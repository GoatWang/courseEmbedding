The firm has begun offering its wealthiest customers the opportunity to invest in about a half-dozen hedge funds, according to regulatory filings, including well-known names like Brevan Howard and Jana Partners, without having to go to the funds themselves, which require much higher minimum investments. The new offering, called Hedge Fund Select, is similar to products that other big brokers like Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch division have offered for many years. But the model is new to Goldman, which has historically preferred to market its own hedge fund products, or steer customers into a so-called fund-of-funds that spreads money between an array of portfolios. Over the years, some clients of Goldman have complained that the firm's own hedge funds have performed poorly, while its outside hedge fund offerings were not as robust as those at other Wall Street firms. With the new arrangement, Goldman clients who have $25 million or more with the investment bank can invest in the funds on the Hedge Fund Select platform, according to a person familiar with the product. There is a minimum $500,000 investment in any single fund, and Goldman will earn a 1 percent fee on the money invested with any particular fund. A big name hedge fund typically requires an investor to put in at least $1 million. A bank that boasts a hedge fund platform can reduce the minimum investment needed because it pools all its customers' money together into a single portfolio. And Wall Street hedge fund platforms sometimes offer shorter redemption periods than the underlying funds. So far, 10 funds have been incorporated for Hedge Fund Select, which Goldman began rolling out this summer. Regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show that Goldman has begun raising money for five funds, and a person familiar with the situation said the firm may offer its customers as many as a dozen hedge funds to choose from. Goldman spokeswoman Andrea Raphael declined to comment. Goldman has been making subtle changes to its $836 billion asset management division for the past couple of years in an effort to boost profits as fees have declined and some of its own funds have struggled to produce big gains. Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) underwent a management overhaul last year and shuttered its Global Alpha Fund after the quantitative fund lost more than $10 billion from its 2007 peak. The new hedge fund offering is being rolled out at a time when the hedge fund industry has lost its swagger as the smartest investors on Wall Street. Through the end of August, hedge funds gained around 4 percent, lagging well behind total returns of 13.5 percent in the benchmark S&P 500 index, according to Credit Suisse. The effort by Goldman appears to be getting off to a slow start. An SEC filing reveals that a Hedge Fund Select portfolio that invests in a Brevan Howard fund had raised just $500,000 as of August. And a Hedge Fund Select portfolio that invests in an Eminence Partners Fund had raised $2 million. Other managers on the Hedge Fund Select platform that have already raised capital include Bocage Global Resources, a commodity-focused fund run by former Caxton Associates trader Kurt Billick, and New York-based Select Equity Group, which specializes in trading stocks. Corsair Capital and Brigade Capital Management have also registered an entity with the GSAM entity, according to a filing with the SEC. The hedge funds Goldman is offering to its customers either declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. The new hedge fund offering is consistent with the terms of the Volcker rule, which allows Wall Street firms to offer hedge funds but limits the amount of firm capital that can be invested in those funds.

                Hedge Fund Trends, Hedge Funds            

                Four Major Hedge Fund Trends from Q1 2016            






 Stan Altshuller
Chief Research Officer




 
                        Each quarter after 13Fs release, we dig through the data to analyze the most recent trends in hedge funds. Read this post to learn more.                    





Every quarter, a few weeks after the 13F release, we publish the top hedge fund trends gleaned from crunching filings data. This time we’ll do something a bit different. In addition to distilling the major developing themes from 13F data, we’ll look at some general, anecdotal (a feared word at Novus) trends of the industry and add a bit of our own perspective. Let’s jump in.
Headlines Unfairly Negative Towards Hedge Funds

The first trend we’ll talk about is that the negative news on the industry is reaching a feverish pitch. If Buffett’s advice to be greedy when others are fearful is any guide, it should be a great time to consider adding to hedge funds. Most headlines are focused on the negative—fees, performance, excessive compensation, and a few select pensions stepping away from the space. It requires little effort to point out the industry’s obvious challenges and bad news sells better than laborious analysis. Now, even hedge fund managers are issuing warnings about their own industry. But few pundits are actually willing to dive deep under the hype and really assess the situation.
Take, for instance, the fees of the hedge fund industry. Typically, hedge funds charge a portion of the money they make (performance fee) and a smaller portion of the total money investors entrust them (management fees) to pay operational expenses. The most common argument is that fees are too high.
But there is no such thing. We live in a free economy with efficient markets, and if fees were truly “too high,” investors would redeem from their managers and elect to not pay any fees outright, reinvesting the balance into no-fee stocks and bonds. No one’s holding them captive—there’s a product offering and there are buyers for the product at agreed-upon terms. Barring fraud, which is extremely rare, everyone knows the risks going into the agreement.
This is not to say that there are no problems with the embattled 2 and 20 structure. The issue, in my view, is a fundamental misalignment of interests between the manager and investor. For smaller managers, the performance fee is the more meaningful part of compensation and that can encourage excessive risk taking. For larger managers, the management fee swells to an amount where they’re disincentivized to take on large risk and (perhaps unintentionally) switch to asset gathering mode. The Goldilocks area where interest in growing and preserving capital are aligned is tiny and fleeting. The solution to the industry’s dilemma is not straight forward, but negotiations on fees need to be less hostile, more informed, and two sided, versus investors simply demanding lower fees.
Furthermore, investor efforts are better placed in finding managers that will deliver higher future returns than in fee negotiations with less-skilled managers. Too much investor attention is spent on the 2 and 20 and not enough on the 98 and 80.
Speaking of which, yet another criticism found commonly in the media is that of poor performance. Here, we agree on some accounts, but the argument has to be based on alpha, not simply underperformance to US equities, which is usually the case in a bull market. They are hedge funds after all, they run with lower exposure to the markets so bull market underperformance is fully expected. Even if the S&P 500 is used as a benchmark, performance is not so bad when viewed over a longer term (more on this later). Also, there are many examples of hedge funds doing exceedingly well as the dispersion between good and poor performers is widening.
The negative sentiment trend is unlikely to stop soon, since many of the points harped on in the news are rooted in real issues that don’t have clear solutions. But simply attacking the industry misses an important point. There is a lot of value and opportunity in hedge funds, and it takes some effort to effectively measure it. We are privy to the inner workings of hundreds of hedge fund managers and are optimistic towards the future. Continuing in this vein, let’s take a closer look at performance.
Performance Viewed Over the Long Term Will Surprise You
Let’s talk about the 98 and 80 for the next trend. Post-fees, hedge funds indeed fared very poorly since the recession when compared to the US large caps as measured by the S&P 500. Here is the performance of the HFRI Equity Hedge Index against the S&P 500 Total Return for March 1st 2009 through end of April 2016.

Long short equity funds underperformed the market by a wide margin, albeit with lower volatility. But who cares about volatility, right? Well, the same indices viewed over a longer period from 1995 tell a different story.


Now, long short funds annualized in line with the market, but with lower volatility and higher Sharpe ratio. And yes, this is after all fees.
Alpha is Indeed Under Assault
The media is right on at least one thing—it’s hard to ignore the trend of declining HF alpha. For our third trend, we’ll look at declining liquidity as it relates to sliding alpha.
Through our work with thousands of manager portfolios, we’ve learned that the majority of managers DO generate consistent alpha through skill. Unfortunately, all managers have areas of alpha drain in the investment process. Call these bad habits—the things to be acknowledged and avoided—since they account for a continuous drag on manager returns. There are many ways managers leak alpha, and we describe the five most common ones here. Lately, however, there has been a new foe. Crowding has been taking ever-growing chunks out of returns, especially during de-risking cycles. And poor liquidity is a primary ingredient in crowding.
In our recent article, “The Liquidity Deception” , we explore the indsutry’s failure to correctly figure crowding into liquidity measures, allowing real liquidity to decline sharply. In the next chart we compare two measures seldom thought of together. The first in blue, is the HFRI Equity Hedge active premium (annualzied) to the S&P 500. The second line, in orange, is the 30-day liquidity of our own HFU comprised of 1,200 HF managers.

To be fair, it’s not an “apples to apples” comparison, since the liquidity metric is point in time and the rolling active premium has a lag built in. Still the general trend is telling.
Managers Divided into Two Camps: Evolve / Double Down
After meeting with hundreds of hedge funds, I can generalize them to two camps, and they’re not divided by performance. Regardless of whether they’re up or down in the last 12 months, some managers truly believe that what got them here will be enough to succeed in the future. The “double down” managers are not really interested in self-analysis, since they believe that time is better spent on researching investment ideas. Even if they’re down massively, they tend to buy more at cheaper prices, and instead of looking critically at their investment process, they isolate themselves in their comfort zones.
The “evolve” managers are constantly looking to improve—even if they’ve been investing for 30 years and are up comfortably for the year. They believe that what got them here will not get them there in the future, and look for new ways to evolve and even shock their current research processes. They tend to question losing positions critically, being brutally honest with themselves when their process can be improved.
Of course, for a portfolio intelligence company, our clients are a biased set of managers, all from the evolve camp. Those are the managers we want to partner with as we grow and thrive alongside them.

The Best and Worst Hedge Fund Stocks

Q1 2016

As we pointed out in our previous report, 2015 was an extremely difficult year for hedge funds. 2016 didn’t start much better, with the Novus Hedge Fund Universe falling through the end of February. A stellar March, where the HFU gained 600+bps, might indicate some green shoots, nonetheless, as our report shows, 2016 has all the indicators of another difficult year for funds with a mediocre history of stock picking.
In this report, we’ll list the top 50 alpha generators and detractors amongst the hedge fund universe. The goal is to take a step back and look at the bigger picture—the bad picks that crushed hedge funds and the stellar picks that remind us of the tenacity of active management.

                The Rise of Quantitative Hedge Funds

                        In lieu of our normal top trends list we write to close out each quarter, this time we'll focus on the biggest trend in 2016: quant funds.                    





This past March, machines once again demonstrated their superiority as Google’s DeepMind AI battered the reigning (human) world champion at Go, making it the latest classical board game to fall to machine dominance. As the first self-driving cars hit the streets and Wall Street adapts to robo-advisors, a comparable divide grows among hedge funds. Quantitative strategies, also known as “Black Box” for the mystery surrounding their algorithms, have been growing in absolute and relative terms. They’ve also recently been outperforming human counterparts, attracting even more investor dollars. Market values controlled by machine-based algorithmic hedge fund strategies (quants) have more than tripled since 2009:

Quants have also grown relative to their hedge fund peers. They now control over 13% of total long market value for all hedge funds, where it was only 8% in 2011.

That’s why, in lieu of our normal list of trends wrapping up the most recent quarter, we’ve dedicated the entire piece to this one, distinct trend. Given the recent performance of these strategies relative to fundamental investors, this trend is likely to continue. Even fundamentally driven managers are taking a new quantitative look at things. Funds are investing heavily in technology and risk management tools, adding a “quant” element to augment their existing investment process. These quantitative methods help with timing, sizing, and risk management. Our own clients use in-depth Novus analytics to squeeze out more and more alpha—despite shrinking opportunities—by optimizing their processes.
A Word of Caution
Maybe a word of caution is in order before we go full quant. While we don’t know what might happen if self-driving cars malfunction, we do have a precedent for stocks when algorithms converge on sell signals. This happened to quants in 2007—a relative asset peak for the strategy, as can be seen in the charts above. In August of that year, all quant models seemed to go haywire, executing sell orders at the same time. (Some believe the quants predicted the 2008 crisis, albeit a bit early.) The hectic two weeks of selling wreaked havoc even on unsuspecting fundamental managers who just happened to overlap the quants. Today quants have surpassed 2007 peaks in assets and—even more importantly—daily volumes traded. If another August 2007 event occurs, it’s critical for investors to know which stocks will feel a technical down thrust—at quants’ current numbers and trading levels, 2007 will seem like a cakewalk.
Thankfully, we’ve analyzed this possibility using something we call overlap analysis. We took thirteen of the world’s most prominent quant funds (Renaissance, Citadel, AQR, and Two Sigma to name a few) and calculated the overlap of their portfolios from public holdings. While we do not know the workings of the Black Box algorithms, we can see the results of their trading. Just like other asset managers, the quants are required to file public disclosure forms – we tapped them to run this analysis.
It’s important to keep in mind the sheer size of these portfolios, as well as the extraordinary position counts for each. Many of these funds hold more stocks than the Russell 3000:

It turns out that quants are often attracted to the same stocks, as the overlap values are high.

The above matrix shows a set of overlapping position values of for each manager pair. A value of 20% for AQR and Citadel denotes that after considering all the stocks that both managers are invested in and tallying up the minimum position sizes for each overlapping pair, you get 20% as the sum.
Looking at these portfolio positions, we see a lot of similarity and a preference for liquid securities. Also, quants never hold large positions. A 1% position is large for a quant fund. Some of the most popular positons for our group of quants are below (Negative values indicate put option exposure from public holdings):

Of course, most valuable for hedge fund managers is to run overlap of their own portfolio against the quants. When coupling concepts such as your own position sizing and liquidity, things get interesting, and you may get the urge to buy some put options on otherwise innocuous names. What goes up must come down and right now, quants are definitely up.
