 Summer is Here! Protect Yourself From the Heat 
 With summer almost upon the Northern Hemisphere, the first heat waves have already caused disruptions. Excessive heat watches have been issued for southwestern US states and southern UK. While the range of temperatures are vastly different in both areas (43 C in the US compared to 33 C in the UK), it’s important to keep in mind that individuals react differently to temperature. In order to avoid heat-related illnesses it is crucial to protect yourself from heat and sun exposure.

iJet Technologies | Connecting aviation with innovation

Our Vision

iJet transforms traditional aviation business processes from a rigid, hardware-centric architecture to a flexible, software-defined infrastructure to facilitate data and analytics services which will lead to new markets in cross-functional and cross-enterprise data integration.

 
 
 
 
 
 





With the aviation connectivity market growing at double-digit rates, airplanes are increasingly connected via IP communication links to airline’s operations and maintenance control centers. Connected airplanes enable a new era of intelligent aircraft providing enterprises with a quantum leap in situational awareness and operational efficiency through streaming and integrated data.
 
 
 
 



Products
 
iJet Technologies integrates aircraft operational data, IP communication links and airline ground systems into a single, extensible software solution that is capable of handling large amounts of streaming data both in real time and post flight. This integrated approach enables scalable operational applications and analytics that provide quantifiable financial value in the air, on the ground, and across all organizational units.
 
 
 


Data Access
 
iJet’s Data Access platform acquires, transforms and makes aircraft data available to applications and analytics, in the air and on the ground.
 
Learn more: Data Access
 
 

Operational Applications and Data Analytics
 
iJet’s Operational Applications and Data Analytics turn data into operational insight.
 
Learn more: Operational Applications and Data Analytics
 
 
 




 
 
 



Data Access
 
The iJet solution begins with the iJet Data Access Platform which includes a data platform onboard each aircraft connected via IP links to an intelligent ground platform. The airborne platform integrates aircraft and ground data with EFB and mobile devices while applying business logic and analytics to airborne data in real time. The ground system aggregates aircraft data, connects to ground based applications and analytics, integrates to corporate back end systems and moves data up to the aircraft using similar business logic.
 
 
⇣
 
 
 
 



Onboard Data Platform
 
The onboard platform is software that is designed to run on a variety of different server hardware, ingest data in multiple formats and to access any available IP communication link installed on the aircraft.
 


 
 


Offboard Data Platform
 
The offboard data platform aggregates aircraft data, connects to ground based applications and analytics via standard API’s, integrates to corporate back end systems and moves data up to the aircraft using similar business logic. The offboard platform can be located in any virtualized or cloud environment and uses open, modular computing resources and integration patterns that are built to scale efficiently over time.
 


 
 
 



Operational Applications and Data Analytics
 
iJet’s Operational Applications and Data Analytics are organized into three Product families: iJet Airborne, iJet Ground and iJet Maintenance. These application and analytic products use real-time data from the onboard platform, historical data from the ground platform, integrated airline and third party data in appropriate combinations, then add business logic and analytic algorithms to deliver on iJet’s vision of innovation.
 
 
⇣
 
 
 
 



iJet Airborne
 
iJet Airborne Applications and Analytics integrate real-time aircraft data with Flight Planning and weather data, then applies analytics in real-time to provide alerting, cost reduction and reporting tools.
 
 

iJet Ground
 
iJet Ground Analytics integrate real-time aircraft data with Flight Planning and operational process goals, then applies analytics in real-time to provide alerting, cost reduction and reporting tools.
 
 

iJet Maintenance
 
iJet Maintenance Analytics include discrete fault reporting, trend analysis and predictive analytics. Using standard data interfaces this information can be shared with onboard EFB tech logs and offboard ground maintenance systems.
 
 
 
 







Our Team

 
iJet Technologies has assembled a strong, diverse team with significant experience in software development, aerospace analytics, flight operations, aerospace systems engineering, cloud architecture and data management.

Our Vision

iJet transforms traditional aviation business processes from a rigid, hardware-centric architecture to a flexible, software-defined infrastructure to facilitate data and analytics services which will lead to new markets in cross-functional and cross-enterprise data integration.

 
 
 
 
 
 





With the aviation connectivity market growing at double-digit rates, airplanes are increasingly connected via IP communication links to airline’s operations and maintenance control centers. Connected airplanes enable a new era of intelligent aircraft providing enterprises with a quantum leap in situational awareness and operational efficiency through streaming and integrated data.

iJet Technologies integrates aircraft operational data, IP communication links and airline ground systems into a single, extensible software solution that is capable of handling large amounts of streaming data both in real time and post flight. This integrated approach enables scalable operational applications and analytics that provide quantifiable financial value in the air, on the ground, and across all organizational units.
 
 
 


Data Access
 
iJet’s Data Access platform acquires, transforms and makes aircraft data available to applications and analytics, in the air and on the ground.

Data Access
 
The iJet solution begins with the iJet Data Access Platform which includes a data platform onboard each aircraft connected via IP links to an intelligent ground platform. The airborne platform integrates aircraft and ground data with EFB and mobile devices while applying business logic and analytics to airborne data in real time. The ground system aggregates aircraft data, connects to ground based applications and analytics, integrates to corporate back end systems and moves data up to the aircraft using similar business logic.
 
 
⇣
 
 
 
 



Onboard Data Platform
 
The onboard platform is software that is designed to run on a variety of different server hardware, ingest data in multiple formats and to access any available IP communication link installed on the aircraft.
 


 
 


Offboard Data Platform
 
The offboard data platform aggregates aircraft data, connects to ground based applications and analytics via standard API’s, integrates to corporate back end systems and moves data up to the aircraft using similar business logic. The offboard platform can be located in any virtualized or cloud environment and uses open, modular computing resources and integration patterns that are built to scale efficiently over time.
 


 
 
 



Operational Applications and Data Analytics
 
iJet’s Operational Applications and Data Analytics are organized into three Product families: iJet Airborne, iJet Ground and iJet Maintenance. These application and analytic products use real-time data from the onboard platform, historical data from the ground platform, integrated airline and third party data in appropriate combinations, then add business logic and analytic algorithms to deliver on iJet’s vision of innovation.
 
 
⇣
 
 
 
 



iJet Airborne
 
iJet Airborne Applications and Analytics integrate real-time aircraft data with Flight Planning and weather data, then applies analytics in real-time to provide alerting, cost reduction and reporting tools.
 
 

iJet Ground
 
iJet Ground Analytics integrate real-time aircraft data with Flight Planning and operational process goals, then applies analytics in real-time to provide alerting, cost reduction and reporting tools.
 
 

iJet Maintenance
 
iJet Maintenance Analytics include discrete fault reporting, trend analysis and predictive analytics. Using standard data interfaces this information can be shared with onboard EFB tech logs and offboard ground maintenance systems.
