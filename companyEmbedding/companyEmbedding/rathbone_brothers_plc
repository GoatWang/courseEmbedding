The IT Department at Rathbones is divided into teams for IT infrastructure, business systems, and IT user support. 

 Rathbones operates a mixed systems IT environment. They operate two Windows XP & Citrix PS4.5/XenApp5 server farm sites within Liverpool and London. In 2011, Rathbones underwent a project to migrate 800 users from Citrix Presentation Server 4.5 to Citrix XenApp 6.5. They also consolidated a 98 server Citrix Presentation Server 4.5 Farm to a 36 server XenApp 6.5 Farm with virtualized infrastructure servers. Around this time, they introduced Microsoft App-V for application deployment to XenApp servers and RES Automation Manager for server base build, local software installs and task automation. The company uses Dell and HP servers along with EMC storage solutions in its hardware environment. Rathbones uses Microsoft Dynamics as its primary enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) platform.

This year, applications have been moved from a Xenapp 5.0/Windows 2003 environment to a XenApp 6.5/Windows 2008 environment as part of a desktop migration project. They are working on virtualizing all applications using AppV 4.6.

      Enquires:
    

      Ali Johnson
    

Company Secretary


      Tel: 0207 399 0326
    

      The Appendix below, together with the information included in
      the Company's announcement of its preliminary results on 23
      February 2017, constitutes the information required to comply
      with DTR 6.3.5.
    

Appendix


Directors' Responsibility Statement


      The directors are responsible for preparing the report and
      accounts 2016, comprising the consolidated financial
      statements of Rathbone Brothers Plc and its subsidiaries (the
      'group') and holding company financial statements (the
      'parent company') in accordance with applicable law and
      regulations.
    

      Company law requires the directors to prepare group and
      parent company financial statements for each financial year.
      Under that law they are required to prepare the group
      financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by
      the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the
      parent company financial statements on the same basis.
    

      Under company law, the directors must not approve the
      financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give
      a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and
      parent company and of their profit or loss for that period.
      In preparing each of the group and parent company financial
      statements, the directors are required to:
    



          select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
          consistently
        



          make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and
          prudent
        



          state whether they have been prepared in accordance with
          IFRS as adopted by the EU
        



          prepare the financial statements on the going concern
          basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
          group and the parent company will continue in business.
        



                   

      The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting
      records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent
      company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy
      at any time the financial position of the parent company and
      enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply
      with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility
      for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to
      safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect
      fraud and other irregularities.
    

      Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also
      responsible for preparing a strategic report, directors'
      report, remuneration committee report and corporate
      governance statement that comply with that law and those
      regulations.
    

      The directors are responsible for the maintenance and
      integrity of the corporate and financial information included
      on the company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the
      preparation and dissemination of financial statements may
      differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
    

      The directors who held office at the date of approval of the
      directors' report confirm that, so far as they are each
      aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the
      company's auditors are unaware and each director has taken
      all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a
      director to make himself or herself aware of any relevant
      audit information and to establish that the company's auditor
      is aware of that information.
    

      We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
    



          the consolidated financial statements, prepared in
          accordance with the applicable set of accounting
          standards, give a true and fair view of the assets,
          liabilities, financial position and profit of the parent
          company and the undertakings included in the
          consolidation taken as a whole
        



          the strategic report and directors' report include a fair
          review of the development and performance of the business
          and the position of the issuer and the undertakings
          included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together
          with a description of the principal risks and
          uncertainties that they face
        



          the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is
          fair, balanced and understandable and provides the
          information necessary for shareholders to assess the
          group's position and performance, business model and
          strategy.
        



      By order of the board

Rathbone Brothers plc is a growth stock that could have far more to give

I’ve been looking at Rathbone Brothers (LSE: RAT), and the investment manager’s first-half results released Tuesday are making me sit up and pay close attention.
Rathbone shares have climbed by 52% since 2016’s low in October, to 2,667p (including a results-day 37p rise), and have doubled in price over the past five years.  The reason for that seems apparent from the company’s recent performance — we’ve seen earnings per share growing by 58% in just four years, with analysts forecasting a further 15% gain by the time we reach December 2018.
While the company spoke of “ongoing geopolitical uncertainty” which is currently dominating short-term market…

Rathbone shares have climbed by 52% since 2016’s low in October, to 2,667p (including a results-day 37p rise), and have doubled in price over the past five years.  The reason for that seems apparent from the company’s recent performance — we’ve seen earnings per share growing by 58% in just four years, with analysts forecasting a further 15% gain by the time we reach December 2018.
While the company spoke of “ongoing geopolitical uncertainty” which is currently dominating short-term market conditions, we did see underlying pre-tax profit rise by 22.7%, to £43.3m, in the first six months of the year.
Funds
The key long-term measure of confidence in an investment manger is its level of funds under management, and we saw a 7% rise to £36.6bn since December 2o16 — and seeing as the FTSE 100 put on only 2.4% over the same period, I’m impressed by that.
I would not place my own investment cash under the control of a professional manager, purely because I think my own simple strategy is effective enough without paying anyone else to do it for me. But there are many, from private investors to charities and pension funds, who need the services of companies like Rathbone — and I reckon buying shares in investment managers themselves can be very rewarding.
I see what might be thought of as contrarian safety here too — it’s when markets are at their most volatile that people turn more to respected professionals to manage their cash. 
And I see Rathbone Brothers as a well-managed and well-respected firm that should continue to do well.
Corporate finance
Financial services at all levels can be very profitable, and I’ve also been examining Intermediate Capital Group (LSE: ICP). The company provides capital for a variety of corporate needs, including IPO, management buyouts and similar.
The first quarter of this year has been pretty good, with inflows in the period of €0.6bn coupled with “robust demand for current fundraising“.
The firm did see a 2% drop in funds under management, to €23.3bn, in the three months, but it put that down to an “expected quieter quarter” and an adverse currency exchange impact on dollar-denominated funds among other things. But inflows in the second quarter are expected to be higher.
Outgoing chief executive Christophe Evain said: “Our expectation continues that this will be a strong fundraising year,” and that supports expectations of a good year this year.
One for the brave?
Intermediate Capital is in a volatile sector, and that can show through in erratic share price movements. But one thing I see as a long-term calming effect is the company’s progressive dividend.
It’s grown from 20p per share in 2013 to 27p this year, and though an impressive share price performance over that timescale has dropped the yield to 3.8%, we’re also looking at a trailing P/E of under 10. Dividend cover is strong, and I expect to see yields increasing nicely over time.
If you’re happy to handle short-term volatility without panicking (which I see as an essential characteristic of a growth investor), I really do see Intermediate Capital Group as having solid long-term potential.

Big money from growth shares
Growth shares like these can be very profitable, and the tempting pick uncovered in our Top Growth Share From The Motley Fool report has been raking in the cash for years.
The past five years have brought in double-digit annual earnings growth, and the City's experts are predicting two more years of solid growth ahead of us. On top of that, a progressive dividend policy adds an extra attraction to the mix.

Rathbone Brothers Plc : Half-yearly report 2017



Underlying profit before tax up 22.7% to £43.3 million Philip Howell, Chief Executive of Rathbone Brothers Plc, said: "The first six months of 2017 has seen another busy period for Rathbones as we continue to deliver our strategic plans without detracting from our high standards of service to our clients. We remain confident in the medium term potential of our growth initiatives. Short term market conditions are dominated by a backdrop of ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and we will continue to invest with discipline."   Highlights:   Underlying profit before tax* increased 22.7% from £35.3 million to £43.3 million in the first six months of 2017. Underlying profit margin remained strong at 30.4% compared to 29.4% in 2016. Underlying earnings per share increased 21.1% to 68.4p (2016: 56.5p).   Profit before tax for the half year increased 16.7% from £22.8 million to £26.6 million, reflecting £15.8 million of costs associated with the London office move, offset by a plan amendment gain of £5.5 million arising from the closure of our defined benefit pension schemes. Basic earnings per share increased 16.5% to 41.6p (2016: 35.7p).   The board recommends a 22.0p interim dividend for 2017 (2016: 21.0p).    Total funds under management at 30 June 2017 were £36.6 billion, up 7.0% from £34.2 billion at 31 December 2016. This compared to an increase of 2.4% in the FTSE 100 Index and an increase of 2.7% in the MSCI WMA Private Investor Balanced Index over the same period.   Total net organic and acquired growth in the funds managed by Investment Management was £0.6 billion in the first six months of 2017, representing a net annual growth rate of 4.0% (2016: 4.2%). Net organic growth of £0.4 billion for the first half represents an underlying annualised rate of net organic growth of 2.9% (2016: 2.5%). In the period, we experienced higher outflows from low margin accounts and adjusting for this, the annualised net organic growth rate was 3.4%.   Underlying operating income in Investment Management of £127.4 million in the first six months of 2017 (2016: £108.8 million) was up 17.1%, largely due to growth in funds under management. The average FTSE 100 Index was 7322 on quarterly billing dates in 2017, compared to 6298 in 2016, an increase of 16.3%.   Underlying operating expenses of £99.1 million (2016: £84.9 million) increased 16.7% year-on-year largely as a result of variable staff costs, reflecting both the higher profitability in the period and an improved investment performance element for growth awards.   Funds under management in Unit Trusts were £4.6 billion at 30 June 2017 (31 December 2016: £4.0 billion). Net inflows were £269 million in the first half of 2017 (2016: £259 million). Underlying operating income in Unit Trusts was £14.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2017, an increase of 30.7% from £11.4 million in the first half of 2016.   Shareholders equity of £342.4 million at 30 June 2017 increased 5.4% since 31 December 2016 (£324.8 million) and 22.4% since 30 June 2016 (£279.7 million), largely as a result of the fall in value of retirement benefit obligations, which totalled £20.0 million at 30 June 2017, 49.4% lower than the £39.5 million recorded at 31 December 2016.    * Excluding a plan amendment gain on the closure of the defined benefit pension schemes and charges in relation to client relationships and goodwill, acquisition-related costs and London head office relocation costs. 25 July 2017 For further information contact:     Rathbone Brothers PlcTel: 020 7399 0000email: shelly.patel@rathbones.com     Philip Howell, Chief ExecutivePaul Stockton, Finance DirectorShelly Patel, Investor Relations Manager     CamarcoTel: 020 3757 4984email: ed.gascoigne-pees@camarco.co.uk     Ed Gascoigne-Pees     Rathbone Brothers Plc  Rathbone Brothers Plc ("Rathbones"), through its subsidiaries, is a leading provider of high-quality, personalised investment and wealth management services for private clients, charities and trustees. Our services include discretionary investment management, unit trusts, banking and loan services, financial planning, unitised portfolio services, and UK trust, legal, estate and tax advice. Rathbones has over 1,100 staff in 16 locations in the UK and Jersey; its headquarters is 8 Finsbury Circus, London. rathbones.com  Investment management reportContinuing growth in funds under management In the first half of 2017, investment markets largely shrugged off political events, and continued to build momentum with the FTSE 100 reaching all time highs during the period. Our own funds under management grew 7.0% to reach £36.6 billion at 30 June 2017, benefitting from a combination of continued acquired and organic growth and these resilient conditions. This compares to a 2.4% increase in the FTSE 100 Index and a 2.7% increase in the MSCI WMA Private Investor Balanced Index.   Funds under management in our Investment Management business were £32.0 billion at 30 June 2017 (2016: £30.2 billion).  Investment Management net inflows were £0.6 billion in the first half (2016: £0.5 billion) representing a total annualised growth rate of 4.0% (2016: 4.2%).  Net organic growth totalled £0.4 billion up from £0.3 billion at 30 June 2016, equating to an annualised net organic growth rate of 2.9%. In the period, we experienced higher outflows from low margin accounts and adjusting for this, the annualised net organic growth rate was 3.4%. Purchased growth totalled £0.2 billion (2016: £0.2 billion), with nearly all investment managers set to meet or exceed their earn-out targets. Our charities business continued to perform well and retained the position of the second biggest investment management provider to the top 5,000 charities in the UK. Its funds under management grew 4.9% to £4.3 billion in the first six months of 2017. The market profile of our ethical business, Rathbone Greenbank Investments, continues to rise with funds under management increasing by 9.6% to reach £946 million in the first half.  Funds under management in our Unit Trusts business increased 15.0% from £4.0 billion at 31 December 2016 to £4.6 billion at 30 June 2017.  Positive markets and competitive investment performance helped to attract gross sales of £733 million compared to £576 million for the same period in 2016. In common with many in the industry, redemptions of £464 million were higher at the start of 2017 as investor concerns heightened, and many sought to realise gains. Whilst the lead up to and subsequent results of the UK election did have some adverse impacts in June, net inflows for the first half totalled £269 million compared to £259 million at 30 June 2016.  We continue to strive to provide high quality service to our clients and in May 2017, for the second year in a row, Rathbones was named both "Private Client Asset Manager of the Year (Institutional)" at the Citywealth awards and "Asset Manager of the Year" at the Better Society Awards. These awards recognise a continued excellence in client service, leadership and an overall contribution to the profession.  Underlying profit before tax up 22.7% to £43.3 million   Underlying profit before tax increased 22.7% to £43.3 million (2016: £35.3 million) in the first six months of 2017, representing an underlying profit margin of 30.4% (2016: 29.4%). Underlying earnings per share of 68.4p increased 21.1% from 56.5p in 2016.    Profit before tax for the half year of £26.6 million is 16.7% higher than the £22.8 million in 2016 and reflects £15.8 million of costs associated with the London office move (see note 3), offset by a plan amendment gain of £5.5 million arising from the closure of our defined benefit pension schemes with effect from 30 June 2017 (see note 13). Prior year profit before tax included charges of £4.4 million in respect of the acquisition of the Vision businesses. We are working hard to let our Curzon Street premises, though the rental market remains soft particularly in light of Brexit uncertainty.  Fee income of £105.5 million in the first half of 2017 increased 21.1% compared to the same period last year (2016: £87.1 million) reflecting positive markets and growth in organic and acquired new business over the period. The average FTSE 100 Index (calculated on our fee billing dates) was 7322, up 16.3% compared to 6298 a year ago.  Fee income represented 74.1% of total underlying operating income in the six months ended 30 June 2017 (2016: 72.5%), as our fee only tariff becomes more widely adopted, helping to support our move to higher quality fee-based income.   Net commission income of £21.9 million was up 12.3% from £19.5 million in the first half of 2016, reflecting more positive investing conditions and a strong first quarter in particular. Net interest income was relatively stable at £5.6 million in the first half (2016: £5.7 million), as higher liquidity largely offset the impact of lower base interest rates. As active investment managers, we remain focused on balancing risks and returns, and as a result saw overall cash weightings in portfolios rise to 7.1% compared to 6.6% a year ago reflecting a greater degree of uncertainty over future equity markets. Average deposits were £2.3 billion in the first half of the year compared to £1.7 billion a year ago. Client loans increased 8.7% to £115.5 million from £106.3 million at 31 December 2016. Fees from advisory services and other income increased 19.0% to £9.4 million (2016: £7.9 million) reflecting more positive flows from Vision following a slower period last year as the business completed a comprehensive file review exercise.  Underlying operating expenses of £99.1 million (2016: £84.9 million) increased 16.7% year-on-year. This was largely as a result of variable staff costs, which increased 32.3% to £25.8 million (2016: £19.5 million) reflecting both the higher profitability in the period and an improved investment performance element for growth awards. Variable staff costs as a percentage of underlying profit before variable staff costs also therefore increased to 37.3% (2016: 35.6%).  In line with our strategy, planned additions in headcount increased fixed staff costs by 11.2% to £44.7 million (2016: £40.2 million) and average headcount in the first half of 2017 was 1,123, up 7.5% compared to 1,045 a year ago. Other direct costs of £28.6 million (2016: £25.2 million) were up 13.5% as a result of higher property costs and planned project expenditure.  Our effective tax rate for the first half of 2017 was 21.1% (2016: 25.3%). The prior year rate was higher as a result of deferred payments to acquire the Vision businesses. Our interim dividend has been increased by 1p per share to 22p (2016: 21p) and will be paid on 3 October 2017.  Progress on growth strategy  Vision continues to gain momentum and now has £1.2 billion of funds under advice on its discretionary investment management panel, up 20.0% from the £1.0 billion at 31 December 2016, and 108 advisers, up from 99 at 31 December 2016. The business remains on track to grow to our target of 150 advisers and we remain confident in its growth prospects. Our distribution strategy continues to focus on promoting our discretionary investment management services to professional intermediaries, principally national and regional IFA networks. It continues to make good progress with net flows of £108 million in the first six months of the year, up 96.4% from £55 million at the same time last year. We continue to build our presence in the intermediary market as evidenced by a May 2017 Defaqto report which confirmed that the usage of Rathbones as a discretionary fund management provider to advisers had more than doubled in the last year, and  placed Rathbones very highly in the critical areas of  'Quality of investment staff' and 'Service'. We successfully launched an execution only Managed Portfolio Service in March 2017 which attracted £7.2 million of net flows in its first 3 months of launch. With the Credit Suisse partnership fully operational, the Rathbone Private Office was formally launched in January. The nucleus team of three senior client advisers and four support staff is making good progress in promoting this new advisory capability. This service is offered directly to super high net worth clients and family offices as well as seeking introductions from the professional intermediary market and from our own investment manager community. The team has already engaged its first clients and is developing an encouraging pipeline of prospective clients for the full year.   We continue to focus on improving our client experience and striving for greater operational efficiency in our support functions with the aim of creating additional capacity for growth. At the full year, we outlined our plans to spend an additional £1 million in 2017 to implement a new client relationship management system and improve our client take on processes. These plans are developing more quickly than originally planned and in light of more favourable investment conditions, we have chosen to bring forward capital expenditure originally planned for 2018 to the second half of this year in order to accelerate delivery and improve functionality through greater automation. This brings the total expected capital expenditure in relation to our client relationship management system and client take on process improvement to approximately £2 million in 2017.  Expenditure on the other growth strategies remains in line with expectations. The relocation of our London head office to 8 Finsbury Circus has proved very successful.   Financial position and regulatory capital  Shareholders' equity of £342.4 million at 30 June 2017 increased 5.4% since 31 December 2016 (£324.8 million) and 22.4% since 30 June 2016 (£279.7 million). This is largely as a result of the fall in value of retirement benefit obligations which totalled £20.0 million at 30 June 2017, 49.4% lower than the £39.5 million recorded at 31 December 2016. This reflected a high number of members transferring their benefits out of the scheme, a reduction in the assumed rates of improvement in longevity and breakage of the link between pension entitlements and final salaries. Triennial valuation discussions with trustees are ongoing and are expected to complete in the second half of the year.   Total assets at 30 June 2017 were £2,829.9 million (31 December 2016: £2,404.0 million; 30 June 2016: £2,344.8 million), of which £2,215.1 million (31 December 2016: £1,888.9 million; 30 June 2016: £1,860.0 million) represents the cash element of client portfolios that is held as a banking deposit. As a result of these higher levels of cash, balances with central banks increased from £1,075.7 million at 31 December 2016 to £1,480.9 million at 30 June 2017 (30 June 2016: £960.1 million). Our consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 18.2 % at 30 June 2017 (31 December 2016: 17.7%; 30 June 2016: 16.0%). Our consolidated leverage ratio was 6.2% at 30 June 2017 (31 December 2016: 6.6%; 30 June 2016: 6.2%). The capital surplus of own funds over the Pillar 1 and 2A requirements and CRD IV buffers was £69.9m at 30 June 2017 (excluding year to date post tax profits and improvements in the value of retirement benefit obligations) compared to £49.2m at 30 June 2016, largely reflecting the impact of additional equity raised in October 2016 offset by higher capital requirements.  Business risks  The board believes that the nature of the principal risks and uncertainties which may have a material effect on the group's performance during the remainder of its financial year remain unchanged from those identified in the strategic report and group risk committee report in our 2016 annual report and accounts (pages 18-25 and pages 80-81 respectively).   Regulatory changes   We continue to prepare for the changes brought on by MiFID II and the General Data Protection Regime and are working hard to ensure our people and systems are compliant. We anticipate that the cost of these projects will be approximately £1.5 million which will be absorbed by our normal expenditure budget for the year. We note the recommendations of the recent FCA Asset Management Market Report and the sequence of consultations prior to final implementation. While we broadly welcome the proposals, they will have an impact on margins of our Unit Trust business from 2018. In addition, as part of our implementation of MiFID II, research payments that have long been charged to our funds will, from 1 January 2018 be borne by the business. The impact of these changes will be significantly offset by a reduction in variable remuneration, some cost actions and by the continued funds growth momentum through this year and beyond. Fund box profits in our Unit Trust business for the six months ended 30 June 2017 were £1.8 million and research costs currently borne by the funds totalled approximately £0.5 million for the same period.   Board and senior management changes  Following the announcement of David Harrel stepping down after nine years on the board, we are pleased to announce that Sarah Gentleman has now completed the regulatory approval process and has formally succeeded David as the chairman of the remuneration committee.  Outlook  The first six months of 2017 has seen another busy period for Rathbones as we continue to deliver our strategic plans without detracting from our high standards of service to our clients. We remain confident in the medium term potential of our growth strategy.

Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements1     Basis of preparation Rathbone Brothers Plc ('the company') is the parent company of a group of companies ('the group') that provides personalised investment and wealth management services for private clients, charities and trustees. The group also provides financial planning, private banking, offshore fund management and trust administration services. The products and services from which the group derives its revenues are described in 'our services' on page 3 of the annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016 and have not materially changed since that date. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' as adopted by the EU. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, using the accounting policies, methods of computation and presentation set out in the group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 except as disclosed below. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the group's audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016, which are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU. The information in this announcement does not comprise statutory financial statements within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The comparative figures for the financial year ended 31 December 2016 are not the group's statutory accounts for that financial year. The group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been reported on by its auditors and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified and did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis. It also did not contain a statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. Developments in reporting standards and interpretations  Future new standards and interpretations A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations will be effective for future annual periods beginning after  1 January 2017 and, therefore, have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' and IFRS 16 'Leases' are expected to have the most significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group. IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'  IFRS 9 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2016. The group has not adopted this standard early. IFRS 9 changes the classification and measurement of financial instruments and the timing and extent of credit provisioning. The group has conducted a preliminary assessment of the potential impact, based on the profile of its financial instruments as at the balance sheet date, and is well advanced in its approach to classification and valuation. Classification of financial assets The basis of classification for financial assets under IFRS 9 is different from that under IAS 39. Financial assets will be classified into one of three categories: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale categories available under IAS 39 have been removed. In addition, the classification criteria for allocating financial assets between categories are different under IFRS 9. The group is well advanced in its classification of financial assets under the new standard. IFRS 9 uses the same measurement bases as IAS 39 and the group has not yet identified any material differences arising from applying the new standard. Debt securities currently classified as held to maturity will be classified as amortised cost. Other assets currently carried at amortised cost such as cash with central banks and loans and advances to banks and customers will also continue to be classified as such. Money market funds currently classified as available for sale will be classified as FVOCI, given that although they are generally held to collect contractual cash flows, they can be redeemed, should the need arise. Impairment of financial assets Under IFRS 9, an expected credit loss model replaces the incurred loss model, meaning there no longer needs to be a triggering event in order to recognise impairment losses. A provision must be made for the amount of any loss expected to arise over the life of the group's financial assets. Under IAS 39, credit losses are recognised when they incurred. Under the expected credit loss model, a dual measurement approach applies whereby a financial asset will attract a loss allowance equal to either 12 month expected credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses. The latter applies if there has been a significant deterioration in the credit quality of the asset. This will require considerable judgement as to how changes in economic factors affect expected credit losses, which will be determined on a probability-weighted basis. The group's trade receivables (including trust and financial planning debtors) are generally short term and does not contain significant financing components. Therefore, the group expects to apply the simplified approach and reflect lifetime expected credit losses. Treasury assets currently held by the group are of high credit quality and the group has not experienced any historical credit losses in its treasury or loan portfolios. Work conducted to date suggests that any impairment charges recognised in the financial statements under the new standard will be minimal. Classification of financial liabilities The basis of classification for financial liabilities under IFRS 9 remains unchanged from that under IAS 39. The two categories are amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss (either designated as such or held for trading) The group does not currently designate any liabilities as fair value through profit or loss, and do not anticipate doing so. Therefore, under IFRS 9, the group expects to classify all financial liabilities as amortised cost, with no material impact on measurement. IFRS 15 ' Revenue from Contracts with Customers'  IFRS 15 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2016. The group has not adopted this standard early. IFRS 15 changes how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers. The group will be required to identify all contracts it has with customers in order to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. The group is in the process of quantifying the potential impact of adopting the standard, based on its existing revenue streams. In addition, the group is considering the impact on its policy of capitalising costs to secure investment management contracts. Net fee and commission income Included within net fee and commission income are initial fees, charged by a number of group companies in relation to certain business activities. Under IFRS 15, the group will be required to make an assessment as to whether the work performed to earn such fees constitutes the transfer of services and, therefore, fulfils any performance obligation(s). If so, then these fees can be recognised when charged; if not, then the fees can only be recognised in the period the services are provided. The group has not yet identified any other revenue streams that will be materially impacted by the new standard. Client relationship intangibles Where payments are made to new investment managers to secure investment management contracts, such costs are capitalised and amortised, where they are separable, reliably measurable and expected to be recovered, under IAS 18. IFRS 15 reinforces this view, stating that incremental costs of obtaining any contract with a customer shall be capitalised if the entity expects to recover those costs. Therefore, the group does not believe the adoption of IFRS 15 will materially change the way it accounts for client relationship intangibles. Transition The group plans to adopt IFRS 15 in its consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018, using the retrospective approach. IFRS 16 ' Leases' IFRS 16 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2017. The group does not plan to adopt this standard early. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases. The group will be required to recognise all leases with a term of more than 12 months as a right-of-use lease asset on its balance sheet; the group will also recognise a financial liability representing its obligation to make future lease payments. The group has conducted an initial quantification of the impact of adopting the standard, based on its existing lease contracts. The most significant impact is in respect of its new London head office premises. Transition Definition of a lease On transition to IFRS 16, the Group can choose whether to:  - Apply the new definition of a lease to all its contracts as if IFRS 16 had always applied; or  - Apply a practical expedient and retain its previous assessments of which contracts contain a lease.  The group intends to apply the practical expedient and therefore will not be reassessing those contracts that are not deemed to contain a lease prior to the date of adoption. Retrospective approach As a lessee, the Group can either apply the standard using a: - Retrospective approach; or  - Modified retrospective approach with optional practical expedients.  The Group has assessed the impact of both approaches in relation to its existing lease contracts, and is most likely to apply the modified retrospective approach. Potential impact The group's total assets and total liabilities will be increased by the recognition of lease assets and liabilities. The lease assets will be depreciated over the shorter of the expected life of the asset and the lease term. The lease liability will be reduced by lease payments, offset by the unwinding of the liability over the lease term. On the group's statement of comprehensive income, the profile of lease costs will be front-loaded, at least individually, as the interest charge is higher in the early years of a lease term as the discount rate unwinds. The total cost of the lease over the lease term is expected to be unchanged. In addition to the above impacts, recognition of lease assets will increase the group's regulatory capital requirement. Lessor accounting Where the Group acts as an intermediate lessor in a sub-lease arrangement it will need to make adjustments for such leases.   2     Segmental information For management purposes, the group is organised into two operating divisions: Investment Management and Unit Trusts. Centrally incurred indirect expenses are allocated to these operating segments on the basis of the cost drivers that generate the expenditure; principally the headcount of staff directly involved in providing those services from which the segment earns revenues, the value of funds under management and the segment's total revenue.

Geographic analysis The following table presents operating income analysed by the geographical location of the group entity providing the service:             Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     United Kingdom       142,503        115,798        241,882      Jersey       5,394        4,403        9,401      Operating income       147,897        120,201        251,283      The group's non-current assets are substantially all located in the United Kingdom. Major clients The group is not reliant on any one client or group of connected clients for generation of revenues. At 30 June 2017, the group provided investment management services to 49,000 clients (30 June 2016: 48,000; 31 December 2016: 48,000).  3     Head office relocation On 6 January 2016, the group exchanged contracts for five 17-year leases for a total of 75,000 sq ft of office space at 8 Finsbury Circus. The group began recognising costs relating to rent and dilapidations on the new premises from the date the leases began, 13 May 2016. The move to the 8 Finsbury Circus office concluded on 13 February 2017, which triggered recognition of a provision for the net cost of the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street until the end of the existing lease (see note 11). During the six months to 30 June 2017, incremental costs of £15,769,000 (30 June 2016: £2,257,000; 31 December 2016: £7,031,000) were incurred as a result of the decision to move the head office to 8 Finsbury Circus. These incremental costs were as follows:             Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     Rental costs for 8 Finsbury Circus prior to relocation       538        599        3,328      Accelerated depreciation charge for 1 Curzon Street       779        1,409        2,745      Provision for dilapidations       123        181        739      Net charge in relation to onerous lease provision (note 11)       13,807        -         -       Professional and other costs       522       68        219              15,769        2,257        7,031      4     Staff numbers The average number of employees, on a full time equivalent basis, during the period was as follows:             Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     Investment Management:                             - investment management services       724        679        698      - advisory services       89        81        82      Unit Trusts       27        26        27      Shared services       283        259        259              1,123        1,045        1,066      5     Taxation The tax expense for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was calculated based on the estimated average annual effective tax rate. The overall effective tax rate for this period was 21.1% (six months ended 30 June 2016: 25.3%; year ended 31 December 2016: 23.9%).             Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     United Kingdom taxation       5,527        4,805        11,953      Overseas taxation       179        92        236      Deferred taxation       (94)       881        (217)             5,612        5,778        11,972      The underlying UK corporation tax rate for the year ending 31 December 2017 is 19.2% (2016: 20.0%). The Finance Bill 2016 contained legislation to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 17.0% in April 2020 and was substantively enacted in September 2016. Deferred income taxes are calculated on all temporary differences under the liability method using the rate expected to apply when the relevant timing differences are forecast to unwind. 6     Dividends An interim dividend of 22.0p per share was declared on 24 July 2017 and is payable on 3 October 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 8 September 2017 (30 June 2016: 21.0p). In accordance with IFRS, the interim dividend has not been included as a liability in this interim statement.

The move to 8 Finsbury Circus accounted for £2,760,000 (six months ended 30 June 2016: £1,457,000; year ended 31 December 2016: £9,900,000) of the amount capitalised in the six months ended 30 June 2017.

A further £2,301,000 (six months ended 30 June 2016: £1,553,000; year ended 31 December 2016: £4,005,000) was expensed as staff costs during the period, representing amounts due for client relationships introduced more than 12 months after the cessation of any non-compete period. Impairment During the period, the group updated its assessment of goodwill allocated to the investment management, trust and tax and Rooper & Whately cash generating units (CGUs) for impairment. The recoverable amounts of goodwill allocated to the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. There was no indication of impairment of goodwill allocated to the investment management or Rooper & Whately CGUs during the period. The calculated recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to the trust and tax CGU at 30 June 2017 was £864,000, which was lower than the carrying value of £1,147,000 at 31 December 2016. The recoverable amount was calculated based on forecast earnings for the current year, extrapolated for a ten year period, assuming an annual decrease in revenues of 1.0% per annum (31 December 2016: decrease of 1.0% per annum). The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was 14.0% (31 December 2016: 11.3%) as the group judges this discount rate appropriately reflects the market in which the CGU operates and, in particular, its small size. The group has therefore recognised an impairment charge of £283,000 during the period. This impairment has been included in the Investment Management segment in the segmental analysis (note 2). 11   Provisions for liabilities and charges             Deferred, variable costs to acquire client relationship intangibles £'000       Deferred and contingent consideration in business combinations £'000       Legal and compensation £'000       Property-related £'000       Total £'000                                                   At 1 January 2016       13,392        3,908        721        1,795        19,816      Charged to profit or loss       -         -         855        306        1,161      Unused amount credited to profit or loss       -         (58)       (89)       -         (147)     Net charge to profit or loss       -         (58)       766        306        1,014      Other movements       4,783        48        -         -         4,831      Utilised/paid during the period       (7,902)       (2,258)       (421)       -         (10,581)     At 30 June 2016 (unaudited)       10,273        1,640        1,066        2,101        15,080      Charged to profit or loss       -         -         62        697        759      Unused amount credited to profit or loss       -         (21)       (397)       -         (418)     Net charge to profit or loss       -         (21)       (335)       697        341      Other movements       3,143        34        -         -         3,177      Utilised/paid during the period       (3,204)       (517)       (133)       -         (3,854)     At 1 January 2017 (audited)       10,212        1,136        598        2,798        14,744      Charged to profit or loss       -         -         93        16,105        16,198      Unused amount credited to profit or loss       -         -         -         -         -       Net charge to profit or loss       -         -         93       16,105       16,198     Other movements       1,597        (13)       -         -         1,584      Utilised/paid during the period       (4,820)       -         (46)       (2,968)       (7,834)     At 30 June 2017 (unaudited)       6,989        1,123        645        15,935        24,692                                                    Payable within 1 year       5,118        -         645        5,528        11,291      Payable after 1 year       1,871        1,123        -         10,407        13,401      At 30 June 2017 (unaudited)       6,989        1,123        645        15,935        24,692      Deferred, variable costs to acquire client relationship intangibles Other movements in provisions relate to deferred payments to investment managers and third parties for the introduction of client relationships, which have been capitalised in the period. Deferred and contingent consideration in business combinations Deferred and contingent consideration of £1,123,000 (30 June 2016: £1,640,000; 31 December 2016: £1,136,000) is the present value of amounts payable at the end of 2019 in respect of the acquisition of Vision and Castle. Legal & compensation During the ordinary course of business the group may, from time to time, be subject to complaints, as well as threatened and actual legal proceedings (which may include lawsuits brought on behalf of clients or other third parties) both in the UK and overseas. Any such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the group incurring a liability. In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to the group's best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the relevant balance sheet date. The timing of settlement of provisions for client compensation or litigation is dependent, in part, on the duration of negotiations with third parties. Property-related Property-related provisions of £15,935,000 relate to dilapidation and onerous lease provisions expected to arise on leasehold premises held by the group (30 June 2016: £2,101,000; 31 December 2016: £2,798,000). The move to the 8 Finsbury Circus office was completed on 13 February 2017, which triggered the recognition of a provision for the net cost of the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street until the end of the existing lease. The ultimate amount of the provision is dependent on the timing of any subletting arrangement and the associated terms agreed with prospective third parties. Based on management's expectations of future costs for the premises and potential rental income, and timings thereof, on 13 February 2017, the group recognised a provision of £12,148,000 whilst releasing the unamortised portion of the rent free period and a landlord contribution totalling £2,148,000. Since the middle of February 2017, management have altered their expected timings of a potential sublet; this has led to a further charge of £3,807,000 being recognised. The group utilised £2,264,000 (30 June 2016 and 31 December 2016: £nil) of the onerous lease provision during the period, being the payment of rent, rates and service charge. Dilapidation provisions are calculated using a discounted cash flow model; during the six months ended 30 June 2017, dilapidation provisions decreased by £554,000 (30 June 2016: increased £306,000; 31 December 2016: increased £1,003,000). The group utilised £704,000 (30 June 2016 and 31 December 2016: £nil) of the dilapidations provision held for the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street during the period. The impact of discounting led to an additional £150,000 (30 June 2016: £306,000; 31 December 2016: £1,003,000) being provided for over the period. Amounts payable after 1 year Property-related provisions of £10,407,000 are expected to be settled within 19  years of the balance sheet date, which corresponds to the longest lease for which a dilapidations provision is being held. Provisions for deferred and contingent consideration in business  combinations of £1,123,000 are expected to be settled within three years of the balance sheet date. Remaining provisions payable after one year are expected to be settled within three years of the balance sheet date. 12   Subordinated loan notes             Unaudited 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited 31 December 2016 £'000     Subordinated loan notes                             - Face value       20,000        20,000        20,000      - Carrying value       19,643        19,541        19,590      Subordinated loan notes consist of 10-year Tier 2 notes, which are repayable in August 2025, with a call option in August 2020 and annually thereafter.

This has resulted in a plan amendment gain of £5,523,000 being recognised in operating income. The group made special contributions into its pension schemes of £1,750,000 during the period (30 June 2016: £1,936,000; 31 December 2016: £2,936,000). 14   Share capital and share premium The following movements in share capital occurred during the period:             Number of shares       Exercise price pence       Share capital £'000       Share premium £'000       Total £'000     At 1 January 2016      48,134,286               2,407        97,643        100,050      Shares issued:                                             - in relation to business combinations        37,898       1,705.0       2        644        646      - to Share Incentive Plan       104,667       1,968.0 - 2,039.0       5        2,069        2,074      - to Save As You Earn scheme       102,319       934.0 - 1,641.0       5        1,104        1,109      At 30 June 2016 (unaudited)     48,379,170               2,419        101,460        103,879      Shares issued:                                             - to Share Incentive Plan       65,510       1,934.0 - 2,264.0       4        1,190        1,194      - to Save As You Earn scheme       13,789       934.0 - 1,641.0       1        166        167      - on placing       2,224,210       1,710.0       111        36,830        36,941      Own shares sold       -       1,754.0 - 1,949.0       -        345        345      At 31 December 2016 (audited)     50,682,679               2,535        139,991        142,526      Shares issued:                                             - to Share Incentive Plan       76,983       1,784.0 - 2,429.0       4        1,475        1,479      - to Save As You Earn scheme       85,838       984.0 - 1,648.0       4        1,243        1,247      - to Employee Benefit Trust       397,761       5.0        19        -        19      At 30 June 2017 (unaudited)     51,243,261               2,562        142,709        145,271      At 30 June 2017, the group held 672,909 own shares (30 June 2016: 376,273; 31 December 2016: 336,987). 15   Financial instruments The table below analyses the group's financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.    Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.    Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

There have been no transfers between levels during the period.   The fair value of listed equity securities is their quoted price. Money market funds are demand securities and changes to estimates of interest rates will not affect their fair value. The fair value of money market funds is their daily redemption value.  The fair values of the group's other financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values with the exception of the following:    Held to maturity debt securities comprise bank and building society certificates of deposit, which have fixed coupons. The fair value of debt securities at 30 June 2017 was £592,696,000 (30 June 2016: £727,395,000; 31 December 2016: £704,815,000) and the carrying value was £590,005,000 (30 June 2016: £725,000,000; 31 December 2016: £700,000,000). Fair value for held to maturity assets is based on market bid prices and hence would be categorised as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.    Subordinated loan notes (note 12) comprise Tier 2 loan notes issued in 2015. The fair value of the loan notes at 30 June 2017 was £20,604,000 (30 June 2016: £20,301,000; 31 December 2016: £19,578,000) and the carrying value was £19,643,000 (30 June 2016: £19,541,000; 31 December 2016: £19,590,000). Fair value of the loan notes is based on discounted future cash flows using current market rates for debts with similar remaining maturity, and hence would be categorised as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.   16   Contingent liabilities and commitments (a)   Indemnities are provided in the normal course of business to a number of directors and employees who provide tax and trust advisory services in connection with them acting as trustees/directors of client companies and providing other services. (b)   Capital expenditure authorised and contracted for at 30 June 2017 but not provided for in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements amounted to £2,074,000 (30 June 2016: £434,000; 31 December 2016: £4,430,000). The contractual amounts of the group's commitments to extend credit to its clients are as follows:             Unaudited 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited 31 December 2016 £'000     Guarantees       117        -        117      Undrawn commitments to lend of 1 year or less       22,644        22,146        25,661      Undrawn commitments to lend of more than 1 year       5,204        -        5,981              27,965        22,146        31,759      The fair value of the guarantees is £nil (30 June 2016 and 31 December 2016: £nil). (c)   The arrangements put in place by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) to protect depositors and investors from loss in the event of failure of financial institutions has resulted in significant levies on the industry in recent years. The financial impact of unexpected FSCS levies is largely out of the group's control as they result from other industry failures. There is uncertainty over the level of future FSCS levies as they depend on the ultimate cost to the FSCS of industry failures. The group contributes to the deposit class, investment fund management class and investment intermediation levy classes and accrues levy costs for future levy years when the obligation arises. 17   Consolidated interim statement of cash flows For the purposes of the consolidated interim statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise the following balances with less than three months until maturity from the date of acquisition:             Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     Cash and balances at central banks       1,480,932        960,115        1,075,673      Loans and advances to banks        147,714        105,629        83,844      Available for sale investment securities       124,287        83,623        103,557              1,752,933        1,149,367        1,263,074      Available for sale investment securities are amounts invested in money market funds which are realisable on demand. Cash flows arising from issue of ordinary shares comprise:             Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     Share capital issued (note 14)       27        12        128      Share premium on shares issued (note 14)       2,718        3,817        42,348      Shares issued in relation to share-based schemes for which no cash consideration was received       (437)       (1,043)       (1,631)     Shares issued in relation to business combinations       -        -        (646)             2,308        2,786        40,199      18   Related party transactions The key management personnel of the group are defined as the company's directors and other members of senior management who are responsible for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the group. Dividends totalling £204,000 were paid in the period (six months ended 30 June 2016: £122,000; year ended 31 December 2016: £302,000) in respect of ordinary shares held by key management personnel. As at 30 June 2017, the group had provided interest-free season ticket loans of £4,000 (30 June 2016: £3,000; 31 December 2016: £6,000) to key management personnel. At 30 June 2017, key management personnel and their close family members had gross outstanding deposits of £4,252,000 (30 June 2016: £4,104,000; 31 December 2016: £5,464,000) and gross outstanding loans of £723,000 (30 June 2016: £949,000; 31 December 2016: £959,000) which were made on normal business terms. A number of the company's directors and their close family members make use of the services provided by companies within the group. Charges for such services are made at various staff rates. One group subsidiary, Rathbone Unit Trust Management, has authority to manage the investments within a number of unit trusts. Another group company, Rathbone Investment Management International, acted as investment manager for a protected cell company offering unitised private client portfolio services. During the first half of 2017, the group managed 25 unit trusts, Sociétés d'investissement à Capital Variable (SICAVs) and open-ended investment companies (OEICs) (together, 'collectives') (six months ended 30 June 2016: 25 unit trusts and OEICs; year ended 31 December 2016: 27 unit trusts and OEICs). The group charges each fund an annual management fee for these services, but does not earn any performance fees on the unit trusts. The management charges are calculated on the bases published in the individual fund prospectuses, which also state the terms and conditions of the management contract with the group. The following transactions and balances relate to the group's interest in the unit trusts:          Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     Total management fees      16,592     12,856     27,783              Unaudited 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited 30 June 2016 £'000     Audited 31 December 2016 £'000     Management fees owed to the group     2,931     2,183     2,557     Holdings in unit trusts (note 15)     2,513     1,082     1,864         5,444     3,265     4,421     Total management fees are included within 'fee and commission income' in the consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income. Management fees owed to the group are included within 'accrued income' and holdings in unit trusts are classified as 'available for sale equity securities' in the consolidated interim balance sheet. The maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount on the balance sheet as disclosed above. All amounts outstanding with related parties are unsecured and will be settled in cash. No guarantees have been given or received. No provisions have been made for doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by related parties. 19   Interest in unconsolidated structured entities As described in note 18, at 30 June 2017, the group owned units in collectives managed by Rathbone Unit Trust Management with a value of £2,513,000 (30 June 2016: £1,082,000; 31 December 2016: £1,864,000), representing 0.05% (30 June 2016: 0.03%; 31 December 2016: 0.05%) of the total value of the collectives managed by the group. These assets are held to hedge the group's exposure to deferred remuneration schemes for employees of Unit Trusts. The group's primary risk associated with its interest in the unit trusts is from changes in fair value of its holdings in the funds. The group is not judged to control, and therefore does not consolidate, the collectives. Although the fund trustees have limited rights to remove Rathbone Unit Trust Management as manager, the group is exposed to very low variability of returns from its management and share of ownership of the funds and is therefore judged to act as an agent rather than having control under IFRS 10. 20   Events after the balance sheet date An interim dividend of 22.0p per share was declared on 24 July 2017 (see note 6). There have been no other material events occurring between the balance sheet date and 24 July 2017.  Regulatory capital The group is classified as a banking group under the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and is therefore required to operate within the restrictions on capital resources and banking exposures prescribed by the Capital Requirements Regulation, as applied by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Regulatory own funds The group's regulatory own funds (excluding profits for the six months ended 30 June, which have not yet been independently verified, but including independently verified profits to 31 December) are shown in the table below:             Unaudited 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited 30 June 2016 £'000       Unaudited 31 December 2016 £'000     Share capital and share premium       145,271        103,880        142,526      Reserves       188,586        206,331        188,530      Less:                             - Own shares       (5,344)       (6,561)       (6,243)     - Intangible assets (net of deferred tax)       (162,589)       (169,582)       (166,414)     Total Common Equity Tier 1 capital       165,924        134,068        158,399      Tier 2 capital       16,498        15,456        15,804      Total own funds       182,422        149,524        174,203      Own funds requirements The group is required to hold capital to cover a range of own funds requirements, classified as Pillar 1 and Pillar 2. Pillar 1 - minimum requirement for capital Pillar 1 focuses on the determination of risk-weighted assets and expected losses in respect of the group's exposure to credit, counterparty credit, market and operational risks and sets a minimum requirement for capital. At 30 June 2017, the group's risk-weighted assets were £911,163,000 (30 June 2016: £837,975,000; 31 December 2016: £892,650,000). Pillar 2 - Supervisory review process Pillar 2 supplements the Pillar 1 minimum requirement with firm-specific Individual Capital Guidance (Pillar 2A) and a framework of regulatory capital buffers (Pillar 2B). The Pillar 2A own funds requirement is set by the PRA to reflect those risks, specific to the firm, which are not fully captured under the Pillar 1 own funds requirement. Pension obligation riskThe potential for additional unplanned costs that the group would incur in the event of a significant deterioration in the funding position of the group's defined benefit pension schemes. Interest rate risk in the banking bookThe potential losses in the non-trading book resulting from interest rate changes or widening of the spread between Bank of England base rates and LIBOR rates. Concentration risk Greater loss volatility arising from a higher level of loan default correlation than is assumed by the Pillar 1 assessment.  The group is also required to maintain a number of Pillar 2B regulatory capital buffers. Capital conservation buffer (CCB)The CCB is a general buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets designed to provide for losses in the event of a stress and is being phased in from 1 January 2016 to 1 January 2019. As at 30 June 2017, the buffer rate was 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. The CCB must be met with Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB)The CCyB is time-varying and is designed to act as an incentive for banks to constrain credit growth in times of heightened systemic risk. The amount of the buffer is determined by reference to rates set by the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) for individual countries where the group has credit exposures.  The buffer rate is currently set at zero for the UK, however non-zero rates for Norway, Sweden and Hong Kong, where the group has small relevant credit exposures, results in an overall rate of 0.02% of risk weighted assets for the group as at 30 June 2017. The FPC has announced that the rate will increase to 0.5%, with binding effect from 27 June 2018. Absent a material change in the outlook, it expects to increase the rate to 1.0% with effect from November 2018. The CCyB must be met with Common Equity Tier 1 capital.

Going concern basis of preparation Details of the group's results, cash flows and resources, together with an update on the risks it faces and other factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in this interim management report. Group companies are regulated by the PRA and FCA and perform annual capital adequacy assessments, which include the modelling of certain extreme stress scenarios. The group publishes Pillar 3 disclosures annually on its website, which provide further detail about its regulatory capital resources and requirements. During the first half of 2017, and as at 30 June 2017, the group was primarily equity-financed, with a small amount of gearing in the form of the Tier 2 debt. In 2017, the group has continued to grow client funds under management, both organically and through acquisition, and the group remains profitable. The directors believe that the company remains well-placed to manage its business risks successfully, despite an uncertain economic and political backdrop. As we believe that the group has, and is forecast to continue to have, sufficient financial and regulatory resources we continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the condensed consolidated interim financial statements. In forming our view, we have considered the company's prospects for a period exceeding 12 months from the date the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are approved. By Order of the Board Philip HowellChief Executive 24 July 2017  Independent review report Rathbone Brothers Plc We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2017 as set out on pages 6 to 25 which comprises the consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, consolidated interim statement of changes in equity, consolidated interim balance sheet, consolidated interim statement of cash flows and the related explanatory notes. We have read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of financial statements. This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the Company in meeting the requirements of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules ("the DTR") of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority ("the UK FCA"). Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached. Directors' responsibilities The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority. As disclosed in note 1, the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The condensed set of financial statements included in this half-yearly financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim Financial Reporting," as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review. Scope of review We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2017 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 as adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority.

Rathbone Brothers Plc 
                Rathbone Brothers Plc : Half-yearly report 2017



Underlying profit before tax up 22.7% to £43.3 million Philip Howell, Chief Executive of Rathbone Brothers Plc, said: "The first six months of 2017 has seen another busy period for Rathbones as we continue to deliver our strategic plans without detracting from our high standards of service to our clients. We remain confident in the medium term potential of our growth initiatives. Short term market conditions are dominated by a backdrop of ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and we will continue to invest with discipline."   Highlights:   Underlying profit before tax* increased 22.7% from £35.3 million to £43.3 million in the first six months of 2017. Underlying profit margin remained strong at 30.4% compared to 29.4% in 2016. Underlying earnings per share increased 21.1% to 68.4p (2016: 56.5p).   Profit before tax for the half year increased 16.7% from £22.8 million to £26.6 million, reflecting £15.8 million of costs associated with the London office move, offset by a plan amendment gain of £5.5 million arising from the closure of our defined benefit pension schemes. Basic earnings per share increased 16.5% to 41.6p (2016: 35.7p).   The board recommends a 22.0p interim dividend for 2017 (2016: 21.0p).    Total funds under management at 30 June 2017 were £36.6 billion, up 7.0% from £34.2 billion at 31 December 2016. This compared to an increase of 2.4% in the FTSE 100 Index and an increase of 2.7% in the MSCI WMA Private Investor Balanced Index over the same period.   Total net organic and acquired growth in the funds managed by Investment Management was £0.6 billion in the first six months of 2017, representing a net annual growth rate of 4.0% (2016: 4.2%). Net organic growth of £0.4 billion for the first half represents an underlying annualised rate of net organic growth of 2.9% (2016: 2.5%). In the period, we experienced higher outflows from low margin accounts and adjusting for this, the annualised net organic growth rate was 3.4%.   Underlying operating income in Investment Management of £127.4 million in the first six months of 2017 (2016: £108.8 million) was up 17.1%, largely due to growth in funds under management. The average FTSE 100 Index was 7322 on quarterly billing dates in 2017, compared to 6298 in 2016, an increase of 16.3%.   Underlying operating expenses of £99.1 million (2016: £84.9 million) increased 16.7% year-on-year largely as a result of variable staff costs, reflecting both the higher profitability in the period and an improved investment performance element for growth awards.   Funds under management in Unit Trusts were £4.6 billion at 30 June 2017 (31 December 2016: £4.0 billion). Net inflows were £269 million in the first half of 2017 (2016: £259 million). Underlying operating income in Unit Trusts was £14.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2017, an increase of 30.7% from £11.4 million in the first half of 2016.   Shareholders equity of £342.4 million at 30 June 2017 increased 5.4% since 31 December 2016 (£324.8 million) and 22.4% since 30 June 2016 (£279.7 million), largely as a result of the fall in value of retirement benefit obligations, which totalled £20.0 million at 30 June 2017, 49.4% lower than the £39.5 million recorded at 31 December 2016.    * Excluding a plan amendment gain on the closure of the defined benefit pension schemes and charges in relation to client relationships and goodwill, acquisition-related costs and London head office relocation costs. 25 July 2017 For further information contact:     Rathbone Brothers PlcTel: 020 7399 0000email: shelly.patel@rathbones.com     Philip Howell, Chief ExecutivePaul Stockton, Finance DirectorShelly Patel, Investor Relations Manager     CamarcoTel: 020 3757 4984email: ed.gascoigne-pees@camarco.co.uk     Ed Gascoigne-Pees     Rathbone Brothers Plc  Rathbone Brothers Plc ("Rathbones"), through its subsidiaries, is a leading provider of high-quality, personalised investment and wealth management services for private clients, charities and trustees. Our services include discretionary investment management, unit trusts, banking and loan services, financial planning, unitised portfolio services, and UK trust, legal, estate and tax advice. Rathbones has over 1,100 staff in 16 locations in the UK and Jersey; its headquarters is 8 Finsbury Circus, London. rathbones.com  Investment management reportContinuing growth in funds under management In the first half of 2017, investment markets largely shrugged off political events, and continued to build momentum with the FTSE 100 reaching all time highs during the period. Our own funds under management grew 7.0% to reach £36.6 billion at 30 June 2017, benefitting from a combination of continued acquired and organic growth and these resilient conditions. This compares to a 2.4% increase in the FTSE 100 Index and a 2.7% increase in the MSCI WMA Private Investor Balanced Index.   Funds under management in our Investment Management business were £32.0 billion at 30 June 2017 (2016: £30.2 billion).  Investment Management net inflows were £0.6 billion in the first half (2016: £0.5 billion) representing a total annualised growth rate of 4.0% (2016: 4.2%).  Net organic growth totalled £0.4 billion up from £0.3 billion at 30 June 2016, equating to an annualised net organic growth rate of 2.9%. In the period, we experienced higher outflows from low margin accounts and adjusting for this, the annualised net organic growth rate was 3.4%. Purchased growth totalled £0.2 billion (2016: £0.2 billion), with nearly all investment managers set to meet or exceed their earn-out targets. Our charities business continued to perform well and retained the position of the second biggest investment management provider to the top 5,000 charities in the UK. Its funds under management grew 4.9% to £4.3 billion in the first six months of 2017. The market profile of our ethical business, Rathbone Greenbank Investments, continues to rise with funds under management increasing by 9.6% to reach £946 million in the first half.  Funds under management in our Unit Trusts business increased 15.0% from £4.0 billion at 31 December 2016 to £4.6 billion at 30 June 2017.  Positive markets and competitive investment performance helped to attract gross sales of £733 million compared to £576 million for the same period in 2016. In common with many in the industry, redemptions of £464 million were higher at the start of 2017 as investor concerns heightened, and many sought to realise gains. Whilst the lead up to and subsequent results of the UK election did have some adverse impacts in June, net inflows for the first half totalled £269 million compared to £259 million at 30 June 2016.  We continue to strive to provide high quality service to our clients and in May 2017, for the second year in a row, Rathbones was named both "Private Client Asset Manager of the Year (Institutional)" at the Citywealth awards and "Asset Manager of the Year" at the Better Society Awards. These awards recognise a continued excellence in client service, leadership and an overall contribution to the profession.  Underlying profit before tax up 22.7% to £43.3 million   Underlying profit before tax increased 22.7% to £43.3 million (2016: £35.3 million) in the first six months of 2017, representing an underlying profit margin of 30.4% (2016: 29.4%). Underlying earnings per share of 68.4p increased 21.1% from 56.5p in 2016.    Profit before tax for the half year of £26.6 million is 16.7% higher than the £22.8 million in 2016 and reflects £15.8 million of costs associated with the London office move (see note 3), offset by a plan amendment gain of £5.5 million arising from the closure of our defined benefit pension schemes with effect from 30 June 2017 (see note 13). Prior year profit before tax included charges of £4.4 million in respect of the acquisition of the Vision businesses. We are working hard to let our Curzon Street premises, though the rental market remains soft particularly in light of Brexit uncertainty.  Fee income of £105.5 million in the first half of 2017 increased 21.1% compared to the same period last year (2016: £87.1 million) reflecting positive markets and growth in organic and acquired new business over the period. The average FTSE 100 Index (calculated on our fee billing dates) was 7322, up 16.3% compared to 6298 a year ago.  Fee income represented 74.1% of total underlying operating income in the six months ended 30 June 2017 (2016: 72.5%), as our fee only tariff becomes more widely adopted, helping to support our move to higher quality fee-based income.   Net commission income of £21.9 million was up 12.3% from £19.5 million in the first half of 2016, reflecting more positive investing conditions and a strong first quarter in particular. Net interest income was relatively stable at £5.6 million in the first half (2016: £5.7 million), as higher liquidity largely offset the impact of lower base interest rates. As active investment managers, we remain focused on balancing risks and returns, and as a result saw overall cash weightings in portfolios rise to 7.1% compared to 6.6% a year ago reflecting a greater degree of uncertainty over future equity markets. Average deposits were £2.3 billion in the first half of the year compared to £1.7 billion a year ago. Client loans increased 8.7% to £115.5 million from £106.3 million at 31 December 2016. Fees from advisory services and other income increased 19.0% to £9.4 million (2016: £7.9 million) reflecting more positive flows from Vision following a slower period last year as the business completed a comprehensive file review exercise.  Underlying operating expenses of £99.1 million (2016: £84.9 million) increased 16.7% year-on-year. This was largely as a result of variable staff costs, which increased 32.3% to £25.8 million (2016: £19.5 million) reflecting both the higher profitability in the period and an improved investment performance element for growth awards. Variable staff costs as a percentage of underlying profit before variable staff costs also therefore increased to 37.3% (2016: 35.6%).  In line with our strategy, planned additions in headcount increased fixed staff costs by 11.2% to £44.7 million (2016: £40.2 million) and average headcount in the first half of 2017 was 1,123, up 7.5% compared to 1,045 a year ago. Other direct costs of £28.6 million (2016: £25.2 million) were up 13.5% as a result of higher property costs and planned project expenditure.  Our effective tax rate for the first half of 2017 was 21.1% (2016: 25.3%). The prior year rate was higher as a result of deferred payments to acquire the Vision businesses. Our interim dividend has been increased by 1p per share to 22p (2016: 21p) and will be paid on 3 October 2017.  Progress on growth strategy  Vision continues to gain momentum and now has £1.2 billion of funds under advice on its discretionary investment management panel, up 20.0% from the £1.0 billion at 31 December 2016, and 108 advisers, up from 99 at 31 December 2016. The business remains on track to grow to our target of 150 advisers and we remain confident in its growth prospects. Our distribution strategy continues to focus on promoting our discretionary investment management services to professional intermediaries, principally national and regional IFA networks. It continues to make good progress with net flows of £108 million in the first six months of the year, up 96.4% from £55 million at the same time last year. We continue to build our presence in the intermediary market as evidenced by a May 2017 Defaqto report which confirmed that the usage of Rathbones as a discretionary fund management provider to advisers had more than doubled in the last year, and  placed Rathbones very highly in the critical areas of  'Quality of investment staff' and 'Service'. We successfully launched an execution only Managed Portfolio Service in March 2017 which attracted £7.2 million of net flows in its first 3 months of launch. With the Credit Suisse partnership fully operational, the Rathbone Private Office was formally launched in January. The nucleus team of three senior client advisers and four support staff is making good progress in promoting this new advisory capability. This service is offered directly to super high net worth clients and family offices as well as seeking introductions from the professional intermediary market and from our own investment manager community. The team has already engaged its first clients and is developing an encouraging pipeline of prospective clients for the full year.   We continue to focus on improving our client experience and striving for greater operational efficiency in our support functions with the aim of creating additional capacity for growth. At the full year, we outlined our plans to spend an additional £1 million in 2017 to implement a new client relationship management system and improve our client take on processes. These plans are developing more quickly than originally planned and in light of more favourable investment conditions, we have chosen to bring forward capital expenditure originally planned for 2018 to the second half of this year in order to accelerate delivery and improve functionality through greater automation. This brings the total expected capital expenditure in relation to our client relationship management system and client take on process improvement to approximately £2 million in 2017.  Expenditure on the other growth strategies remains in line with expectations. The relocation of our London head office to 8 Finsbury Circus has proved very successful.   Financial position and regulatory capital  Shareholders' equity of £342.4 million at 30 June 2017 increased 5.4% since 31 December 2016 (£324.8 million) and 22.4% since 30 June 2016 (£279.7 million). This is largely as a result of the fall in value of retirement benefit obligations which totalled £20.0 million at 30 June 2017, 49.4% lower than the £39.5 million recorded at 31 December 2016. This reflected a high number of members transferring their benefits out of the scheme, a reduction in the assumed rates of improvement in longevity and breakage of the link between pension entitlements and final salaries. Triennial valuation discussions with trustees are ongoing and are expected to complete in the second half of the year.   Total assets at 30 June 2017 were £2,829.9 million (31 December 2016: £2,404.0 million; 30 June 2016: £2,344.8 million), of which £2,215.1 million (31 December 2016: £1,888.9 million; 30 June 2016: £1,860.0 million) represents the cash element of client portfolios that is held as a banking deposit. As a result of these higher levels of cash, balances with central banks increased from £1,075.7 million at 31 December 2016 to £1,480.9 million at 30 June 2017 (30 June 2016: £960.1 million). Our consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 18.2 % at 30 June 2017 (31 December 2016: 17.7%; 30 June 2016: 16.0%). Our consolidated leverage ratio was 6.2% at 30 June 2017 (31 December 2016: 6.6%; 30 June 2016: 6.2%). The capital surplus of own funds over the Pillar 1 and 2A requirements and CRD IV buffers was £69.9m at 30 June 2017 (excluding year to date post tax profits and improvements in the value of retirement benefit obligations) compared to £49.2m at 30 June 2016, largely reflecting the impact of additional equity raised in October 2016 offset by higher capital requirements.  Business risks  The board believes that the nature of the principal risks and uncertainties which may have a material effect on the group's performance during the remainder of its financial year remain unchanged from those identified in the strategic report and group risk committee report in our 2016 annual report and accounts (pages 18-25 and pages 80-81 respectively).   Regulatory changes   We continue to prepare for the changes brought on by MiFID II and the General Data Protection Regime and are working hard to ensure our people and systems are compliant. We anticipate that the cost of these projects will be approximately £1.5 million which will be absorbed by our normal expenditure budget for the year. We note the recommendations of the recent FCA Asset Management Market Report and the sequence of consultations prior to final implementation. While we broadly welcome the proposals, they will have an impact on margins of our Unit Trust business from 2018. In addition, as part of our implementation of MiFID II, research payments that have long been charged to our funds will, from 1 January 2018 be borne by the business. The impact of these changes will be significantly offset by a reduction in variable remuneration, some cost actions and by the continued funds growth momentum through this year and beyond. Fund box profits in our Unit Trust business for the six months ended 30 June 2017 were £1.8 million and research costs currently borne by the funds totalled approximately £0.5 million for the same period.   Board and senior management changes  Following the announcement of David Harrel stepping down after nine years on the board, we are pleased to announce that Sarah Gentleman has now completed the regulatory approval process and has formally succeeded David as the chairman of the remuneration committee.  Outlook  The first six months of 2017 has seen another busy period for Rathbones as we continue to deliver our strategic plans without detracting from our high standards of service to our clients. We remain confident in the medium term potential of our growth strategy.

Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements1     Basis of preparation Rathbone Brothers Plc ('the company') is the parent company of a group of companies ('the group') that provides personalised investment and wealth management services for private clients, charities and trustees. The group also provides financial planning, private banking, offshore fund management and trust administration services. The products and services from which the group derives its revenues are described in 'our services' on page 3 of the annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016 and have not materially changed since that date. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' as adopted by the EU. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, using the accounting policies, methods of computation and presentation set out in the group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 except as disclosed below. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the group's audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016, which are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU. The information in this announcement does not comprise statutory financial statements within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The comparative figures for the financial year ended 31 December 2016 are not the group's statutory accounts for that financial year. The group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been reported on by its auditors and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified and did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis. It also did not contain a statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. Developments in reporting standards and interpretations  Future new standards and interpretations A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations will be effective for future annual periods beginning after  1 January 2017 and, therefore, have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' and IFRS 16 'Leases' are expected to have the most significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group. IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'  IFRS 9 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2016. The group has not adopted this standard early. IFRS 9 changes the classification and measurement of financial instruments and the timing and extent of credit provisioning. The group has conducted a preliminary assessment of the potential impact, based on the profile of its financial instruments as at the balance sheet date, and is well advanced in its approach to classification and valuation. Classification of financial assets The basis of classification for financial assets under IFRS 9 is different from that under IAS 39. Financial assets will be classified into one of three categories: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale categories available under IAS 39 have been removed. In addition, the classification criteria for allocating financial assets between categories are different under IFRS 9. The group is well advanced in its classification of financial assets under the new standard. IFRS 9 uses the same measurement bases as IAS 39 and the group has not yet identified any material differences arising from applying the new standard. Debt securities currently classified as held to maturity will be classified as amortised cost. Other assets currently carried at amortised cost such as cash with central banks and loans and advances to banks and customers will also continue to be classified as such. Money market funds currently classified as available for sale will be classified as FVOCI, given that although they are generally held to collect contractual cash flows, they can be redeemed, should the need arise. Impairment of financial assets Under IFRS 9, an expected credit loss model replaces the incurred loss model, meaning there no longer needs to be a triggering event in order to recognise impairment losses. A provision must be made for the amount of any loss expected to arise over the life of the group's financial assets. Under IAS 39, credit losses are recognised when they incurred. Under the expected credit loss model, a dual measurement approach applies whereby a financial asset will attract a loss allowance equal to either 12 month expected credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses. The latter applies if there has been a significant deterioration in the credit quality of the asset. This will require considerable judgement as to how changes in economic factors affect expected credit losses, which will be determined on a probability-weighted basis. The group's trade receivables (including trust and financial planning debtors) are generally short term and does not contain significant financing components. Therefore, the group expects to apply the simplified approach and reflect lifetime expected credit losses. Treasury assets currently held by the group are of high credit quality and the group has not experienced any historical credit losses in its treasury or loan portfolios. Work conducted to date suggests that any impairment charges recognised in the financial statements under the new standard will be minimal. Classification of financial liabilities The basis of classification for financial liabilities under IFRS 9 remains unchanged from that under IAS 39. The two categories are amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss (either designated as such or held for trading) The group does not currently designate any liabilities as fair value through profit or loss, and do not anticipate doing so. Therefore, under IFRS 9, the group expects to classify all financial liabilities as amortised cost, with no material impact on measurement. IFRS 15 ' Revenue from Contracts with Customers'  IFRS 15 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2016. The group has not adopted this standard early. IFRS 15 changes how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers. The group will be required to identify all contracts it has with customers in order to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. The group is in the process of quantifying the potential impact of adopting the standard, based on its existing revenue streams. In addition, the group is considering the impact on its policy of capitalising costs to secure investment management contracts. Net fee and commission income Included within net fee and commission income are initial fees, charged by a number of group companies in relation to certain business activities. Under IFRS 15, the group will be required to make an assessment as to whether the work performed to earn such fees constitutes the transfer of services and, therefore, fulfils any performance obligation(s). If so, then these fees can be recognised when charged; if not, then the fees can only be recognised in the period the services are provided. The group has not yet identified any other revenue streams that will be materially impacted by the new standard. Client relationship intangibles Where payments are made to new investment managers to secure investment management contracts, such costs are capitalised and amortised, where they are separable, reliably measurable and expected to be recovered, under IAS 18. IFRS 15 reinforces this view, stating that incremental costs of obtaining any contract with a customer shall be capitalised if the entity expects to recover those costs. Therefore, the group does not believe the adoption of IFRS 15 will materially change the way it accounts for client relationship intangibles. Transition The group plans to adopt IFRS 15 in its consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018, using the retrospective approach. IFRS 16 ' Leases' IFRS 16 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2017. The group does not plan to adopt this standard early. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases. The group will be required to recognise all leases with a term of more than 12 months as a right-of-use lease asset on its balance sheet; the group will also recognise a financial liability representing its obligation to make future lease payments. The group has conducted an initial quantification of the impact of adopting the standard, based on its existing lease contracts. The most significant impact is in respect of its new London head office premises. Transition Definition of a lease On transition to IFRS 16, the Group can choose whether to:  - Apply the new definition of a lease to all its contracts as if IFRS 16 had always applied; or  - Apply a practical expedient and retain its previous assessments of which contracts contain a lease.  The group intends to apply the practical expedient and therefore will not be reassessing those contracts that are not deemed to contain a lease prior to the date of adoption. Retrospective approach As a lessee, the Group can either apply the standard using a: - Retrospective approach; or  - Modified retrospective approach with optional practical expedients.  The Group has assessed the impact of both approaches in relation to its existing lease contracts, and is most likely to apply the modified retrospective approach. Potential impact The group's total assets and total liabilities will be increased by the recognition of lease assets and liabilities. The lease assets will be depreciated over the shorter of the expected life of the asset and the lease term. The lease liability will be reduced by lease payments, offset by the unwinding of the liability over the lease term. On the group's statement of comprehensive income, the profile of lease costs will be front-loaded, at least individually, as the interest charge is higher in the early years of a lease term as the discount rate unwinds. The total cost of the lease over the lease term is expected to be unchanged. In addition to the above impacts, recognition of lease assets will increase the group's regulatory capital requirement. Lessor accounting Where the Group acts as an intermediate lessor in a sub-lease arrangement it will need to make adjustments for such leases.   2     Segmental information For management purposes, the group is organised into two operating divisions: Investment Management and Unit Trusts. Centrally incurred indirect expenses are allocated to these operating segments on the basis of the cost drivers that generate the expenditure; principally the headcount of staff directly involved in providing those services from which the segment earns revenues, the value of funds under management and the segment's total revenue.

Geographic analysis The following table presents operating income analysed by the geographical location of the group entity providing the service:             Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     United Kingdom       142,503        115,798        241,882      Jersey       5,394        4,403        9,401      Operating income       147,897        120,201        251,283      The group's non-current assets are substantially all located in the United Kingdom. Major clients The group is not reliant on any one client or group of connected clients for generation of revenues. At 30 June 2017, the group provided investment management services to 49,000 clients (30 June 2016: 48,000; 31 December 2016: 48,000).  3     Head office relocation On 6 January 2016, the group exchanged contracts for five 17-year leases for a total of 75,000 sq ft of office space at 8 Finsbury Circus. The group began recognising costs relating to rent and dilapidations on the new premises from the date the leases began, 13 May 2016. The move to the 8 Finsbury Circus office concluded on 13 February 2017, which triggered recognition of a provision for the net cost of the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street until the end of the existing lease (see note 11). During the six months to 30 June 2017, incremental costs of £15,769,000 (30 June 2016: £2,257,000; 31 December 2016: £7,031,000) were incurred as a result of the decision to move the head office to 8 Finsbury Circus. These incremental costs were as follows:             Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     Rental costs for 8 Finsbury Circus prior to relocation       538        599        3,328      Accelerated depreciation charge for 1 Curzon Street       779        1,409        2,745      Provision for dilapidations       123        181        739      Net charge in relation to onerous lease provision (note 11)       13,807        -         -       Professional and other costs       522       68        219              15,769        2,257        7,031      4     Staff numbers The average number of employees, on a full time equivalent basis, during the period was as follows:             Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     Investment Management:                             - investment management services       724        679        698      - advisory services       89        81        82      Unit Trusts       27        26        27      Shared services       283        259        259              1,123        1,045        1,066      5     Taxation The tax expense for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was calculated based on the estimated average annual effective tax rate. The overall effective tax rate for this period was 21.1% (six months ended 30 June 2016: 25.3%; year ended 31 December 2016: 23.9%).             Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     United Kingdom taxation       5,527        4,805        11,953      Overseas taxation       179        92        236      Deferred taxation       (94)       881        (217)             5,612        5,778        11,972      The underlying UK corporation tax rate for the year ending 31 December 2017 is 19.2% (2016: 20.0%). The Finance Bill 2016 contained legislation to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 17.0% in April 2020 and was substantively enacted in September 2016. Deferred income taxes are calculated on all temporary differences under the liability method using the rate expected to apply when the relevant timing differences are forecast to unwind. 6     Dividends An interim dividend of 22.0p per share was declared on 24 July 2017 and is payable on 3 October 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 8 September 2017 (30 June 2016: 21.0p). In accordance with IFRS, the interim dividend has not been included as a liability in this interim statement.

The move to 8 Finsbury Circus accounted for £2,760,000 (six months ended 30 June 2016: £1,457,000; year ended 31 December 2016: £9,900,000) of the amount capitalised in the six months ended 30 June 2017.

A further £2,301,000 (six months ended 30 June 2016: £1,553,000; year ended 31 December 2016: £4,005,000) was expensed as staff costs during the period, representing amounts due for client relationships introduced more than 12 months after the cessation of any non-compete period. Impairment During the period, the group updated its assessment of goodwill allocated to the investment management, trust and tax and Rooper & Whately cash generating units (CGUs) for impairment. The recoverable amounts of goodwill allocated to the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. There was no indication of impairment of goodwill allocated to the investment management or Rooper & Whately CGUs during the period. The calculated recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to the trust and tax CGU at 30 June 2017 was £864,000, which was lower than the carrying value of £1,147,000 at 31 December 2016. The recoverable amount was calculated based on forecast earnings for the current year, extrapolated for a ten year period, assuming an annual decrease in revenues of 1.0% per annum (31 December 2016: decrease of 1.0% per annum). The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was 14.0% (31 December 2016: 11.3%) as the group judges this discount rate appropriately reflects the market in which the CGU operates and, in particular, its small size. The group has therefore recognised an impairment charge of £283,000 during the period. This impairment has been included in the Investment Management segment in the segmental analysis (note 2). 11   Provisions for liabilities and charges             Deferred, variable costs to acquire client relationship intangibles £'000       Deferred and contingent consideration in business combinations £'000       Legal and compensation £'000       Property-related £'000       Total £'000                                                   At 1 January 2016       13,392        3,908        721        1,795        19,816      Charged to profit or loss       -         -         855        306        1,161      Unused amount credited to profit or loss       -         (58)       (89)       -         (147)     Net charge to profit or loss       -         (58)       766        306        1,014      Other movements       4,783        48        -         -         4,831      Utilised/paid during the period       (7,902)       (2,258)       (421)       -         (10,581)     At 30 June 2016 (unaudited)       10,273        1,640        1,066        2,101        15,080      Charged to profit or loss       -         -         62        697        759      Unused amount credited to profit or loss       -         (21)       (397)       -         (418)     Net charge to profit or loss       -         (21)       (335)       697        341      Other movements       3,143        34        -         -         3,177      Utilised/paid during the period       (3,204)       (517)       (133)       -         (3,854)     At 1 January 2017 (audited)       10,212        1,136        598        2,798        14,744      Charged to profit or loss       -         -         93        16,105        16,198      Unused amount credited to profit or loss       -         -         -         -         -       Net charge to profit or loss       -         -         93       16,105       16,198     Other movements       1,597        (13)       -         -         1,584      Utilised/paid during the period       (4,820)       -         (46)       (2,968)       (7,834)     At 30 June 2017 (unaudited)       6,989        1,123        645        15,935        24,692                                                    Payable within 1 year       5,118        -         645        5,528        11,291      Payable after 1 year       1,871        1,123        -         10,407        13,401      At 30 June 2017 (unaudited)       6,989        1,123        645        15,935        24,692      Deferred, variable costs to acquire client relationship intangibles Other movements in provisions relate to deferred payments to investment managers and third parties for the introduction of client relationships, which have been capitalised in the period. Deferred and contingent consideration in business combinations Deferred and contingent consideration of £1,123,000 (30 June 2016: £1,640,000; 31 December 2016: £1,136,000) is the present value of amounts payable at the end of 2019 in respect of the acquisition of Vision and Castle. Legal & compensation During the ordinary course of business the group may, from time to time, be subject to complaints, as well as threatened and actual legal proceedings (which may include lawsuits brought on behalf of clients or other third parties) both in the UK and overseas. Any such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the group incurring a liability. In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to the group's best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the relevant balance sheet date. The timing of settlement of provisions for client compensation or litigation is dependent, in part, on the duration of negotiations with third parties. Property-related Property-related provisions of £15,935,000 relate to dilapidation and onerous lease provisions expected to arise on leasehold premises held by the group (30 June 2016: £2,101,000; 31 December 2016: £2,798,000). The move to the 8 Finsbury Circus office was completed on 13 February 2017, which triggered the recognition of a provision for the net cost of the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street until the end of the existing lease. The ultimate amount of the provision is dependent on the timing of any subletting arrangement and the associated terms agreed with prospective third parties. Based on management's expectations of future costs for the premises and potential rental income, and timings thereof, on 13 February 2017, the group recognised a provision of £12,148,000 whilst releasing the unamortised portion of the rent free period and a landlord contribution totalling £2,148,000. Since the middle of February 2017, management have altered their expected timings of a potential sublet; this has led to a further charge of £3,807,000 being recognised. The group utilised £2,264,000 (30 June 2016 and 31 December 2016: £nil) of the onerous lease provision during the period, being the payment of rent, rates and service charge. Dilapidation provisions are calculated using a discounted cash flow model; during the six months ended 30 June 2017, dilapidation provisions decreased by £554,000 (30 June 2016: increased £306,000; 31 December 2016: increased £1,003,000). The group utilised £704,000 (30 June 2016 and 31 December 2016: £nil) of the dilapidations provision held for the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street during the period. The impact of discounting led to an additional £150,000 (30 June 2016: £306,000; 31 December 2016: £1,003,000) being provided for over the period. Amounts payable after 1 year Property-related provisions of £10,407,000 are expected to be settled within 19  years of the balance sheet date, which corresponds to the longest lease for which a dilapidations provision is being held. Provisions for deferred and contingent consideration in business  combinations of £1,123,000 are expected to be settled within three years of the balance sheet date. Remaining provisions payable after one year are expected to be settled within three years of the balance sheet date. 12   Subordinated loan notes             Unaudited 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited 31 December 2016 £'000     Subordinated loan notes                             - Face value       20,000        20,000        20,000      - Carrying value       19,643        19,541        19,590      Subordinated loan notes consist of 10-year Tier 2 notes, which are repayable in August 2025, with a call option in August 2020 and annually thereafter.

This has resulted in a plan amendment gain of £5,523,000 being recognised in operating income. The group made special contributions into its pension schemes of £1,750,000 during the period (30 June 2016: £1,936,000; 31 December 2016: £2,936,000). 14   Share capital and share premium The following movements in share capital occurred during the period:             Number of shares       Exercise price pence       Share capital £'000       Share premium £'000       Total £'000     At 1 January 2016      48,134,286               2,407        97,643        100,050      Shares issued:                                             - in relation to business combinations        37,898       1,705.0       2        644        646      - to Share Incentive Plan       104,667       1,968.0 - 2,039.0       5        2,069        2,074      - to Save As You Earn scheme       102,319       934.0 - 1,641.0       5        1,104        1,109      At 30 June 2016 (unaudited)     48,379,170               2,419        101,460        103,879      Shares issued:                                             - to Share Incentive Plan       65,510       1,934.0 - 2,264.0       4        1,190        1,194      - to Save As You Earn scheme       13,789       934.0 - 1,641.0       1        166        167      - on placing       2,224,210       1,710.0       111        36,830        36,941      Own shares sold       -       1,754.0 - 1,949.0       -        345        345      At 31 December 2016 (audited)     50,682,679               2,535        139,991        142,526      Shares issued:                                             - to Share Incentive Plan       76,983       1,784.0 - 2,429.0       4        1,475        1,479      - to Save As You Earn scheme       85,838       984.0 - 1,648.0       4        1,243        1,247      - to Employee Benefit Trust       397,761       5.0        19        -        19      At 30 June 2017 (unaudited)     51,243,261               2,562        142,709        145,271      At 30 June 2017, the group held 672,909 own shares (30 June 2016: 376,273; 31 December 2016: 336,987). 15   Financial instruments The table below analyses the group's financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.    Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.    Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

There have been no transfers between levels during the period.   The fair value of listed equity securities is their quoted price. Money market funds are demand securities and changes to estimates of interest rates will not affect their fair value. The fair value of money market funds is their daily redemption value.  The fair values of the group's other financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values with the exception of the following:    Held to maturity debt securities comprise bank and building society certificates of deposit, which have fixed coupons. The fair value of debt securities at 30 June 2017 was £592,696,000 (30 June 2016: £727,395,000; 31 December 2016: £704,815,000) and the carrying value was £590,005,000 (30 June 2016: £725,000,000; 31 December 2016: £700,000,000). Fair value for held to maturity assets is based on market bid prices and hence would be categorised as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.    Subordinated loan notes (note 12) comprise Tier 2 loan notes issued in 2015. The fair value of the loan notes at 30 June 2017 was £20,604,000 (30 June 2016: £20,301,000; 31 December 2016: £19,578,000) and the carrying value was £19,643,000 (30 June 2016: £19,541,000; 31 December 2016: £19,590,000). Fair value of the loan notes is based on discounted future cash flows using current market rates for debts with similar remaining maturity, and hence would be categorised as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.   16   Contingent liabilities and commitments (a)   Indemnities are provided in the normal course of business to a number of directors and employees who provide tax and trust advisory services in connection with them acting as trustees/directors of client companies and providing other services. (b)   Capital expenditure authorised and contracted for at 30 June 2017 but not provided for in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements amounted to £2,074,000 (30 June 2016: £434,000; 31 December 2016: £4,430,000). The contractual amounts of the group's commitments to extend credit to its clients are as follows:             Unaudited 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited 31 December 2016 £'000     Guarantees       117        -        117      Undrawn commitments to lend of 1 year or less       22,644        22,146        25,661      Undrawn commitments to lend of more than 1 year       5,204        -        5,981              27,965        22,146        31,759      The fair value of the guarantees is £nil (30 June 2016 and 31 December 2016: £nil). (c)   The arrangements put in place by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) to protect depositors and investors from loss in the event of failure of financial institutions has resulted in significant levies on the industry in recent years. The financial impact of unexpected FSCS levies is largely out of the group's control as they result from other industry failures. There is uncertainty over the level of future FSCS levies as they depend on the ultimate cost to the FSCS of industry failures. The group contributes to the deposit class, investment fund management class and investment intermediation levy classes and accrues levy costs for future levy years when the obligation arises. 17   Consolidated interim statement of cash flows For the purposes of the consolidated interim statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise the following balances with less than three months until maturity from the date of acquisition:             Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     Cash and balances at central banks       1,480,932        960,115        1,075,673      Loans and advances to banks        147,714        105,629        83,844      Available for sale investment securities       124,287        83,623        103,557              1,752,933        1,149,367        1,263,074      Available for sale investment securities are amounts invested in money market funds which are realisable on demand. Cash flows arising from issue of ordinary shares comprise:             Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     Share capital issued (note 14)       27        12        128      Share premium on shares issued (note 14)       2,718        3,817        42,348      Shares issued in relation to share-based schemes for which no cash consideration was received       (437)       (1,043)       (1,631)     Shares issued in relation to business combinations       -        -        (646)             2,308        2,786        40,199      18   Related party transactions The key management personnel of the group are defined as the company's directors and other members of senior management who are responsible for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the group. Dividends totalling £204,000 were paid in the period (six months ended 30 June 2016: £122,000; year ended 31 December 2016: £302,000) in respect of ordinary shares held by key management personnel. As at 30 June 2017, the group had provided interest-free season ticket loans of £4,000 (30 June 2016: £3,000; 31 December 2016: £6,000) to key management personnel. At 30 June 2017, key management personnel and their close family members had gross outstanding deposits of £4,252,000 (30 June 2016: £4,104,000; 31 December 2016: £5,464,000) and gross outstanding loans of £723,000 (30 June 2016: £949,000; 31 December 2016: £959,000) which were made on normal business terms. A number of the company's directors and their close family members make use of the services provided by companies within the group. Charges for such services are made at various staff rates. One group subsidiary, Rathbone Unit Trust Management, has authority to manage the investments within a number of unit trusts. Another group company, Rathbone Investment Management International, acted as investment manager for a protected cell company offering unitised private client portfolio services. During the first half of 2017, the group managed 25 unit trusts, Sociétés d'investissement à Capital Variable (SICAVs) and open-ended investment companies (OEICs) (together, 'collectives') (six months ended 30 June 2016: 25 unit trusts and OEICs; year ended 31 December 2016: 27 unit trusts and OEICs). The group charges each fund an annual management fee for these services, but does not earn any performance fees on the unit trusts. The management charges are calculated on the bases published in the individual fund prospectuses, which also state the terms and conditions of the management contract with the group. The following transactions and balances relate to the group's interest in the unit trusts:          Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000       Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000     Total management fees      16,592     12,856     27,783              Unaudited 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited 30 June 2016 £'000     Audited 31 December 2016 £'000     Management fees owed to the group     2,931     2,183     2,557     Holdings in unit trusts (note 15)     2,513     1,082     1,864         5,444     3,265     4,421     Total management fees are included within 'fee and commission income' in the consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income. Management fees owed to the group are included within 'accrued income' and holdings in unit trusts are classified as 'available for sale equity securities' in the consolidated interim balance sheet. The maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount on the balance sheet as disclosed above. All amounts outstanding with related parties are unsecured and will be settled in cash. No guarantees have been given or received. No provisions have been made for doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by related parties. 19   Interest in unconsolidated structured entities As described in note 18, at 30 June 2017, the group owned units in collectives managed by Rathbone Unit Trust Management with a value of £2,513,000 (30 June 2016: £1,082,000; 31 December 2016: £1,864,000), representing 0.05% (30 June 2016: 0.03%; 31 December 2016: 0.05%) of the total value of the collectives managed by the group. These assets are held to hedge the group's exposure to deferred remuneration schemes for employees of Unit Trusts. The group's primary risk associated with its interest in the unit trusts is from changes in fair value of its holdings in the funds. The group is not judged to control, and therefore does not consolidate, the collectives. Although the fund trustees have limited rights to remove Rathbone Unit Trust Management as manager, the group is exposed to very low variability of returns from its management and share of ownership of the funds and is therefore judged to act as an agent rather than having control under IFRS 10. 20   Events after the balance sheet date An interim dividend of 22.0p per share was declared on 24 July 2017 (see note 6). There have been no other material events occurring between the balance sheet date and 24 July 2017.  Regulatory capital The group is classified as a banking group under the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and is therefore required to operate within the restrictions on capital resources and banking exposures prescribed by the Capital Requirements Regulation, as applied by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Regulatory own funds The group's regulatory own funds (excluding profits for the six months ended 30 June, which have not yet been independently verified, but including independently verified profits to 31 December) are shown in the table below:             Unaudited 30 June 2017 £'000       Unaudited 30 June 2016 £'000       Unaudited 31 December 2016 £'000     Share capital and share premium       145,271        103,880        142,526      Reserves       188,586        206,331        188,530      Less:                             - Own shares       (5,344)       (6,561)       (6,243)     - Intangible assets (net of deferred tax)       (162,589)       (169,582)       (166,414)     Total Common Equity Tier 1 capital       165,924        134,068        158,399      Tier 2 capital       16,498        15,456        15,804      Total own funds       182,422        149,524        174,203      Own funds requirements The group is required to hold capital to cover a range of own funds requirements, classified as Pillar 1 and Pillar 2. Pillar 1 - minimum requirement for capital Pillar 1 focuses on the determination of risk-weighted assets and expected losses in respect of the group's exposure to credit, counterparty credit, market and operational risks and sets a minimum requirement for capital. At 30 June 2017, the group's risk-weighted assets were £911,163,000 (30 June 2016: £837,975,000; 31 December 2016: £892,650,000). Pillar 2 - Supervisory review process Pillar 2 supplements the Pillar 1 minimum requirement with firm-specific Individual Capital Guidance (Pillar 2A) and a framework of regulatory capital buffers (Pillar 2B). The Pillar 2A own funds requirement is set by the PRA to reflect those risks, specific to the firm, which are not fully captured under the Pillar 1 own funds requirement. Pension obligation riskThe potential for additional unplanned costs that the group would incur in the event of a significant deterioration in the funding position of the group's defined benefit pension schemes. Interest rate risk in the banking bookThe potential losses in the non-trading book resulting from interest rate changes or widening of the spread between Bank of England base rates and LIBOR rates. Concentration risk Greater loss volatility arising from a higher level of loan default correlation than is assumed by the Pillar 1 assessment.  The group is also required to maintain a number of Pillar 2B regulatory capital buffers. Capital conservation buffer (CCB)The CCB is a general buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets designed to provide for losses in the event of a stress and is being phased in from 1 January 2016 to 1 January 2019. As at 30 June 2017, the buffer rate was 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. The CCB must be met with Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB)The CCyB is time-varying and is designed to act as an incentive for banks to constrain credit growth in times of heightened systemic risk. The amount of the buffer is determined by reference to rates set by the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) for individual countries where the group has credit exposures.  The buffer rate is currently set at zero for the UK, however non-zero rates for Norway, Sweden and Hong Kong, where the group has small relevant credit exposures, results in an overall rate of 0.02% of risk weighted assets for the group as at 30 June 2017. The FPC has announced that the rate will increase to 0.5%, with binding effect from 27 June 2018. Absent a material change in the outlook, it expects to increase the rate to 1.0% with effect from November 2018. The CCyB must be met with Common Equity Tier 1 capital.

Going concern basis of preparation Details of the group's results, cash flows and resources, together with an update on the risks it faces and other factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in this interim management report. Group companies are regulated by the PRA and FCA and perform annual capital adequacy assessments, which include the modelling of certain extreme stress scenarios. The group publishes Pillar 3 disclosures annually on its website, which provide further detail about its regulatory capital resources and requirements. During the first half of 2017, and as at 30 June 2017, the group was primarily equity-financed, with a small amount of gearing in the form of the Tier 2 debt. In 2017, the group has continued to grow client funds under management, both organically and through acquisition, and the group remains profitable. The directors believe that the company remains well-placed to manage its business risks successfully, despite an uncertain economic and political backdrop. As we believe that the group has, and is forecast to continue to have, sufficient financial and regulatory resources we continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the condensed consolidated interim financial statements. In forming our view, we have considered the company's prospects for a period exceeding 12 months from the date the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are approved. By Order of the Board Philip HowellChief Executive 24 July 2017  Independent review report Rathbone Brothers Plc We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2017 as set out on pages 6 to 25 which comprises the consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, consolidated interim statement of changes in equity, consolidated interim balance sheet, consolidated interim statement of cash flows and the related explanatory notes. We have read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of financial statements. This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the Company in meeting the requirements of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules ("the DTR") of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority ("the UK FCA"). Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached. Directors' responsibilities The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority. As disclosed in note 1, the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The condensed set of financial statements included in this half-yearly financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim Financial Reporting," as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review. Scope of review We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2017 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 as adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority.

Rathbone Brothers Plc  : Issue of Equity
Rathbone Brothers Plc   20 October 2016 THIS ANNOUNCEMENT (INCLUDING THE APPENDICES) IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER TO SELL OR ISSUE OR THE SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO BUY, SUBSCRIBE OR ACQUIRE ANY SECURITIES, INCLUDING THE PLACING SHARES, IN ANY JURISDICTION IN WHICH ANY SUCH OFFER OR SOLICITATION WOULD BE UNLAWFUL. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT (INCLUDING THE APPENDICES) AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS RESTRICTED AND IS NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN OR INTO, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (INCLUDING ITS TERRITORIES AND POSSESSIONS, ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA), AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN, JERSEY, THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION WOULD BE UNLAWFUL. Rathbone Brothers Plc ("Rathbones" or the "Company") Outcome of the Board's review of the Company's defined benefit pension schemesPlacing of 4.6% to raise approximately £38.0m  Current tradingThe Board of Rathbones has announced this morning the Company's trading update for the three months ended 30 September 2016 which demonstrates positive momentum in its business, with funds under management up 8.5% in the quarter, supported by favourable investment markets, net organic and acquired growth in Investment Management and strong net inflows in Unit Trusts. Further details of this trading update are contained in the separate announcement released this morning. Pensions reviewFurther to the announcement made in the group's interim results in July, the Board has concluded its review of the Company's two defined benefit pension schemes (the "DB Schemes") and in particular the larger Rathbone 1987 Scheme (the "1987 Scheme") which remains open to future service accrual. During 2016 the combined deficit in the DB Schemes has risen significantly, mainly driven by the valuation of scheme liabilities based on yields on long term corporate bonds. Those yields, which have been falling since the financial crisis, reduced significantly during the year and in particular since the outcome of the UK referendum on its membership of the EU on 23 June 2016.  Prior to this, the increase in the DB Schemes' liabilities was broadly matched by Company contributions and the growth of assets in the schemes. By way of illustration, the combined half-yearly IAS 19 funding position of the DB Schemes fluctuated between a £14m deficit and a £9m surplus between 2011 and 2015, and stood at a modest deficit of £4.5m at 31 December 2015.  The group's recent interim results showed a deficit of £32.0m as at 30 June 2016, and this rose further to £58.3m in the three months to 30 September 2016. Changes in the level of the DB Schemes' deficits under IAS19 directly impact the group's regulatory capital resources and the Company's distributable reserves. An elevated deficit position also constrains the group's strategic flexibility. The Board has therefore resolved to take action to mitigate the situation. In particular it has engaged with the 1987 Scheme's trustees and plans to consult with affected employees with respect to proposals to cap pensionable salaries and to close the scheme for future service accrual with effect from July 2017. Whilst the Laurence Keen Scheme (the "LK Scheme") is already closed to future accrual, the Board will also consult with those affected employees who are members of the LK Scheme with respect to a proposal to cap pensionable salaries with effect from July 2017. The consultation processes will last for a minimum period of 60 days although ultimate resolution may take longer. The Board will update the market on the progress of the consultation processes in due course. Whilst implementing these proposed actions is expected to generate a higher regulatory capital requirement in the near-term, the Board expects this to be more than outweighed by the following key benefits over the life of the DB Schemes: a reduction in the combined IAS19 deficit of the DB Schemes and therefore the Company's exposure to its future volatility;a reduction in ongoing required contributions and service costs associated with the DB Schemes; and a reduction in the rate of growth of regulatory capital required to support the DB Schemes. The PlacingThe Board has therefore decided to undertake a placing of 4.6% of the issued share capital to raise gross proceeds of approximately £38.0 million primarily to fund the near-term capital requirement and also to provide a measure of additional financial flexibility. The funds raised will remain on the Company balance sheet to be applied as the Board sees fit. It is not anticipated that there will be any immediate incremental contribution to the DB Schemes. The Board considers the proposed actions, including the Placing, to be appropriate to address the current situation and reduce future risks. Nonetheless it is possible that further actions will be required in the future as the Company will remain exposed to ongoing uncertainties related to the deficit position of the DB Schemes including (i) further possible corporate bond yield compression, (ii) the outcome of the engagement with the Trustees, the consultation with the DB Scheme members and the next triennial valuation of the DB Schemes (which will be carried out based on the financial position as at 31 December 2016); (iii) the resultant level of contributions required to address the deficit position in the future; and (iv) any regulatory capital implications associated with the above that might arise. Commenting on the proposed actions, Philip Howell, Chief Executive Officer said:'Rathbones has continued to perform well despite challenging industry conditions. We have conducted a review of our defined benefit pension arrangements in the context of the rising costs associated with our pension schemes. We concluded we needed to take the actions we have announced today and look forward to engaging successfully with the Trustees and our affected employees. The capital raising will enable us to progress these actions and support our continued future growth.' Placing detailsThe Company intends to issue 2,224,210 Placing Shares pursuant to the Placing, which is being conducted by means of an accelerated bookbuild process. The price per Placing Share is 1,710 pence to raise approximately £37.0 million, net of expenses. The Placing will be conducted by Peel Hunt and Canaccord Genuity in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Appendix to this announcement. The bookbuilding process will determine demand for and participation in the Placing. The bookbuilding will commence with immediate effect and the books are expected to close no later than 4.30pm on the date of this announcement. However, Peel Hunt and Canaccord Genuity reserve the right to close the books earlier or later without further notice. A further announcement will then be made following the completion of the bookbuilding process. The Placing is also subject to the conditions and termination rights set out in the Placing Agreement. The Placing Shares, when issued, will be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of the Company, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid after the date of issue. The Placing Shares represent an increase of approximately 4.6% of the current issued ordinary share capital of the Company. The Placing does not require any further Shareholder approval. Application has been made for the Placing Shares to be admitted to the premium listing segment of the Official List of the FCA and to be admitted to trading on the main market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange. Settlement for the Placing Shares and Admission are expected to take place on or before 8.00 a.m. on 25 October 2016. The Placing is conditional, among other things, upon Admission becoming effective.

By participating in the Placing, each Placee agrees with the Joint Bookrunners that the exercise of any right of termination or other discretion by the Joint Bookrunners (or either of them) under the Placing Agreement shall be within the absolute discretion of the Joint Bookrunners and that the Joint Bookrunners need not make any reference to the Placee in this regard and that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, neither Joint Bookrunner shall have any liability whatsoever to the Placee in connection with any such exercise. Upon such termination, the relevant Joint Bookrunner (if only one of the Joint Bookrunners terminates its obligations under the Placing Agreement or all of the parties to the Placing Agreement shall if both of the Joint Bookrunners terminate their obligations under the Placing Agreement) shall be released and discharged (except for any liability arising before or in relation to such termination) from their respective obligations under or pursuant to the Placing Agreement subject to certain exceptions. No prospectusNo offering document or prospectus has been or will be prepared in relation to the Placing and Placees' commitments will be made solely on the basis of the information contained in this document and any information previously published by or on behalf of the Company by notification to a Regulatory Information Service (as defined in the Listing Rules). Each Placee, by accepting a participation in the Placing, agrees that the content of this document is exclusively the responsibility of the Company and confirms to the Joint Bookrunners and the Company that it has neither received nor relied on any information, representation, warranty or statement made by or on behalf of either Joint Bookrunner (other than the amount of the relevant Placing participation in the oral confirmation given to Placees and the trade confirmation referred to below), any of their respective Affiliates, any persons acting on their behalf or the Company  and neither Joint Bookrunner nor any of their Affiliates, nor any persons acting on their behalf, nor the Company will be liable for the decision of any Placee to participate in the Placing based on any other information, representation, warranty or statement which the Placee may have obtained or received (regardless of whether or not such information, representation, warranty or statement was given or made by or on behalf of any such persons). By participating in the Placing, each Placee acknowledges to and agrees with the Joint Bookrunners for themselves and as agents for the Company that, except in relation to the information contained in this document, it has relied on its own investigation of the business, financial or other position of the Company in deciding to participate in the Placing. Nothing in this paragraph shall exclude the liability of any person for fraudulent misrepresentation. Registration and settlementSettlement of transactions in the Placing Shares (ISIN GB0002148343) following Admission will take place within the CREST system, subject to certain exceptions. The Joint Bookrunners reserve the right to require settlement for and delivery of the Placing Shares to Placees by such other means as the Joint Bookrunners respectively deem necessary if delivery or settlement is not possible or practicable within the CREST system within the timetable set out in this document or would not be consistent with the regulatory requirements in the Placee's jurisdiction.   Each Placee allocated Placing Shares in the Placing will be sent a trade confirmation stating the number of Placing Shares allocated to it, the Placing Price, the aggregate amount owed by such Placee to Canaccord Genuity or Peel Hunt (as the case may be) and settlement instructions.  It is expected that such trade confirmation will be despatched on 20 October 2016 and that this will also be the trade date. Each Placee agrees that it will do all things necessary to ensure that delivery and payment is completed in accordance with either the standing CREST or certificated settlement instructions which it has in place with Canaccord Genuity or Peel Hunt (as appropriate). It is expected that settlement will be on 25 October 2016 on a T+3 basis in accordance with the instructions set out in the trade confirmation. Interest is chargeable daily on payments not received from Placees on the due date in accordance with the arrangements set out above at the rate of 2 percentage points above the base rate of Barclays Bank Plc as determined by the Joint Bookrunners. Each Placee is deemed to agree that if it does not comply with these obligations, Canaccord Genuity and/or Peel Hunt may sell any or all of the Placing Shares allocated to the Placee on such Placee's behalf and retain from the proceeds, for its own account and profit, an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed by the Placee plus any interest due. The Placee will, however, remain liable for any shortfall below the aggregate amount owed by such Placee and it may be required to bear any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (together with any interest or penalties) which may arise upon the sale of such Placing Shares on such Placee's behalf. If Placing Shares are to be delivered to a custodian or settlement agent, the Placee should ensure that the trade confirmation is copied and delivered immediately to the relevant person within that organisation. Insofar as Placing Shares are registered in the Placee's name or that of its nominee or in the name of any person for whom the Placee is contracting as agent or that of a nominee for such person, such Placing Shares will, subject as provided below, be so registered free from any liability to PTM levy, stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. If there are any circumstances in which any other stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is payable in respect of the issue of the Placing Shares, neither Canaccord Genuity, Peel Hunt, nor the Company shall be responsible for the payment thereof. Placees will not be entitled to receive any fee or commission in connection with the Placing.

person has any duties or responsibilities to it for providing advice in relation to the Placing or in respect of any representations, warranties, undertakings or indemnities contained in the Placing Agreement or for the exercise or performance of any of the Joint Bookrunners' individual or joint rights and obligations thereunder, including any right to waive or vary any condition or exercise any termination right contained therein;undertakes that (i) the person whom it specifies for registration as holder of the Placing Shares will be (a) the Placee or (b) the Placee's nominee, as the case

simultaneously upon receipt of the Placing Shares in the Placee's stock account on a delivery versus payment basis;acknowledges that any agreements entered into by it pursuant to these terms and

Such agreement assumes that the Placing Shares are not being acquired in connection with arrangements to issue depositary receipts or to issue or transfer the Placing Shares into a clearance service. If there were any such arrangements, or the settlement related to other dealing in the Placing Shares, stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax may be payable, for which none of the Company nor the Joint Bookrunners will be responsible.

The Placee acknowledges that the money will not be subject to the protections conferred by the client money rules; as a consequence, this money will not be segregated from the Joint Bookrunners' money in accordance with the client money rules and will be used by the Joint Bookrunners in the course of their respective businesses; and the Placee will rank only as a general creditor of either of the Joint Bookrunners (as the case may be);acknowledges and understands that the Company, the Joint Bookrunners and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representations, warranties, agreements, undertakings and acknowledgements; andacknowledges that the basis of allocation will be determined by the Joint Bookrunners at their absolute discretion. The right is reserved to reject in whole or in part and/or scale back any participation in the Placing. The acknowledgements, agreements, undertakings, representations and warranties referred to above are given to the Company and each of the Joint Bookrunners  (for their own benefit and, where relevant, the benefit of their respective Affiliates and any person acting on  behalf of any such person), are irrevocable and will survive completion of the Placing. No UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax should be payable to the extent that the Placing Shares are issued or transferred (as the case may be) into CREST to, or to the nominee of, a Placee who holds those shares beneficially (and not as agent or nominee for any other person) within the CREST system and registered in the name of such Placee or such Placee's nominee. Any arrangements to issue or transfer the Placing Shares into a depositary receipts system or a clearance service or to hold the Placing Shares as agent or nominee of a person to whom a depositary receipt may be issued or who will hold the Placing Shares in a clearance service, or any arrangements subsequently to transfer the Placing Shares, may give rise to stamp duty and/or stamp duty reserve tax, for which neither the Company nor the Joint Bookrunners will be responsible and the Placee to whom (or on behalf of whom, or in respect of the person for whom it is participating in the Placing as an agent or nominee) the allocation, allotment, issue or delivery of Placing Shares has given rise to such stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax undertakes to pay such stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax forthwith and to indemnify on an after-tax basis and to hold harmless the Company and the Joint Bookrunners in the event that any of the Company and/or the Joint Bookrunners has incurred any such liability to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. In addition, Placees should note that they will be liable for any capital duty, stamp duty and all other stamp, issue, securities, transfer, registration, documentary or other duties or taxes (including any interest, fines or penalties relating thereto) payable outside the UK by them or any other person on the acquisition by them of any Placing Shares or the agreement by them to acquire any Placing Shares. All times and dates in this document may be subject to amendment.  Either or both of the Joint Bookrunners shall notify the Placees and any person acting on behalf of the Placees of any such changes. This document has been issued by the Company and is the sole responsibility of the Company. The rights and remedies of the Joint Bookrunners and the Company under these terms and conditions are in addition to any rights and remedies which would otherwise be available to each of them and the exercise or partial exercise or partial exercise of one will not prevent the exercise of others. Each Placee may be asked to disclose in writing or orally to either of the Joint Bookrunners: if he is an individual, his nationality; or  if he is a discretionary fund manager, the jurisdiction in which the funds are managed or owned.

Rathbone Brothers plc is a growth stock that could have far more to give

Alan Oscroft | Tuesday, 25th July, 2017 | More on:  ICP RAT








 


            Image: Public domain        

I’ve been looking at Rathbone Brothers (LSE: RAT), and the investment manager’s first-half results released Tuesday are making me sit up and pay close attention.
Rathbone shares have climbed by 52% since 2016’s low in October, to 2,667p (including a results-day 37p rise), and have doubled in price over the past five years.  The reason for that seems apparent from the company’s recent performance — we’ve seen earnings per share growing by 58% in just four years, with analysts forecasting a further 15% gain by the time we reach December 2018.
While the company spoke of “ongoing geopolitical uncertainty” which is currently dominating short-term market…

I’ve been looking at Rathbone Brothers (LSE: RAT), and the investment manager’s first-half results released Tuesday are making me sit up and pay close attention.
Rathbone shares have climbed by 52% since 2016’s low in October, to 2,667p (including a results-day 37p rise), and have doubled in price over the past five years.  The reason for that seems apparent from the company’s recent performance — we’ve seen earnings per share growing by 58% in just four years, with analysts forecasting a further 15% gain by the time we reach December 2018.
While the company spoke of “ongoing geopolitical uncertainty” which is currently dominating short-term market conditions, we did see underlying pre-tax profit rise by 22.7%, to £43.3m, in the first six months of the year.
Funds
The key long-term measure of confidence in an investment manger is its level of funds under management, and we saw a 7% rise to £36.6bn since December 2o16 — and seeing as the FTSE 100 put on only 2.4% over the same period, I’m impressed by that.
I would not place my own investment cash under the control of a professional manager, purely because I think my own simple strategy is effective enough without paying anyone else to do it for me. But there are many, from private investors to charities and pension funds, who need the services of companies like Rathbone — and I reckon buying shares in investment managers themselves can be very rewarding.
I see what might be thought of as contrarian safety here too — it’s when markets are at their most volatile that people turn more to respected professionals to manage their cash. 
And I see Rathbone Brothers as a well-managed and well-respected firm that should continue to do well.
Corporate finance
Financial services at all levels can be very profitable, and I’ve also been examining Intermediate Capital Group (LSE: ICP). The company provides capital for a variety of corporate needs, including IPO, management buyouts and similar.
The first quarter of this year has been pretty good, with inflows in the period of €0.6bn coupled with “robust demand for current fundraising“.
The firm did see a 2% drop in funds under management, to €23.3bn, in the three months, but it put that down to an “expected quieter quarter” and an adverse currency exchange impact on dollar-denominated funds among other things. But inflows in the second quarter are expected to be higher.
Outgoing chief executive Christophe Evain said: “Our expectation continues that this will be a strong fundraising year,” and that supports expectations of a good year this year.
One for the brave?
Intermediate Capital is in a volatile sector, and that can show through in erratic share price movements. But one thing I see as a long-term calming effect is the company’s progressive dividend.
It’s grown from 20p per share in 2013 to 27p this year, and though an impressive share price performance over that timescale has dropped the yield to 3.8%, we’re also looking at a trailing P/E of under 10. Dividend cover is strong, and I expect to see yields increasing nicely over time.
If you’re happy to handle short-term volatility without panicking (which I see as an essential characteristic of a growth investor), I really do see Intermediate Capital Group as having solid long-term potential.

Big money from growth shares
Growth shares like these can be very profitable, and the tempting pick uncovered in our Top Growth Share From The Motley Fool report has been raking in the cash for years.
The past five years have brought in double-digit annual earnings growth, and the City's experts are predicting two more years of solid growth ahead of us. On top of that, a progressive dividend policy adds an extra attraction to the mix.

 Underlying profit before tax up 22.7% to £43.3 million Philip Howell, Chief Executive of Rathbone Brothers Plc, said: "The first six months of 2017 has seen another busy period for Rathbones as we continue to deliver our strategic plans without detracting from our high standards of service to our clients. We remain confident in the medium term potential of our growth initiatives. Short term market conditions are dominated by a backdrop of ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and we will continue to invest with discipline."   Highlights:  Underlying profit before tax* increased 22.7% from £35.3 million to £43.3 million in the first six months of 2017. Underlying profit margin remained strong at 30.4% compared to 29.4% in 2016. Underlying earnings per share increased 21.1% to 68.4p (2016: 56.5p).  Profit before tax for the half year increased 16.7% from £22.8 million to £26.6 million, reflecting £15.8 million of costs associated with the London office move, offset by a plan amendment gain of £5.5 million arising from the closure of our defined benefit pension schemes. Basic earnings per share increased 16.5% to 41.6p (2016: 35.7p).  The board recommends a 22.0p interim dividend for 2017 (2016: 21.0p).   Total funds under management at 30 June 2017 were £36.6 billion, up 7.0% from £34.2 billion at 31 December 2016. This compared to an increase of 2.4% in the FTSE 100 Index and an increase of 2.7% in the MSCI WMA Private Investor Balanced Index over the same period.  Total net organic and acquired growth in the funds managed by Investment Management was £0.6 billion in the first six months of 2017, representing a net annual growth rate of 4.0% (2016: 4.2%). Net organic growth of £0.4 billion for the first half represents an underlying annualised rate of net organic growth of 2.9% (2016: 2.5%). In the period, we experienced higher outflows from low margin accounts and adjusting for this, the annualised net organic growth rate was 3.4%.  Underlying operating income in Investment Management of £127.4 million in the first six months of 2017 (2016: £108.8 million) was up 17.1%, largely due to growth in funds under management. The average FTSE 100 Index was 7322 on quarterly billing dates in 2017, compared to 6298 in 2016, an increase of 16.3%.  Underlying operating expenses of £99.1 million (2016: £84.9 million) increased 16.7% year-on-year largely as a result of variable staff costs, reflecting both the higher profitability in the period and an improved investment performance element for growth awards.  Funds under management in Unit Trusts were £4.6 billion at 30 June 2017 (31 December 2016: £4.0 billion). Net inflows were £269 million in the first half of 2017 (2016: £259 million). Underlying operating income in Unit Trusts was £14.9 million in the six months ended 30 June 2017, an increase of 30.7% from £11.4 million in the first half of 2016.  Shareholders equity of £342.4 million at 30 June 2017 increased 5.4% since 31 December 2016 (£324.8 million) and 22.4% since 30 June 2016 (£279.7 million), largely as a result of the fall in value of retirement benefit obligations, which totalled £20.0 million at 30 June 2017, 49.4% lower than the £39.5 million recorded at 31 December 2016.   * Excluding a plan amendment gain on the closure of the defined benefit pension schemes and charges in relation to client relationships and goodwill, acquisition-related costs and London head office relocation costs. 25 July 2017 For further information contact:  Rathbone Brothers PlcTel: 020 7399 0000email: shelly.patel@rathbones.com     Philip Howell, Chief ExecutivePaul Stockton, Finance DirectorShelly Patel, Investor Relations Manager    CamarcoTel: 020 3757 4984email: ed.gascoigne-pees@camarco.co.uk     Ed Gascoigne-Pees  Rathbone Brothers Plc  Rathbone Brothers Plc ("Rathbones"), through its subsidiaries, is a leading provider of high-quality, personalised investment and wealth management services for private clients, charities and trustees.

Our own funds under management grew 7.0% to reach £36.6 billion at 30 June 2017, benefitting from a combination of continued acquired and organic growth and these resilient conditions. This compares to a 2.4% increase in the FTSE 100 Index and a 2.7% increase in the MSCI WMA Private Investor Balanced Index.   Funds under management in our Investment Management business were £32.0 billion at 30 June 2017 (2016: £30.2 billion).  Investment Management net inflows were £0.6 billion in the first half (2016: £0.5 billion) representing a total annualised growth rate of 4.0% (2016: 4.2%).  Net organic growth totalled £0.4 billion up from £0.3 billion at 30 June 2016, equating to an annualised net organic growth rate of 2.9%. In the period, we experienced higher outflows from low margin accounts and adjusting for this, the annualised net organic growth rate was 3.4%. Purchased growth totalled £0.2 billion (2016: £0.2 billion), with nearly all investment managers set to meet or exceed their earn-out targets. Our charities business continued to perform well and retained the position of the second biggest investment management provider to the top 5,000 charities in the UK. Its funds under management grew 4.9% to £4.3 billion in the first six months of 2017. The market profile of our ethical business, Rathbone Greenbank Investments, continues to rise with funds under management increasing by 9.6% to reach £946 million in the first half.  Funds under management in our Unit Trusts business increased 15.0% from £4.0 billion at 31 December 2016 to £4.6 billion at 30 June 2017.  Positive markets and competitive investment performance helped to attract gross sales of £733 million compared to £576 million for the same period in 2016. In common with many in the industry, redemptions of £464 million were higher at the start of 2017 as investor concerns heightened, and many sought to realise gains. Whilst the lead up to and subsequent results of the UK election did have some adverse impacts in June, net inflows for the first half totalled £269 million compared to £259 million at 30 June 2016.  We continue to strive to provide high quality service to our clients and in May 2017, for the second year in a row, Rathbones was named both "Private Client Asset Manager of the Year (Institutional)" at the Citywealth awards and "Asset Manager of the Year" at the Better Society Awards. These awards recognise a continued excellence in client service, leadership and an overall contribution to the profession.  Underlying profit before tax up 22.7% to £43.3 million   Underlying profit before tax increased 22.7% to £43.3 million (2016: £35.3 million) in the first six months of 2017, representing an underlying profit margin of 30.4% (2016: 29.4%). Underlying earnings per share of 68.4p increased 21.1% from 56.5p in 2016.    Profit before tax for the half year of £26.6 million is 16.7% higher than the £22.8 million in 2016 and reflects £15.8 million of costs associated with the London office move (see note 3), offset by a plan amendment gain of £5.5 million arising from the closure of our defined benefit pension schemes with effect from 30 June 2017 (see note 13). Prior year profit before tax included charges of £4.4 million in respect of the acquisition of the Vision businesses. We are working hard to let our Curzon Street premises, though the rental market remains soft particularly in light of Brexit uncertainty.  Fee income of £105.5 million in the first half of 2017 increased 21.1% compared to the same period last year (2016: £87.1 million) reflecting positive markets and growth in organic and acquired new business over the period. The average FTSE 100 Index (calculated on our fee billing dates) was 7322, up 16.3% compared to 6298 a year ago.  Fee income represented 74.1% of total underlying operating income in the six months ended 30 June 2017 (2016: 72.5%), as our fee only tariff becomes more widely adopted, helping to support our move to higher quality fee-based income.   Net commission income of £21.9 million was up 12.3% from £19.5 million in the first half of 2016, reflecting more positive investing conditions and a strong first quarter in particular. Net interest income was relatively stable at £5.6 million in the first half (2016: £5.7 million), as higher liquidity largely offset the impact of lower base interest rates. As active investment managers, we remain focused on balancing risks and returns, and as a result saw overall cash weightings in portfolios rise to 7.1% compared to 6.6% a year ago reflecting a greater degree of uncertainty over future equity markets. Average deposits were £2.3 billion in the first half of the year compared to £1.7 billion a year ago. Client loans increased 8.7% to £115.5 million from £106.3 million at 31 December 2016. Fees from advisory services and other income increased 19.0% to £9.4 million (2016: £7.9 million) reflecting more positive flows from Vision following a slower period last year as the business completed a comprehensive file review exercise.  Underlying operating expenses of £99.1 million (2016: £84.9 million) increased 16.7% year-on-year. This was largely as a result of variable staff costs, which increased 32.3% to £25.8 million (2016: £19.5 million) reflecting both the higher profitability in the period and an improved investment performance element for growth awards. Variable staff costs as a percentage of underlying profit before variable staff costs also therefore increased to 37.3% (2016: 35.6%).  In line with our strategy, planned additions in headcount increased fixed staff costs by 11.2% to £44.7 million (2016: £40.2 million) and average headcount in the first half of 2017 was 1,123, up 7.5% compared to 1,045 a year ago. Other direct costs of £28.6 million (2016: £25.2 million) were up 13.5% as a result of higher property costs and planned project expenditure.  Our effective tax rate for the first half of 2017 was 21.1% (2016: 25.3%). The prior year rate was higher as a result of deferred payments to acquire the Vision businesses. Our interim dividend has been increased by 1p per share to 22p (2016: 21p) and will be paid on 3 October 2017.  Progress on growth strategy  Vision continues to gain momentum and now has £1.2 billion of funds under advice on its discretionary investment management panel, up 20.0% from the £1.0 billion at 31 December 2016, and 108 advisers, up from 99 at 31 December 2016. The business remains on track to grow to our target of 150 advisers and we remain confident in its growth prospects. Our distribution strategy continues to focus on promoting our discretionary investment management services to professional intermediaries, principally national and regional IFA networks. It continues to make good progress with net flows of £108 million in the first six months of the year, up 96.4% from £55 million at the same time last year. We continue to build our presence in the intermediary market as evidenced by a May 2017 Defaqto report which confirmed that the usage of Rathbones as a discretionary fund management provider to advisers had more than doubled in the last year, and  placed Rathbones very highly in the critical areas of  'Quality of investment staff' and 'Service'. We successfully launched an execution only Managed Portfolio Service in March 2017 which attracted £7.2 million of net flows in its first 3 months of launch. With the Credit Suisse partnership fully operational, the Rathbone Private Office was formally launched in January. The nucleus team of three senior client advisers and four support staff is making good progress in promoting this new advisory capability. This service is offered directly to super high net worth clients and family offices as well as seeking introductions from the professional intermediary market and from our own investment manager community. The team has already engaged its first clients and is developing an encouraging pipeline of prospective clients for the full year.   We continue to focus on improving our client experience and striving for greater operational efficiency in our support functions with the aim of creating additional capacity for growth. At the full year, we outlined our plans to spend an additional £1 million in 2017 to implement a new client relationship management system and improve our client take on processes. These plans are developing more quickly than originally planned and in light of more favourable investment conditions, we have chosen to bring forward capital expenditure originally planned for 2018 to the second half of this year in order to accelerate delivery and improve functionality through greater automation. This brings the total expected capital expenditure in relation to our client relationship management system and client take on process improvement to approximately £2 million in 2017.  Expenditure on the other growth strategies remains in line with expectations. The relocation of our London head office to 8 Finsbury Circus has proved very successful.   Financial position and regulatory capital  Shareholders' equity of £342.4 million at 30 June 2017 increased 5.4% since 31 December 2016 (£324.8 million) and 22.4% since 30 June 2016 (£279.7 million). This is largely as a result of the fall in value of retirement benefit obligations which totalled £20.0 million at 30 June 2017, 49.4% lower than the £39.5 million recorded at 31 December 2016. This reflected a high number of members transferring their benefits out of the scheme, a reduction in the assumed rates of improvement in longevity and breakage of the link between pension entitlements and final salaries. Triennial valuation discussions with trustees are ongoing and are expected to complete in the second half of the year.   Total assets at 30 June 2017 were £2,829.9 million (31 December 2016: £2,404.0 million; 30 June 2016: £2,344.8 million), of which £2,215.1 million (31 December 2016: £1,888.9 million; 30 June 2016: £1,860.0 million) represents the cash element of client portfolios that is held as a banking deposit. As a result of these higher levels of cash, balances with central banks increased from £1,075.7 million at 31 December 2016 to £1,480.9 million at 30 June 2017 (30 June 2016: £960.1 million). Our consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 18.2 % at 30 June 2017 (31 December 2016: 17.7%; 30 June 2016: 16.0%). Our consolidated leverage ratio was 6.2% at 30 June 2017 (31 December 2016: 6.6%; 30 June 2016: 6.2%). The capital surplus of own funds over the Pillar 1 and 2A requirements and CRD IV buffers was £69.9m at 30 June 2017 (excluding year to date post tax profits and improvements in the value of retirement benefit obligations) compared to £49.2m at 30 June 2016, largely reflecting the impact of additional equity raised in October 2016 offset by higher capital requirements.  Business risks  The board believes that the nature of the principal risks and uncertainties which may have a material effect on the group's performance during the remainder of its financial year remain unchanged from those identified in the strategic report and group risk committee report in our 2016 annual report and accounts (pages 18-25 and pages 80-81 respectively).   Regulatory changes   We continue to prepare for the changes brought on by MiFID II and the General Data Protection Regime and are working hard to ensure our people and systems are compliant. We anticipate that the cost of these projects will be approximately £1.5 million which will be absorbed by our normal expenditure budget for the year. We note the recommendations of the recent FCA Asset Management Market Report and the sequence of consultations prior to final implementation. While we broadly welcome the proposals, they will have an impact on margins of our Unit Trust business from 2018. In addition, as part of our implementation of MiFID II, research payments that have long been charged to our funds will, from 1 January 2018 be borne by the business. The impact of these changes will be significantly offset by a reduction in variable remuneration, some cost actions and by the continued funds growth momentum through this year and beyond. Fund box profits in our Unit Trust business for the six months ended 30 June 2017 were £1.8 million and research costs currently borne by the funds totalled approximately £0.5 million for the same period.   Board and senior management changes  Following the announcement of David Harrel stepping down after nine years on the board, we are pleased to announce that Sarah Gentleman has now completed the regulatory approval process and has formally succeeded David as the chairman of the remuneration committee.  Outlook  The first six months of 2017 has seen another busy period for Rathbones as we continue to deliver our strategic plans without detracting from our high standards of service to our clients. We remain confident in the medium term potential of our growth strategy. Short term market conditions are dominated by a backdrop of ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and we will continue to invest with discipline.    Mark Nicholls   Philip Howell  Chairman  Chief Executive   Consolidated interim statement of comprehensive incomefor the six months ended 30 June 2017        Note     Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000     Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000  Interest and similar income           6,323      7,141      13,890   Interest expense and similar charges           (723)     (1,394)     (2,319)  Net interest income           5,600      5,747      11,571   Fee and commission income           144,600      120,948      253,192   Fee and commission expense           (10,636)     (8,596)     (17,936)  Net fee and commission income           133,964      112,352      235,256   Net trading income           1,769      1,445      3,103   Gain on plan amendment of defined benefit pension schemes   13     5,523      -       -    Other operating income           1,041      657      1,353   Operating income           147,897      120,201      251,283   Charges in relation to client relationships and goodwill     10     (5,960)     (5,778)     (11,735)  Acquisition-related costs           (487)     (4,431)     (5,985)  Head office relocation costs     3     (15,769)     (2,257)     (7,031)  Other operating expenses           (99,095)     (84,910)     (176,403)  Operating expenses           (121,311)     (97,376)     (201,154)  Profit before tax           26,586      22,825      50,129   Taxation     5     (5,612)     (5,778)     (11,972)  Profit for the period attributable to                          equity holders of the company           20,974      17,047      38,157                              Other comprehensive income:                          Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss                          Net remeasurement of defined benefit liability           13,495      (29,080)     (37,318)  Deferred tax relating to the net remeasurement of defined benefit liability           (2,294)     4,535      5,936                              Items that may be reclassified to profit or loss                          Revaluation of available for sale investment securities:                          - net gain from changes in fair value           110     12      93   - net profit on disposal transferred to profit or loss during the year           (43)     -      -                67     12      93   Deferred tax relating to revaluation of available for sale investment securities           (11)     -      (14)  Other comprehensive income net of tax            11,257      (24,533)     (31,303)  Total comprehensive income for the period net of tax attributable to equity holders of the company           32,231     (7,486)     6,854                              Dividends paid and proposed for the period per ordinary share     6     22.0p     21.0p     57.0p  Dividends paid and proposed for the period           11,274     10,160     28,267                              Earnings per share for the period attributable to equity holders of the company:     7                    - basic           41.6p     35.7p     78.9p  - diluted           41.3p     35.4p     78.2p  The accompanying notes form an integral part of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements1     Basis of preparation Rathbone Brothers Plc ('the company') is the parent company of a group of companies ('the group') that provides personalised investment and wealth management services for private clients, charities and trustees. The group also provides financial planning, private banking, offshore fund management and trust administration services. The products and services from which the group derives its revenues are described in 'our services' on page 3 of the annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016 and have not materially changed since that date. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' as adopted by the EU. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, using the accounting policies, methods of computation and presentation set out in the group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 except as disclosed below. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the group's audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016, which are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU. The information in this announcement does not comprise statutory financial statements within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The comparative figures for the financial year ended 31 December 2016 are not the group's statutory accounts for that financial year. The group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 have been reported on by its auditors and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified and did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis. It also did not contain a statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. Developments in reporting standards and interpretations  Future new standards and interpretations A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations will be effective for future annual periods beginning after  1 January 2017 and, therefore, have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' and IFRS 16 'Leases' are expected to have the most significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group. IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'  IFRS 9 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2016. The group has not adopted this standard early. IFRS 9 changes the classification and measurement of financial instruments and the timing and extent of credit provisioning. The group has conducted a preliminary assessment of the potential impact, based on the profile of its financial instruments as at the balance sheet date, and is well advanced in its approach to classification and valuation. Classification of financial assets The basis of classification for financial assets under IFRS 9 is different from that under IAS 39. Financial assets will be classified into one of three categories: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale categories available under IAS 39 have been removed. In addition, the classification criteria for allocating financial assets between categories are different under IFRS 9. The group is well advanced in its classification of financial assets under the new standard. IFRS 9 uses the same measurement bases as IAS 39 and the group has not yet identified any material differences arising from applying the new standard. Debt securities currently classified as held to maturity will be classified as amortised cost. Other assets currently carried at amortised cost such as cash with central banks and loans and advances to banks and customers will also continue to be classified as such. Money market funds currently classified as available for sale will be classified as FVOCI, given that although they are generally held to collect contractual cash flows, they can be redeemed, should the need arise. Impairment of financial assets Under IFRS 9, an expected credit loss model replaces the incurred loss model, meaning there no longer needs to be a triggering event in order to recognise impairment losses. A provision must be made for the amount of any loss expected to arise over the life of the group's financial assets. Under IAS 39, credit losses are recognised when they incurred. Under the expected credit loss model, a dual measurement approach applies whereby a financial asset will attract a loss allowance equal to either 12 month expected credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses. The latter applies if there has been a significant deterioration in the credit quality of the asset. This will require considerable judgement as to how changes in economic factors affect expected credit losses, which will be determined on a probability-weighted basis. The group's trade receivables (including trust and financial planning debtors) are generally short term and does not contain significant financing components. Therefore, the group expects to apply the simplified approach and reflect lifetime expected credit losses. Treasury assets currently held by the group are of high credit quality and the group has not experienced any historical credit losses in its treasury or loan portfolios. Work conducted to date suggests that any impairment charges recognised in the financial statements under the new standard will be minimal. Classification of financial liabilities The basis of classification for financial liabilities under IFRS 9 remains unchanged from that under IAS 39. The two categories are amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss (either designated as such or held for trading) The group does not currently designate any liabilities as fair value through profit or loss, and do not anticipate doing so. Therefore, under IFRS 9, the group expects to classify all financial liabilities as amortised cost, with no material impact on measurement. IFRS 15 ' Revenue from Contracts with Customers'  IFRS 15 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2016. The group has not adopted this standard early. IFRS 15 changes how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers. The group will be required to identify all contracts it has with customers in order to determine whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. The group is in the process of quantifying the potential impact of adopting the standard, based on its existing revenue streams. In addition, the group is considering the impact on its policy of capitalising costs to secure investment management contracts. Net fee and commission income Included within net fee and commission income are initial fees, charged by a number of group companies in relation to certain business activities. Under IFRS 15, the group will be required to make an assessment as to whether the work performed to earn such fees constitutes the transfer of services and, therefore, fulfils any performance obligation(s). If so, then these fees can be recognised when charged; if not, then the fees can only be recognised in the period the services are provided. The group has not yet identified any other revenue streams that will be materially impacted by the new standard. Client relationship intangibles Where payments are made to new investment managers to secure investment management contracts, such costs are capitalised and amortised, where they are separable, reliably measurable and expected to be recovered, under IAS 18. IFRS 15 reinforces this view, stating that incremental costs of obtaining any contract with a customer shall be capitalised if the entity expects to recover those costs. Therefore, the group does not believe the adoption of IFRS 15 will materially change the way it accounts for client relationship intangibles. Transition The group plans to adopt IFRS 15 in its consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018, using the retrospective approach. IFRS 16 ' Leases' IFRS 16 is effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. The standard was endorsed by the EU during 2017. The group does not plan to adopt this standard early. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases. The group will be required to recognise all leases with a term of more than 12 months as a right-of-use lease asset on its balance sheet; the group will also recognise a financial liability representing its obligation to make future lease payments. The group has conducted an initial quantification of the impact of adopting the standard, based on its existing lease contracts. The most significant impact is in respect of its new London head office premises. Transition Definition of a lease On transition to IFRS 16, the Group can choose whether to:  - Apply the new definition of a lease to all its contracts as if IFRS 16 had always applied; or  - Apply a practical expedient and retain its previous assessments of which contracts contain a lease.  The group intends to apply the practical expedient and therefore will not be reassessing those contracts that are not deemed to contain a lease prior to the date of adoption. Retrospective approach As a lessee, the Group can either apply the standard using a: - Retrospective approach; or  - Modified retrospective approach with optional practical expedients.  The Group has assessed the impact of both approaches in relation to its existing lease contracts, and is most likely to apply the modified retrospective approach. Potential impact The group's total assets and total liabilities will be increased by the recognition of lease assets and liabilities. The lease assets will be depreciated over the shorter of the expected life of the asset and the lease term. The lease liability will be reduced by lease payments, offset by the unwinding of the liability over the lease term. On the group's statement of comprehensive income, the profile of lease costs will be front-loaded, at least individually, as the interest charge is higher in the early years of a lease term as the discount rate unwinds. The total cost of the lease over the lease term is expected to be unchanged. In addition to the above impacts, recognition of lease assets will increase the group's regulatory capital requirement. Lessor accounting Where the Group acts as an intermediate lessor in a sub-lease arrangement it will need to make adjustments for such leases.   2     Segmental information For management purposes, the group is organised into two operating divisions: Investment Management and Unit Trusts. Centrally incurred indirect expenses are allocated to these operating segments on the basis of the cost drivers that generate the expenditure; principally the headcount of staff directly involved in providing those services from which the segment earns revenues, the value of funds under management and the segment's total revenue. The allocation of these costs is shown in a separate column in the table below, alongside the information presented for internal reporting to the executive committee, which is the group's chief operating decision maker.

Geographic analysis The following table presents operating income analysed by the geographical location of the group entity providing the service:        Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000     Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000  United Kingdom     142,503      115,798      241,882   Jersey     5,394      4,403      9,401   Operating income     147,897      120,201      251,283   The group's non-current assets are substantially all located in the United Kingdom. Major clients The group is not reliant on any one client or group of connected clients for generation of revenues. At 30 June 2017, the group provided investment management services to 49,000 clients (30 June 2016: 48,000; 31 December 2016: 48,000).  3     Head office relocation On 6 January 2016, the group exchanged contracts for five 17-year leases for a total of 75,000 sq ft of office space at 8 Finsbury Circus. The group began recognising costs relating to rent and dilapidations on the new premises from the date the leases began, 13 May 2016. The move to the 8 Finsbury Circus office concluded on 13 February 2017, which triggered recognition of a provision for the net cost of the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street until the end of the existing lease (see note 11). During the six months to 30 June 2017, incremental costs of £15,769,000 (30 June 2016: £2,257,000; 31 December 2016: £7,031,000) were incurred as a result of the decision to move the head office to 8 Finsbury Circus. These incremental costs were as follows:        Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000     Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000  Rental costs for 8 Finsbury Circus prior to relocation     538      599      3,328   Accelerated depreciation charge for 1 Curzon Street     779      1,409      2,745   Provision for dilapidations     123      181      739   Net charge in relation to onerous lease provision (note 11)     13,807      -       -    Professional and other costs     522     68      219         15,769      2,257      7,031   4     Staff numbers The average number of employees, on a full time equivalent basis, during the period was as follows:        Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000     Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000  Investment Management:                    - investment management services     724      679      698   - advisory services     89      81      82   Unit Trusts     27      26      27   Shared services     283      259      259         1,123      1,045      1,066   5     Taxation The tax expense for the six months ended 30 June 2017 was calculated based on the estimated average annual effective tax rate. The overall effective tax rate for this period was 21.1% (six months ended 30 June 2016: 25.3%; year ended 31 December 2016: 23.9%).        Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000     Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000  United Kingdom taxation     5,527      4,805      11,953   Overseas taxation     179      92      236   Deferred taxation     (94)     881      (217)        5,612      5,778      11,972   The underlying UK corporation tax rate for the year ending 31 December 2017 is 19.2% (2016: 20.0%). The Finance Bill 2016 contained legislation to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 17.0% in April 2020 and was substantively enacted in September 2016. Deferred income taxes are calculated on all temporary differences under the liability method using the rate expected to apply when the relevant timing differences are forecast to unwind. 6     Dividends An interim dividend of 22.0p per share was declared on 24 July 2017 and is payable on 3 October 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 8 September 2017 (30 June 2016: 21.0p). In accordance with IFRS, the interim dividend has not been included as a liability in this interim statement. A final dividend for 2016 of 36.0p per share was paid on 16 May 2017.  7     Earnings per share Earnings used to calculate earnings per share on the bases reported in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements were:        Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017     Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016     Audited Year to 31 December 2016          Pre-tax £'000     Post-tax £'000     Pre-tax £'000     Post-tax £'000     Pre-tax £'000     Post-tax £'000  Underlying profit attributable to equity holders     43,279      34,457      35,291      27,020      74,880      59,064   Gain on plan amendment of defined benefit pension schemes (note 13)     5,523      4,460      -      -      -      -   Charges in relation to client relationships and goodwill (note 10)     (5,960)     (4,813)     (5,778)     (4,622)     (11,735)     (9,388)  Acquisition-related costs     (487)     (487)     (4,431)     (3,545)     (5,985)     (5,894)  Head office relocation costs (note 3)     (15,769)     (12,643)     (2,257)     (1,806)     (7,031)     (5,625)  Profit attributable to equity holders     26,586      20,974      22,825      17,047      50,129      38,157   Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing profit attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of shares in issue throughout the period, excluding own shares, of 50,403,394 (30 June 2016: 47,805,338 ; 31 December 2016: 48,357,728 ).

The move to 8 Finsbury Circus accounted for £2,760,000 (six months ended 30 June 2016: £1,457,000; year ended 31 December 2016: £9,900,000) of the amount capitalised in the six months ended 30 June 2017. No assets were disposed of in the six months ended 30 June 2017 (six months ended 30 June 2016 and year ended 31 December 2016: assets with net book value of £nil) with no resulting gain or loss on disposal (six months ended 30 June 2016: gain on disposal of £13,000; year ended 31 December 2016: gain on disposal of £16,000).  10   Intangible assets        Goodwill £'000     Client relationships £'000     Software development costs £'000     Purchased software £'000     Total Intangibles £'000  Cost                                At 1 January 2017     64,272      144,652      4,936      24,354      238,214   Internally developed in the period     -      -      392      -       392   Purchased in the period     -      1,596      -       1,677      3,273   Disposals     -       (1,061)     -       -       (1,061)  At 30 June 2017     64,272      145,187      5,328      26,031      240,818                                    Amortisation and impairment                                At 1 January 2017     807      47,451      4,037      18,727      71,022   Charge in the period     283      5,677      241      1,333      7,534   Disposals     -       (1,061)     -       -       (1,061)  At 30 June 2017     1,090      52,067      4,278      20,060      77,495   Carrying value at 30 June 2017 (unaudited)     63,182      93,120      1,050      5,971      163,323   Carrying value at 30 June 2016 (unaudited)     63,465      100,017      890      6,037      170,409   Carrying value at 31 December 2016 (audited)     63,465      97,201      899      5,627      167,192   The total amount charged to profit or loss in the period, in relation to goodwill and client relationships, was £5,960,000 (six months ended 30 June 2016: £5,778,000; year ended 31 December 2016: £11,735,000). A further £2,301,000 (six months ended 30 June 2016: £1,553,000; year ended 31 December 2016: £4,005,000) was expensed as staff costs during the period, representing amounts due for client relationships introduced more than 12 months after the cessation of any non-compete period. Impairment During the period, the group updated its assessment of goodwill allocated to the investment management, trust and tax and Rooper & Whately cash generating units (CGUs) for impairment. The recoverable amounts of goodwill allocated to the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. There was no indication of impairment of goodwill allocated to the investment management or Rooper & Whately CGUs during the period. The calculated recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to the trust and tax CGU at 30 June 2017 was £864,000, which was lower than the carrying value of £1,147,000 at 31 December 2016. The recoverable amount was calculated based on forecast earnings for the current year, extrapolated for a ten year period, assuming an annual decrease in revenues of 1.0% per annum (31 December 2016: decrease of 1.0% per annum). The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows was 14.0% (31 December 2016: 11.3%) as the group judges this discount rate appropriately reflects the market in which the CGU operates and, in particular, its small size. The group has therefore recognised an impairment charge of £283,000 during the period. This impairment has been included in the Investment Management segment in the segmental analysis (note 2). 11   Provisions for liabilities and charges        Deferred, variable costs to acquire client relationship intangibles £'000     Deferred and contingent consideration in business combinations £'000     Legal and compensation £'000     Property-related £'000     Total £'000                                   At 1 January 2016     13,392      3,908      721      1,795      19,816   Charged to profit or loss     -       -       855      306      1,161   Unused amount credited to profit or loss     -       (58)     (89)     -       (147)  Net charge to profit or loss     -       (58)     766      306      1,014   Other movements     4,783      48      -       -       4,831   Utilised/paid during the period     (7,902)     (2,258)     (421)     -       (10,581)  At 30 June 2016 (unaudited)     10,273      1,640      1,066      2,101      15,080   Charged to profit or loss     -       -       62      697      759   Unused amount credited to profit or loss     -       (21)     (397)     -       (418)  Net charge to profit or loss     -       (21)     (335)     697      341   Other movements     3,143      34      -       -       3,177   Utilised/paid during the period     (3,204)     (517)     (133)     -       (3,854)  At 1 January 2017 (audited)     10,212      1,136      598      2,798      14,744   Charged to profit or loss     -       -       93      16,105      16,198   Unused amount credited to profit or loss     -       -       -       -       -    Net charge to profit or loss     -       -       93     16,105     16,198  Other movements     1,597      (13)     -       -       1,584   Utilised/paid during the period     (4,820)     -       (46)     (2,968)     (7,834)  At 30 June 2017 (unaudited)     6,989      1,123      645      15,935      24,692                                    Payable within 1 year     5,118      -       645      5,528      11,291   Payable after 1 year     1,871      1,123      -       10,407      13,401   At 30 June 2017 (unaudited)     6,989      1,123      645      15,935      24,692   Deferred, variable costs to acquire client relationship intangibles Other movements in provisions relate to deferred payments to investment managers and third parties for the introduction of client relationships, which have been capitalised in the period. Deferred and contingent consideration in business combinations Deferred and contingent consideration of £1,123,000 (30 June 2016: £1,640,000; 31 December 2016: £1,136,000) is the present value of amounts payable at the end of 2019 in respect of the acquisition of Vision and Castle. Legal & compensation During the ordinary course of business the group may, from time to time, be subject to complaints, as well as threatened and actual legal proceedings (which may include lawsuits brought on behalf of clients or other third parties) both in the UK and overseas. Any such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the group incurring a liability. In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to the group's best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the relevant balance sheet date. The timing of settlement of provisions for client compensation or litigation is dependent, in part, on the duration of negotiations with third parties. Property-related Property-related provisions of £15,935,000 relate to dilapidation and onerous lease provisions expected to arise on leasehold premises held by the group (30 June 2016: £2,101,000; 31 December 2016: £2,798,000). The move to the 8 Finsbury Circus office was completed on 13 February 2017, which triggered the recognition of a provision for the net cost of the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street until the end of the existing lease. The ultimate amount of the provision is dependent on the timing of any subletting arrangement and the associated terms agreed with prospective third parties. Based on management's expectations of future costs for the premises and potential rental income, and timings thereof, on 13 February 2017, the group recognised a provision of £12,148,000 whilst releasing the unamortised portion of the rent free period and a landlord contribution totalling £2,148,000. Since the middle of February 2017, management have altered their expected timings of a potential sublet; this has led to a further charge of £3,807,000 being recognised. The group utilised £2,264,000 (30 June 2016 and 31 December 2016: £nil) of the onerous lease provision during the period, being the payment of rent, rates and service charge. Dilapidation provisions are calculated using a discounted cash flow model; during the six months ended 30 June 2017, dilapidation provisions decreased by £554,000 (30 June 2016: increased £306,000; 31 December 2016: increased £1,003,000). The group utilised £704,000 (30 June 2016 and 31 December 2016: £nil) of the dilapidations provision held for the surplus property at 1 Curzon Street during the period. The impact of discounting led to an additional £150,000 (30 June 2016: £306,000; 31 December 2016: £1,003,000) being provided for over the period. Amounts payable after 1 year Property-related provisions of £10,407,000 are expected to be settled within 19  years of the balance sheet date, which corresponds to the longest lease for which a dilapidations provision is being held. Provisions for deferred and contingent consideration in business  combinations of £1,123,000 are expected to be settled within three years of the balance sheet date. Remaining provisions payable after one year are expected to be settled within three years of the balance sheet date. 12   Subordinated loan notes        Unaudited 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited 30 June 2016 £'000     Audited 31 December 2016 £'000  Subordinated loan notes                    - Face value     20,000      20,000      20,000   - Carrying value     19,643      19,541      19,590   Subordinated loan notes consist of 10-year Tier 2 notes, which are repayable in August 2025, with a call option in August 2020 and annually thereafter.

For the purposes of calculating the pension benefit obligations, the following assumptions have been used:        Unaudited 30 June 2017 % p.a.     Unaudited 30 June 2016 % p.a.     Audited 31 December 2016 % p.a.

This has resulted in a plan amendment gain of £5,523,000 being recognised in operating income. The group made special contributions into its pension schemes of £1,750,000 during the period (30 June 2016: £1,936,000; 31 December 2016: £2,936,000). 14   Share capital and share premium The following movements in share capital occurred during the period:        Number of shares     Exercise price pence     Share capital £'000     Share premium £'000     Total £'000  At 1 January 2016    48,134,286           2,407      97,643      100,050   Shares issued:                                - in relation to business combinations      37,898     1,705.0     2      644      646   - to Share Incentive Plan     104,667     1,968.0 - 2,039.0     5      2,069      2,074   - to Save As You Earn scheme     102,319     934.0 - 1,641.0     5      1,104      1,109   At 30 June 2016 (unaudited)   48,379,170           2,419      101,460      103,879   Shares issued:                                - to Share Incentive Plan     65,510     1,934.0 - 2,264.0     4      1,190      1,194   - to Save As You Earn scheme     13,789     934.0 - 1,641.0     1      166      167   - on placing     2,224,210     1,710.0     111      36,830      36,941   Own shares sold     -     1,754.0 - 1,949.0     -      345      345   At 31 December 2016 (audited)   50,682,679           2,535      139,991      142,526   Shares issued:                                - to Share Incentive Plan     76,983     1,784.0 - 2,429.0     4      1,475      1,479   - to Save As You Earn scheme     85,838     984.0 - 1,648.0     4      1,243      1,247   - to Employee Benefit Trust     397,761     5.0      19      -      19   At 30 June 2017 (unaudited)   51,243,261           2,562      142,709      145,271   At 30 June 2017, the group held 672,909 own shares (30 June 2016: 376,273; 31 December 2016: 336,987). 15   Financial instruments The table below analyses the group's financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.   Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.   Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

There have been no transfers between levels during the period.   The fair value of listed equity securities is their quoted price. Money market funds are demand securities and changes to estimates of interest rates will not affect their fair value. The fair value of money market funds is their daily redemption value.  The fair values of the group's other financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values with the exception of the following:   Held to maturity debt securities comprise bank and building society certificates of deposit, which have fixed coupons. The fair value of debt securities at 30 June 2017 was £592,696,000 (30 June 2016: £727,395,000; 31 December 2016: £704,815,000) and the carrying value was £590,005,000 (30 June 2016: £725,000,000; 31 December 2016: £700,000,000). Fair value for held to maturity assets is based on market bid prices and hence would be categorised as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.   Subordinated loan notes (note 12) comprise Tier 2 loan notes issued in 2015. The fair value of the loan notes at 30 June 2017 was £20,604,000 (30 June 2016: £20,301,000; 31 December 2016: £19,578,000) and the carrying value was £19,643,000 (30 June 2016: £19,541,000; 31 December 2016: £19,590,000). Fair value of the loan notes is based on discounted future cash flows using current market rates for debts with similar remaining maturity, and hence would be categorised as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  16   Contingent liabilities and commitments (a)   Indemnities are provided in the normal course of business to a number of directors and employees who provide tax and trust advisory services in connection with them acting as trustees/directors of client companies and providing other services. (b)   Capital expenditure authorised and contracted for at 30 June 2017 but not provided for in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements amounted to £2,074,000 (30 June 2016: £434,000; 31 December 2016: £4,430,000). The contractual amounts of the group's commitments to extend credit to its clients are as follows:        Unaudited 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited 30 June 2016 £'000     Audited 31 December 2016 £'000  Guarantees     117      -      117   Undrawn commitments to lend of 1 year or less     22,644      22,146      25,661   Undrawn commitments to lend of more than 1 year     5,204      -      5,981         27,965      22,146      31,759   The fair value of the guarantees is £nil (30 June 2016 and 31 December 2016: £nil). (c)   The arrangements put in place by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) to protect depositors and investors from loss in the event of failure of financial institutions has resulted in significant levies on the industry in recent years. The financial impact of unexpected FSCS levies is largely out of the group's control as they result from other industry failures. There is uncertainty over the level of future FSCS levies as they depend on the ultimate cost to the FSCS of industry failures. The group contributes to the deposit class, investment fund management class and investment intermediation levy classes and accrues levy costs for future levy years when the obligation arises. 17   Consolidated interim statement of cash flows For the purposes of the consolidated interim statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise the following balances with less than three months until maturity from the date of acquisition:        Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000     Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000  Cash and balances at central banks     1,480,932      960,115      1,075,673   Loans and advances to banks      147,714      105,629      83,844   Available for sale investment securities     124,287      83,623      103,557         1,752,933      1,149,367      1,263,074   Available for sale investment securities are amounts invested in money market funds which are realisable on demand. Cash flows arising from issue of ordinary shares comprise:        Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000     Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000  Share capital issued (note 14)     27      12      128   Share premium on shares issued (note 14)     2,718      3,817      42,348   Shares issued in relation to share-based schemes for which no cash consideration was received     (437)     (1,043)     (1,631)  Shares issued in relation to business combinations     -      -      (646)        2,308      2,786      40,199   18   Related party transactions The key management personnel of the group are defined as the company's directors and other members of senior management who are responsible for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the group. Dividends totalling £204,000 were paid in the period (six months ended 30 June 2016: £122,000; year ended 31 December 2016: £302,000) in respect of ordinary shares held by key management personnel. As at 30 June 2017, the group had provided interest-free season ticket loans of £4,000 (30 June 2016: £3,000; 31 December 2016: £6,000) to key management personnel. At 30 June 2017, key management personnel and their close family members had gross outstanding deposits of £4,252,000 (30 June 2016: £4,104,000; 31 December 2016: £5,464,000) and gross outstanding loans of £723,000 (30 June 2016: £949,000; 31 December 2016: £959,000) which were made on normal business terms. A number of the company's directors and their close family members make use of the services provided by companies within the group. Charges for such services are made at various staff rates. One group subsidiary, Rathbone Unit Trust Management, has authority to manage the investments within a number of unit trusts. Another group company, Rathbone Investment Management International, acted as investment manager for a protected cell company offering unitised private client portfolio services. During the first half of 2017, the group managed 25 unit trusts, Sociétés d'investissement à Capital Variable (SICAVs) and open-ended investment companies (OEICs) (together, 'collectives') (six months ended 30 June 2016: 25 unit trusts and OEICs; year ended 31 December 2016: 27 unit trusts and OEICs). The group charges each fund an annual management fee for these services, but does not earn any performance fees on the unit trusts. The management charges are calculated on the bases published in the individual fund prospectuses, which also state the terms and conditions of the management contract with the group. The following transactions and balances relate to the group's interest in the unit trusts:     Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited Six months to 30 June 2016 £'000     Audited Year to 31 December 2016 £'000  Total management fees    16,592   12,856   27,783      Unaudited 30 June 2017 £'000   Unaudited 30 June 2016 £'000   Audited 31 December 2016 £'000  Management fees owed to the group   2,931   2,183   2,557  Holdings in unit trusts (note 15)   2,513   1,082   1,864    5,444   3,265   4,421  Total management fees are included within 'fee and commission income' in the consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income. Management fees owed to the group are included within 'accrued income' and holdings in unit trusts are classified as 'available for sale equity securities' in the consolidated interim balance sheet. The maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount on the balance sheet as disclosed above. All amounts outstanding with related parties are unsecured and will be settled in cash. No guarantees have been given or received. No provisions have been made for doubtful debts in respect of the amounts owed by related parties. 19   Interest in unconsolidated structured entities As described in note 18, at 30 June 2017, the group owned units in collectives managed by Rathbone Unit Trust Management with a value of £2,513,000 (30 June 2016: £1,082,000; 31 December 2016: £1,864,000), representing 0.05% (30 June 2016: 0.03%; 31 December 2016: 0.05%) of the total value of the collectives managed by the group. These assets are held to hedge the group's exposure to deferred remuneration schemes for employees of Unit Trusts. The group's primary risk associated with its interest in the unit trusts is from changes in fair value of its holdings in the funds. The group is not judged to control, and therefore does not consolidate, the collectives. Although the fund trustees have limited rights to remove Rathbone Unit Trust Management as manager, the group is exposed to very low variability of returns from its management and share of ownership of the funds and is therefore judged to act as an agent rather than having control under IFRS 10. 20   Events after the balance sheet date An interim dividend of 22.0p per share was declared on 24 July 2017 (see note 6). There have been no other material events occurring between the balance sheet date and 24 July 2017.  Regulatory capital The group is classified as a banking group under the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and is therefore required to operate within the restrictions on capital resources and banking exposures prescribed by the Capital Requirements Regulation, as applied by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Regulatory own funds The group's regulatory own funds (excluding profits for the six months ended 30 June, which have not yet been independently verified, but including independently verified profits to 31 December) are shown in the table below:        Unaudited 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited 30 June 2016 £'000     Unaudited 31 December 2016 £'000  Share capital and share premium     145,271      103,880      142,526   Reserves     188,586      206,331      188,530   Less:                    - Own shares     (5,344)     (6,561)     (6,243)  - Intangible assets (net of deferred tax)     (162,589)     (169,582)     (166,414)  Total Common Equity Tier 1 capital     165,924      134,068      158,399   Tier 2 capital     16,498      15,456      15,804   Total own funds     182,422      149,524      174,203   Own funds requirements The group is required to hold capital to cover a range of own funds requirements, classified as Pillar 1 and Pillar 2. Pillar 1 - minimum requirement for capital Pillar 1 focuses on the determination of risk-weighted assets and expected losses in respect of the group's exposure to credit, counterparty credit, market and operational risks and sets a minimum requirement for capital. At 30 June 2017, the group's risk-weighted assets were £911,163,000 (30 June 2016: £837,975,000; 31 December 2016: £892,650,000). Pillar 2 - Supervisory review process Pillar 2 supplements the Pillar 1 minimum requirement with firm-specific Individual Capital Guidance (Pillar 2A) and a framework of regulatory capital buffers (Pillar 2B). The Pillar 2A own funds requirement is set by the PRA to reflect those risks, specific to the firm, which are not fully captured under the Pillar 1 own funds requirement. Pension obligation riskThe potential for additional unplanned costs that the group would incur in the event of a significant deterioration in the funding position of the group's defined benefit pension schemes. Interest rate risk in the banking bookThe potential losses in the non-trading book resulting from interest rate changes or widening of the spread between Bank of England base rates and LIBOR rates. Concentration risk Greater loss volatility arising from a higher level of loan default correlation than is assumed by the Pillar 1 assessment.  The group is also required to maintain a number of Pillar 2B regulatory capital buffers. Capital conservation buffer (CCB)The CCB is a general buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets designed to provide for losses in the event of a stress and is being phased in from 1 January 2016 to 1 January 2019. As at 30 June 2017, the buffer rate was 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. The CCB must be met with Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB)The CCyB is time-varying and is designed to act as an incentive for banks to constrain credit growth in times of heightened systemic risk. The amount of the buffer is determined by reference to rates set by the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) for individual countries where the group has credit exposures.  The buffer rate is currently set at zero for the UK, however non-zero rates for Norway, Sweden and Hong Kong, where the group has small relevant credit exposures, results in an overall rate of 0.02% of risk weighted assets for the group as at 30 June 2017. The FPC has announced that the rate will increase to 0.5%, with binding effect from 27 June 2018. Absent a material change in the outlook, it expects to increase the rate to 1.0% with effect from November 2018. The CCyB must be met with Common Equity Tier 1 capital. PRA bufferThe PRA also determines whether any incremental firm-specific buffer is required, in addition to the CCB and the CCyB. The PRA requires any PRA buffer to remain confidential between the group and the PRA. The group's own funds requirements were as follows:        Unaudited 30 June 2017 £'000     Unaudited 30 June 2016 £'000     Unaudited 31 December 2016 £'000  Own funds requirement for credit risk     38,729      36,630      36,859   Own funds requirement for market risk     -      -      389   Own funds requirement for operational risk     34,164      30,407      34,164   Pillar 1 own funds requirement     72,893      67,037      71,412   Pillar 2A own funds requirement     28,105      27,285      27,898   Total Pillar 1 and 2A own funds requirement     100,998      94,322      99,310   CRD IV buffers:                    - Capital conservation buffer (CCB)     11,390      5,237      5,579   - Countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB)     182      754      357   Total Pillar 1 and 2A own funds requirement and CRD IV buffers     112,570     100,313      105,246    Statement of directors' responsibilities in respect of the interim statement Confirmations by the board We confirm to the best of our knowledge that:   the condensed set of financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' as adopted by the EU;   the interim management report includes a fair view of the information required by:    DTR 4.2.7R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, being an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the condensed set of financial statements; and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year; and   DTR 4.2.8R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, being related party transactions that have taken place in the first six months of the current financial year and that have materially affected the financial position or performance of the entity during that period; and any changes in the related party transactions described in the last annual report that could do so.   Going concern basis of preparation Details of the group's results, cash flows and resources, together with an update on the risks it faces and other factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in this interim management report. Group companies are regulated by the PRA and FCA and perform annual capital adequacy assessments, which include the modelling of certain extreme stress scenarios. The group publishes Pillar 3 disclosures annually on its website, which provide further detail about its regulatory capital resources and requirements. During the first half of 2017, and as at 30 June 2017, the group was primarily equity-financed, with a small amount of gearing in the form of the Tier 2 debt. In 2017, the group has continued to grow client funds under management, both organically and through acquisition, and the group remains profitable. The directors believe that the company remains well-placed to manage its business risks successfully, despite an uncertain economic and political backdrop. As we believe that the group has, and is forecast to continue to have, sufficient financial and regulatory resources we continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the condensed consolidated interim financial statements. In forming our view, we have considered the company's prospects for a period exceeding 12 months from the date the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are approved. By Order of the Board Philip HowellChief Executive 24 July 2017  Independent review report Rathbone Brothers Plc We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2017 as set out on pages 6 to 25 which comprises the consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, consolidated interim statement of changes in equity, consolidated interim balance sheet, consolidated interim statement of cash flows and the related explanatory notes. We have read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of financial statements. This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the Company in meeting the requirements of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules ("the DTR") of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority ("the UK FCA"). Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached. Directors' responsibilities The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority. As disclosed in note 1, the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The condensed set of financial statements included in this half-yearly financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim Financial Reporting," as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review. Scope of review We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2017 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 as adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority.
