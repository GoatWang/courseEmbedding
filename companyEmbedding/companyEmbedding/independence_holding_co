                    Who We Are

                    For over 30 years, the member companies of The IHC Group have provided health, life,
                    disability, dental, vision, short term medical and hospital indemnity
                    insurance solutions to individuals and groups.
                    

                    Through product innovation and committed relationships with our policyholders, we
                    have built a strong, successful insurance organization. 
                    




Our products

Dental and vision


                Individual and group dental plans are a low-cost option for those looking to supplement 
                their major medical coverage or offer employees a value-added benefit. Plans provided by The IHC Group allow you 
                to choose your own providers or to choose from an extensive PPO network with more than 130,000 
                providers nationwide. 
                Dental and vision for individuals can be purchased separately or as a bundled plan.

                usually lasts for as few as 30 days and up to 364 days in some states.

Supplemental insurance


            Health insurance deductibles and out-of-pocket costs can take a toll on your savings
            should an unexpected medical event occur to you or someone in your family. Metal
            Gap plans are bundled insurance benefits that can cover the cost of your deductible
            should an accident, critical illness or hospital confinement take place, reducing
            the burden and stress from your wallet.

                pays you a lump sum cash benefit when a covered medical condition is diagnosed.
                You choose how to spend the money, whether for lost income, mortgage or child care
                payments.
