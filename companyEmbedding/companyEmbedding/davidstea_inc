DAVIDsTEA Inc. Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Financial Results






GlobeNewswire



Jun 7, 2017 4:01 PM EDT













 


















































   First quarter sales increase of 9.4% to C   $48.7    million   Announces Departure of Chief Financial Officer, Luis Borgen, in July 2017  MONTREAL, June 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DAVIDsTEA Inc. (Nasdaq:DTEA) today announced financial results for the three months April 29, 2017.   For the three months ended April 29, 2017:   Sales increased by 9.4% to C$48.7 million from C$44.5 million a year ago. Comparable sales decreased by 5.7%. Gross profit increased by 4.3% to C$24.2 million from C$23.2 million, while gross profit as a percent of sales decreased to 49.7% from 52.1%. The decrease in gross profit as a percent of sales was driven by additional promotional activity, a shift in product sales mix and the adverse impact from the stronger U.S. dollar on U.S. dollar denominated purchases. Net loss was C$(0.4) million compared to net income of C$1.5 million. Adjusted net income (loss), a non-IFRS measure, which excludes the impact of onerous contracts in the first quarter of 2017 (see Reconciliation of IFRS basis to Adjusted net income (loss) table), was C$(1.1) million compared to C$1.5 million. Fully diluted income (loss) per common share was C$(0.01) compared to C$0.06. Adjusted fully diluted income (loss) per common share, a non-IFRS measure, which is adjusted net income (loss) on an adjusted fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding basis (see Reconciliation of fully diluted weighted average common shares outstanding table), was C$(0.04) per share compared to C$0.06 per share.  DAVIDsTEA President and Chief Executive Officer, Joel Silver, stated, "Our first quarter sales trends remained challenging as we continued to work through our excess inventory position. Total sales were up close to 10%. As well, the year-over-year gross profit margin decline was less than anticipated. Since taking over as CEO in late March, I have confirmed my belief that DAVIDsTEA is highly recognized, is known for quality and innovation, and has a very solid retail concept. But there is considerable work to be done to reinvigorate the overall business and get back to the core of the DAVIDsTEA brand. We are encouraged with the initial progress we are making against our strategic priorities that are centered around improving the product assortment, in-store experience and raising the bar on our e-commerce platform during this reset year. Our overriding objective is to make the tea core experience better for our customers and ensure that the DAVIDsTEA brand can realize its full potential."

Ratios valuation of DAVIDsTEA, Inc, ( DTEA | CAN)The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio (also called EBITDA multiple or enterprise multiple) is a well-known company valuation metric that compares a company's overall value to its operational earning power. The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio is very commonly used for business valuation as it indicates whether a company may be undervalued or overvalued compared to industry peers. The EV/EBITDA NTM ratio is a more precise measure than the P/E ratio because it takes into account both the company pure operational earning measure (EBITDA vs. Net Profit) and a company overall value indicator that also includes financial debt, cash position and minority interests which are key indicators when valuing a firm market value.

There are many standard financial ratios used in order to evaluate a business or a company. Financial ratios can also be used by managers within a firm, by current and potential shareholders (owners) of a firm, and by a firm's creditors. Security analysts use financial ratios to compare the strengths and weaknesses of various companies. In Infinancials, financial ratios are categorized according to the financial aspect of the business that the ratio measures:- Growth ratios measure the company's rate of growth and assess the potential for future growth. E.g. Net Sales Growth, EBITDA Growth, EBIT Growth.- Profitability ratios measure the returns generated on sales and investment, hence the ability of the company to generate profits.Profitability ratios include margin ratios (such as profit margin or operating margin) and return ratios (such as return on equity or return on assets).- Capital structure and liquidity ratios measure the extent to which the company is relying upon debt to fund its operations, and its ability to pay back the debt. Capital structure ratios include debt to equity and debt to asset ratios, and liquidity ratios include coverage ratios and solvency ratios.- Asset utilization ratios, also called activity or efficiency ratios, measure how efficiently the company's day to day operations are managing inventory, selling and producing products, or using assets to generate revenue.Financial ratios allow for comparisons between companies, between industries and also between a single company and its industry average or peer group average.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Financial ResultsGlobeNewswire•June 7, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareFirst quarter sales increase of 9.4% to C$48.7 millionAnnounces Departure of Chief Financial Officer, Luis Borgen, in July 2017MONTREAL, June 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DAVIDsTEA Inc. (DTEA) today announced financial results for the three months April 29, 2017.For the three months ended April 29, 2017:Sales increased by 9.4% to C$48.7 million from C$44.5 million a year ago. Comparable sales decreased by 5.7%.Gross profit increased by 4.3% to C$24.2 million from C$23.2 million, while gross profit as a percent of sales decreased to 49.7% from 52.1%. The decrease in gross profit as a percent of sales was driven by additional promotional activity, a shift in product sales mix and the adverse impact from the stronger U.S. dollar on U.S. dollar denominated purchases.Net loss was C$(0.4) million compared to net income of C$1.5 million. Adjusted net income (loss), a non-IFRS measure, which excludes the impact of onerous contracts in the first quarter of 2017 (see Reconciliation of IFRS basis to Adjusted net income (loss) table), was C$(1.1) million compared to C$1.5 million.Fully diluted income (loss) per common share was C$(0.01) compared to C$0.06. Adjusted fully diluted income (loss) per common share, a non-IFRS measure, which is adjusted net income (loss) on an adjusted fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding basis (see Reconciliation of fully diluted weighted average common shares outstanding table), was C$(0.04) per share compared to C$0.06 per share.DAVIDsTEA President and Chief Executive Officer, Joel Silver, stated, “Our first quarter sales trends remained challenging as we continued to work through our excess inventory position. Total sales were up close to 10%. As well, the year-over-year gross profit margin decline was less than anticipated. Since taking over as CEO in late March, I have confirmed my belief that DAVIDsTEA is highly recognized, is known for quality and innovation, and has a very solid retail concept. But there is considerable work to be done to reinvigorate the overall business and get back to the core of the DAVIDsTEA brand. We are encouraged with the initial progress we are making against our strategic priorities that are centered around improving the product assortment, in-store experience and raising the bar on our e-commerce platform during this reset year. Our overriding objective is to make the tea core experience better for our customers and ensure that the DAVIDsTEA brand can realize its full potential.”Other financial metricsSelling, general and administration expenses (“SG&A”) increased to C$24.2 million from C$21.1 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 49.6% from 47.5%. Adjusted SG&A, a non-IFRS measure, which excludes the impact of onerous contracts in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 (see Reconciliation of IFRS basis to Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses), increased to C$25.6 million from C$21.1, due primarily to the hiring of additional staff to support the growth of the Company, including new stores, and higher store operating expenses to support the operations of 232 stores as of April 29, 2017 as compared to 198 stores as of April 30, 2016. As a percent of sales, adjusted SG&A increased to 52.6% from 47.5%.Results from operating activities were C$0.0 million as compared to C$2.0 million.

We will also concentrate on re-energizing the existing U.S. store base. U.S. new store growth will be up to five stores, as we will be selective in any new undertakings to ensure those we do open deliver higher returns.“As previously stated, fiscal 2017 will be a reset year and as such, we will not be issuing quarterly and annual guidance through 2017. We will re-evaluate this at the appropriate time. We remain focused on the mid-term vision and realignment of DAVIDsTEA as we implement the needed strategic initiatives to make the core tea experience better and deliver enhanced shareholder returns,” commented Mr. Silver.Chief Financial Officer DepartureThe Company also announced today that Chief Financial Officer, Luis Borgen, has notified the company that he will be leaving, effective July 31, 2017, to pursue other interests. DAVIDsTEA has begun a comprehensive search for its next CFO.Mr. Silver continued, “On behalf of everyone at DAVIDsTEA, I would like to thank Luis for his leadership and many contributions over the last five years. He played an integral role in taking DAVIDsTEA public two years ago and has been instrumental in instilling financial and cost discipline at the Company. We wish him well in his future endeavors.”Conference Call Information:A conference call to discuss the first quarter Fiscal 2017 financial results is scheduled for today, June 7, 2017, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted fully diluted income (loss) per share are not presentations made in accordance with IFRS, and the use of the terms Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted fully diluted income (loss) per share may differ from similar measures reported by other companies. We believe that Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted fully diluted income (loss) per share provide investors with useful information with respect to our historical operations. We present Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted fully diluted income (loss) per share as supplemental performance measures because we believe they facilitate a comparative assessment of our operating performance relative to our performance based on our results under IFRS, while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period-to-period. Specifically, Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted fully diluted income (loss) per share allow for an assessment of our operating performance, including new store costs, without the effect of non-cash charges of the period or other one-time charges, such as depreciation, amortization, finance costs, deferred rent, non-cash compensation expense, costs related to onerous contracts or contracts where we expect the costs of the obligations to exceed the economic benefit, gain (loss) on derivative financial instruments, loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment of property and equipment, and certain non-recurring expenses. These measures also function as benchmarks to evaluate our operating performance. Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss), and Adjusted fully diluted income (loss) per share are not measurements of our financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, net cash provided by operating, investing or financing activities or any other financial statement data presented as indicators of financial performance or liquidity, each as presented in accordance with IFRS. We understand that although Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss), and Adjusted fully diluted income (loss) per share are frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, they have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are:Read MoreAdjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss), and Adjusted fully diluted income (loss) per share do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and   Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.Because of these limitations, Adjusted selling, general and administration expenses, Adjusted results from operating activities, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss), and Adjusted fully diluted income (loss) per share should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.Forward-Looking Statements:This press release includes forward-looking statements.
