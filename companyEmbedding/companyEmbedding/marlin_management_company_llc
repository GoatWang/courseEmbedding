Product Management Assessments 

Our Product Management Assessments can help take your company or team to the next level!
Get A Free Estimate
Product Management is one of the most important strategic functions in a company. Great Product Management leads to more successful and more profitable products, happier customers and long-term winning strategies to conquer markets. It also ensures that your company doesn’t waste money developing, marketing and selling products that don’t meet customer needs and should not have been built in the first place.
Optimal Product Process Assessment
Our Product Management Assessments ensure that you have the following elements in place:

An effective product process (as lightweight as possible for your culture)
A great team who understands their role and is trained to perform at a high level of competence
Excellent standardized tools and templates to ensure that deliverables can be created quickly
Systems in place for ongoing company improvements/learning and leveraged collaboration

The 280 Group Product Management Assessments are a service where we do an in-depth analysis of the Product Management function at your company (process, people and tools), provide concrete recommendations for dramatically improving its effectiveness, and assist you with implementing key changes. By working with the 280 Group, you can ensure that you are implementing best practices and that product management will help drive your company’s overall success.
To perform the Product Management Assessments, the 280 Group assigns a team of senior consultants to work with your company. Our rapid and thorough assessment will provide you with a plan to dramatically improve Product Management at your company in a short period of time.
Let the 280 Group help you build a plan to optimize your company’s Product Management function
The deliverable for the assessment is:

Presentation to stakeholders and/or executive staff

LOS ANGELES, July 9, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Marlin Management Company, LLC ("Marlin"), a global investment firm, is pleased to announce the first and final closing of Marlin Equity IV, L.P. ("Fund IV"), with $1.6 billion of capital commitments. Fund IV completed its fundraise at its hard-cap in just over four months and was more than three times oversubscribed from its initial $1 billion target. 
Consistent with Marlin's predecessor funds, Fund IV will invest in businesses that can benefit from the firm's significant capital base, deep industry relationships and extensive network of operational resources. It will focus on industries where Marlin has developed extensive domain expertise, including technology, business services, healthcare, consumer and manufacturing, among others. 
Marlin has closed four private equity funds since its inception in 2005 and has more than $2.6 billion of capital under management. The limited partners in Fund IV include some of the world's largest and most sophisticated investors, including leading sovereign wealth funds, public and private pension funds, endowments and foundations, insurance companies, fund of funds and family offices. 
"We are pleased with the extraordinary level of support that we received from such a prestigious group of global investors," said David McGovern, Managing Partner of Marlin. "The successful fundraise is a clear endorsement of our operationally focused investment strategy and reflects our ability to deliver superior returns to our investors and partners." 
Peter Spasov, a Partner at Marlin, added, "In just over three years, we have more than doubled our assets under management. To have accomplished this in a difficult fundraising environment speaks to the quality of our team, our innovative and disciplined investment strategy, and the strength of our past performance across economic cycles." 
The closing of Fund IV follows a very active year for Marlin. Since the beginning of 2012, Marlin has acquired over 15 businesses, including six corporate divestitures, and has achieved five successful exits to strategic buyers. Additionally, the firm established a London office to further strengthen its European presence. 
Bruce Ettelson and Karin Orsic of Kirkland & Ellis LLP served as legal counsel and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC acted as an advisor and exclusive placement agent for Fund IV. 
About Marlin Equity Partners      Marlin Equity Partners is a global investment firm with over $2.6 billion of capital under management. The firm is focused on providing corporate parents, shareholders and other stakeholders with tailored solutions that meet their business and liquidity needs. Since its inception, Marlin, through its group of funds and related companies, has successfully completed over 65 acquisitions. The firm is headquartered in Los Angeles, California with an additional office in London. For more information, please visit www.marlinequity.com.

Product Management Assessments 

Our Product Management Assessments can help take your company or team to the next level!
Get A Free Estimate
Product Management is one of the most important strategic functions in a company. Great Product Management leads to more successful and more profitable products, happier customers and long-term winning strategies to conquer markets. It also ensures that your company doesn’t waste money developing, marketing and selling products that don’t meet customer needs and should not have been built in the first place.
Optimal Product Process Assessment
Our Product Management Assessments ensure that you have the following elements in place:

An effective product process (as lightweight as possible for your culture)
A great team who understands their role and is trained to perform at a high level of competence
Excellent standardized tools and templates to ensure that deliverables can be created quickly
Systems in place for ongoing company improvements/learning and leveraged collaboration

The 280 Group Product Management Assessments are a service where we do an in-depth analysis of the Product Management function at your company (process, people and tools), provide concrete recommendations for dramatically improving its effectiveness, and assist you with implementing key changes. By working with the 280 Group, you can ensure that you are implementing best practices and that product management will help drive your company’s overall success.
To perform the Product Management Assessments, the 280 Group assigns a team of senior consultants to work with your company. Our rapid and thorough assessment will provide you with a plan to dramatically improve Product Management at your company in a short period of time.
Let the 280 Group help you build a plan to optimize your company’s Product Management function
The deliverable for the assessment is:

Presentation to stakeholders and/or executive staff
Summary of findings
Recommendations
In-depth plans for additional work to execute the recommendations.
