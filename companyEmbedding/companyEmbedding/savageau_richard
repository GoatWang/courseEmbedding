5.0 out of 5 starsBest book of its type--be sure to get the latest editionByRo Maon December 8, 2013We have bought several editions of this book over the years in preparation for retirement. Coming from the northeast US we found that warm weather was our main criterion in selecting our retirement location, and this book provides a wealth of information related to weather and its seasonal variations. However, the book goes on to provide detailed information about many other criteria:  health services, crime rate, cost of living, real estate, quality of life, etc., all of which are important decision-making components.My wife and I have been retired in FL for 6 years and, while the warm climate is still very important to us, we find that health services are of increasing concern. Our small community has limited and relatively low-rated health services and facilities, though we have found an internist we really like. However, the local hospitals and specialty doctors are, to put it nicely, ranked in the middle of all of the medical quality ratings. The nearest bigger cities, which have better facilities and services, are about 2 hours away, and the very best medical services and facilities are in the biggest cities, which are 3-4 hours away.We are fortunate that our health is relatively good, but if we ever have to face serious illness (heart attack, cancer), I know we will wish we were closer to top medical care.

3.0 out of 5 starsThe Pre-Crash publication makes this of limited valueByRobert Princeon November 30, 2011I purchased this book, and not for the first time, when my wife and I set off in January 2010 in an RV, looking for a new place to call home.  The almanac's concept is a good one: It breaks down all that make one city more "livable" than another, such as climate, housing costs, transportation, crime, and so on, then determines criteria in which to evaluate the different metropolitan areas around the United States.  In some areas, the statistics are fairly cut and dried, in others, there's plenty of room for interpretation.If not for the crash of December 2007, this almanac would still be very valuable.  But the changes have been so great in the last few years that the almanac is rendered useless in some areas. In the areas of climate, crime, health care, education and transportation, it is still pretty accurate.  But the information that may matter most to you (it does to us!) about the outlook for job prospects and housing costs, have become nearly useless.  For instance, the first statistic under housing is the increase in average home values between 1st quarter 2000 and 4th quarter 2006.  You can imagine how useless this information is, since in the last five years, some areas have suffered a drastic loss in home values.If you are looking to relocate, I would still purchase this guide while keeping in mind the areas in which this guide is still relevant, and which areas it isn't.  And consider other resources- some magazines will do a "Best Places to Live" article from time to time.

I just wish the data was a bit more up to date-- they don't publish these books as often as they need to-- especially since the "real estate boom & bust" in U. S. real estate.  I would recommend, but with the cautions mentioned above.  The data is very detailed and put into logical categories and the format is easy to understand.  As I said, the book needs updating, but the research is always solid by this author.0Comment|

The book is big and will take a lot of going through, but the information is laid out good and is easily accessible.  I really loved this book.  I purchased other books along with this one for my husband and I as we start to plan our retirement (that is about 11 years away).... and although I know information might change, it gives us a starting point as to where we think we might want to spend our golden years.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsGreat information in an easy to navigagte formatByJack Larixon September 6, 2010Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis book rates 354 metropolitan areas across the United States. It is an outstanding reference for municipal managers, planners, developers, or businesses to see how a given community stacks up against others around the nation. The authors rate a variety of community factors including crime, job growth, and education. Additionally, the book (although dated) can provide a quick "order of magnitude" estimate of the comparative size of various populated areas. Since a great deal of the information is census based, I anticipate another edition coming out in the next year or so. I find this book to be very helpful at putting the size and demographics of communities in perspective with the rest of the country.0Comment|

The comparison covers nine different areas: ambience, housing, jobs, recreation, transportation, health care, education, climate and crime. It also has a preference questionnaire, to enable the reader to determine the relative importance to the reader that each of these nine areas has. I am looking forward to purchasing an updated version of this almanac when it is available.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Okladekon May 17, 2010Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseWant to make a big move in this beautiful country?  Unsure which portion of the West Coast you would like to be?  Does the weather mean more to you than the length of your commute?  Do potential jobs matter more than sports teams?  Then this is your tool!I have moved cross country a number of times.  I am looking to do it again in the next year.  I want a good clue of what to expect without having to spend money on airline tickets and spending months on research of the local economy.This book has it all... How much will housing cost me?  How bad is the crime? Will I be living with the heater on for 6 months and the a/c the other six months of the year? I would never plan a move again with out these books (this is my third edition.)0Comment|

I found this one, which I bought for my adult children's benefit, to be even more helpful and fact filled. In the absence of facts, their "ideal re-lo" destination could well have become a nightmare, if not for the guidance gained from the Classic Guide. .0Comment|

What People are Saying About This


From the Publisher
". . . you’ll find a number of books that rate and rank places as regions or communities. However, for [retirement], the most complete is from the famous wanderer, David Savageau.--Richard Bolles and John Nelson, What Color is Your Parachute? For Retirement (2007)"When I came across Savageau’s book, I was awed by the extraordinary amount of research that went into its creation. As a reporter who has spent his life gathering information, I could appreciate the effort involved."--Stan Hinden, How to Retire Happy (2006)" . . . the lowdown on terrific, affordable places to spend your retirement."--Jordan Goodman, Everyone’s Money Book on Retirement Planning (2002)"The great resource not only explains the most important retirement location considerations, but it rates big and small towns on key components. Savageau’s new book is the best in its field."--Robert J. Bruss, Tribune Media Services, August 1999
