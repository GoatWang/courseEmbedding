Innovu LLC, former Pepperweed Consulting CEO Patrick Stewart’s new startup, has moved to Station Square and is ramping up hiring.
The company has taken the fifth floor, which is 11,400 square feet, in the Landmarks Building, Stewart said. The company employs 15 and wants to grow to 35 here by year-end, largely by hiring data analytics and health care industry professionals.
