        Trustee's jokes put UR in awkward spot

Paul B. Queally





























































A major benefactor and trustee of the University of Richmond has been caught on tape making sexist and homophobic jokes that are putting his alma mater in an awkward spot.Paul Queally — whose name is on a 33,000-square-foot addition to the Robins School of Business and will be on a new gateway building for the campus — is quoted in a New York Magazine article as telling the jokes two years ago during the induction ceremony for a secret Wall Street fraternity called Kappa Beta Phi.Queally did not return a call seeking comment, but he emailed a statement through a representative Wednesday that said the jokes do not reflect his views or values, and that “on reflection” he should not have made them.The article by Kevin Roose, titled “One-Percent Jokes and Plutocrats in Drag: What I Saw When I Crashed a Wall Street Secret Society,” describes Queally’s exchange with another private-equity executive during a skit that was surreptitiously recorded at the black-tie event.According to Roose’s article, Queally made the jokes about Hillary Clinton and Barney Frank, a now retired openly gay member of Congress, as part of a skit involving new Kappa Beta Phi inductees, who were dressed in leotards and gold-sequined skirts and wigs.The article, with accompanying audio, touched a nerve at UR, which has an administrator specifically to oversee programs related to sexual diversity and to support the LGBTQ community.In his statement, Queally said the event was “a private function where all participants were expected to dress in costume and make silly, outrageous comments. Writers were engaged.”The statement added: “My brief remarks were in the spirit of the event but they do not reflect my views or my values. On reflection I should have said nothing. I understand that people who do not know me or my work may misinterpret what I said. I believe my record in support of education, diversity and economic advancement defines who I am and what I stand for.”Queally, co-president of the Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe investment firm, is a 1986 UR alumnus. With his wife, Anne-Marie, also a UR graduate, he has given the university nearly $20 million. Their recent donation of $10 million will help finance a center for admission and career services that will serve as the new gateway to campus.At UR, some are now questioning whether Queally’s name should be on the welcome center, said Peter Kaufman, a professor in the Jepson School of Leadership Studies.“It would be a shame to see his name closely associated with the first thing prospective students see when they come to the university,” Kaufman said.Asked for reaction, the university released a statement from Rector Charles A. Ledsinger Jr. that said the board “reaffirms the commitment of each of its members to promoting opportunity, inclusivity, civility and respect.”In his New York Magazine piece, Roose writes that he slipped into the January 2012 event at the St. Regis Hotel in New York as part of research for his newly published book “Young Money.”Before he was discovered and ejected, he observed some of the world’s top investors dining on rack of lamb and foie gras and hearing the legend of Kappa Beta Phi, a secret fraternity founded at the beginning of the Great Depression “as a sort of one-percenter’s Friars Club,” Roose writes.He quotes the fraternity’s leader, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, as telling the new initiates that the group was started in 1929 by “four C+ William and Mary students.” Its crest depicts a “macho right hand in a proper Savile Row suit and a Turnbull and Asser shirtsleeve.”Roose quotes Ross as saying the crest was superior to that of its namesake, Phi Beta Kappa, whose ruffled-sleeve logo Ross called a “tacit confession of homosexuality.”
Phi Beta Kappa – actually founded by five College of William and Mary students in 1776 -- is not the only reference to Virginia higher education in the article.Among those named as members of Kappa Beta Phi is Paul Tudor Jones, the University of Virginia alumnus whose comments at a U.Va. symposium last year were denounced as sexist by some faculty members.Jones’ remark that women lose interest in their finance careers when they have babies was officially disavowed by the university.The year before, Jones was embroiled in U.Va.’s leadership crisis when he backed the board in its unsuccessful attempt to fire the president — prompting debate over how much influence a major donor might have in a university’s direction.On a different level, that issue also surfaced at UR when the university dropped the men’s soccer and track programs to make room for Division I lacrosse.Amid the dispute, longtime UR backer Bobby Ukrop resigned from the board. Queally was among those supporting the decision to add lacrosse.kkapsidelis@timesdispatch.com(804) 649-6119

On the University of Richmond’s panel: (from left to right) Herbert McDade III, Alan Breed, Michael Walrath and Paul Queally

Fewer regulations; easier immigration policies for skilled workers; and more education in science, technology and math — that seemed to be the overarching remedy for the economy (and a wish list for the Trump administration) from a panel of three investment and finance professionals and one tech industry businessman who spoke at the University of Richmond this week.The semiannual “Word on Wall Street” forum, hosted by UR’s Robins School of Business on Wednesday, drew about 160 students, businesspeople and other guests.The panel discussion focused on how President Donald Trump’s decisions and policies may affect the national and global economies, but the conversation ranged much more broadly to include such issues as workforce preparedness.A so-called “Trump bump” that sparked stock markets on the prospect of lower taxes and fewer regulations seems to be cooling off now, as the reality of the political situation in Washington sets in, the panelists said.Paul Queally, the moderator of the panel and co-president of investment firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, gave a somewhat grim summation of the current economic fundamentals, citing slowing productivity, sluggish gross domestic product, underfunded pensions, and a concentration of wealth.“The big picture in the economy is we spend more than we collect and we have been doing it for an awfully long time, and it does not look like that is abating,” Queally said.“Another big picture is that growth continues to slow,” he said, referring to GDP growth that seems to be stuck in a torpid growth pattern slower than most of the past 60 years, despite a low inflation environment.Queally and other panelists, including Alan Breed, president and portfolio manager of Edgewood Management, and Herbert McDade III, managing partner of River Birch Capital, put much of the blame on federal regulatory burdens, which they said have only expanded for decades.“It is a significant burden but, more than that, it is a significant deterrent to starting businesses,” Breed said. “I think there is hope that President Trump will roll some of this back.”Immigration policy was a key issue emphasized by panelist Michael Walrath, a University of Richmond graduate and co-founder of several successful tech ventures, including Right Media and Moat.
Walrath said that despite Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric, innovative companies need to be able to recruit talented people from all over the world. When it comes to technology, “immigration is not part of the problem, it is part of the solution,” he said.A tech company of 300 employees may have three foreign workers who are “absolutely essential for the mission of that company,” and their work supports 297 other jobs, he said.The panelists seemed to agree that a lack of workforce preparedness in such fields as science and technology is exacerbating what Queally described as a growing concentration of wealth among a smaller percentage of the population.“Unfortunately, our students in America lack STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) skills,” Queally said. “The top 1 percent seems almost unstoppable. More and more wealth is getting concentrated in the hands of the few, as it is a knowledge economy.”

Alumni couple donates $6 million for Robins School of Business addition
November 16, 2007
		  The University of Richmond has received a $6 million gift from an alumni couple to be used toward construction of an addition to the Robins School of Business building, complemented by new programs and curricular enhancements focusing on finance. 
Paul B. Queally and Anne-Marie Flinn Queally of New Canaan, Conn., both 1986 Phi Beta Kappa graduates of Richmond, made the contribution through their Paul and Anne-Marie Queally Family Foundation. The Queallys are long-time benefactors of the university, having supported several major projects and programs including the Gottwald Center for the Sciences, athletics and an endowed faculty chair.
The 33,000-square-foot addition is expected to be completed by the end of 2010 and will be named Queally Hall. 
Along with the construction of Queally Hall, the Robins School plans to implement new elective courses in finance that will be team-taught by a faculty member and practitioners from the financial services industry; market update seminars that will keep students abreast of the latest trends and developments in the national and global finance world; a Wall Street "Fast Track" program providing internships and mentors at sponsoring firms for five competitively chosen freshmen; a distinguished speaker series to bring national figures in finance and business to the school for visits and presentations; and a pilot of an intensive program that, over the course of a weekend, will immerse students in activities and introduce them to communications and negotiation methods and other skills to prepare them for professions in the corporate arena. 
"As a student, alumnus and trustee, I have always valued the emphasis that the University of Richmond places on its students," said Paul Queally. "Anne-Marie and I wanted to give back to the university in a way that enabled it to provide more value to its students. We believe in the Robins School vision and that the new addition will enable the dean and faculty to offer new programming, initiatives and resources which will enhance the student experience and better prepare them for their futures."
"This gift will make a big difference to the University of Richmond," said UR President Ed Ayers.  "Paul and Anne-Marie's gift provides us with the space, opportunity, and incentive to build on the wonderful legacy of the Robins School."
Paul Queally, who received his undergraduate degree cum laude in business economics and an MBA from Columbia University, is co-president of the investment firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, which he joined in 1996 as general partner.  He began his career as an analyst at the New York investment banking firm Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ). He rose to vice president before becoming a general partner of the venture capital company Sprout Group, a DLJ affiliate. 
Queally has been active in Richmond alumni activities and served on the university's Board of Trustees from 2000-07. He also served on the Business School Executive Advisory Council from 2002-03. He is a member of the board of Spider Management Company, which oversees the investment of the university's endowment.
Anne-Marie Flinn Queally, who graduated from Richmond summa cum laude with an economics and French double major, worked as a marketing representative for IBM and budget and financial analyst for Morgan Guaranty Trust before leaving the corporate world to raise the couple's three children.
Queally Hall will facilitate collaboration between students and faculty, encourage a sense of community through creative use of common spaces, support hands-on discovery-based learning through centers and laboratories, and enhance connections between the Robins School and the local and global business communities. The addition will house classrooms, offices, meeting spaces, a 225-seat auditorium, a marketing research lab and a simulated capital markets trading room. 
"Paul Queally has been a supporter and a leader in the evolution of the Robins School of Business to become one of the best business schools in the country," said Robins School Dean Jorge Haddock. "Now the Queallys are enabling us to achieve our vision for the future. The new building addition will provide us with the opportunity to expand our programs and equip our students still better for their professions."
For the last two years, BusinessWeek magazine has ranked the Robins School as one of the top 25 undergraduate business programs in the country. This year, BusinessWeek also named the school's MBA program to its list of "The Best Part-Time MBA Programs" in the country, ranking it 14th.
