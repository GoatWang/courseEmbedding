For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund, Franklin Large Cap Equity Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin Ultra-Short California Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.

Title: Natural vegetation of Oregon and Washington.
Author: Franklin, Jerry F.; Dyrness, C.T.; 
Date: 1973
Source: Gen. Tech. Rep. PNW-GTR-008. Portland, OR: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. 427 p
Publication Series: General Technical Report (GTR)
Description: Major vegetational units of Oregon and Washington and their environmental relationships are described and illustrated. After an initial consideration of the vegetation components in the two States, major geographic areas and vegetation zones are detailed. Descriptions of each vegetation zone include composition and succession, as well as discussion of variations associated with environmental gradients. Three chapters treat the forested zones found in the two States. Major emphasis is on the distinctive mesic temperate forests found in western Washington and northwestern Oregon. The interior valley forests, shrub lands, and prairies found between the Coast and Cascade Ranges in western Oregon are treated in a single chapter as are subalpine and alpine mosaics of tree-dominated and meadow communities. Unusual habitats, such as areas of recent vulcanism, serpentines, and ocean strand, are individually described. Soils, geology, and climate are considered in broad outline in an early chapter and in greater detail within discussions of individual geographic areas and vegetation zones. Appendices are included for definition of the various soil types, scientific and common plant names, and a subject index. An extensive bibliography is included to direct the reader to other references.
Keywords: vegetation,  Washington,  Oregon,  plant communities,  plant succession,  soils,  geology Publication Notes:

Module11 - Franklin Bio              Behind the Scenes: Forest & Forest Product Research        Home         > Table of Contents>        Module 11 > Franklin Bio > Next           Worksheet 3: Biography (Student Page)  Jerry F. FranklinJerry Forest Franklin was born in Waldport , Oregon on October 27, 1936. He loved the forest at a young age, and it is said that by age nine he knew he wanted to grow up to be a forester. Franklin did just that. He received both his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Forest Management from Oregon State University . Then in 1966 he completed his PhD in Botany and Soils from Washington State University .Dr. Franklin has been a researcher for the Forest Service and at academic institutions since 1959. He became a research forester for the USDA Forest Service in 1959. He worked as a forest researcher at the Corvallis , Oregon Research Station, and the Coniferous Forest Biome International Biological Program. While working as a forester he challenged the practice of clear-cutting and instead offered logging solutions that were more science based. His new forestry strategy taught management practices of leaving logs and other wood debris, standing dead trees and some larger live trees when logging an area. While his new ideas were met at first with uncertainty within the timber industry, eventually they were accepted by environmentalists and timber companies alike. He has conducted numerous long-term experiments designed to help forest science for years to come. He has studied old-growth forests, natural disturbances in forests (such as fire) and the recovery process of forest ecosystems (how forest recover after a disturbance such as logging or wildfires).Image 1:  Jerry F. Franklin in an Old Growth Forest in the Pacific Northwest. Dr. Franklin has spent more than 40 years studying old-growth forests, primarily in the Pacific Northwest. He has been a researcher for the USDA Forest Service, at Oregon State University and the University of Washington . He was the program director of the Wind River Canopy Crane Research Facility. He has served on many local, national and global commissions dedicated to the analyses of forest issues. He was on the national boards of The Nature Conservancy and The Wilderness Society. Dr. Franklin has written over 300 scientific articles and books.
