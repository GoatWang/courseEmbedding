Biochemistry, not Petrochemistry
Founded in 2010, Lygos is providing biotechnology solutions for today’s renewable chemical challenges. We engineer microbes to convert sugars into high-value, industrial chemicals, targeting compounds where biological production is cost-advantaged over petrochemical production. 






Full-Stack Biotechnology
Lygos' technology goes beyond engineering microbes and includes fermentation and purification development. Our goal is to manufacture and sell chemicals. This work has been supported, in part, by over $6.5MM in grants from the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and National Science Foundation.

Our Products





Lygos' First Product: Bio-Malonic Acid
For the last 75-years malonic acid has been produced from cyanide and chloroacetic acid, two costly and environmentally hazardous chemicals. The petrochemical production process has restricted market growth. Lygos' technology uses sugar and water, opening the door to new applications.

Our Technology | Malonic Acid






We produce bio-advantaged chemicals
Bio-advantaged chemicals are those where petrochemistry cannot compete with biochemistry, where biological production provides a compelling economic or technical advantage over existing chemical syntheses.






Our Technology

Thought Leadership

The Resurgence of Industrial Biotech 

Our target products are the specialty chemicals of today that can grow into the commodity chemicals of tomorrow. The primary hurdles restricting market growth of these chemicals is their current high production cost or environmentally hazardous production process. We address both these problems using a low-cost microbial fermentation technology, enabling over $25B in downstream value to be unlocked using our technology.
We make our products using commercially proven, acid-tolerant yeast. We have developed a suite of high-throughput engineering technologies that enable us to rapidly prototype and optimize our microbes, enabling low-cost, rapid technology scaleup.
Many of our target products are organic acids, compounds that are expensive to synthesize using petrochemistry but can be produced at high theoretical yield microbially. A high yielding process means less sugar is required to produce each kilogram of product, decreasing operating costs and lowering exposure to changing raw material (e.g., corn) prices. For some compounds, a theoretical yield greater than 100% can be achieved by sinking carbon dioxide. Low operating costs is a fundamental reason why microbial production of organic acids (e.g., itaconic, lactic, citric, and succinic acids) has been more successful than biofuels (e.g., farnesane, bio-diesel, butanol, and ethanol).

Malonic Acid

Malonic acid is a C3-dicarboxylic acid currently used as an intermediate in the synthesis of numerous flavors, fragrances and pharmaceuticals.
While capable of being used in a wider variety of applications, demand has been held back by malonic acid’s environmentally hazardous, expensive production process. The current process used to produce malonic acid requires sodium cyanide and chloroacetic acid; Lygos’ engineered yeast produces malonic acid from sugar and CO2.
By decreasing malonic acid’s production cost, we are enabling its use for production of various polymer, solvent, and adhesive molecules. We aim to develop many of these downstream applications along with our commercial partners.

Goals / Objectives This small business innovation research phase I project will support Lygos development of a biocatalyst for conversion of sugar feedstocks into fine and commodity chemicals. In specific Lygos is targeting compounds that are currently derived from petroleum using inefficient, ecologically hazardous chemical processes. To date, market expansion for select compounds has also been inhibited by high production costs and low process yields. Lygos is developing high-yielding microbial catalysts that will decrease production costs. The goal of this Phase I proposal is to engineer a new class of enzymes catalyzing specific reactions to hydrocarbon products; Phase II is anticipated to focus on optimizing the microbial production process and improving process economics. The market value for Lygos first product is currently over $150MM. Market expansion, however, has been historically limited by inefficiences in the incumbent petrochemical production process. Following optimization, Lygos biological route is anticipated to be cost advantaged, opening the door to a potential $15B in market opportunities. With regard to societal impact, Lygos microbial processes are based on renewable feedstocks and eliminate use of environmentally hazardous materials.
						

Project Methods Lygos employs state-of-the-art synthetic biology techniques to rapidly prototype and optimize metabolic pathways. These methods include development of product screening tools, rapid biocatalyst construction, protein engineering tools, and identification and deployment of novel metabolic pathways in industrial micro-organisms. The general workflows and methods Lygos is developing for synthetic biology could drastically decrease the cost and time required for commercialization of biocatalysts. The scientific results from this effort will be a greater understanding of how to engineer a new class of enzymes.

 The USDA and Lygos employees, Azadeh Alikhani, Mario Ouellet, Jeffrey Dietrich, and Eric Steen supported the success of this project. In this phase I SBIR effort, Lygos developed a new set of enzymes that are useful in converting renewable biomass into a new biochemical. As a platform our product has an immediate, addressable market of $250MM per year. Because it can be readily converted into other valuable chemicals and materials &gt;$1BB total market sizes could be accessed with our production process. The end goal of our Phase I SBIR was successfully achieved and demonstrated the potential for using novel, engineered enzymes for production of biochemical, using a biocatalyst. In ongoing commercialization phases, we expect to focus on process development, optimization, further scale up and development of other valuable products. Publications

Lygos Inc. receives two grants for microbial technology projects 
By Katie Fletcher | October 28, 2014

Lygos Inc., a company that evolved from the U.S. DOE’s Joint BioEnergy Institute, recently received two grants; $100,000 for a phase one project and $450,000 for a phase two project under the USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture Small Business Innovation Research program. NIFA awarded 100 grants, totaling more than $18 million to small businesses for research and development to lead to technological innovations and solutions in American agriculture.
Companies who apply for the SBIR program initially apply for phase one feasibility studies, which may be followed by phase two research and development projects if successful. Phase one grants are capped at $100,000 over a period of eight months, and phase two grants top off at $450,000 over two years.
Although Lygos cannot share specifics on the awarded phase one project, the phase two project receiving $450,000 will develop new purification techniques for organic acids, specifically looking at malonic acid, which is Lygos’s first product.
“Lygos develops fermentative technology, where we engineer microbes to sugars or other renewable resources from carbon and then make projects from those, so small molecule chemicals is predominantly what we’re focused on,” said Jeffery Dietrich, chief technology officer and founder of Lygos.
Biomass Magazine reported in 2012 that the company could not disclose specifically which molecules they were targeting, but now the company is speaking publically about their first product, malonic acid. “That grant is really focused on how you get malonic acid out of the fermentation process at a low cost and high efficiency,” Dietrich said. “I would say, that the techniques for developing for that process would ideally then be useful for other compounds that we or others are working on as well.”
Dietrich said the company has learned a lot about what types of products they will focus on. He compares the company’s strategy when working with compounds, in some ways, to what Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America do for different drug candidates and applications. Lygos funnels down from a relatively large number of compounds by doing proof of principle production, and then focuses on specific ones to optimize and move to pilot production. Dietrich said, Lygos is working on about three different compounds currently, all at different stages of optimization.
“We always knew we were going to work on microbial technologies to produce different compounds, and really what we’re finding is our niche area is trying to identify existing chemicals that are currently made for petroleum,” Dietrich said.
According to Dietrich, the processes used to produce these chemicals are extremely environmental hazardous or expensive. As a result, Lygos is focusing on where there are fundamental inefficiencies in the market today, where Lygos technology can be cost competitive and environmentally friendly. “Generally speaking we are looking at much higher value commodity and specialty chemicals, and our total production cost we estimate will be lower than the raw material cost for the incumbent producers,” Dietrich said. “It is really kind of a unique area where we are looking at what biology does extremely well, and where petro chemistry inherently is not going to be able to compete.”
Lygos is in the final stages of negotiating a pilot-scale contract, and is looking to scale up that process beyond the pilot plant in the next year or two. “It’s been a slow, but steady route towards commercialization,” Dietrich said.
As Lygos continues on their route towards commercialization they are looking to collaborate on different projects with larger, existing companies. “We recognize that as a startup company we’re not going to be able to take our first product to market alone, and it’s going to certainly be in partnership.”

Business Identifier: Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering  
Public Profile: Spun out of the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Lygos Inc. develops high efficiency, novel processes for renewable chemicals by using their expertise in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. Many of the firm's target products are organic acids, compounds that are expensive to synthesize using petrochemistry but can be produced at high theoretical yield microbially. A high yielding process means less sugar is required to produce each kilogram of product, decreasing operating costs and lowering exposure to changing raw material (e.g., corn) prices. Low operating costs is a fundamental reason why microbial production of organic acids (e.g., itaconic, lactic, citric, and succinic acids) has been more successful than biofuels (e.g., farnesane, bio-diesel, butanol, and ethanol).

Non Technical Summary Lygos is developing novel bio-manufacturing processes to valuable chemicals. Our targeted chemicals have existing, large markets of &gt;$250M per year. Current petroleum-based production of these chemicals has a number of pitfalls. Current chemical manufacturing requires petroleum feedstocks, utilize environmentally damaging processes, achieve low-yields, and have high production costs. In contrast, Lygos&#39; process converts domestic, renewable, agricultural sugar-residues, including corn, corn-stover, woody-biomass, and other energy crops into chemicals using fermentation; our process is high-yielding, is performed at ambient temperatures, and could decrease production costs 5-10 fold. While our technology holds great promise, there are challenges required for delivering a complete process to the market place. Ultimately, customers that may use our chemicals will demand stable supplies of product as that derived from petroleum and at the same or better costs. Development of our bio-manufacturing process could expand the market to &gt;$10B per year.The objective of our Phase II SBIR is to begin integrating Lygos&#39; product into existing customers&#39; supply chains.

Goals / Objectives The major technical goal is to conduct R&amp;D on renewable chemical production parameters that can be modified to improve the efficiency of our process, decrease overall costs, and improve product quality. By investigating the effects of various parameters, we will be able to establish a more robust process for production of renewable chemicals from domestic agriculture feedstocks.
						

Project Methods The project will be conducted using the scientific method in addition to previously measured physico-chemical parameters of our system related to production and separation of chemicals. We will conduct R&amp;D to investigate the effect of changing specific parameters on the output product quality. We will make measurements using laboratory instrumentation including chromatography and mass spectrometry. Clear documentation and statistical analysis will enable us to refine our approach.

Progress 09/01/14 to 08/31/15OutputsTarget Audience:Our target audience has been directed toward the biochemicals industry, where fermentation manufacturing is being employed to produce new and existing chemicals in relatively dilute concentrations. Lygos is developing novel bio-manufacturing processes to valuable chemicals. Our targeted chemicals have been estimated to have existing, large markets ranging from $70M-$250M per year. Current petroleum-based production of these chemicals has a number of pitfalls. Current chemical manufacturing requires petroleum feedstocks, utilize environmentally damaging processes, achieve low-yields, and have high production costs. In contrast, Lygos&#39; process converts domestic, renewable, agricultural sugar-residues, including corn, corn-stover, woody-biomass, and other energy crops into chemicals using fermentation; our process is high-yielding, is performed at ambient temperatures, and could decrease production costs significantly, while reducing energy costs. While our technology holds great promise, there are challenges in removing relatively dilute chemicals from the highly aqueous environment of a fermentation broth. Ultimately, customers that may use our chemicals will demand equally pure and stable supplies of product as that derived from petroleum and at the same or better costs. Development of a complete bio-manufacturing process could impact numerous markets and allow for substantial growth to &gt;$1BB per year. In order to purify chemicals from a fermentation process R&amp;D is required. The objective of our Phase II SBIR is to establish baseline methods for purification. Further, we test a number of renewable feedstocks in our bio-manufacturing process and elucidate potential differences between impurity profiles. Through these studies, we seek to establish a complete benchtop scale process that could deliver lower cost, highly pure chemicals. At the end of our phase II effort, we expect to have established a suitable workflow that would enable process scaling and commercialization. Changes/Problems:We have modified our plan to accomplish work that was previously assigned to a subcontractorat Lygos. This has resulted in project delays, but we are making substantial progress toward isolating and purifying material and will ultimately enable Lygos to provide more routine customer samples and receive validation. What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?Our lead scientist has helped to train a junior scientist / technician in process development, chemistry, and other laboratory techniques. How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?
Nothing Reported
What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?We will continue to evaluate the various methods for purification and arrive at the most promising combination of isolation methods for implementation at large scale. We will populate our technoeconomic models that estimate the cost of product isolation with data that we obtain at benchtop scale experimental work. ImpactsWhat was accomplished under these goals?
We continue to investigate and deploy methods for isolating our dilute organic acidproducts from fermentation broth and evaluate them for economic feasibility in an industrial setting. Our work has established that some of our previously proposed methods are unlikely to be useful at large scale, and some continue to show promise. Publications

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!
