FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

North America's Premier Junior Uranium Mining Company
Ur-Energy is a dynamic junior mining company operating the Lost Creek in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium facility in south-central Wyoming.  The Lost Creek processing facility has a two million pounds per year physical design capacity.  Shirley Basin, our newest project, is one of the Pathfinder Mines assets we acquired in 2013. Baseline studies necessary for permitting and licensing of the project are complete, the WDEQ application for permit to mine has been submitted, and work on other permits is underway. Ur-Energy engages in uranium mining and recovery operations, with activities including acquisition, exploration, development, and operation of uranium mineral properties. Shares of Ur-Energy trade on the NYSE MKT under the symbol “URG” and on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “URE".  In addition, Ur-Energy’s project pipeline is supported by an extensive, valuable exploration database and intensive analysis programs, providing for great exploration and development potential.

The Company’s common shares are listed on the NYSE MKT.
Section 110 of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (the “NYSE Guide”) permits companies domiciled outside the United States to follow certain home country corporate governance practices in lieu of complying with applicable provisions of the NYSE Guide, provided that any company that avails itself of this allowance discloses the ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by domestic companies pursuant to the NYSE MKT standards. The Company is incorporated under the Canadian Business Corporations Act and is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”). A description of the significant ways in which the Company’s governance practices differ from those followed by domestic companies pursuant to NYSE MKT standards is as follows:

Shareholder Vote Requirement: Section 713 of the NYSE Guide requires a listed company to obtain the approval of its shareholders for certain types of securities issuances, including private placements that may result in the issuance of common shares (or securities convertible into common shares) equal to 20% or more of the presently outstanding shares for less than the greater of book or market value of the shares.  Under TSX rules, shareholder approval is required for issuances of common shares equal to 25% or more of the presently outstanding shares for less than market value. Under certain circumstances, the TSX may, pursuant to Section 604(e) of the TSX company guide, grant waivers to its shareholder approval requirements where the listed company would suffer financial hardship in complying with such requirements. The conditions under which the TSX grants such waivers from its shareholder approval requirements may depart from similar NYSE MKT waivers or exemptions, if any. The Company will seek a waiver from the NYSE MKT’s shareholder approval requirements in circumstances where the securities issuance does not trigger such a requirement under Canadian law or under the rules of the TSX.
Shareholder Meeting Quorum Requirement: The NYSE MKT recommends that a quorum of at least 33 1/3% of shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote be required for shareholder action and be provided for in a listed company’s by-laws. The Company’s quorum requirement is set forth in its Articles and By-laws. A quorum for a meeting of members of the Company is two persons who are, or who represent by proxy, shareholders who, in the aggregate, hold at least 10% of the shares entitled to be voted at the meeting.

The foregoing all are consistent with the laws, customs and practices in Canada.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 07/26/2011
            

                BBB has determined that UR Energy Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.
