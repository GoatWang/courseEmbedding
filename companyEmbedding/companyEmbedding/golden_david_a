ITEM#: 16714113

This ready to hang, gallery-wrapped art piece features a landscape of the Golden Gate Bridge.Masters Fine Art is a company that travels around the world to bring the best in fine art from outstanding artists from different lands. They believe that art is the sould of the world, that it represents our human essence.MFA works mostly with Latin American art. It portrays a happy view of life, represented with bright beautiful colors, music, dance, love, hope and happiness, giving us the feeling that we can overcome all hardships with all the beautiful things we still have in life. The art Masters FineArt carries is many things: colorful, contemporary, sexy, emotional, musical, romantic.Above all it is beautiful and full of joy.Giclee (jee-clay) is an advanced printmaking process for creating high quality fine art reproductions. The attainable excellence that Giclee printmaking affords makes the reproduction virtually indistinguishable from the original piece. The result is wide acceptance of Giclee by galleries, museums, and private collectors. Gallery wrap is a method of stretching an artist's canvas so that the canvas wraps around the sides and is secured on a hidden, wooden frame. This method of stretching and preparing a canvas allows for a frameless presentation of the finished painting. Artist: David Ayash

Brilliant colors.hppycmprcolor is true to posting. Nice gallery wrap ideal for blank wall from my kitchen into my family room. Quality painting and beautiful.red treesWe do like this, but had anticipated texture to the canvas. There is an illusion of texture, but this is a print on canvas.Wrapped Canvas WatercolorFrameless, wrapped canvas artwork can visually expand a space. The quality of this one is top-notch and I constantly get raves about it. It is easily worth twice what I paid and I'm scouting for another. Overstock's Oversized Gallery is the place to shop.Fun pictureNice colors and the canvas is wrapped nice and tight. This looks great in our Florida vacation guest room as part of a gallery wall. Awesome!!I ordered the gallery wrap canvas.  When I unpacked I found that I was sent the wrong item.  They sent me a framed evergreen plantation picture,, not a canvas wrapped.   No explanation was included in the package.  I like it so I will just keep it , instead of going thru the hassle of returning it.    It's a beautiful picture canvas or not!!!Spa FeelAlthough it took a little while to show up, it was worth waiting for. Very calming print. Like gallery wrap. Lighter frame than expected and sturdy construction.My Audubon collectionLove the quality of this canvas.  Beautifully done. I have a wall I am doing of the Audubon collection. This made my five in the gallery wall. Thank you! JNCColors exactly as shown.  For a gallery wrapped canvas print, it's great.  It hangs on our screened porch.Sponsored LinksWhat's This?Quick ViewFavorite$7699Was $135.00 $58.01 OFFMadison Park Midnight Forest Gel Coat Canvas with Gold Foil Embellishment 3-piece Set216 ReviewsQuick ViewFavorite$6949 -

Intergalactic Golden Blood is a book that will open your mind to new possibilities and give substance to what was once believed to be pure fantasy.it is set in the year 2111 and introduces Samuel J Lewis, an average human being working as a freelance photojournalist. But, unbeknown to Sam he is not just an average man, he is a unique individual and a man who has a particularly rare version of golden blood. So uniquely rare that he is the only person in the universe who can save a dying civilisation, on a planet called Cryon. A planet which is more than 6000 light years from Earth, and a planet which is so technologically advanced that science fiction, becomes science fact. Intergalactic golden blood is more than just another science fiction book, it’s a reality yet to be discovered with an inconceivable conclusion!

Publisher's Description▼▲
Almost anyone you ask would say that they want to do work that matters. Yet many people do not feel like they are actively making a difference in the world. Others may feel a sense of calling but lack either the courage or the supportive community to carry it out. But if God created each of us on purpose, for a purpose, we should be ordering our lives around that purpose.Jonathan D. Golden, founder of Land of a Thousand Hills coffee company, has discovered and is living out his unique calling to promote social, spiritual, and economic justice while providing a living wage to 2,500 farmers in Rwanda. Now he reveals to readers how to identify their calling, dispels the myths and misunderstandings we often have about what constitutes a calling, and challenges them to pursue that calling with a courage that can surmount the many obstacles that may lie in their path. He also shows readers how to cultivate a community of support that will help them fulfill their calling.For anyone who is dissatisfied with the work they are doing, just entering the workforce, or wondering what more is out there, this book reveals how to embrace the meaningful life they were meant to live.

God spends the day elsewhere, but He sleeps in Rwanda.


This may be a popular saying in that East African country, but my view of Rwanda has been shaped by 1990s era news reports of violence, genocide, and war.  Jonathan David Golden has spent a few nights in Rwanda himself, and the result of that is a multi-million dollar coffee business that promotes justice through partnering directly with Rwandan farmers to make excellent coffee  and to make a difference.


Be You.  Do Good. tells the story of Jonathans journey from conflicted and confused to confident and called.  On his way to The Land of a Thousand Hills (the name of his company and another nickname for Rwanda), he extracts twelve principles that shaped his missional world view:


1. Let Go of the Myths  We believe all kinds of false statements about calling and vocation that keep us mired in indecision.


2.Be Who You Are  Life is a cosmic collaboration in which God works through the person he created to do a great thing.  Dont put that self on the shelf.


3.Use What You Have  Take the first step, and dont wait. Notice who is nearby to help, and live scrappy!


4.Get What You Can  Sounds pretty radical, right? Jonathan is a believer in The Big Ask.  Tempered by the truth that its not about you, but about the call, this is a legitimate position:  you are inviting others into Gods work.


5.Follow the Inkling  God invites us into adventure.  Our experiences and gifts are custom-made to equip us for that faithful following.


6.Pursue What Makes You Come Alive  Sensitive to social injustice from the time he was a boy, Jonathan realized that his entrepreneurial spirit and his heart for ministry could make a difference in Rwanda through the production of coffee.  This chemistry of passion and ability is what we all need to find.


7.Find a People to Serve  A healthy community is one in which everyone blesses and everyone is blessed in return.  For Jonathan, it was a matter of not being The Rich White Guy.  Serve and be served.


8.Growing Little by Little  The work of forgiveness, finding your calling, reaching your goals:  these are all works of slow grace.


9.March Through Challenges  One foot ahead of the other requires a mundane soldiering through the hard times.  Jonathan shares his liturgy for life which, essentially, is a daily turning of his face toward what is true.


10.Follow, Dont Force  Forging through with ones own agenda can be dangerous.  Pause and allow the Holy Spirit to show the next step.


11.Stand Back Up  When the wheels come off our plans, the choice between give-up and stand-up is a tough one.  The myth of easy can keep us from persevering.


12.Stay Open to New Possibilities  Open eyes to the needs around us and open hearts to hear the voice of the Spirit are essential to readiness.


Intensely practical and yet highly motivational, Be You. Do Good. is a call to gritty obedience and a faithful following that honors Gods unique gifting of the believer.  When the Spirit whispers, take one brave step.  Then, see what God does with your availability.

            Today we are brought a new book, courtesy of Jonathan David Golden.    It was an interesting read and was filled with helpful tips for those who do not feel like they are living a life that makes them feel "alive."   Jonathan's story was encouraging to read, as it detailed a regular guy and his journey to listening to the Lord.  For people like myself, going out on a limb and following the Lord's crazy callings is not easy, and this book encouraged me to be more bold. I enjoyed tracking the humble beginnings of Jonathan's coffee company and seeing it grow over time into a company that is growing into a profitable business.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to take the next step in their life or feels stuck in a rut.  I am not really into self-help  books as a rule but this was easy for me to read.  His personal life stories made it much more interesting to me and didn't feel like it was an impersonal list of things I need to do to get "better." I would give this book 4/5 stars.

            I love when a book asks good questions. This one goes beyond What do you want to be when you grow up? to Who do you want to be? Jonathan Golden has an impressive resume, but shares how his accomplishments dont mean anything without purpose behind them. I deeply resonated with his drive to do more than just what was expected or what looked good. He speaks throughout his book of the quiet faithfulness behind real transformation, doing things little by little. I love the courage he speaks of to start doing the things that make you come alive. Every calling begins with one brave step. (48) He gives permission for the unconventional and bold, inviting the reader to ask better questions of what it means to live a life of meaning. 4/5 for me.

            Earlier this year, I asked to review an Amish fiction book. By mistake, I received Jonathan David Golden's book Be You. Do Good. I was told I could read it or pass it on, since it had been sent in error. I decided maybe the mistake wasn't so much of a mistake, and I should read the book.


The subtitle is "Having the guts to pursue what makes you come alive," and since I'm still in my first year of career change and new paths, I thought perhaps this would offer me something really pivotal to help me in my journey.


I was so sad when I finally closed the book, because it wasn't my favorite. I pondered just skipping the review entirely because I didn't want to say something negative, but I decided to go ahead with it, believing that part of being a book reviewer is knowing every book might not zing me and being okay with admitting when one does not.


Jonathan is the founder of a successful business called Land of a Thousand Hills Coffee Company. {COFFEE!!! I mean how could this go wrong for me??} The book shares many of the stories of his life, but particularly over the last decade as he founded this company and went through seasons of success and failure, personally and professionally.


I did a lot of underlining in the first chapter and felt excited that I would learn so much from this book, but the chapters that followed were predominantly story, with a tag line of application at the end of each one. It seemed the main meat of the book was all in the first chapter. I craved less story and more explanation of how he imagined others could apply what he experienced in their own lives. I think I felt so disconnected from it because I know that my own calling is not to run a multi-million-dollar corporation, nor is it to work across national boundaries, so I wanted to know how to apply the principles in ordinary-world. {I'm not opposed to doing the heavy lifting as a reader and figuring out how to make something fit my own details. In this situation, I just didn't feel like I'd been given enough actual teaching to do so.}


It was much more of a business book than a Christian living book, in my opinion, though it is marketed as Christian living. The copy on the back of the book indicates that anyone looking to make a career out of their life calling can learn from the book, but I did not find it to be a good fit for me.


Make no mistake: his stories are interesting, and there is much to learn about the country of Rwanda and the coffee business through reading the pages, but I just ached for a little bit more guidance and a little bit less story.


If you're a business-minded person and you aspire to head a corporation someday, this actually might be a great book for you. It just wasn't for me, and I was sorry for that.


* I received this book from Baker in exchange for an honest review. *

            Many of us struggle with or know the struggle of trying to find our way through this one life. It sometimes does not come to most of us so easily nor does it develop overtime. However, Be You. Do Good by Jonathan David Golden gives, shares, and demonstrates the ways in which any one of us can find the right path. This book is the perfect tool that will enable us to work out the kinks or balance out the thoughts that linger in whether we should take the next step in pushing our boundaries. I found this book to be inspiring and a fast read to enjoy and pushes its reader to take the leap in the direction that will make a happy life. It may seem like it can be an easy pursuit to finding what calls you to do in life, but Golden shares the words that will guide us to a meaningful life. A must read. I received a copy for this review from Baker Books and all opinions are my own.
