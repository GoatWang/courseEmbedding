The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Mark L. Reuss, Executive Vice President of Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain for General Motors Company has been elected to serve a three-year term as a member of the Board of Trustees at The Henry Ford.







Mark Reuss, executive vice president for General Motors Company

The Henry Ford tells America’s stories of innovation, resourcefulness and ingenuity. Mark has spent his whole career fully dedicated to fueling the innovative spirit within the automotive industry


Dearborn, Mich. (PRWEB)
February 15, 2016
 Mark L. Reuss, Executive Vice President of Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain for General Motors Company has been elected to serve a three-year term as a member of the Board of Trustees at The Henry Ford. As a new board member, Reuss  joins 20 other business and civic leaders from national and global organizations.  
“The Henry Ford tells America’s stories of innovation, resourcefulness and ingenuity. Mark has spent his whole career fully dedicated to fueling the innovative spirit within the automotive industry,” said Patricia E. Mooradian, president of The Henry Ford. “His passion and commitment for education are infectious and make him a natural fit for this institution. We look forward to working with him.”
"As a lifelong Detroiter, I know exactly how important The Henry Ford is to our community, and beyond," said Reuss. "It's a national treasure. I couldn't be happier to join its Board of Trustees and do what I can to help it continue to preserve, archive and encourage American innovation."
Reuss leads the design, engineering, safety, quality, research and development and program management of General Motors vehicles around the world. He also oversees GM’s Global Purchasing and Supply Chain organization, and is a member of the GM Executive Leadership Team, the Opel Supervisory Board and the board of Shanghai General Motors (SGM).
From 2009-2013, Reuss was President of General Motors North America, responsible for GM’s performance, manufacturing, portfolio and dealer network. Under his watch, GM’s North America region produced consistent profits and improved margins during a product renaissance featuring a slate of award-winning vehicles.
Previously, Reuss served briefly as GM’s vice president of global engineering after spending two years overseas as vice president and managing director of Australia and New Zealand. During this time, he was a member of the GM Asia Pacific Strategy Board.
Reuss, a mechanical engineer and lifelong auto and motorsports enthusiast, started at GM as an intern in 1986. Over the years, he held numerous positions in architecture and systems engineering, vehicle integration and more. He also created and led GM’s Performance Division in 2001. He is a certified industry pool test driver on the North Course of the Nürburgring Motorsport Racetrack in Germany, and is licensed for Grand American Road Racing. His first car was a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro, which he bought and restored himself.
Born and raised in metro Detroit, Reuss is deeply committed to revitalizing the city via education, community and philanthropy. In 2010, he spearheaded a $27.1 million grant to the United Way for Southeastern Michigan to improve graduation rates at seven Detroit-area high schools. In 2013, he championed the GM Student Corps, a summer internship and career development program for under-served youth. He also was instrumental in bringing the Chevrolet Belle Isle Detroit Grand Prix back to the city, which generates millions in economic impact for the region.

Mark Reuss - Wikipedia





















 






Mark Reuss

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Mark L. Reuss is the current President of General Motors North America.[1] In 2001 he was appointed executive director of the Performance Division, then executive director of Global Vehicle Integration, Safety and Virtual Development in 2005.
Later he served as chairman and managing director of Holden, the Australasian General Motors (GM) operation from February 1, 2008 until September 1, 2009, overseeing GM's Australasian operations and is a director on the GM Asia Pacific Strategy Board.[2][3]
Reuss was the vehicle line executive in charge of the highly criticized and unsuccessful Pontiac Aztek and Buick Rendezvous. However, he was praised for his tenure in the early 2010s for leading product development.
From September 1, 2009, Alan Batey took over his position as Reuss returned to the GM in the United States as a senior product development director.
Mark's father was Lloyd E. Reuss, former president at GM from 1990 to 1992. He received an undergraduate degree from Vanderbilt University in 1986 and an MBA from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business in 1990.

Executive Vice President, Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain, General Motors Company





Mark L. Reuss leads the design, engineering, safety, quality, research and development, advanced vehicle technology and program management of General Motors cars, trucks and crossovers around the world. He also oversees GM’s Global Purchasing and Supply Chain organization, and is a member of the GM Executive Leadership Team, the Opel Supervisory Board and the board of Shanghai General Motors (SGM).
From 2009-2013, Reuss was President of General Motors North America, responsible for GM’s performance, manufacturing, portfolio and dealer network. Under his watch, GM’s North America region produced consistent profits and improved margins during a product renaissance featuring a slate of award-winning vehicles.
Previously, Reuss served briefly as GM’s vice president of global engineering after spending two years overseas as vice president and managing director of Australia and New Zealand. During this time, he was a member of the GM Asia Pacific Strategy Board.

Reuss was born and raised in metro Detroit and is deeply committed to revitalizing the city via education, community and philanthropy. In 2010, he spearheaded a $27.1 million grant to the United Way for Southeastern Michigan to improve graduation rates at seven Detroit-area high schools. In 2013, he championed the GM Student Corps, a summer internship and career development program for under-served youth. He also was instrumental in bringing the Chevrolet Belle Isle Detroit Grand Prix back to the city, which generates millions in economic impact for the region.
He holds a bachelor of engineering degree from Vanderbilt University and a master of business administration from Duke University.
