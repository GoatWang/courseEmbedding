Lithium Exploration Group Announces New Product Offerings At Morinville Disposal Facility




Scottsdale, AZ (Marketwired) - Lithium Exploration Group Inc. (OTCQB: LEXG) today announces that Alta Disposal's Morinville Facility has clarified approvals to resume acceptance of waste streams that were approved at the facility under the prior operator. This allows the facility to accept more forms of liquid waste because up to today the facility has only been disposing of produced water from oil and gas production.
Some of these other forms of liquid waste are: fluids generated from tank and floor washing in chemical plant operation, fluids generated from tank washing of bulk carriers, and fluids generated from washing of upgrading and refining plant equipment. These fluids command variable, but considerably higher price to dispose of than traditional produced water. Confirmation of the ability to handle a wider variety of fluids is expected in the very near future. 
"These new product offerings will expand our reach in the region and give us a lot more flexibility in dealing with potential customers," commented CEO Alex Walsh. "Alta Disposal's goal as a company is to provide exceptional customer service and competitive pricing in the market. That combination along with the technological advantages that we bring will make us a formidable competitor in the multibillion dollar waste disposal industry."
About Alta Disposal
Alta Disposal is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lithium Exploration Group. Its corporate offices are in Calgary, Alberta and it holds the company's interest in oilfield disposal facilities in Western Canada. More information about Alta Disposal can be found at www.altadisposal.com.
About Lithium Exploration Group
Lithium Exploration Group is a US-based exploration and development company focused on the acquisition and development potential of lithium brines and other precious metals that demonstrate high probability for near-term production. Currently the company is focused on its Western Canada lithium assets, testing its Ultrasonic Generator Technology and the acquisition of oil and gas related assets in Western Canada. Lithium Exploration Group is a fully reporting company traded on the OTCQB under the symbol LEXG. Website:www.lithiumexplorationgroup.com.

This news release contains "forward-looking statements". Statements in this press release that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements and include any statements regarding beliefs, plans, expectations or intentions regarding the future testing of the ultrasonic technology.
Actual results could differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors. Such factors include, among others, the inherent uncertainties associated with mineral exploration and difficulties associated with obtaining financing on acceptable terms. We are not in control of lithium prices and these could vary to make development uneconomic. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this news release, and we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements.
Although we believe that the beliefs, plans, expectations and intentions contained in this press release are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such beliefs, plans, expectations or intentions will prove to be accurate.

					Full Description



Lithium Exploration Group, Inc., incorporated on May 31, 2006, is an exploration-stage company. The Company is engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of resource properties. The Company is focused on the acquisition and development of assets in Alberta, Canada. The Company's Ultrasonic Technology assists in separating suspended solids from brine water. The technology is based around a transportable ultra-sound reactor. It has applications in the oil and gas, and mining industries. The Ultrasonic Generator (single base unit) can desalinate water at a rate of over 25 to 35 cubic meters per hour. The two discharge streams are distilled water and marketable minerals (flow rates will vary depending on the salinity level of the input stream).The Ultrasonic Generator also has the ability to upgrade crude oil. A single Ultrasonic Generator can upgrade crude oil into petroleum products. Flow rates for crude oil (single base unit) are over 25 tons per day (approximately 150 barrels of oil per day). The Ultrasonic Generator's by-products are clean water (or steam) and minerals. Various tailored fluids can also be synthesized for use in the oil and gas industry. The steam by-product created by the Ultrasonic Generator can also be used to generate electricity by propelling steam turbines. The dissolved minerals, such as Lithium (Li), Calcium chloride (CaCl), Potassium chloride (KCl), Magnesium chloride (MgCl), Sodium chloride (NaCl), Iodine (I) and Bromine (Br) can be separated from brine or other solutions using the Ultrasonic Technology. Also, various types of fluids can be synthesized using the Ultrasonic Technology, including those required for voidage, formation stabilization, water flood, enhanced oil recovery (EOR), fracking and other special applications. As of June 30, 2016, the Company did not generate any revenue.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
