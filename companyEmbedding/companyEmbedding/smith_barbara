Product Test a New Tack for Institute 
By Smith, Barbara Peters

Article excerpt

Sarasota's Institute for the Ages, a nonprofit foundation charged
with the challenge of both tapping and empowering this region's
resource of older adults, is trying something a little different in
its third partnership with a company wooing the elder marketplace.In its first two ventures -- with a communications technology
start-up called Lively and a joint venture between GE and Intel
called Care Innovations -- local people 50 and over who signed on
with the institute's Community-Powered Research Network were tasked
with evaluating a product still in development.This time around, the product -- Juvent, one of those vibration
machines believed to build bone health by applying low-intensity
force when you stand on them -- has been on the market for some
time. The role for the institute is to help the company figure out
what it would take to convince elders that the "exercise" program is
worth sticking to."We're looking to understand their perceptions so we can shorten
the education time for people before they understand it's worth
using a Juvent," says Peter Simonson, president of Regenerative
Technologies Corp., a Palm Beach company that has licensed patents
for the device. "We know that in one to three weeks, they get it.
But we're trying to shorten that time."So the institute, in partnership with the Evalyn Sadlier Jones
branch of the YMCA -- that's the one in Palmer Ranch -- is asking
testers 50 and over to commit to trying out the gizmo. Users will be
asked to drop by one of two sites and use the Juvent -- this means
basically standing on it for 20 minutes while it emits a subtle
vibration -- three times a week for five weeks. The 15-session total
can be spread over a longer time to accommodate holidays or trips,
said Stacy Prouty, chief operations officer for the institute."It feels really good," she said. "But you might want to bring a
book."The study began Nov. 6 and will continue for 10 weeks.
Participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires about the
experience and their results."We want your feedback and honest opinion," Prouty told a roomful
of potential testers last week. …

            Smith on bringing black women's literature to colleges and publishing, and the changing self-image of young women of color.
            






              Barbara Smith and her twin sister Beverly are the products of a powerful upbringing. As young girls growing up in Cleveland, they were surrounded by an extended family made up entirely of intellectually and politically-oriented women. A librarian aunt brought books home and made the house a center for discussion and pointed political awareness. "I'm kind of a natural activist," she later told Ms. magazine. "By the time I was eight I noticed that things were not fair." Barbara joined Mount Holyoke’s class of 1969 and was quickly among a wave of scholars and critics leading in the definition of a distinctive African-American women’s literary tradition and establishing Black women’s studies in college and university curricula.
 
The new critical approach in turn informed political action and in 1974 Smith co-founded the Combahee River Collective, an early and influential Black feminist group. Her leadership made the group a conscience for different movements by calling attention to the ways racism, classism, homophobia, and sexism intersect. When feminists were ignoring issues of race, Smith was there. And when African-Americans were indulging in homophobia, she was there, too. "We understood that dealing with sexual politics didn't mean you weren't a race woman, and that speaking out about homophobia didn't mean that you didn't want to end poverty." Smith’s political action—recognized in a 2005 Nobel Peace Prize nomination—has continued to be interwoven with writing and criticism. She co-founded, Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, the first US publisher of women of color, in 1980. She is currently serving her second term as a member of the Albany Common Council.
            


More From Barbara


Not Getting Women's "Liberation" at First

Smith describes her initial reaction to hearing white women talk about "women's liberation." 



Time Frame for Revolution

The idealistic baby boomers of Smith's generation thought they would transform the world by the time they were 30.  Her estimates have changed.

Amos & Andy

Smith talks about what it was like growing up with limited black role models on television.



Don Imus & Rutgers

The media's reaction to the Don Imus-Rutgers incident was actually a sign of progress to Smith.



Being Stereotyped

Smith describes the maddening burden of facing negative stereotypes her whole life.



An Early Sense of Injustice

Smith was not raised by activists, but a deep sense of justice and injustice ran in her veins.



Black Feminism and Domestic Violence

Why the women's movement often alienated women of color like Smith, who experienced key issues differently.



How Race Meets Feminism

A core feminist issue like abortion, shows how the mainstream movement didn't necessarily represent women of color.



Birth of the National Black Women’s Org

Smith recalls the galvanizing experience of attending the first NBFO gathering and the who's who of black feminists present.



Sexism in the Black Power Movement

Frustrated by the sexism of the Black Power movement, Smith was primed to embrace the messages of the feminism.



Origins of Black Women’s Studies

Smith explains how black female scholars, excluded from the texts of black studies and women's studies, created a new field.

Jada Pinkett-Smith’s Skincare Routine


Any time Jada Pinkett-Smith walks the red carpet or makes a TV appearance you can’t help but ask yourself: does this woman age?! Her skin is flawless and her body is impeccable! She is giving the girls in their 20s a run for their money. Earlier today she shared one of her skincare beauty secrets and I was all over it.

She spilled the details about one of the products that changed her skin by Dr. Barbara Sturm.
Jada’s Skincare Routine


Steam your face, covering your head with a towel over a pot of hot water


Use a drop of this ampule (you can get 3-4 uses from one ampule) and done!


Jada confesses that your face will radiate like you just got off a 2 week spa vacation and the product is a skin game changer. Of course it doesn’t take much to convince me. I immediately headed over to Net-a-Porter‘s Beauty Section to do some research.

Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid occurs naturally in our skin. Dr. Barbara Sturm’s powerful anti-aging treatment contains a 7 day supply of the active concentrate. It’s also formulated with regenerative Purslane, which moisturizes the deepest layers of the dermis to reinforce cell tissue and the skin’s barrier function. The product claims that when used intensively over a one-to-three week period, it will diminish fine lines, boost elasticity and make your complexion appear firmer. Free from fragrance, parabens and mineral oils. Can be used to calm stressed skin after sun exposure.
Dr. Sturm’s products are a bit pricy but could be worth the investment. For flawless skin like Jada’s grab yours here.
