(the “Company”) (KLXI), a leading distributor and value added service provider of aerospace fasteners and consumables, and a provider of services and products to the oil and gas exploration and production industry, today reported its first fiscal quarter 2017 financial results.On a GAAP basis, for the three month period ended April 30, 2017, revenues of $411.3 million increased 16.6 percent, operating earnings of $48.6 million increased 109.5 percent, and net earnings of $18.4 million and net earnings per diluted share of $0.36 increased approximately $15.9 million and $0.31 per diluted share, respectively, as compared to the three month period ended April 30, 2016.FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Consolidated revenues increased 16.6 percent to $411.3 million, driven by a 10.0 percent increase in revenues in the Aerospace Solutions Group segment (“ASG”) and a 72.4 percent increase in revenues in the Energy Services Group segment (“ESG”)Consolidated operating earnings of $48.6 million increased 109.5 percentAdjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share (as defined below) were $34.8 million and $0.67 per diluted share, representing increases of 152.2 percent and 157.7 percent, respectivelyRepurchased approximately $14.4 million KLXI common shares during the first quarterShare repurchase authorization increased to $200 millionWe have presented Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share to reflect net earnings before amortization and non-cash compensation expense, and to include the tax benefit from the amortization of tax-deductible goodwill (“Adjusted Net Earnings” and “Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share”). We have also presented adjusted EBITDA, which reflects EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) before non-cash compensation expense (“Adjusted EBITDA”). See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”Amin J. Khoury, KLX’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are pleased to report that both our ASG and ESG segments are off to a solid start in 2017. On a consolidated basis, first quarter revenues increased 16.6 percent and operating earnings increased by 109.5 percent. Gross margin improved by nearly 400 basis points and operating margin increased by approximately 500 basis points. Both businesses established momentum in the quarter that is expected to accelerate as the year progresses. We remain optimistic about the outlook for our ASG business as new program awards begin to ramp up in the second half of 2017. In addition, our ESG business is performing ahead of our earlier expectations and Adjusted EBITDA, which we had earlier guided to be breakeven in the third or fourth quarter, actually became slightly positive in the first quarter. We now expect ESG to achieve positive operating earnings in the third or fourth quarter of 2017.”Mr. Khoury continued, “ASG’s revenues increased 10.0 percent, driven primarily by an increase in military aftermarket sales. Exclusive of Herndon’s contributions in the current year period, ASG revenues increased approximately 3 percent. Our ESG business delivered substantially improved results, both on sequential and year over year bases. ESG generated revenues of $63.8 million, an increase of 72.4 percent versus the same period in the prior year, and an increase of 46.3 percent as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. ESG’s operating loss improved by $20.8 million to $(10.1) million, as compared to the same period in the prior year, and improved by $8.9 million, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. ESG Adjusted EBITDA for the current period of $1.3 million improved by $20.5 million as compared to the prior year period.”FIRST QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTSFor the three months ended April 30, 2017, revenues of $411.3 million increased 16.6 percent, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The consolidated results reflect an increase of 10.0 percent in ASG revenues, and an increase of 72.4 percent in ESG revenues. Operating earnings of $48.6 million increased 109.5 percent. Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share were $34.8 million and $0.67 per diluted share, and increased 152.2 percent and 157.7 percent, respectively, as compared with the same period in the prior year.FIRST QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTSThe following is a tabular summary and commentary of revenues and operating earnings, presented on a GAAP basis, for the three month periods ended April 30, 2017 and 2016 ($ millions):     REVENUES             THREE MONTHS ENDED                           Segment   April 30, 2017   April 30, 2016   % Change       Aerospace Solutions Group   $   347.5     $   315.8     10.0 %       Energy Services Group       63.8         37.0     72.4 %       Total   $   411.3     $   352.8     16.6 %                                             OPERATING EARNINGS (LOSS)              THREE MONTHS ENDED                           Segment   April 30, 2017   April 30, 2016   % Change       Aerospace Solutions Group   $   58.7     $   54.1     8.5 %       Energy Services Group       (10.1 )       (30.9 )   67.3 %       Total   $   48.6     $   23.2     109.5 %                                             ADJUSTED EBITDA (LOSS)             THREE MONTHS ENDED                           Segment   April 30, 2017   April 30, 2016   % Change       Aerospace Solutions Group   $   69.7     $   63.8     9.2 %       Energy Services Group       1.3         (19.2 )   106.8 %       Total   $   71.0     $   44.6     59.2 %   For the three months ended April 30, 2017, ASG revenues of $347.5 million increased 10.0 percent compared to the same period in the prior year.

This release also includes “Adjusted EBITDA,” which excludes depreciation and amortization and non-cash compensation expense, which are “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The Company uses the above described adjusted measures to evaluate and assess the operational strength and performance of the business and of particular segments of the business. The Company believes these financial measures are relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to have a better understanding of the Company’s actual operating performance unaffected by the impact of the costs as defined.  These financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, operating earnings or net earnings (each as defined under GAAP), the most directly comparable GAAP measures, as a measure of the Company’s operating performance.Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G of the Exchange Act, we are providing the following tables that reconcile the above mentioned non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures: KLX INC.     RECONCILIATION OF NET EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE      TO ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE      (In Millions, Except Per Share Data)                         THREE MONTHS ENDED           April 30, 2017   April 30, 2016       Net earnings   $   18.4   $   2.5         Amortization expense       4.8       4.7         Non-cash compensation       5.9       4.8         Income taxes       11.2       1.8       Adjusted earnings before tax expense     40.3       13.8         Income taxes at normalized rate       15.2       5.8         Less: impact of goodwill deduction *     9.7       5.8       Adjusted income taxes       5.5       -       Adjusted net earnings   $   34.8   $   13.8       Adjusted net earnings                 per diluted share   $   0.67   $   0.26                       Diluted weighted average                 shares       51.8       52.2                       * For purposes of this calculation, tax benefit of goodwill deduction is limited to income taxes at the normalized rate       KLX INC.     RECONCILIATION OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EARNINGS      TO ADJUSTED EBITDA     (In Millions)                     THREE MONTHS ENDED         April 30, 2017   April 30, 2016       Operating earnings $   48.6     $   23.2           Depreciation and amortization     16.5         16.6           Non-cash compensation     5.9         4.8         Adjusted EBITDA $   71.0     $   44.6                             RECONCILIATION OF AEROSPACE SOLUTIONS GROUP OPERATING EARNINGS     TO ADJUSTED EBITDA     (In Millions)                     THREE MONTHS ENDED         April 30, 2017   April 30, 2016       ASG operating earnings $   58.7     $   54.1           Depreciation and amortization     7.9         7.0           Non-cash compensation     3.1         2.7         Adjusted EBITDA $   69.7     $   63.8                             RECONCILIATION OF ENERGY SERVICES GROUP OPERATING LOSS     TO ADJUSTED EBITDA (LOSS)     (In Millions)                     THREE MONTHS ENDED         April 30, 2017   April 30, 2016       ESG operating loss $   (10.1 )   $   (30.9 )         Depreciation and amortization     8.6         9.6           Non-cash compensation     2.8         2.1         Adjusted EBITDA (loss) $   1.3     $   (19.2 )     ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHere's How Much Donald Trump's Senior Adviser Anthony Scaramucci Is WorthFortuneEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredFacebook and Google are in a battle to control their explosive spendingCNBCBaidu rebounds in Q2 with 83% jump in net incomeAFPVerizon meets 2Q profit forecastsAssociated PressThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredTwitter shares tumble as user growth stallsReutersAnthony Scaramucci's wife reportedly filed for divorce because he was 'hell-bent' on joining TrumpBusiness InsiderMainstream Model 3 holds promise _ and peril _ for TeslaAssociated PressDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderApple (AAPL) to Report Q3 Earnings: Is a Beat in Store?ZacksChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoWhich Travel Card Has the Most Valuable Miles?Wise BreadSponsoredStocks mixed after heavy earnings weekThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceRepublicans' bid to repeal Obamacare ends with a surpriseOH-ME/OH-MY: Term limits for Congress needed.Join the Conversation1 / 539
