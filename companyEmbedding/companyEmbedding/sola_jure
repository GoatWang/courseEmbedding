 Jure Sola 1951— Biography



      Jure Sola
      
      1951–
    











        Chairman and chief executive officer, Sanmina-SCI Corporation
      


      Nationality: American.
    

      Born: 1951, in Croatia.
    

      Education: San Jose State University, BS, 1972.
    

      Family: Married Michelle (maiden name unknown); children: three.
    

      Career: Lika Corporation, 1972–1980, various management positions;
      Sanmina Corporation, 1980–1991, various management positions;
      1991–2001, chairman and president; Sanmina-SCI Corporation,
      2001–2002, cochairman and CEO; 2002–, chairman and CEO.
    

      Address: Sanmina-SCI Corporation, 2700 North First Street, San Jose,
      California 95134; http://www.sanmina.com.
    

      ■ Jure Sola founded Sanmina Corporation in 1980 for the manufacture
      of advanced electronic-circuit cards, back planes, and enclosures for the
      telecommunications market. In 2001 Sanmina completed its acquisition of
      the competitor SCI, and in 2002 Sola became the chief executive officer
      and chairman of the newly named Sanmina-SCI Corporation. As of 2004 the
      merger was the largest ever in the electronic manufacturing services
      industry. The combined company was a leading global electronics contract
      manufacturer, building parts and providing manufacturing-management
      services for original-equipment manufacturers in the communications,
      industrial and medical instrumentation, and computer-technology sectors.
    

      BUILDING THE ELECTRONIC MANUFACTURING SERVICES BUSINESS
    

      Born in Croatia, Sola came to the United States as a 17-year-old in 1968.
      After receiving an engineering degree from San Jose State University, he
      joined the management of the electronic manufacturing company Lika,
      producing electronic transducers and control instruments for factory
      automation. In 1980 he cofounded Sanmina and began serving the company in
      various management capacities. Sola became chairman and president of
      Sanmina in 1991.
    

      For most of its history the contract manufacturing business received
      little respect. Many engineering firms preferred to design products and
      then let original-equipment manufacturers (OEMs) build the parts. In the
      1990s most of the companies that manufactured end products decided to
      reduce redundant resources and staff by seeking out other firms with which
      to outsource ongoing production. Sola took advantage of this trend early
      on to advance Sanmina. Ranked ninth among contract manufacturers in 1997,
      the company avoided consumer products in order to concentrate on high-end
      networking and telecommunications applications. Sola stated his business
      strategy in 
      
        Electronic Business
      
      : "We go after the products that are more difficult to manufacture
      internally" (August 1, 1998).
    

      Throughout much of its existence Sanmina maintained a 15 percent operating
      margin, a figure that impressed other contract manufacturers. Sola
      credited the company's results to the niches that he chose, good
      management, and a history of closely watched costs. Comparing
      Sanmina's operations from well after it became profitable to those
      of its infancy, when the company had almost as much debt as it did
      revenue, Sola remarked, "We don't run any
      differently" (
      
        Electronic Business
      
      , August 1, 1998).
    

      MERGING SANMINA WITH SCI
    

      In the 1990s OEMs and contract manufacturers had begun to operate like
      identical companies—both had become truly cooperative and
      integrated. Contract manufacturers like SCI joined OEM design sessions and
      provided services throughout the supply chain, from designing to box
      building. SCI was a pioneer in vertical integration, once designing and
      producing almost everything for the Apollo space project. By the latter
      part of the 1990s SCI derived most of its revenue from personal computers
      and government contracts.
    

      In the late 1990s Sola decided that he needed to give Sanmina a more
      diversified revenue stream by appealing to a broader group of customers;
      he pursued a friendly merger with the larger SCI. Sola noted, "We
      built the company to a certain
       level with niche technology, but we needed to have the fundamentals of
      system assembly in place" (
      
        Electronic Buyers News
      
      , December 17, 2001). Acquiring SCI would result in quicker improvements
      than would developing such capabilities internally. Sanmina derived more
      than two-thirds of its revenue from the communications market, which was
      highly depressed at the time; the substantially cyclical nature of that
      business as well as high operating leverages made diversification
      necessary for Sanmina's survival.
    

      In July 2001 Sola and Sanmina took over SCI in a stock swap valued at
      about $6 billion, making it the largest acquisition in the history of the
      electronic manufacturing services industry. The merger saved the new
      Sanmina-SCI about $150–200 million annually through combined
      operational efficiencies and the internal sourcing of components. The new
      company operated manufacturing facilities in 23 countries and had annual
      revenue in the $12 billion range. It was ranked among the five largest
      electronic manufacturers in the world. Sanmina-SCI generated revenue from
      communications, highend computing, personal computers, multimedia, and
      medical/aerospace/industrial sales.
    

      With a technical-sales organization that he now personally deemed the
      largest in the electronic manufacturing industry, Sola set his sights on
      Asia, planning to take advantage of the cheaper labor available in China.
      He explained, "Our approach is winning new-product introductions
      and designs in Japan, but doing the manufacturing in China" (
      
        Electronic Buyers News
      
      , December 10, 2001).
    

      Analysts expressed concerns over Sola's ability to blend the
      business models of Sanmina and SCI. Sanmina provided high levels of
      manufacturing technology to clients, while SCI specialized in
      high-velocity assembly; the two platforms required different customer
      interactions and pricing strategies. Sola maintained that the potential of
      the acquisition outweighed the risks.

History[edit]
Sanmina was founded by Jure Sola and Milan Mandarić in 1980 as a printed circuit board manufacturer. During the 1980s, the company expanded into manufacturing backplanes and subassemblies [2] for the telecommunications industry. During the 1990s, the company grew significantly, producing complete products for major OEM companies and completing a number of strategic acquisitions. Jure Sola became CEO and Chairman of Sanmina in 1991. The company completed an initial public offering on NASDAQ in 1993.
Merger and name changes[edit]
In December 2001, Sanmina merged with SCI Systems of Huntsville, Alabama, for $6 billion in cash, stock, and debt. Although Sanmina was only half as large as SCI at the time, it was in a better cash position because its core telecommunications business was performing well, whereas SCI's lower-margin businesses such as personal computer manufacturing, were struggling.[3] Shortly after, Sanmina-SCI bought E-M Solutions, a bankrupt Fremont, California electronics manufacturer, for $110 million in cash.[4] Then in early 2002, Sanmina acquired Viking Interworks of Rancho Santa Margarita for $15 million ($10.9 million in cash and 390,000 shares of Sanmina stock worth $10.26 per share at the time).[5]
On November 15, 2012, the company changed its name to Sanmina.[6]
On July 2, 2015, the company announced that it had acquired the CertainSource Technology Group.
Change of Leadership[edit]
In July 2017, the Sanmina Board of Directors unanimously voted to appoint Bob Eulau as the new CEO of the company. Eulau is scheduled to replace co-founder Jure Sola as the CEO effective October 2, 2017. After this change, Sola will be assuming the role of Executive Chairman of the Board and continue to maintain a presence in the company.[7]
Operations[edit]
In 2015, the San Jose, California-based company had 38,417 employees in over 27 countries on six continents. It serves clients in the fields of communications, computing, multimedia, semiconductors, defense, aerospace, medical applications, and automotive technology. It provides consulting, design, engineering, logistics, new product introduction, assembly, machining, and fabrication, to produce printed circuit boards, backplanes, electrical cables, injection-molded plastics, enclosures and frames, optics.

Jure Sola1951–
Chairman and chief executive officer, Sanmina-SCI Corporation 
Nationality: American.
Born: 1951, in Croatia.
Education: San Jose State University, BS, 1972.
Family: Married Michelle (maiden name unknown); children: three.
Career: Lika Corporation, 1972–1980, various management positions; Sanmina Corporation, 1980–1991, various management positions; 1991–2001, chairman and president; Sanmina-SCI Corporation, 2001–2002, cochairman and CEO; 2002–, chairman and CEO.
Address: Sanmina-SCI Corporation, 2700 North First Street, San Jose, California 95134; http://www.sanmina.com.
■ Jure Sola founded Sanmina Corporation in 1980 for the manufacture of advanced electronic-circuit cards, back planes, and enclosures for the telecommunications market. In 2001 Sanmina completed its acquisition of the competitor SCI, and in 2002 Sola became the chief executive officer and chairman of the newly named Sanmina-SCI Corporation. As of 2004 the merger was the largest ever in the electronic manufacturing services industry. The combined company was a leading global electronics contract manufacturer, building parts and providing manufacturing-management services for original-equipment manufacturers in the communications, industrial and medical instrumentation, and computer-technology sectors.
BUILDING THE ELECTRONIC MANUFACTURING SERVICES BUSINESS
Born in Croatia, Sola came to the United States as a 17-year-old in 1968. After receiving an engineering degree from San Jose State University, he joined the management of the electronic manufacturing company Lika, producing electronic transducers and control instruments for factory automation. In 1980 he cofounded Sanmina and began serving the company in various management capacities. Sola became chairman and president of Sanmina in 1991.


For most of its history the contract manufacturing business received little respect. Many engineering firms preferred to design products and then let original-equipment manufacturers (OEMs) build the parts. In the 1990s most of the companies that manufactured end products decided to reduce redundant resources and staff by seeking out other firms with which to outsource ongoing production. Sola took advantage of this trend early on to advance Sanmina. Ranked ninth among contract manufacturers in 1997, the company avoided consumer products in order to concentrate on high-end networking and telecommunications applications. Sola stated his business strategy in Electronic Business : "We go after the products that are more difficult to manufacture internally" (August 1, 1998).
Throughout much of its existence Sanmina maintained a 15 percent operating margin, a figure that impressed other contract manufacturers. Sola credited the company's results to the niches that he chose, good management, and a history of closely watched costs. Comparing Sanmina's operations from well after it became profitable to those of its infancy, when the company had almost as much debt as it did revenue, Sola remarked, "We don't run any differently" (Electronic Business, August 1, 1998).
MERGING SANMINA WITH SCI
In the 1990s OEMs and contract manufacturers had begun to operate like identical companies—both had become truly cooperative and integrated. Contract manufacturers like SCI joined OEM design sessions and provided services throughout the supply chain, from designing to box building. SCI was a pioneer in vertical integration, once designing and producing almost everything for the Apollo space project. By the latter part of the 1990s SCI derived most of its revenue from personal computers and government contracts.
In the late 1990s Sola decided that he needed to give Sanmina a more diversified revenue stream by appealing to a broader group of customers; he pursued a friendly merger with the larger SCI. Sola noted, "We built the company to a certain level with niche technology, but we needed to have the fundamentals of system assembly in place" (Electronic Buyers News, December 17, 2001). Acquiring SCI would result in quicker improvements than would developing such capabilities internally. Sanmina derived more than two-thirds of its revenue from the communications market, which was highly depressed at the time; the substantially cyclical nature of that business as well as high operating leverages made diversification necessary for Sanmina's survival.
In July 2001 Sola and Sanmina took over SCI in a stock swap valued at about $6 billion, making it the largest acquisition in the history of the electronic manufacturing services industry. The merger saved the new Sanmina-SCI about $150–200 million annually through combined operational efficiencies and the internal sourcing of components. The new company operated manufacturing facilities in 23 countries and had annual revenue in the $12 billion range. It was ranked among the five largest electronic manufacturers in the world. Sanmina-SCI generated revenue from communications, highend computing, personal computers, multimedia, and medical/aerospace/industrial sales.
With a technical-sales organization that he now personally deemed the largest in the electronic manufacturing industry, Sola set his sights on Asia, planning to take advantage of the cheaper labor available in China. He explained, "Our approach is winning new-product introductions and designs in Japan, but doing the manufacturing in China" (Electronic Buyers News, December 10, 2001).
Analysts expressed concerns over Sola's ability to blend the business models of Sanmina and SCI. Sanmina provided high levels of manufacturing technology to clients, while SCI specialized in high-velocity assembly; the two platforms required different customer interactions and pricing strategies. Sola maintained that the potential of the acquisition outweighed the risks.
