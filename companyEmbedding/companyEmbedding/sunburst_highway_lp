Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping.

Fender Highway One HSS Stratocaster Electric Guitar
OVERVIEW



An Atomic- Humbucker™ in the bridge adds fatness.


The Highway One series! Super-size frets, '70s styling, alnico pickups in the neck and middle positions and great colors take this amazing guitar to the next level.  The neck and middle position pickups on the Highway One Stratocaster HSS guitar produce a more round tone that can sound glassy and great with high gain. Master Greasebucket Tone Circuit rolls off highs without adding bass. The thin nitrocellulose lacquer finish lets the body wood's natural tone shine through, making for one of the most exciting instruments in the Fender family!Check the drop-down menu to the right to select colors and/or other options.

Obviously there are a lot of people out there that think the brand name overcomes the lack of quality or something. Here are the pluses: the finish is nice and the pickups are decent.  Here are the minuses: the neck joint is more than 2 inches thick. The bridge saddles can move side to side even with the strings under tension. The action (meaning the distance from the strings to the frets) is 1/8" or greater (meaning it's not as great as everyone says it is). I was not able to get the action anywhere near good, and to top it off the strings fretted out in the high registers in several places.  The strings on mine were shifted to the left at the neck pickup, meaning that either the neck was crooked or the bridge was installed off-center.  This guitar is like stepping back in time...and not in a good way.  There are other brands in the same price range that eat Fenders alive in every aspect.  You guys keep yours..I'm never buying another Fender again.Reviewed by 44 customersSort byNewestOldestHighest ratingLowest ratingMost helpfulLeast helpfulClear all filtersDisplaying reviews 1-20Back to topPrevious | Next »5/23/2011(1 of 1 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Complete info on this guitar-right here By dearlpitts-jMX4Ofrom pismo,caOk-i was looking for a really great american made guitar a couple months ago and was right where you are -now,reading Musicians friend reviews-i had about $800 to buy a guitar and was down to 3 guitars1-fender highway one hss strat2-the sg faded gibson3-the les paul studio faded gibson-well from reviews at time all pointed to the studio lp,but i really wanted the strat-even though alot reviews madeit sond like the highway hss was not so great-but went with my gut and picked the 3 tone sunburt hss-and man-in 30 yrs and lots of guitars this baby will be with me foreverer.heres why-first love the pure alder wood that i can touch with this thin nitro finish,soo nice to feel the wood.2-jumbo frets i was worried about-no problem,actually seems easier to play and note bending is a real lot of fun-sweet.3-the atomic humbucker is a great sounding very powerfull rocking pickup. alnico5-then the switch to sweet alnico 3 singles in neck and middle give me abililty to play anything-love the fact that leo fenders first choice way back in early 50s was these a3 single coils.4-headstock on this guitr is awsome-jimmy hendrix feel.5-tuners hold tunning perfect-even after using vitage tremolo,which is professional level-everything about this guitar is professional level-came set up out of box(case-thanx to great service of MF people for putting in case for shipping)also got in on MF 15% off weekend so got a gig bag,case,and an expression pedal with extended warranty-and this wonder guitar all for under 700 bucs-top that?Get one soon have a feeling they really wont be around much longer as it looks like the american special will be taking its place-which is fine thats next for me-but this highway will always be with me-truly all i was hoping for and more.am a happy camper-thanx musicians friend.(1 of 1 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review2/11/2010(1 of 2 customers found this review helpful) 5.0A very tweakable guitar III By Anonymousfrom UndisclosedI now own 7 (!!!??!!) of these guitars in ALL the available colors of the series!!! I know....I'm a glutton!! I can't help it;I love the finish, big headstocks, HSS configuration, and larger frets. I do, however, as ALWAYS... have many issues with the pickups. In short....they kinda STINK! But all is not lost.....once I replaced the pickups on all 7 guitars, (all different pickup combinations) they became EXCELLENT guitars! They feel very comfortable and play effortlessly. They just need "improving"! All in all...a very versatile guitar that looks real cool onstage. Just replace the pickups!! I suggest Dimarzio Area 58's and 61's, any good Gibson Humbucker like the Burstbucker 3, or my new favorite...the DiMarzio 36th Anniv. P.A.F. THEN you will have a KILLER AXE worthy of ANY club stage!!!These ARE really great toneful, resonant guitars!(1 of 2 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review8/30/2011(1 of 1 customers found this review helpful) 4.0Still a prized possession By Bevan-P4P_ofrom Atlanta, GASee all my reviews Since I've always been a mostly Les Paul kind of guy, it's been a while since I took this guitar out for a spin. The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the case was it's weight. Most players seem to prefer a lighter instrument, but a little heft doesn't bother me. Though I always use the bridge humbucker and middle pickup combination for a little extra punch, the signature Stratocaster sound is always there. Mine is a few years old, but it's still responsive and hot. To be honest, I might not even still own a strat but for the fact that Jimi Hendrix changed my life when I was 14 years old. I rated it a seven on quality because it required some major adjustments by a guitar technician when it was new, but it's been solid as a rock ever since. The one I have was made in the U.S.A. I've been told that strats made in Mexico are hit-or-miss in terms of quality, but strats made in Japan have a good reputation. My first electric was a Les Paul clone, which I selected because the neck felt good in my hands, which are fairly small. Hendrix had very large hands, and contrary to standard technique, he let his thumb go wherever it wanted. When I buy a guitar, I always choose a neck I can wrap my hand around, and of course I never worry about my thumb.

The pickups really stand out. The bridge has a very airy and open sound that sounds great with a chorus or flanger. The middle has an amazing clean tone in conjunction with the neck pickup. And the neck pickup has a great clear and bassy sound. The neck is very Smooth and comfortable.The Vibrato arm is amazing. I'm blown away that ithas survived. I use it alot to manipulate feedback and effect pedals and I've had no problems with it. It also holds tune very well, I can go nuts on it during a 10 minute Improvisation and I'll only be slightly sharp but not noticably out of tune.Great guitarWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review4/21/2010 5.0great overall guitar By tyler22from fresno,caliI purchased a midnight wine highway one hss and after a set up,this guitar is great. the bridge humbucker may not be for everyone but the other pickups sound fine, it has a great unique tone that works.i was just using a 1936 gibson (original) but i added this to my set and now i love switching back and forth. the tuning machines keep in tune great. and i love the finish on this guitar the nitro looks and feels amazing. i like the character and tone of this guitar way more than the american standard...especially since every  musician i know plays a standard.Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review7/23/2008 5.0Lost on Highway 1! By WhiteDynomite!from Southern California.I have owned this amazing instrument for approximately 2 weeks now and haven't stopped playing it yet. Lol. Seriously, I can't remember the last time I've slept, I haven't showered, I've grown a full beard. lol. My familly keeps calling 2 check and see if I'm alive... I'm alive on highway 1. lol... Seriously. I've played all other guitars. I own several others. I was looking to buy a new 1 and had narrowed it down to the highway 1 HSS, American standard HSS and the Mahogany special. After playing them all I ould not justify spending more money on the others. This guitar has amazing sound, amazing sustain and tone. I don't know how one could justify another purchase within $$$ or so. Also this is 1 beautiful guitar. the collors are vibrant and beautiful. It feels perfect in ur hands as well, and gives better action then a Kung-Fu flick... So if ur lookin for somethin to gig with or what ever u need... U'll find it on highway 1.Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review8/6/2008 3.0Exit Highway One!!

By DoctorDSPfrom MichiganFor a long time, I've been of the opinion that the American-made and Mexican made products were of similar quality.  That may explain why I bought a Mexi-Strat about two years ago.  It was my primary guitar and committed to use it --- but it always seemed lacking somehow.  I shopped for pickups and was ready to replace the pickups and rewire my Mexi when I decided to play some of the American mades and critically listen to the tone through headphones and A LOT of pedal patches and a few different amps.  That convinced me to buy this guitar.  The bridge humbucker sounds right to me and the middle and neck pickups give that nice round bell tone when I'm playing some background stuff during verses.  While the Mexi was well-built for the $$, the tone difference justifies the switch.Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review4/11/2008 5.0awsome By Mike-Pq_rofrom Jessup PASee all my reviews I have played Highway one strats before and they are amazing i almost bought one but when i made my mind to buy the guitar it was gone so i am left stratless again. but its greatWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review9/18/2010 5.0Love love love this guitar By Threpny Bitsfrom North JerseySee all my reviews Ask me a questionI love this guitar ~ the pickups sound excellent, very bluesy on the neck, and very straty everywhere else.  I had the humbucker connected to a pull up knob to switch it is single coil, and it still give that beautiful hendrix chili peppers sound as a single coil. I play classic rock music, and new rock, and this guitar is down right cool.  Only downfall for me is I like flatter necks.Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review3/16/2007 5.0THIS THING ROCKS!!!

I play in a Classic Rock band as well as a Hard Rock band. The single coils sound great. And when you want to play some hard rock or a Classic Rock song with a Gibson sound but with your American Strat feel(cause everyone knows a real musician plays Fender)this guitar is perfect. I tweaked it a little but man just look at the price you cant beat it. This is my main guitar on the road and it holds up just fine. Hey do you hear that oh wait its just sustain and his friend Fender. People will look up on stage and expect you to be playing a gibson with all that sustain. But nope just my Highway One. I went with the Classic Sunburst. This thing does it all. And best of all its 100% American made.Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review3/12/2007 5.0One of the best made By WV Drummer-7pJsOfrom WVSee all my reviews I was at a music store in a nearby city and I seen this guitar, the one with the flat black finish. So I took it down plugged into a epiphone half stack. I immediately fell in love with this guitar. I've played quite a few strats including a '78 american hardtail and some newer mexican strats but this beats them all. That day I was looking to buy a good guitar for playing metal, but since I am used to the way a strat plays and how the contour of the body feels so out of all the others I played this was my favorite. The other guitars I played were a couple of jacksons, The Dean From Hell, a couple of epiphones, and a low-end Dean Dimebag. I was suprised at how clear the humbucker sounded with distortion and the looks are killer but I wish this came as a hardtail model. I've always loved fender but have never been able to find one that was made for me until now. I really hope to own this incredible axe in the near future.Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review3/28/2007 5.0BEUTIFUL By Fender FTWfrom Naples FlI have been playing my strat for about 4 months and man do i love it.  Nothing has broken, and I have no problems with it keeping in tune.  The singles and a humbucker was an awesome idea and it works great.  All my friends are jealous of my highway one strat!Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review3/2/2011 5.0Very cool strat By Maplefretguyfrom IlliniosBought the 3-tone brown model. Took only four days to get it. Would have prefered to have a maple fretboard, but the rosewood feels almost as good. Out of the box it had a couple of blemishes in the finish. One small one in the front and an indent spot in the back. The strings were setup pretty high, but after some adjustment the action started feeling alot better. I guess this being my first americam made strat, I thought it would be perfect right away, but I'm not at all disappointed with how well it sounds and feels. It does have have to somehow live up to my favorite strat of all time, I bought a new japan strat back in 87, with a maple neck and the cool fine tuning knobs, and I'll never sell that, it's just the finest guitar in every way I'll ever have. I was just looking to get a MIA strat that was differant and the HW1 with the cool finish and HSS pup setup filled the bill for me. The jumbo frets are same spacing as my MIJ strat, so it really feels similar. I know over time I'll like it even more tham I do now. It's much lighter than I expected, but that just means my shoulder won't hurt after playing for a long periods. Good guitar and even better value in my opinion....Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review3/12/2007 5.0Great Value Fender Strat By VOX fanfrom Schaumberg IllinoisSee all my reviews WOW...I said..WOW..I had the original Highway One Strat and it was amenic, so I tried the new version and it is an amazing improvment.

It was used, and I got it for right around $500. It didn't play quite right, but after a set up and some new strings, it was great. The Atomic Humbucker is a great pickup, but just wasn't quite what I was looking for tone-wise, so I got online and ordered a DiMarzio 36th Anniversary P.A.F bridge humbucker. Installation was actually more of a pain than I anticipated, as I had to cut a square hole in the pickgaurd and drill 2 body holes to fit it. But, after putting that in, it sounds a thousand times better. The other pickups sound great to me, and overall, I think it is an AMAZING guitar for the money.Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review11/10/2008 5.0A very TWEAKABLE guitar!

I'm a gibson guy and I take pride in my Gibson SG standard. I would have never thought that a guitar half the price would fit me so well. I love the tone and the way the strings play. Its like wax melting under my fingers.. It is amazing. It has a smooth tone on the single coils, and a possibly crunchy tone on the humbucker. I stinking love it.Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this reviewDisplaying reviews 1-20Back to topPrevious | Next »

The pickups produce a round tone that sounds glassy with high gain. Master Greasebucket tone circuit rolls off highs without adding bass. Thin nitrocellulose lacquer lets tone shine through.",

The electric guitar is an instrument that took the world by storm. Rising from nonexistence to prominence in nearly every genre in just a few decades, it's had an impact on the music scene that no one can deny. If you're looking to follow in the footsteps of legends like Jimi Hendrix and Carlos Santana or modern guitar heroes like Dave Grohl and Tom Morello, then choosing a solid-body electric guitar is an important rite of passage. Newly released is the Jimi Hendrix Signature Stratocaster.Solid-body designs are the most common type of electric guitar, owing to their outstanding versatility. The Fender Stratocaster is a solid body electric that is considered to be on the the iconic guitars in rock and roll. To get the Made in USA quality, check out the Fender American Standard Stratocaster. Six strings is par for the course, but if you're adventurous you can also challenge yourself with extended-range 7, 8, 10 or even 12-string guitars. Under those strings are the pickups, which come in two major varieties. Single coils were the original style pickups, and they're still widely in use today. These pickups are known for allowing a little bit of feedback, or hum, giving a vintage character to their sound. The second type of pickup is dual-coil, also known as humbuckers because they cancel out that hum. The two coils have a side-effect that results in a more powerful, heavy tone, making them the go-to pickups for distortion-rich genres like metal, grunge and alternative.The tone is also affected by the wood of the guitar body, which has a subtle impact on the overall character of the sound. Poplar and alder are some of the most common tonewoods, since they create bright, balanced sounds that flatter precision playing. On the other end of the scale you have maple and mahogany, which yield a darker, mellower tone. Other woods, like basswood and ash, lie somewhere in the middle, providing a neutral character that makes them amazingly versatile.Apart from the pickups and body material, one of the other factors to take into account when choosing your guitar is the neck style. It may seem simple at first glance, but there are a lot of differences from one neck to the next. For example, is the back C-shaped or V-shaped? What is the radius of the fretboard? Fretted or fretless? Rosewood or ebony on top, maple or mahogany in back? All of these things distinguish one guitar neck from the next, and you owe it to yourself to do your homework here. It might take some thought in order to figure out for certain what works best for you, but it's worth the effort a guitar that's the right "fit" will be a joy to play.So, take your time and make your decision carefully. With your favorite guitar in your hands and plenty of practice to get to know its ins and outs, you'll be well on your way to earning your own place in music history.

I don't hear any difference between the two. Those who do must really have amazing ears. The american plays a little easier, but the overall feel, the looks (the fat head and the cool matte black finish) won me over - I actually bought this over the american standard, though I was ready to pony up the extra $200 that day based on my decision. Long story short -GREAT guitar, great sound, awesome looks, great price (buffalobrosguitars.com has 'em a lot cheaper, by the way).(38 of 55 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review2/9/2007(28 of 40 customers found this review helpful) 5.0IT'S THE NITRO! By GPaul1from SF, CAComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:After trying many guitars, the reason I settled on the Highway 1 is the sound. The thin nitrocellulose lacquer finish let the wood sustain tones like no 'modern' poly finish. Yes it will wear a lot more but its the trade off worth making. Look at the old nitro finished Strats being sold for thousands. The new pick-ups are excellent as well. The Highway 1 is a keeper.(28 of 40 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review9/6/2007(21 of 26 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Meet my next guitar By hiway1from i'm not sure right nowComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:I was in guitar center to get strings for my acoustic and while i was there i decided to try out a few strats. i've been saving up for a strat for a little while and i've been trying to decide between a highway one and an american standard. I tried out both and i would have to say the I LIKE THE HIGHWAY ONE BETTER! i was surprised, but the h1 sounded better. I love the nitrocellulose laquer finish (i think it adds to the sound and makes the guitar seem lighter. also it doesn't pick up fingerprints.) this is the first time i have like the cheaper of an assortment of products. Note: the highway one instruments are made in america and the neck and body are also but the pickups are made in mexico and some of the hardware is to but im not sure. Don't let this stop you though because it is a wonderful instrument and you can always change the pickups to american made to a full american strat.(21 of 26 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review8/15/2007(19 of 23 customers found this review helpful) 4.0Truly and American Strat By GibSG61from NEBRASKAComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:This guitar is truly an American Strat. The neck and body feels so comfortable and light. Smooth maple neck with a beautiful 3 tone sunburst. I don't like the standard tuners though, if it were locking of vintage slot-holes, it'll be better. I really like the 70's style decal. The pickups are hot and are extremely versatile. VERy VERY versatile. Minus points on the Vintage bridge which should be a 2 point American trem. An LSR nut would be lovely also, but that'd raise the guitar's price. It has a great tone and a great feel and I recommend this for any guitar player, beginner or advance. It's an American Strat with a Mexican price.(19 of 23 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review7/11/2009(19 of 19 customers found this review helpful) 5.0American made Strat at this price...no brainer!!! By Blind Lemon Orangefrom Hartford, Ct.Comments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:Here's the trade off for the $500 you save compared to the American Standard (next step-up USA made Strat) - no microtilt neck adjustment, gig bag instead of the hardshell case...ahh...that's it. Here are the benefits to the Highway One: hot alnico pickups (so much better sounding than the American Standard pups) and jumbo frets (not medium jumbo). You can't go wrong at this price - it's the best deal out there from Fender...I'm shocked they're not completely sold out. Actually, I think I'll buy another today!(19 of 19 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review3/9/2007(13 of 19 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Amazing By SlowhandIHfrom Overland Park, KSComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:I spent over 3 hours in a guitar center trying to choose b/w this beauty or the new highway one w/ humbucker pickups. Needless to say I chose this one, it sounds and looks great, and fit to my needs like a glove. I can play any of my Jazz licks all the way to SRV with amazing tone and clarity. Great intonation as well. Also got this at a steal of a price(550) brand new in the store. The only downside is I play so much that the finish is already starting to fade a little bit... If you want an American Strat that'll blow you away, but not burn a whole in your pocket this is for you.(13 of 19 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review11/12/2007(9 of 9 customers found this review helpful) 5.0This Guitar Does not have a 2 point trem By Bubbanovfrom KatrinalandComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:The nitro topcoat body will shine up real nice given a little time and attention, and the alder body, generally three pieces, will look pretty nice. The guitar has a vintage style 6 screw trem with a steel block, and the trem works far better than any of the asian strat types. I don't personally like the jumbo frets, rather 6150 or smaller, nor do I like the big headstock aesthetically. But these pickups I like, much more than the Highway One Upgrade Tele Alnico 3s, and this tone on the neck pickup, second tone on the bridge pickup, open middle pup ala Jimmie Vaughan works great. I think I'll have the frets milled down a bit or go down to 9.5-44 diameter strings, an extra trem spring and I'll be doing right. Make sure the one you buy has a sunburst or one with a somewhat transparent finish so you can inspect the alder. A few are made of pieces parts bodies, won't effect the use of the guitar but worth avoiding.(9 of 9 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review2/18/2010(9 of 11 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Thank You Fender By Zack Dryerfrom NYComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:I am a Soldier in the Army and contrary to popular beief we do not get paid very well, so when I saw this AMERICAN MADE STRAT for the price I had to have it. I can honestly say that only 2 time in my life have I ever felt the way I did when I held this Strat for the first time, the First was when I met my wife and the socond was when I held my daughter for the first time. This strat is the last electric I will ever buy!!!! Thank you Fender for bringing American made quality down to a price the average American can afford.(9 of 11 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review2/1/2010(7 of 8 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Yep, it's a Strat By Brianfrom Fort Myers, FloridaComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:For 20+ years, I've been wanting a new Strat for myself. Having played 20 or more Mexi's, and about a dozen USA's, including the HW1, I decided on the HW1. The guitar arrived at the store while I was there, so i saw it come off the FedEX truck, get unpacked, and thrust into my hands. I've found the factory setup to be near perfect. Even the shipping strings were usable, and they're still on a week later. The Nitro finish was the deal breaker, as now, most Poly and Acrylic finishes make a guitar feel like a block of plastic. The Nitro is soft, so be careful about dinging it. Every fret played out, on every string, pickups were sunk at the proper angles, no screws were loose. Someone went over this guitar well at the factory. The one gripe I have, is, the nut. It's cut depth is perfect, but it binds strings when using the tremolo. Get some graphite on the way out of the store. This guitar definitely is a keeper.(7 of 8 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review1/19/2007(5 of 6 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Try it, you'll buyit By Dr. Edmundfrom Portland, ORComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:This by far has the best sound of any strat I have ever played, this is do to the satin finish. When I tryied this guitar I wish I would have never bough the standard strat. I recommend this to any guitarist experienced or not. The best value and sound I have ever seen or heard. But don't take my advise for it try it out. I asure you, you wont be disappointed.(5 of 6 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review4/24/2007(5 of 12 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Wonderful guitar! By rrpfrom PittsburghComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:What more can I say?? I simply LOVE this guitar for only $750!! I can't believe we are blessed with an American made guitar for this price. Here are some of the details: The finish looks just like a sticker whcih scratches and dents real easily and the pickups are nice and weak, the way I like them. The neck cuts my fingers when I move up or down the fretboard, which is awesome. I needed to use that box of finger bandages but I couldn't cut myself enough... this solves that problem. I love the gig bag (a $20 value, which comes FREE!!) instead of a nice sturdy case... puts those highly sought after dings in it everytime I drive to a gig and gives it that really worn, dented look that I love and throws it out of tune... also great for resale. Another fabulous feature is that for $750, the guitar comes fully unintonated and poorly set up... which I prefer because I really wanted to spend an additional $50 but I didn't know how to. Simply fabulous! Looks and feels like it was made in a 4th grade shop class... what more could you ask for for a mere $750?? Pocket change really. How does Fender do it? They must be going broke. An American made guitar for only nearly a grand!?! With only $750 to spare, I thought I was going to have to buy one of those Kathy Lee editions made with Balsa wood. I'm hoping next time they don't finish it at all (Custom Shop requests... they get them all the time) and give you a cardboard box to carry it around in... but they'll have to raise the price to $850.(5 of 12 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review6/21/2007(4 of 11 customers found this review helpful) 5.0amazing music machine By SgtSexyfrom Redondo Beach, CAComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:I had been saving up for a standard american strat for a while, but opted for the highway-one becasue i couldn't tell the difference between the two. Its just as rich as the standard, has exactly the same features, and its a little cheaper. My only complaint would be the jumbo frets, but i got ove that really quickly. I use this with my dunlap 535Q crybaby and my Fender Deville, and the sound is unparraleled.(4 of 11 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review6/14/2010(4 of 6 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Amazing Instrument By Cameron Gormanfrom Arroyo Grande, CaliforniaComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:I have had my eye on this particular guitar for a few years now. I had purchased one of the first highway one's in the walnut finish way back when and i have always wanted a classic looking black with a maple fretboard and large 70s headstock. I finally got it and it is nothing short of amazing. Aside from its amazing looks, the playability is just as stunning. The neck feels amazing and is actually very fast. I am so surprised about the bridge pickup. It is so overwound that is actually sounds like a humbucker. Which for me, suits my tastes perfectly. I can get those really good pinch harmonics and smooth distortion. By comparison to my previous highway one the neck and middle pickups are the only things i am not sure of because they are overwound as well and lack in the great Stevie Ray blues tone. That is to stay not as "sparkly" as your traditional stratocaster. All in all, its an extremely comfortable and playable guitar and being an american made one for this price seems too good to be true, but frankly, it is true! I have owned a mexican made standard strat from 2000 and when compared to the highway one. Its a piece of junk. So don't believe people when they say the quality is the same... it isn't! Save up the extra $200 or whatever and go american. You'll be so glad you did.(4 of 6 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review5/7/2007(3 of 9 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Long lost Strat By Anonymousfrom InComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:Had a 1973ish Strat long time ago, had a big fat u-neck hard to reach with pinkie,noisy weak pickups but it had that sound,you know? Since then iv'e had a few Charvels, Ibanez, Jackson,all nice guitars in this price range.I play mostly heavy stuff,(active pickups,locking trem)but I missed that real Strat tone so I ordered a Malmsteen Strat but it was back-ordered so instead of waiting 30 days I decided to settle for a less expensive Highway One,honey blonde,maple neck,3 sweet single coils with 5-way selector for many different tones and they are well balanced, equal output,very clear,kinda spicey but not alive like my Charvel with active picks. So it arrives one day I'm not home and there's a hole the size of a fist through both boxes(cardboard no case)and I can touch the fretboard! thanx ups But it comes out spotless so I'm well pleased with this guitar.The neck is so smooth,and shaped exactly like my Charvel so for my the playability is perfect,low action, fast if you want to,BIG FAT FRETS and FAT HEADSTOCK are cool thats another reason I picked Highway One. The trem is non locking but it stays in tune if you don't dive bomb harmonics, if you do,get a locker. Overall nice quality guitar with great sound,looks and playability I like it alot!(3 of 9 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review7/18/2007(3 of 8 customers found this review helpful) 4.0Nice guitar, but maybe not for everyone By SamsDaddyfrom COComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:I purchased the Highway One strat initially but also bought the American Deluxe V-Neck strat (I got a smoking deal on it so I couldn't pass it up). In comparing the Highway to the V-Neck, I noticed a very distinct metallic tone to the Highway that was not there with the V-Neck. It was sort of brittle and harsh, and the tone pot didn't help to clean it up much. Off the shelf it appears that all of the Highways are not setup very well. If you like the tone from these pickups and get a setup done then maybe the Highway is the right strat for you.(3 of 8 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review6/5/2008(3 of 4 customers found this review helpful) 5.0best strat out there today By A.J.from new jerseyComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:this is simply the best strat fender has put out in years.the highway one does it all from classic/modern tones to every in between. feel/tone/playability hands down beats the american stanands.this strat is simply a top of the line crafted guitar. the late-upgrade 2006 to 2007's are the best.i enjoy playing my higheay ones more than my american standards and my two vintage strats.

The fit, feel and finish were excellent. The pick ups were a little too noisy. I put a set of samarium cobalt noiseless pick ups in and all I can say is WOW!! I love this guitar.

It is an awesome guitar. Great for metal guitarists (pickups distortion friendly).

By Samuelfrom CharlotteComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:I love this guitar. It feels incredible and sounds outstanding. The only issue I have is that it doesn�ۡ���t have the two point trem. Its not a huge deal but its one of the little things that bothered me. But, that�ۡ���s it. The first thing I noticed was how light the guitar was. It is extremely light. It�ۡ���s one of the most comfortable feeling guitars I ever held. The frets are huge. But, I like them. Its very easy to move around and bend. In most reviews Ive read throughout the web, most people love the head stock or hate it. I love it. Looks awesome to me and sets it apart from most other Strats. I did an in store comparison of the American Special and the Highway One. The only differences between the two are the pickups and the finish. The Highway One�ۡ���s thin nitro-cellular finish was one of the big pros for me. I like the feel of it and the look. It supposedly adds an extra dimension to the sound by allowing for better resonance. I�ۡ���m not sure about all that but okay Ill buy the idea. Mostly, I like the idea that it will wear over time and change. I think it adds personality and a uniqueness to the instrument. The Texas Special pickups in the Special are definitely hotter. Which is not to say the Highway One pickups arent hot. When properly dialed in, they will roar and scream. Both are absolute beasts. Between the Alnico V�ۡ���s in Standard American and the Texas Specials, the Highway One pickups are right in between�ۡ����probably leans slightly more to the Texas Special side of the spectrum. Ive always been a huge fan of the Texas Specials. When properly dialed, I think they are the best pickups available (I play mostly blues). But I like the uniqueness of the Highway One pickups. When clean, they are super clear and articulate. When dirty, they get very very nasty�ۡ����in a good way. With some pickups, when the gain is pushed, a lot of tone is lost and it just sounds too harsh. The Highway One pickups cuts through all of that. So, you get the harshness but you don�ۡ���t lose tons of tone. The guitar is awesome.(2 of 2 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review3/31/2011(2 of 2 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Amazing Guitar! By Alexfrom Lansing, MichiganComments about Fender Highway One Stratocaster Electric Guitar:I got a beautiful dark-red version of this guitar in 2008 and it has been amazing ever since. It sounds just as good as many guitars that i have played that cost much, much more(including the American Standard). For any one looking for a great, versatile tone, this is the guitar. It can play anything from classic rock and blues to modern metal. Amazing guitar, especially for the price.(2 of 2 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this reviewDisplaying reviews 1-20Back to TopPrevious | Next »

Overview






The Highway One series! Super-size frets, '70s styling, alnico pickups in the neck and middle positions and great colors take this amazing guitar to the next level.  The neck and middle position pickups on the Highway One Stratocaster HSS guitar produce a more round tone that can sound glassy and great with high gain. Master Greasebucket Tone Circuit rolls off highs without adding bass. The thin nitrocellulose lacquer finish lets the body wood's natural tone shine through, making for one of the most exciting instruments in the Fender family!Check the drop-down menu to the right to select colors and/or other options.

Its amazing. Very bright sounding. The guitar looks great. The finish is thin so after about a month, it will start to wear off and you'll be able to see the wood. It gives it a great vintage look that is almost custom because your wear marks will be different than other people's. Another great thing about the Highway One are the Alnico pickups. They sound great. The frets on this guitar are huge. Your fingers cannot get crammed on this thing. I have never played a guitar that sounded this nice on a clean setting. It sounds like an acoustic. Which was something I really wanted in an electric. This guitar is really light weight. I was surprised. I am used to Les Pauls and this thing felt like it weighed half of it. It feels really solid too. The whammy bar is great. Nothing wrong there. The strings that come with this guitar are "Fender Super Bullets". They work great. They slide nice and sound amazing. The only problem that I had with this guitar is the b string had some serious buzzing. So make sure you check everything on it when you test it out. Other than that, this guitar is the best thing I've played. Very solid, sounds amazing, and it looks awesome. I would definately reccommend this guitar.VSMost Liked Negative Review Do yourself a favor stay awaythis guitar will tune itself 10 cents up right after i tune it correctly i have lost 5 packs of strings putting shaller tuners on it soon.

By Sittin' Bullfrom Delmar, NYComments about Fender Highway One HSS Stratocaster Electric Guitar:How ever one want to say it. This Is one Sweet Strat! I absolutely Love this Guitar. Beautiful sound, appearance, and most of all PLAYBILITY. I'm no expert, and some what of a beginner, but I own a Gibson LP and a Martin..but I can't put this axe down. I went for the Labor Day sale and seen this guitar...and well it was "Love at first sight". What a great value for an American Strat. The neck is so smooth! One can sweat and the neck's not sticky. The frets are great for a beginner or expert. The 70's look is so "COOL MAN". I can't say enough or find the words.(14 of 14 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review2/20/2010(10 of 11 customers found this review helpful) 5.0MIND BLOWING!!! By Gavinfrom Milwaukee, WIComments about Fender Highway One HSS Stratocaster Electric Guitar:Definatly 100% well worth your money. I bought this guitar last summer and it was the best decision I have made my whole life. It has an incredible amount of tones to offer, anywhere from screeching metal to clean blues or distorted rock. The pickups are some of the highest quality and the parts along with the guitar itself will last forever. If you are looking for an electic guitar and are a player of any of those styles of music that I just mentioned, you are making a huge mistake if you dont get this guitar!!!(10 of 11 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review11/21/2006(7 of 8 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Great varied sound from a crisp looking strat By stevefrom old bridge, njComments about Fender Highway One HSS Stratocaster Electric Guitar:A great black, HSS Strat, It has a varied sound from humbucker to single coil, or both at once. Great if your going form sound to sound in a song. Sounds ultra clean on its neck, like a normal fender is, then deep and heavey on the bottom, where the weaker pickup is place, in this case the most powerful. Worth the money.(7 of 8 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review12/10/2009(7 of 8 customers found this review helpful) 5.0WOW...I'm in love By Colby C.from Portland, MaineComments about Fender Highway One HSS Stratocaster Electric Guitar:I bought this guitar in July after I tried it out at guitar center and fell in love with it. I tried it out without even realizing it was a USA strat or a highway one. I had no idea about it, the playability just blew me away. It has THE MOST COMFORTABLE NECK I have ever played! It is also very lightweight, can capture any tone with the atomic humbucker and 2 single coils. This is the easiest and most comfortable guitar that I have ever played. Also the nitrocellulose finish is finally starting to wear to how I play which is beautiful to look at. The bottom line, this is one of if not the best guitar you can get on the market today.(7 of 8 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review5/30/2007(6 of 10 customers found this review helpful) 5.0FENDER HIGHWAY ONE HSS STRAT By guitardude23from McKinney, TXComments about Fender Highway One HSS Stratocaster Electric Guitar:This guitar is absolutely incredible. When I used it, I was amazed at the sound. With a Line 6 Spider III amp, you can get any sound you want out of this guitar. The pickups are great, the humbucker has a rich sound, but the single coils have good sound too. The neck is smooth and isn't sticky or too stiff. It lets your hand move easily up and down. The finish is great and gives a vintage look after the pain starts to wear off. Once I get the money, I will buy this guitar as my first choice.(6 of 10 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review10/5/2009(5 of 5 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Highway 1 HSS strat By Emanfrom San Mateo, CaliforniaComments about Fender Highway One HSS Stratocaster Electric Guitar:This guitar is the best in its class. Its feel is amazing. I personally like the paint job. I have a black one. It is very versatile. The humbucker lets you play EVH while the single coils let you play SRV. I love mine, so if you like it, by all means buy it.(5 of 5 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review4/17/2010(5 of 7 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Best electric guitar By Mick Annefrom Boston, MassachusettsComments about Fender Highway One HSS Stratocaster Electric Guitar:No, I'm not just saying that. It is even better than the Fender Standard American Stratocaster! And, it costs less than the standard as well! Now, the one thing that makes it better is right near the bridge, and that is it's humbucker pickup! It allows you to get some Gibson-esque tones out of a strat, as well as keeping fender's traditional bluesy tones on a strat with it's two single coil pickups. This is the American model (I only buy American fenders), and I'm not even sure if there is a Mexican or Chinese model of it. As I stated above, it has two single coil pickups, and one humbucker, which, by the way, are HOT pickups. They toggle through a five-way switch, as usual, producing tones from biting and quacking on the single coils to screaming on the humbucker. If your into Classic rock like I am this guitar's sounds will suit you, and even metal players will get something out of it. The only problem I had with these pickups is that there is a lot of buzzing in the single coils (but hey, that's expected, right?), but even that doesn't stop them from getting a perfect score. The pickups get 5 stars. Onto the materials that the guitar is made out of. An Alder body gives it it's bright, straty tone, and mine has a nice stain so you can see the wood grain. The neck is bolt on maple (I'm pretty sure, I didn't read the description on this page) with an excellent rosewood fretboard, which, for a guitar with a bolt on neck, gives it pretty sweet sustain. The neck has a really nice and stylish in grain strip in it, that really helps to make the guitar beautiful. Although the body could have been made out of better wood than alder, it is still an excellent wood, just not my favorite. The parts of this guitar get 5 stars. I'll get onto the specifics of the guitar now. It has a traditional style floating bridge, with a standard fender whammy bar (which I hardly use. It has one master volume and two tone knobs (one for the two single coil pickups combined, and one for the Humbucker), which work fine. The tuning heads are again standard Fender (Although every thing on this guitar is standard, you don't need to replace anything, all the parts are quality made), and the head stock has that whole 70's huge headstock look, which I like a lot, and you should too! The specifics of this guitar are excellent (the only problem I had was that the tuning head for the b string was a bit loose, but that's just coincidence, I just used a screw driver to tighten it), so they get another 5 stars. I'm going to wrap this up quickly. If you want to buy an American stratocaster, do your self a favor, pay less than you would for the standard, and buy this. Or, better yet, buy two, if you have the money, because it's wider variety of tones from the humbucker make it totally worth it. I am a Fender fan boy, but that's not why this guitar got a perfect score on everything. It really is that good. Final verdict: A completely perfect score of 5 stars.(5 of 7 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review8/11/2008(4 of 4 customers found this review helpful) 5.0awesome! By Colefrom New OrleansComments about Fender Highway One HSS Stratocaster Electric Guitar:I bought this guitar a few days ago over the american standards and other strat models, and I have to say it was way worth it. If you hear anyone tell you that the "C" shaped neck is uncomfortable to play, that the frets are too big, or that the finish is no good- just ignore them. This is really a beautiful guitar. Its sound ranges from a bluesy mellow sound to a great rock tone.

The humbucking pick-up is absolutely piercing with outstanding sustain. The bridge and middle pick-ups are smooth as satin. The finish is, in my opinion, like the finest silk. The weight is perfectly balanced, so it is comfortable to play on stage. Whether one plays blues or shred, this guitar is perfectly made for either styles. I treat my guitars like they are percussion instruments, and the Highway One HSS guitar can take everything with finesse.(2 of 2 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review1/12/2010(2 of 2 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Excellent Guitar By Johnfrom St. Louis, MOComments about Fender Highway One HSS Stratocaster Electric Guitar:I am an intermediate skill level and spent 6 months searching for the best guitar for the least amount of $$$. I played everything from Standard LP's and SG's, Ibanez Prestige , PRS-several models, Jackson, EVH, ESP and so on. Even more expensive American made Fenders and the Highway one HSS was hands down the best, and I would of spent more $$$ if I found a better guitar(2 of 2 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review3/11/2010(2 of 11 customers found this review helpful) 2.0Do yourself a favor stay away By Brandon Smithfrom Baltimore, MDComments about Fender Highway One HSS Stratocaster Electric Guitar:this guitar will tune itself 10 cents up right after i tune it correctly i have lost 5 packs of strings putting shaller tuners on it soon.

Everyday it seems to grow on me a little more. It need to be professionally set up after I bought it(recomend that for every guitar). The sound is incredible. Lots of pickup combinations with the added humbucker. I also like the unique look. The big 70's head to go along with the more modern body.

I bought this at one of the stores about a week ago. it was the only one they had left, so it was the one on the wall everyone picked up to play, but they got it nice and cleaned up, new strings of my choosing, and got everything adjusted the way i liked it. it sounds amazing. you just cannot get an american made strat for this price. it is an incredible deal. the ONE problem i am having with it is the buzzing and noise on the neck and middle single coil pickups. i am probably going to replace them with Fender Hot Noiseless pickups soon, or maybe even the Lace Sensor Gold set. I dont know yet, i first have to get the money to do that. also, i am very used to playing gibson's. the neck if this guitar is like HEAVEN compared to all my gibson's. fender has given me a GREAT first impression by this guitar. but all i know is, if you are a beginner, get this guitar. if you are freaking Jimi Hendrix, still get this guitar. you will NOT regret it. P.S. it doesnt even have floyd rose, but it stilll doesnt get out of tune when you whammy it!!!!(1 of 1 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this reviewDisplaying reviews 1-20Back to TopPrevious | Next »
