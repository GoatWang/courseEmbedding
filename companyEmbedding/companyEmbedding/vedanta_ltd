Vedanta Limited, formerly known as Sesa Sterlite/Sesa Goa Limited, a Vedanta Group company is one of the world's largest global diversified natural resource majors, with operations across zinc-lead-silver, oil & gas, iron ore, copper, aluminium and commercial power.
For more than five decades, it has been engaged in exploration, mining and processing of iron ore. The company was founded in 1954, as Scambi Economici SA Goa.[2] Since then, it has grown to be one among the top low-cost producers of iron ore in the world. During 1991–1995, it diversified into the manufacture of pig iron and metallurgical coke. It has also developed indigenous and environment-friendly technology for producing high quality metallurgical coke.
In 2007, it became a majority-owned subsidiary[3] of Vedanta Resources Plc, listed on the London Stock Exchange, when Vedanta acquired 51% controlling stake from Mitsui & Co., Ltd. In June 2009, Sesa Goa Limited acquired[4] VS Dempo & Co. Private Limited (now Sesa Resources Limited) along with its fully owned subsidiary Dempo Mining Corporation (now Vedanta Limited) and 50% equity in Goa Maritime Private Limited. In 2010, Vedanta acquired the zinc assets of British miner Anglo American plc.
In 2011 Vedanta Resources bought 58.5% controlling stake in Cairn India, India's largest private sector oil & gas company.[5] In 2015, Sterlite Industries and Sesa Goa announced their merger and finally merged into a single entity in August, 2015.[6] In 2015, Sesa Sterlite changed its name to Vedanta Limited.[7] On April 11, 2017, Cairn India merged with Vedanta Limited to consolidate its position as one of the largest diversified natural resources companies in the world.[8]
Vedanta Limited’s operations are based predominantly in Goa, Odisha, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Punjab Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, while offices are based across various locations in India.[9]

History & Milestones[edit]
Brief Outline[edit]
Scambi Economici Societa Anonyma (SESA), owned by Baron Ludovic Toeplitz, with the financial backing of Alessandro Vassalo, obtained the Orasso Dongor mining lease in Sirsaim, Goa in 1954 and Sesa Goa Limitada was formed. It was bought over in 1955, with equal shareholding, by Gewerkeshaft Exploration e Bergbau and Ferromin S.p.A., a subsidiary of Finsider S.p.A. (of IRI group), which eventually acquired the other half stake in 1963.
Sesa Goa Limitada was incorporated as a private limited company in 1963 under The Companies Act, 1956. In 1979, Sesa Goa Private Limited was formed, with the merger of Sesa Goa Limitada with another mining company in Goa, Mingoa Sociedade Miniera Goesa S.a.r.l. In 1981, Sesa Goa Limited became a public limited company with 60% equity with Indian shareholders. In 1996, Mitsui & Co. Ltd. of Japan acquired Finsider International, along with its 51% stake in Sesa Goa Limited .
In 2007, Vedanta Resources plc, acquired the controlling stake in Sesa Goa Limited from Mitsui & Co. Ltd.
Milestones[edit]
By 1965, Sesa Goa and Mingoa were incorporated as a private limited company under The Companies Act, 1956. The merger happened in 1979 and the new, unified company was called ‘Sesa Goa Pvt Ltd’. The company went public in 1981[10] with 42,000 Indian shareholders, holding 60% of its shares and the remaining 40% held by Finsider International, which later became ILVA International. Sesa Goa had started with iron mining as its core business but slowly, it ventured into barge construction in 1984 at Sirsaim, located in the Bardez taluka of North Goa. Since then, the barge construction unit has been developed into a shipbuilding division.[11]
Growth in the 90s: In 1992, the first phase of a 150,000 ton pig iron plant was commissioned. In the same year, Sesa introduced India’s first low-phosphorus foundry grade pig iron in India and subsequently formalised the business under pig iron division. The pig iron plant is located at Amona, Goa. This plant has an annual production capacity of 250,000 tonnes per annum. Other alliances were formed in the nineties—in January 1995, Sesa Shipping was launched by acquiring transhipper M.V. Orissa. The year also saw the inclusion of 84 new coke ovens. When Mitsui & Co. of Japan bought Finsider International in 1996, it gained 51% stake in Sesa Go. By 1997, Sesa Kembla became a 100% subsidiary of Sesa Goa.
In 1997, A Narrain mines located in Chitradurga, (Karnataka) were purchased. A Supreme Court directive in August 2011 led to suspension of mining activities in the region. In 1999, Sesa Goa started mining operations in Barbil, which has the fifth largest deposit of iron ore and manganese in the world. They started producing high grade iron ore which was exported from the port towns of Haldia and Paradip.
Along with these business ventures, in 1998, the company started the Sesa Community Development Foundation that supported the NCM Sesa Technical School and a new Sesa football academy. The company promoted SESA F.A.
Mergers and Acquisitions - 2000 onwards: Sesa Kembla completed the creation of an indigenous and environment-friendly technology that produced high-quality metallurgical coke. This technology generated power[12] as a by-product. In 2002, Sesa Group becomes the first business of its kind to be certified with OHSAS 18001.[13] In 2003, the Sesa Goa equity in Sesa Industries was raised to 88.25%, impacting the shareholding pattern.
In 2007, Vedanta Resources Plc, a diversified metals and mining group founded by Anil Agarwal, acquired 51% controlling stake[14] in Sesa Goa Ltd. from Mitsui & Co. Ltd. Vedanta Resources is listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of FTSE 100 Index. The deal was worth ₹40.7 billion (US$630 million), making it the largest M&A deal in the industry so far.[15] In 2009, Sesa Goa acquired Goa-based Dempo Group’s mining and maritime businesses for ₹17.5 billion (US$270 million) in an all-cash deal.[4][16] This was the second largest[17] acquisition in India’s iron-ore industry, and it gave Sesa Goa access to Dempo’s 70 million tons of iron-ore mineable resources in Goa. In 2011, Sesa Goa purchased 51% stake in Western Cluster, Liberia for $90 million.[18] The Liberia Gola Forest Community people who also suffered from the civil war believe that the coming of Western Cluster will help to alleviate their suffering and provide employment.

History[edit]
The company was founded in Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1976 by Anil Agarwal, who is also its Group Chairman.[6] Agarwal founded Sterlite Industries, a business operating in the industrial sector in 1976[7] and then in 1986 established Vedanta Resources bringing together a variety of businesses owned by the Agarwal family.[8] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2003 when it raised $876 million through an Initial Public Offering.[9] Meanwhile, in 2006 it acquired Sterlite Gold, a gold mining business.[10] It raised an additional $2bn through an ADR issue in 2007.[11] In 2008 it bought certain of the assets of Asarco, a copper mining business, out of Chapter 11 for $2.6bn.[12] In December 2011 it announced the US$8.67 billion acquisition of Cairn India, a subsidiary of Cairn Energy, heralding its foray in the oil sector.[13]

Aluminium[edit]
In February 2001, Government of India in a major dis-investment deal, approved the sale of its 51% stake in BALCO to Sterlite Industries (SIL) for Rs.551.5 crores.[18] The government of India owns the remaining 49.0%. Incorporated in 1965, BALCO was a profit making Public Sector Company which had played a crucial role in increasing the usage of aluminium over a wide spectrum of products ranging from household utensils to aerospace and defense sectors. Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd: BALCO is headquartered at Korba in the state of Chhattisgarh and is a vertically integrated aluminium producer having its own captive bauxite mines, captive power plants and smelter.[19]
Vedanta Aluminium: Vedanta Aluminium is headquartered in Jharsuguda, Odisha. Vedanta owns 70.5% of the share capital of Vedanta Aluminium and Sterlite owns the remaining 29.5% share capital of Vedanta Aluminium. Vedanta Aluminium produces ingots, billets & wire rods that are sold in the markets around the world. Vedanta Aluminium Limited (VAL) has acquired 24.5% stake in L & T subsidiary Raykal Aluminium. Based on achieving certain milestones, Vedanta Aluminium will fully acquire Raykal Aluminium in phases.[20]
Vedanta is undertaking an expansion program. It plans to produce around 1.5 million tonnes of aluminium in the fiscal year 2016-17 from its Jharsuguda and Korba smelters which will make it the largest aluminium producer in India. Its alumina refinery, located in Lanjigarh, plans[21] to produce 1.5 million tonnes of alumina and depending on availability of domestic bauxite will subsequently ramp it up to 4 million tonnes per annum in the near future.[22] Despite NGO sponsored activism, the Lanjigarh smelter has seen a lot of support from the local people who see it as an important source of employment and livelihood.[23]
Madras Aluminium Company: MALCO is headquartered in Mettur, India. MALCO’s equity shares are listed and traded on the NSE and BSE. It owns 93.9% of MALCO’s share capital and has management control of the company.[24]

Sterlite Energy: Sterlite Energy is headquartered in Mumbai. Sterlite owns 100.0% of Sterlite Energy and has management control of the company.[26]
Criticism[edit]
Environmental damage[edit]
Vedanta has been criticised by human rights and activist groups, including Survival International, Amnesty International and Niyamgiri Surakshya Samiti because of the company's operations in Niyamgiri Hills in Orissa, India that are said to threaten the lives of the Dongria Kondh people who populate this region.[27] The Niyamgiri hills are also claimed to be an important wildlife habitat in Eastern Ghats of India as per a report by the Wildlife Institute of India[28] as well as independent reports/studies carried out by civil society groups.[29] In January 2009, thousands of locals formed a human chain around the hill in protest at the plans to start bauxite mining in the area.[30] The Union Environment Ministry in August 2010 rejected earlier clearances granted to a joint venture led by the Vedanta Group company Sterlite Industries for mining bauxite from Niyamgiri hills.[31]
Vedanta's Alumina Refinery in Lanjigarh was criticised by the Orissa State Pollution Control Board (the statutory environmental regulation body) for air pollution and water pollution in the area. According to Amnesty International, local people reported dust from the plant settling on clothes, crops and food. Vedanta officials claimed there was no dust pollution from the plant at all.[32] An environmental inspection of the plant reported water pollution by the plant including increasing the pH value of the river Vamshadhara below the refinery and a high level of SPM in the stack emissions.[33]
In October 2009 it was reported that the British government has criticised Vedanta for its treatment of the Dongria Kondh tribe in Orissa, India.[34] The company refused to co-operate with the British government and with an OECD investigation. It has rejected charges of environmental damage, saying it may be related to the increased use of fertiliser by farmers.[32]
It was reported in August 2015 that villagers in Chingola, Zambia can smell and taste toxic pollution/leaks from the largest copper mine in Africa owned by KCM.[35]
Safety concerns[edit]
2007 Mining Deaths[edit]
Unsafe mining operations led to 18 deaths and 1,256 injuries involving own employees and contractors in 2007.[36]
Balco, Korba, Chhattisgarh[edit]
A chimney under construction by Gannon Dunkerley & Company at the Balco smelter in Korba, Chhattisgarh collapsed on 23 September 2009, killing at least 40 workers.[37] Balco and GDCL management have been accused of negligence in the incident.[38]
Litigation[edit]
India[edit]
In respect of bauxite mines at Lanjigarh, Orissa, public interest litigations were filed in 2004 by Indian non-government organisations led by the People's Union for Civil Liberties to the supreme court sub-committee regarding the potential environmental impact of the mines. The Ministry of Environment and Forests received reports from expert organisations and has submitted its recommendations to the supreme court. The sub-committee has found "blatant violations" of environmental regulations and grave concerns about the impact of the Niyamgiri mine on both the environment and the local tribal population. The committee recommended to the court that mining in such an ecologically sensitive area should not be permitted.[39]
Human rights[edit]
In February 2010, the Church of England decided to disinvest from the company on ethical grounds.[40] According to the indigenous rights organisation Survival International, the church’s decision is extremely unusual, as it almost always prefers a policy of 'constructive engagement’ to disinvesting.[41]
The Director of Survival International, Stephen Corry, said, "The Church’s unprecedented and very welcome decision sends a strong signal to companies that trample on tribal peoples’ rights: we will not bankroll your abuses. Anybody that has shares in Vedanta should sell them today if they care about human rights."[41]
Vedanta responded by expressing disappointment at the church's actions, and that it is "fully committed to pursuing its investments in a responsible manner, respecting the environment and human rights".[32]
The NGO Amnesty International has also criticised the company's record on human rights.[32][42] It has said, "[I]t is clear that Vedanta Resources and its subsidiaries [...] have failed to respect the human rights of the people of Lanjigarh and the Niyamgiri Hills" adding, "The proposed bauxite mine [...] threatens the survival of a protected Indigenous community [...] However, these risks have been largely ignored and consultation with and disclosure of information to affected communities have been almost non-existent."[43]
Following this controversy, several shareholders have joined in selling their shares because of human rights concerns. This includes the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, the Marlborough Ethical Fund, Millfield House Foundation and PGGM. The British and Norwegian governments have both condemned the project, and Martin Currie Investments has also disinvested following pressure from Survival. The BP Pension Fund has reduced its shareholding over similar concerns.[44] The Economic Times criticised the project in an editorial, stating that if the mine goes ahead it will "impoverish a defenceless populace, perhaps to extinction."[45] On July 2010, the Chief Secretary of the Indian state of Orissa ordered a new investigation into the rights of the Dongria Kondh tribe affected by Vedanta Resources' bauxite mine, in what Survival International characterised as the "...third major blow to Vedanta in a month". The announcement came two weeks after the Indian Minister of Environment and Forests ordered an investigation on the same topic. A government investigation published in March concluded that Vedanta’s mine ‘may lead to the destruction of the Dongria Kondh’.[46]
A four-member panel set up by government of India in the Ministry of Environment and Forests investigated the bauxite mining proposal over Niyamgiri near Lanjigarh in the districts of Kalahandi and Rayagada in Orissa. The area has been traditional habitat of two particularly vulnerable tribal groups, the Dongria Kondh and the Kutia Kondh. The committee submitted its report on 16 August 2010, saying "The Vedanta Company has consistently violated the Forest Conservation Act [FCA], the Forest Rights Act [FRA], the Environment Protection Act [EPA] and the Orissa Forest Act in active collusion with the State officials. ..Allowing mining ... by depriving two primitive tribal groups of their rights over the proposed mining site to benefit a private company would shake the faith of the tribal people in the laws of the land ".[47] Based on a panel report, the government of India has served a show cause notice on the company on why its Stage I environment clearance should not be cancelled.[48]
Legal violations[edit]
In July 2010, Sterlite Industries, a subsidiary of Vedanta Group, was slapped a tax notice of about ₹3.24 billion (US$50 million), and charged with violating several rules by the excise department in India.[49] Excise officialed charged Sterlite Industries with misdeclaration because the company tried to ship out copper waste for separating gold and silver when the waste also contained other precious metals like platinum and palladium.[50]

History[edit]
The company was founded in Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1976 by Anil Agarwal, who is also its Group Chairman.[6] Agarwal founded Sterlite Industries, a business operating in the industrial sector in 1976[7] and then in 1986 established Vedanta Resources bringing together a variety of businesses owned by the Agarwal family.[8] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2003 when it raised $876 million through an Initial Public Offering.[9] Meanwhile, in 2006 it acquired Sterlite Gold, a gold mining business.[10] It raised an additional $2bn through an ADR issue in 2007.[11] In 2008 it bought certain of the assets of Asarco, a copper mining business, out of Chapter 11 for $2.6bn.[12] In December 2011 it announced the US$8.67 billion acquisition of Cairn India, a subsidiary of Cairn Energy, heralding its foray in the oil sector.[13]

Sterlite owns 64.9% of the share capital in HZL and has management control. Sterlite has a call option to acquire the government of India’s remaining ownership interest.[17]
Aluminium[edit]
In February 2001, Government of India in a major dis-investment deal, approved the sale of its 51% stake in BALCO to Sterlite Industries (SIL) for Rs.551.5 crores.[18] The government of India owns the remaining 49.0%. Incorporated in 1965, BALCO was a profit making Public Sector Company which had played a crucial role in increasing the usage of aluminium over a wide spectrum of products ranging from household utensils to aerospace and defense sectors. Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd: BALCO is headquartered at Korba in the state of Chhattisgarh and is a vertically integrated aluminium producer having its own captive bauxite mines, captive power plants and smelter.[19]
Vedanta Aluminium: Vedanta Aluminium is headquartered in Jharsuguda, Odisha. Vedanta owns 70.5% of the share capital of Vedanta Aluminium and Sterlite owns the remaining 29.5% share capital of Vedanta Aluminium. Vedanta Aluminium produces ingots, billets & wire rods that are sold in the markets around the world. Vedanta Aluminium Limited (VAL) has acquired 24.5% stake in L & T subsidiary Raykal Aluminium. Based on achieving certain milestones, Vedanta Aluminium will fully acquire Raykal Aluminium in phases.[20]
Vedanta is undertaking an expansion program. It plans to produce around 1.5 million tonnes of aluminium in the fiscal year 2016-17 from its Jharsuguda and Korba smelters which will make it the largest aluminium producer in India. Its alumina refinery, located in Lanjigarh, plans[21] to produce 1.5 million tonnes of alumina and depending on availability of domestic bauxite will subsequently ramp it up to 4 million tonnes per annum in the near future.[22] Despite NGO sponsored activism, the Lanjigarh smelter has seen a lot of support from the local people who see it as an important source of employment and livelihood.[23]
Madras Aluminium Company: MALCO is headquartered in Mettur, India. MALCO’s equity shares are listed and traded on the NSE and BSE. It owns 93.9% of MALCO’s share capital and has management control of the company.[24]

Sterlite Energy: Sterlite Energy is headquartered in Mumbai. Sterlite owns 100.0% of Sterlite Energy and has management control of the company.[26]
Criticism[edit]
Environmental damage[edit]
Vedanta has been criticised by human rights and activist groups, including Survival International, Amnesty International and Niyamgiri Surakshya Samiti because of the company's operations in Niyamgiri Hills in Orissa, India that are said to threaten the lives of the Dongria Kondh people who populate this region.[27] The Niyamgiri hills are also claimed to be an important wildlife habitat in Eastern Ghats of India as per a report by the Wildlife Institute of India[28] as well as independent reports/studies carried out by civil society groups.[29] In January 2009, thousands of locals formed a human chain around the hill in protest at the plans to start bauxite mining in the area.[30] The Union Environment Ministry in August 2010 rejected earlier clearances granted to a joint venture led by the Vedanta Group company Sterlite Industries for mining bauxite from Niyamgiri hills.[31]
Vedanta's Alumina Refinery in Lanjigarh was criticised by the Orissa State Pollution Control Board (the statutory environmental regulation body) for air pollution and water pollution in the area. According to Amnesty International, local people reported dust from the plant settling on clothes, crops and food. Vedanta officials claimed there was no dust pollution from the plant at all.[32] An environmental inspection of the plant reported water pollution by the plant including increasing the pH value of the river Vamshadhara below the refinery and a high level of SPM in the stack emissions.[33]
In October 2009 it was reported that the British government has criticised Vedanta for its treatment of the Dongria Kondh tribe in Orissa, India.[34] The company refused to co-operate with the British government and with an OECD investigation. It has rejected charges of environmental damage, saying it may be related to the increased use of fertiliser by farmers.[32]
It was reported in August 2015 that villagers in Chingola, Zambia can smell and taste toxic pollution/leaks from the largest copper mine in Africa owned by KCM.[35]
Safety concerns[edit]
2007 Mining Deaths[edit]
Unsafe mining operations led to 18 deaths and 1,256 injuries involving own employees and contractors in 2007.[36]
Balco, Korba, Chhattisgarh[edit]
A chimney under construction by Gannon Dunkerley & Company at the Balco smelter in Korba, Chhattisgarh collapsed on 23 September 2009, killing at least 40 workers.[37] Balco and GDCL management have been accused of negligence in the incident.[38]
Litigation[edit]
India[edit]
In respect of bauxite mines at Lanjigarh, Orissa, public interest litigations were filed in 2004 by Indian non-government organisations led by the People's Union for Civil Liberties to the supreme court sub-committee regarding the potential environmental impact of the mines. The Ministry of Environment and Forests received reports from expert organisations and has submitted its recommendations to the supreme court. The sub-committee has found "blatant violations" of environmental regulations and grave concerns about the impact of the Niyamgiri mine on both the environment and the local tribal population. The committee recommended to the court that mining in such an ecologically sensitive area should not be permitted.[39]
Human rights[edit]
In February 2010, the Church of England decided to disinvest from the company on ethical grounds.[40] According to the indigenous rights organisation Survival International, the church’s decision is extremely unusual, as it almost always prefers a policy of 'constructive engagement’ to disinvesting.[41]
The Director of Survival International, Stephen Corry, said, "The Church’s unprecedented and very welcome decision sends a strong signal to companies that trample on tribal peoples’ rights: we will not bankroll your abuses. Anybody that has shares in Vedanta should sell them today if they care about human rights."[41]
Vedanta responded by expressing disappointment at the church's actions, and that it is "fully committed to pursuing its investments in a responsible manner, respecting the environment and human rights".[32]
The NGO Amnesty International has also criticised the company's record on human rights.[32][42] It has said, "[I]t is clear that Vedanta Resources and its subsidiaries [...] have failed to respect the human rights of the people of Lanjigarh and the Niyamgiri Hills" adding, "The proposed bauxite mine [...] threatens the survival of a protected Indigenous community [...] However, these risks have been largely ignored and consultation with and disclosure of information to affected communities have been almost non-existent."[43]
Following this controversy, several shareholders have joined in selling their shares because of human rights concerns. This includes the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, the Marlborough Ethical Fund, Millfield House Foundation and PGGM. The British and Norwegian governments have both condemned the project, and Martin Currie Investments has also disinvested following pressure from Survival. The BP Pension Fund has reduced its shareholding over similar concerns.[44] The Economic Times criticised the project in an editorial, stating that if the mine goes ahead it will "impoverish a defenceless populace, perhaps to extinction."[45] On July 2010, the Chief Secretary of the Indian state of Orissa ordered a new investigation into the rights of the Dongria Kondh tribe affected by Vedanta Resources' bauxite mine, in what Survival International characterised as the "...third major blow to Vedanta in a month". The announcement came two weeks after the Indian Minister of Environment and Forests ordered an investigation on the same topic. A government investigation published in March concluded that Vedanta’s mine ‘may lead to the destruction of the Dongria Kondh’.[46]
A four-member panel set up by government of India in the Ministry of Environment and Forests investigated the bauxite mining proposal over Niyamgiri near Lanjigarh in the districts of Kalahandi and Rayagada in Orissa. The area has been traditional habitat of two particularly vulnerable tribal groups, the Dongria Kondh and the Kutia Kondh. The committee submitted its report on 16 August 2010, saying "The Vedanta Company has consistently violated the Forest Conservation Act [FCA], the Forest Rights Act [FRA], the Environment Protection Act [EPA] and the Orissa Forest Act in active collusion with the State officials. ..Allowing mining ... by depriving two primitive tribal groups of their rights over the proposed mining site to benefit a private company would shake the faith of the tribal people in the laws of the land ".[47] Based on a panel report, the government of India has served a show cause notice on the company on why its Stage I environment clearance should not be cancelled.[48]
Legal violations[edit]
In July 2010, Sterlite Industries, a subsidiary of Vedanta Group, was slapped a tax notice of about ₹3.24 billion (US$50 million), and charged with violating several rules by the excise department in India.[49] Excise officialed charged Sterlite Industries with misdeclaration because the company tried to ship out copper waste for separating gold and silver when the waste also contained other precious metals like platinum and palladium.[50]

History[edit]
The company was founded in Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1976 by Anil Agarwal, who is also its Group Chairman.[6] Agarwal founded Sterlite Industries, a business operating in the industrial sector in 1976[7] and then in 1986 established Vedanta Resources bringing together a variety of businesses owned by the Agarwal family.[8] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2003 when it raised $876 million through an Initial Public Offering.[9] Meanwhile, in 2006 it acquired Sterlite Gold, a gold mining business.[10] It raised an additional $2bn through an ADR issue in 2007.[11] In 2008 it bought certain of the assets of Asarco, a copper mining business, out of Chapter 11 for $2.6bn.[12] In December 2011 it announced the US$8.67 billion acquisition of Cairn India, a subsidiary of Cairn Energy, heralding its foray in the oil sector.[13]

Sterlite owns 64.9% of the share capital in HZL and has management control. Sterlite has a call option to acquire the government of India’s remaining ownership interest.[17]
Aluminium[edit]
In February 2001, Government of India in a major dis-investment deal, approved the sale of its 51% stake in BALCO to Sterlite Industries (SIL) for Rs.551.5 crores.[18] The government of India owns the remaining 49.0%. Incorporated in 1965, BALCO was a profit making Public Sector Company which had played a crucial role in increasing the usage of aluminium over a wide spectrum of products ranging from household utensils to aerospace and defense sectors. Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd: BALCO is headquartered at Korba in the state of Chhattisgarh and is a vertically integrated aluminium producer having its own captive bauxite mines, captive power plants and smelter.[19]
Vedanta Aluminium: Vedanta Aluminium is headquartered in Jharsuguda, Odisha. Vedanta owns 70.5% of the share capital of Vedanta Aluminium and Sterlite owns the remaining 29.5% share capital of Vedanta Aluminium. Vedanta Aluminium produces ingots, billets & wire rods that are sold in the markets around the world. Vedanta Aluminium Limited (VAL) has acquired 24.5% stake in L & T subsidiary Raykal Aluminium. Based on achieving certain milestones, Vedanta Aluminium will fully acquire Raykal Aluminium in phases.[20]
Vedanta is undertaking an expansion program. It plans to produce around 1.5 million tonnes of aluminium in the fiscal year 2016-17 from its Jharsuguda and Korba smelters which will make it the largest aluminium producer in India. Its alumina refinery, located in Lanjigarh, plans[21] to produce 1.5 million tonnes of alumina and depending on availability of domestic bauxite will subsequently ramp it up to 4 million tonnes per annum in the near future.[22] Despite NGO sponsored activism, the Lanjigarh smelter has seen a lot of support from the local people who see it as an important source of employment and livelihood.[23]
Madras Aluminium Company: MALCO is headquartered in Mettur, India. MALCO’s equity shares are listed and traded on the NSE and BSE. It owns 93.9% of MALCO’s share capital and has management control of the company.[24]

Sterlite Energy: Sterlite Energy is headquartered in Mumbai. Sterlite owns 100.0% of Sterlite Energy and has management control of the company.[26]
Criticism[edit]
Environmental damage[edit]
Vedanta has been criticised by human rights and activist groups, including Survival International, Amnesty International and Niyamgiri Surakshya Samiti because of the company's operations in Niyamgiri Hills in Orissa, India that are said to threaten the lives of the Dongria Kondh people who populate this region.[27] The Niyamgiri hills are also claimed to be an important wildlife habitat in Eastern Ghats of India as per a report by the Wildlife Institute of India[28] as well as independent reports/studies carried out by civil society groups.[29] In January 2009, thousands of locals formed a human chain around the hill in protest at the plans to start bauxite mining in the area.[30] The Union Environment Ministry in August 2010 rejected earlier clearances granted to a joint venture led by the Vedanta Group company Sterlite Industries for mining bauxite from Niyamgiri hills.[31]
Vedanta's Alumina Refinery in Lanjigarh was criticised by the Orissa State Pollution Control Board (the statutory environmental regulation body) for air pollution and water pollution in the area. According to Amnesty International, local people reported dust from the plant settling on clothes, crops and food. Vedanta officials claimed there was no dust pollution from the plant at all.[32] An environmental inspection of the plant reported water pollution by the plant including increasing the pH value of the river Vamshadhara below the refinery and a high level of SPM in the stack emissions.[33]
In October 2009 it was reported that the British government has criticised Vedanta for its treatment of the Dongria Kondh tribe in Orissa, India.[34] The company refused to co-operate with the British government and with an OECD investigation. It has rejected charges of environmental damage, saying it may be related to the increased use of fertiliser by farmers.[32]
It was reported in August 2015 that villagers in Chingola, Zambia can smell and taste toxic pollution/leaks from the largest copper mine in Africa owned by KCM.[35]
Safety concerns[edit]
2007 Mining Deaths[edit]
Unsafe mining operations led to 18 deaths and 1,256 injuries involving own employees and contractors in 2007.[36]
Balco, Korba, Chhattisgarh[edit]
A chimney under construction by Gannon Dunkerley & Company at the Balco smelter in Korba, Chhattisgarh collapsed on 23 September 2009, killing at least 40 workers.[37] Balco and GDCL management have been accused of negligence in the incident.[38]
Litigation[edit]
India[edit]
In respect of bauxite mines at Lanjigarh, Orissa, public interest litigations were filed in 2004 by Indian non-government organisations led by the People's Union for Civil Liberties to the supreme court sub-committee regarding the potential environmental impact of the mines. The Ministry of Environment and Forests received reports from expert organisations and has submitted its recommendations to the supreme court. The sub-committee has found "blatant violations" of environmental regulations and grave concerns about the impact of the Niyamgiri mine on both the environment and the local tribal population. The committee recommended to the court that mining in such an ecologically sensitive area should not be permitted.[39]
Human rights[edit]
In February 2010, the Church of England decided to disinvest from the company on ethical grounds.[40] According to the indigenous rights organisation Survival International, the church’s decision is extremely unusual, as it almost always prefers a policy of 'constructive engagement’ to disinvesting.[41]
The Director of Survival International, Stephen Corry, said, "The Church’s unprecedented and very welcome decision sends a strong signal to companies that trample on tribal peoples’ rights: we will not bankroll your abuses. Anybody that has shares in Vedanta should sell them today if they care about human rights."[41]
Vedanta responded by expressing disappointment at the church's actions, and that it is "fully committed to pursuing its investments in a responsible manner, respecting the environment and human rights".[32]
The NGO Amnesty International has also criticised the company's record on human rights.[32][42] It has said, "[I]t is clear that Vedanta Resources and its subsidiaries [...] have failed to respect the human rights of the people of Lanjigarh and the Niyamgiri Hills" adding, "The proposed bauxite mine [...] threatens the survival of a protected Indigenous community [...] However, these risks have been largely ignored and consultation with and disclosure of information to affected communities have been almost non-existent."[43]
Following this controversy, several shareholders have joined in selling their shares because of human rights concerns. This includes the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, the Marlborough Ethical Fund, Millfield House Foundation and PGGM. The British and Norwegian governments have both condemned the project, and Martin Currie Investments has also disinvested following pressure from Survival. The BP Pension Fund has reduced its shareholding over similar concerns.[44] The Economic Times criticised the project in an editorial, stating that if the mine goes ahead it will "impoverish a defenceless populace, perhaps to extinction."[45] On July 2010, the Chief Secretary of the Indian state of Orissa ordered a new investigation into the rights of the Dongria Kondh tribe affected by Vedanta Resources' bauxite mine, in what Survival International characterised as the "...third major blow to Vedanta in a month". The announcement came two weeks after the Indian Minister of Environment and Forests ordered an investigation on the same topic. A government investigation published in March concluded that Vedanta’s mine ‘may lead to the destruction of the Dongria Kondh’.[46]
A four-member panel set up by government of India in the Ministry of Environment and Forests investigated the bauxite mining proposal over Niyamgiri near Lanjigarh in the districts of Kalahandi and Rayagada in Orissa. The area has been traditional habitat of two particularly vulnerable tribal groups, the Dongria Kondh and the Kutia Kondh. The committee submitted its report on 16 August 2010, saying "The Vedanta Company has consistently violated the Forest Conservation Act [FCA], the Forest Rights Act [FRA], the Environment Protection Act [EPA] and the Orissa Forest Act in active collusion with the State officials. ..Allowing mining ... by depriving two primitive tribal groups of their rights over the proposed mining site to benefit a private company would shake the faith of the tribal people in the laws of the land ".[47] Based on a panel report, the government of India has served a show cause notice on the company on why its Stage I environment clearance should not be cancelled.[48]
Legal violations[edit]
In July 2010, Sterlite Industries, a subsidiary of Vedanta Group, was slapped a tax notice of about ₹3.24 billion (US$50 million), and charged with violating several rules by the excise department in India.[49] Excise officialed charged Sterlite Industries with misdeclaration because the company tried to ship out copper waste for separating gold and silver when the waste also contained other precious metals like platinum and palladium.[50]

History[edit]
The company was founded in Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1976 by Anil Agarwal, who is also its Group Chairman.[6] Agarwal founded Sterlite Industries, a business operating in the industrial sector in 1976[7] and then in 1986 established Vedanta Resources bringing together a variety of businesses owned by the Agarwal family.[8] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2003 when it raised $876 million through an Initial Public Offering.[9] Meanwhile, in 2006 it acquired Sterlite Gold, a gold mining business.[10] It raised an additional $2bn through an ADR issue in 2007.[11] In 2008 it bought certain of the assets of Asarco, a copper mining business, out of Chapter 11 for $2.6bn.[12] In December 2011 it announced the US$8.67 billion acquisition of Cairn India, a subsidiary of Cairn Energy, heralding its foray in the oil sector.[13]

Sterlite owns 64.9% of the share capital in HZL and has management control. Sterlite has a call option to acquire the government of India’s remaining ownership interest.[17]
Aluminium[edit]
In February 2001, Government of India in a major dis-investment deal, approved the sale of its 51% stake in BALCO to Sterlite Industries (SIL) for Rs.551.5 crores.[18] The government of India owns the remaining 49.0%. Incorporated in 1965, BALCO was a profit making Public Sector Company which had played a crucial role in increasing the usage of aluminium over a wide spectrum of products ranging from household utensils to aerospace and defense sectors. Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd: BALCO is headquartered at Korba in the state of Chhattisgarh and is a vertically integrated aluminium producer having its own captive bauxite mines, captive power plants and smelter.[19]
Vedanta Aluminium: Vedanta Aluminium is headquartered in Jharsuguda, Odisha. Vedanta owns 70.5% of the share capital of Vedanta Aluminium and Sterlite owns the remaining 29.5% share capital of Vedanta Aluminium. Vedanta Aluminium produces ingots, billets & wire rods that are sold in the markets around the world. Vedanta Aluminium Limited (VAL) has acquired 24.5% stake in L & T subsidiary Raykal Aluminium. Based on achieving certain milestones, Vedanta Aluminium will fully acquire Raykal Aluminium in phases.[20]
Vedanta is undertaking an expansion program. It plans to produce around 1.5 million tonnes of aluminium in the fiscal year 2016-17 from its Jharsuguda and Korba smelters which will make it the largest aluminium producer in India. Its alumina refinery, located in Lanjigarh, plans[21] to produce 1.5 million tonnes of alumina and depending on availability of domestic bauxite will subsequently ramp it up to 4 million tonnes per annum in the near future.[22] Despite NGO sponsored activism, the Lanjigarh smelter has seen a lot of support from the local people who see it as an important source of employment and livelihood.[23]
Madras Aluminium Company: MALCO is headquartered in Mettur, India. MALCO’s equity shares are listed and traded on the NSE and BSE. It owns 93.9% of MALCO’s share capital and has management control of the company.[24]

Sterlite Energy: Sterlite Energy is headquartered in Mumbai. Sterlite owns 100.0% of Sterlite Energy and has management control of the company.[26]
Criticism[edit]
Environmental damage[edit]
Vedanta has been criticised by human rights and activist groups, including Survival International, Amnesty International and Niyamgiri Surakshya Samiti because of the company's operations in Niyamgiri Hills in Orissa, India that are said to threaten the lives of the Dongria Kondh people who populate this region.[27] The Niyamgiri hills are also claimed to be an important wildlife habitat in Eastern Ghats of India as per a report by the Wildlife Institute of India[28] as well as independent reports/studies carried out by civil society groups.[29] In January 2009, thousands of locals formed a human chain around the hill in protest at the plans to start bauxite mining in the area.[30] The Union Environment Ministry in August 2010 rejected earlier clearances granted to a joint venture led by the Vedanta Group company Sterlite Industries for mining bauxite from Niyamgiri hills.[31]
Vedanta's Alumina Refinery in Lanjigarh was criticised by the Orissa State Pollution Control Board (the statutory environmental regulation body) for air pollution and water pollution in the area. According to Amnesty International, local people reported dust from the plant settling on clothes, crops and food. Vedanta officials claimed there was no dust pollution from the plant at all.[32] An environmental inspection of the plant reported water pollution by the plant including increasing the pH value of the river Vamshadhara below the refinery and a high level of SPM in the stack emissions.[33]
In October 2009 it was reported that the British government has criticised Vedanta for its treatment of the Dongria Kondh tribe in Orissa, India.[34] The company refused to co-operate with the British government and with an OECD investigation. It has rejected charges of environmental damage, saying it may be related to the increased use of fertiliser by farmers.[32]
It was reported in August 2015 that villagers in Chingola, Zambia can smell and taste toxic pollution/leaks from the largest copper mine in Africa owned by KCM.[35]
Safety concerns[edit]
2007 Mining Deaths[edit]
Unsafe mining operations led to 18 deaths and 1,256 injuries involving own employees and contractors in 2007.[36]
Balco, Korba, Chhattisgarh[edit]
A chimney under construction by Gannon Dunkerley & Company at the Balco smelter in Korba, Chhattisgarh collapsed on 23 September 2009, killing at least 40 workers.[37] Balco and GDCL management have been accused of negligence in the incident.[38]
Litigation[edit]
India[edit]
In respect of bauxite mines at Lanjigarh, Orissa, public interest litigations were filed in 2004 by Indian non-government organisations led by the People's Union for Civil Liberties to the supreme court sub-committee regarding the potential environmental impact of the mines. The Ministry of Environment and Forests received reports from expert organisations and has submitted its recommendations to the supreme court. The sub-committee has found "blatant violations" of environmental regulations and grave concerns about the impact of the Niyamgiri mine on both the environment and the local tribal population. The committee recommended to the court that mining in such an ecologically sensitive area should not be permitted.[39]
Human rights[edit]
In February 2010, the Church of England decided to disinvest from the company on ethical grounds.[40] According to the indigenous rights organisation Survival International, the church’s decision is extremely unusual, as it almost always prefers a policy of 'constructive engagement’ to disinvesting.[41]
The Director of Survival International, Stephen Corry, said, "The Church’s unprecedented and very welcome decision sends a strong signal to companies that trample on tribal peoples’ rights: we will not bankroll your abuses. Anybody that has shares in Vedanta should sell them today if they care about human rights."[41]
Vedanta responded by expressing disappointment at the church's actions, and that it is "fully committed to pursuing its investments in a responsible manner, respecting the environment and human rights".[32]
The NGO Amnesty International has also criticised the company's record on human rights.[32][42] It has said, "[I]t is clear that Vedanta Resources and its subsidiaries [...] have failed to respect the human rights of the people of Lanjigarh and the Niyamgiri Hills" adding, "The proposed bauxite mine [...] threatens the survival of a protected Indigenous community [...] However, these risks have been largely ignored and consultation with and disclosure of information to affected communities have been almost non-existent."[43]
Following this controversy, several shareholders have joined in selling their shares because of human rights concerns. This includes the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, the Marlborough Ethical Fund, Millfield House Foundation and PGGM. The British and Norwegian governments have both condemned the project, and Martin Currie Investments has also disinvested following pressure from Survival. The BP Pension Fund has reduced its shareholding over similar concerns.[44] The Economic Times criticised the project in an editorial, stating that if the mine goes ahead it will "impoverish a defenceless populace, perhaps to extinction."[45] On July 2010, the Chief Secretary of the Indian state of Orissa ordered a new investigation into the rights of the Dongria Kondh tribe affected by Vedanta Resources' bauxite mine, in what Survival International characterised as the "...third major blow to Vedanta in a month". The announcement came two weeks after the Indian Minister of Environment and Forests ordered an investigation on the same topic. A government investigation published in March concluded that Vedanta’s mine ‘may lead to the destruction of the Dongria Kondh’.[46]
A four-member panel set up by government of India in the Ministry of Environment and Forests investigated the bauxite mining proposal over Niyamgiri near Lanjigarh in the districts of Kalahandi and Rayagada in Orissa. The area has been traditional habitat of two particularly vulnerable tribal groups, the Dongria Kondh and the Kutia Kondh. The committee submitted its report on 16 August 2010, saying "The Vedanta Company has consistently violated the Forest Conservation Act [FCA], the Forest Rights Act [FRA], the Environment Protection Act [EPA] and the Orissa Forest Act in active collusion with the State officials. ..Allowing mining ... by depriving two primitive tribal groups of their rights over the proposed mining site to benefit a private company would shake the faith of the tribal people in the laws of the land ".[47] Based on a panel report, the government of India has served a show cause notice on the company on why its Stage I environment clearance should not be cancelled.[48]
Legal violations[edit]
In July 2010, Sterlite Industries, a subsidiary of Vedanta Group, was slapped a tax notice of about ₹3.24 billion (US$50 million), and charged with violating several rules by the excise department in India.[49] Excise officialed charged Sterlite Industries with misdeclaration because the company tried to ship out copper waste for separating gold and silver when the waste also contained other precious metals like platinum and palladium.[50]

Vedanta Limited, formerly known as Sesa Sterlite/Sesa Goa Limited, a Vedanta Group company is one of the world's largest global diversified natural resource majors, with operations across zinc-lead-silver, oil & gas, iron ore, copper, aluminium and commercial power.
For more than five decades, it has been engaged in exploration, mining and processing of iron ore. The company was founded in 1954, as Scambi Economici SA Goa.[2] Since then, it has grown to be one among the top low-cost producers of iron ore in the world. During 1991–1995, it diversified into the manufacture of pig iron and metallurgical coke. It has also developed indigenous and environment-friendly technology for producing high quality metallurgical coke.
In 2007, it became a majority-owned subsidiary[3] of Vedanta Resources Plc, listed on the London Stock Exchange, when Vedanta acquired 51% controlling stake from Mitsui & Co., Ltd.

History & Milestones[edit]
Brief Outline[edit]
Scambi Economici Societa Anonyma (SESA), owned by Baron Ludovic Toeplitz, with the financial backing of Alessandro Vassalo, obtained the Orasso Dongor mining lease in Sirsaim, Goa in 1954 and Sesa Goa Limitada was formed. It was bought over in 1955, with equal shareholding, by Gewerkeshaft Exploration e Bergbau and Ferromin S.p.A., a subsidiary of Finsider S.p.A. (of IRI group), which eventually acquired the other half stake in 1963.
Sesa Goa Limitada was incorporated as a private limited company in 1963 under The Companies Act, 1956. In 1979, Sesa Goa Private Limited was formed, with the merger of Sesa Goa Limitada with another mining company in Goa, Mingoa Sociedade Miniera Goesa S.a.r.l. In 1981, Sesa Goa Limited became a public limited company with 60% equity with Indian shareholders. In 1996, Mitsui & Co. Ltd. of Japan acquired Finsider International, along with its 51% stake in Sesa Goa Limited .
In 2007, Vedanta Resources plc, acquired the controlling stake in Sesa Goa Limited from Mitsui & Co. Ltd.
Milestones[edit]
By 1965, Sesa Goa and Mingoa were incorporated as a private limited company under The Companies Act, 1956. The merger happened in 1979 and the new, unified company was called ‘Sesa Goa Pvt Ltd’. The company went public in 1981[10] with 42,000 Indian shareholders, holding 60% of its shares and the remaining 40% held by Finsider International, which later became ILVA International. Sesa Goa had started with iron mining as its core business but slowly, it ventured into barge construction in 1984 at Sirsaim, located in the Bardez taluka of North Goa. Since then, the barge construction unit has been developed into a shipbuilding division.[11]
Growth in the 90s: In 1992, the first phase of a 150,000 ton pig iron plant was commissioned. In the same year, Sesa introduced India’s first low-phosphorus foundry grade pig iron in India and subsequently formalised the business under pig iron division. The pig iron plant is located at Amona, Goa. This plant has an annual production capacity of 250,000 tonnes per annum. Other alliances were formed in the nineties—in January 1995, Sesa Shipping was launched by acquiring transhipper M.V. Orissa. The year also saw the inclusion of 84 new coke ovens. When Mitsui & Co. of Japan bought Finsider International in 1996, it gained 51% stake in Sesa Go. By 1997, Sesa Kembla became a 100% subsidiary of Sesa Goa.
In 1997, A Narrain mines located in Chitradurga, (Karnataka) were purchased. A Supreme Court directive in August 2011 led to suspension of mining activities in the region. In 1999, Sesa Goa started mining operations in Barbil, which has the fifth largest deposit of iron ore and manganese in the world. They started producing high grade iron ore which was exported from the port towns of Haldia and Paradip.
Along with these business ventures, in 1998, the company started the Sesa Community Development Foundation that supported the NCM Sesa Technical School and a new Sesa football academy. The company promoted SESA F.A.
Mergers and Acquisitions - 2000 onwards: Sesa Kembla completed the creation of an indigenous and environment-friendly technology that produced high-quality metallurgical coke. This technology generated power[12] as a by-product. In 2002, Sesa Group becomes the first business of its kind to be certified with OHSAS 18001.[13] In 2003, the Sesa Goa equity in Sesa Industries was raised to 88.25%, impacting the shareholding pattern.
In 2007, Vedanta Resources Plc, a diversified metals and mining group founded by Anil Agarwal, acquired 51% controlling stake[14] in Sesa Goa Ltd. from Mitsui & Co. Ltd. Vedanta Resources is listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of FTSE 100 Index. The deal was worth ₹40.7 billion (US$630 million), making it the largest M&A deal in the industry so far.[15] In 2009, Sesa Goa acquired Goa-based Dempo Group’s mining and maritime businesses for ₹17.5 billion (US$270 million) in an all-cash deal.[4][16] This was the second largest[17] acquisition in India’s iron-ore industry, and it gave Sesa Goa access to Dempo’s 70 million tons of iron-ore mineable resources in Goa. In 2011, Sesa Goa purchased 51% stake in Western Cluster, Liberia for $90 million.[18] The Liberia Gola Forest Community people who also suffered from the civil war believe that the coming of Western Cluster will help to alleviate their suffering and provide employment.

History & Milestones[edit]
Brief Outline[edit]
Scambi Economici Societa Anonyma (SESA), owned by Baron Ludovic Toeplitz, with the financial backing of Alessandro Vassalo, obtained the Orasso Dongor mining lease in Sirsaim, Goa in 1954 and Sesa Goa Limitada was formed. It was bought over in 1955, with equal shareholding, by Gewerkeshaft Exploration e Bergbau and Ferromin S.p.A., a subsidiary of Finsider S.p.A. (of IRI group), which eventually acquired the other half stake in 1963.
Sesa Goa Limitada was incorporated as a private limited company in 1963 under The Companies Act, 1956. In 1979, Sesa Goa Private Limited was formed, with the merger of Sesa Goa Limitada with another mining company in Goa, Mingoa Sociedade Miniera Goesa S.a.r.l. In 1981, Sesa Goa Limited became a public limited company with 60% equity with Indian shareholders. In 1996, Mitsui & Co. Ltd. of Japan acquired Finsider International, along with its 51% stake in Sesa Goa Limited .
In 2007, Vedanta Resources plc, acquired the controlling stake in Sesa Goa Limited from Mitsui & Co. Ltd.
Milestones[edit]
By 1965, Sesa Goa and Mingoa were incorporated as a private limited company under The Companies Act, 1956. The merger happened in 1979 and the new, unified company was called ‘Sesa Goa Pvt Ltd’. The company went public in 1981[10] with 42,000 Indian shareholders, holding 60% of its shares and the remaining 40% held by Finsider International, which later became ILVA International. Sesa Goa had started with iron mining as its core business but slowly, it ventured into barge construction in 1984 at Sirsaim, located in the Bardez taluka of North Goa. Since then, the barge construction unit has been developed into a shipbuilding division.[11]
Growth in the 90s: In 1992, the first phase of a 150,000 ton pig iron plant was commissioned. In the same year, Sesa introduced India’s first low-phosphorus foundry grade pig iron in India and subsequently formalised the business under pig iron division. The pig iron plant is located at Amona, Goa. This plant has an annual production capacity of 250,000 tonnes per annum. Other alliances were formed in the nineties—in January 1995, Sesa Shipping was launched by acquiring transhipper M.V. Orissa. The year also saw the inclusion of 84 new coke ovens. When Mitsui & Co. of Japan bought Finsider International in 1996, it gained 51% stake in Sesa Go. By 1997, Sesa Kembla became a 100% subsidiary of Sesa Goa.
In 1997, A Narrain mines located in Chitradurga, (Karnataka) were purchased. A Supreme Court directive in August 2011 led to suspension of mining activities in the region. In 1999, Sesa Goa started mining operations in Barbil, which has the fifth largest deposit of iron ore and manganese in the world. They started producing high grade iron ore which was exported from the port towns of Haldia and Paradip.
Along with these business ventures, in 1998, the company started the Sesa Community Development Foundation that supported the NCM Sesa Technical School and a new Sesa football academy. The company promoted SESA F.A.
Mergers and Acquisitions - 2000 onwards: Sesa Kembla completed the creation of an indigenous and environment-friendly technology that produced high-quality metallurgical coke. This technology generated power[12] as a by-product. In 2002, Sesa Group becomes the first business of its kind to be certified with OHSAS 18001.[13] In 2003, the Sesa Goa equity in Sesa Industries was raised to 88.25%, impacting the shareholding pattern.
In 2007, Vedanta Resources Plc, a diversified metals and mining group founded by Anil Agarwal, acquired 51% controlling stake[14] in Sesa Goa Ltd. from Mitsui & Co. Ltd. Vedanta Resources is listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of FTSE 100 Index. The deal was worth ₹40.7 billion (US$630 million), making it the largest M&A deal in the industry so far.[15] In 2009, Sesa Goa acquired Goa-based Dempo Group’s mining and maritime businesses for ₹17.5 billion (US$270 million) in an all-cash deal.[4][16] This was the second largest[17] acquisition in India’s iron-ore industry, and it gave Sesa Goa access to Dempo’s 70 million tons of iron-ore mineable resources in Goa. In 2011, Sesa Goa purchased 51% stake in Western Cluster, Liberia for $90 million.[18] The Liberia Gola Forest Community people who also suffered from the civil war believe that the coming of Western Cluster will help to alleviate their suffering and provide employment.

History & Milestones[edit]
Brief Outline[edit]
Scambi Economici Societa Anonyma (SESA), owned by Baron Ludovic Toeplitz, with the financial backing of Alessandro Vassalo, obtained the Orasso Dongor mining lease in Sirsaim, Goa in 1954 and Sesa Goa Limitada was formed. It was bought over in 1955, with equal shareholding, by Gewerkeshaft Exploration e Bergbau and Ferromin S.p.A., a subsidiary of Finsider S.p.A. (of IRI group), which eventually acquired the other half stake in 1963.
Sesa Goa Limitada was incorporated as a private limited company in 1963 under The Companies Act, 1956. In 1979, Sesa Goa Private Limited was formed, with the merger of Sesa Goa Limitada with another mining company in Goa, Mingoa Sociedade Miniera Goesa S.a.r.l. In 1981, Sesa Goa Limited became a public limited company with 60% equity with Indian shareholders. In 1996, Mitsui & Co. Ltd. of Japan acquired Finsider International, along with its 51% stake in Sesa Goa Limited .
In 2007, Vedanta Resources plc, acquired the controlling stake in Sesa Goa Limited from Mitsui & Co. Ltd.
Milestones[edit]
By 1965, Sesa Goa and Mingoa were incorporated as a private limited company under The Companies Act, 1956. The merger happened in 1979 and the new, unified company was called ‘Sesa Goa Pvt Ltd’. The company went public in 1981[10] with 42,000 Indian shareholders, holding 60% of its shares and the remaining 40% held by Finsider International, which later became ILVA International. Sesa Goa had started with iron mining as its core business but slowly, it ventured into barge construction in 1984 at Sirsaim, located in the Bardez taluka of North Goa. Since then, the barge construction unit has been developed into a shipbuilding division.[11]
Growth in the 90s: In 1992, the first phase of a 150,000 ton pig iron plant was commissioned. In the same year, Sesa introduced India’s first low-phosphorus foundry grade pig iron in India and subsequently formalised the business under pig iron division. The pig iron plant is located at Amona, Goa. This plant has an annual production capacity of 250,000 tonnes per annum. Other alliances were formed in the nineties—in January 1995, Sesa Shipping was launched by acquiring transhipper M.V. Orissa. The year also saw the inclusion of 84 new coke ovens. When Mitsui & Co. of Japan bought Finsider International in 1996, it gained 51% stake in Sesa Go. By 1997, Sesa Kembla became a 100% subsidiary of Sesa Goa.
In 1997, A Narrain mines located in Chitradurga, (Karnataka) were purchased. A Supreme Court directive in August 2011 led to suspension of mining activities in the region. In 1999, Sesa Goa started mining operations in Barbil, which has the fifth largest deposit of iron ore and manganese in the world. They started producing high grade iron ore which was exported from the port towns of Haldia and Paradip.
Along with these business ventures, in 1998, the company started the Sesa Community Development Foundation that supported the NCM Sesa Technical School and a new Sesa football academy. The company promoted SESA F.A.
Mergers and Acquisitions - 2000 onwards: Sesa Kembla completed the creation of an indigenous and environment-friendly technology that produced high-quality metallurgical coke. This technology generated power[12] as a by-product. In 2002, Sesa Group becomes the first business of its kind to be certified with OHSAS 18001.[13] In 2003, the Sesa Goa equity in Sesa Industries was raised to 88.25%, impacting the shareholding pattern.
In 2007, Vedanta Resources Plc, a diversified metals and mining group founded by Anil Agarwal, acquired 51% controlling stake[14] in Sesa Goa Ltd. from Mitsui & Co. Ltd. Vedanta Resources is listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of FTSE 100 Index. The deal was worth ₹40.7 billion (US$630 million), making it the largest M&A deal in the industry so far.[15] In 2009, Sesa Goa acquired Goa-based Dempo Group’s mining and maritime businesses for ₹17.5 billion (US$270 million) in an all-cash deal.[4][16] This was the second largest[17] acquisition in India’s iron-ore industry, and it gave Sesa Goa access to Dempo’s 70 million tons of iron-ore mineable resources in Goa. In 2011, Sesa Goa purchased 51% stake in Western Cluster, Liberia for $90 million.[18] The Liberia Gola Forest Community people who also suffered from the civil war believe that the coming of Western Cluster will help to alleviate their suffering and provide employment.
