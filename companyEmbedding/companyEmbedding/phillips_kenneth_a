GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREBasic Techniques Of Conductingby Phillips, Kenneth H.Systematic, practical, and thorough, Basic Techniques of Conducting offers a clear instructional strategy and a basic methodology for teaching the physical gestures and concepts essential for the development of a convincing conducting technique. Taking a competency-based approach, this text provides a clear, step-by-step system for mastering the physical gestures required for good conducting. Paying special attention to the psychomotor skills needed for clear and expressive conducting, it establishes a solid foundation on which to build an advanced and personal conducting style.   Based on ten years of teaching and class-testing, the text is carefully organized to establish essential conducting skills over a one-semester period. Each of the thirty lessons introduces basic conducting techniques in a developmental sequence, and includes a review of previous techniques, "guided practice" segments for group practice of new techniques, and "assignment" sections for independent study and practice.   The text is fully illustrated with many conducting diagrams, photographs of hand and body movements, and numerous musical examples for directed conducting practice. Emphasizing complete musical examples rather than short excerpts, it features both choral and instrumental exercises for drill and practice. Engaging and accessible, Basic Techniques of Conducting offers all of the content necessary to build a solid foundation of conducting skills for all vocal and instrumental music education majors.ConductingCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

                    The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance.
The Memorial Candle Program has been designed to help offset the costs associated with hosting this Tribute 
Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of Kenneth Ray Phillips can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.
