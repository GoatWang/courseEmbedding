Truly innovative product solutions



 





 



Nature’s Way
Bringing wildlife back to your yard!
Since putting up our first birdfeeder almost 30 years ago, we have always enjoyed a deep appreciation of nature and a greater understanding of birding. That’s why when we started Nature’s Way Bird Products we sought to develop the most innovative and best-performing bird products in the industry. Through research, prototypes, and field testing, as well as consulting with independent store owners, park district naturalists, birders, and business professionals across the country we were able to develop revolutionary new designs and currently have 15 patents and 7 trademarks pending.
Our company is built around two key components: Innovative Design and Superior Quality. To enhance this, we have an experienced staff of design engineers and graphic designers and employ a large staff in purchasing, process control, and quality control inspection who regularly visit our broad range of factories and suppliers in the USA and Asia to ensure our high-quality standards are met every day.
These are all investments Nature’s Way makes to guarantee we deliver quality products and services to our valued customers, consumers, and birds!

Mutual Non Disclosure Agreement

The non-disclosure agreement protects proprietary business information by preventing recipients of that information from disclosing it to others. This agreement empowers the parties that sign it to freely discuss their ideas so that they may build successful business relationships without fear of losing their business opportunities.
LegalNature’s form builder gives you the flexibility needed to customize the agreement according to the wishes of the parties. When completing the agreement, you will identify the parties involved and choose how long the recipient’s duty of confidentiality will last. Often the duty of confidentiality will last forever.
LegalNature's step-by-step guidance helps you quickly draft a strong non-disclosure agreement you can rely on.
