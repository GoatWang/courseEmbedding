Following the Closing Date, the
Oaktree LP shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
nominate to the Board a number of designees equal to at least:
(i) a majority of the Total Number of Directors, so long as
the Oaktree Entities collectively beneficially own 50% or more of
the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote generally

of Directors, in the event that the Oaktree Entities collectively
beneficially own 40% or more, but less than 50%, of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock entitled to vote generally in the election
of the Directors; (iii) 30% of the Total Number of Directors,
in the event that the Oaktree Entities collectively beneficially

nominated less than the total number of designees that the Oaktree
LP is entitled to nominate pursuant to Section 2.1(a), the
Oaktree LP shall have the right, at any time, to nominate such
additional designees to which it is entitled, in which case, the
