The Firm
 




Overview
Rubenstein Partners is a fully integrated real estate investment firm providing first-class investment services, as a Registered Investment Advisor, in office markets throughout the Eastern United States.We believe in superior results through specialization and therefore focus on a single asset class (office), a single segment of the risk spectrum (value-added), and a specific geography (the Eastern United States). Our goal is to consistently generate outsized risk-adjusted returns for our clients through a variety of skills including creative acquisitions, “hands on” asset management, entrepreneurial repositionings, and timely dispositions. These investments are structured across the real estate capital stack; however, we typically focus on traditional, controlling investments both with and without local operating partners.
We currently manage three fully discretionary closed-end funds — Rubenstein Properties Fund I, a $475 million private equity fund closed in 2006, and Rubenstein Properties Fund II, a $515 million private equity fund that is in its investment period, and Fund III an additional fund in its investment period — as well as some legacy assets related to the firm’s predecessor company.


History
Rubenstein Partners was founded in 2005 after the predecessor company was disposed of in 2004.The predecessor company to Rubenstein Partners comprised a vertically integrated platform focusing on commercial office in the Eastern United States which, at its peak, was one of the largest private investors in office real estate in the Mid-Atlantic by square footage. After liquidating, David Rubenstein and several other key members of the former senior management team formed Rubenstein Partners which closed on its first fund in May 2006. Since then, Rubenstein Partners has become a Registered Investment Advisor with established offices in Boston, New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Washington, DC and Atlanta.


Approach
Rubenstein Partners primarily focuses on complex office real estate investments, including assets requiring major redevelopment or recapitalization.As a result of our history as a vertically-integrated operator, our management team possesses an extensive real estate background across a variety of disciplines, including redevelopment and construction, property management, operations and engineering, leasing, asset management, transactions, legal and accounting.  We therefore target complex investments that enable us to utilize our in-house expertise to mitigate real estate risk while simultaneously maintaining the outsized returns associated with such complex transactions, resulting in the attractive risk/return proposition we offer to our investors.  These outsized risk-adjusted returns are a result of our ability to create alpha through a combination of creative acquisitions, “hands-on” asset management, entrepreneurial repositionings and timely dispositions.
Our depth enables us to directly operate properties acquired by our private equity funds; however, we typically joint venture with local operating partners to leverage ourselves on a day-to-day basis.


Present
Rubenstein Partners currently manages two closed-end private equity funds with equity commitments in the amounts of $475 million and $515 million, respectively. Fund I was established in late 2005 and quickly closed in May 2006 with a diverse group of institutional investors, including educational endowments, public and private pension funds, and high net worth individuals. Investment activities in Fund I concluded in 2012 and we continue to manage assets acquired therein. Fund II commenced activities in mid-2012 and has $515 million in commitments from a similar investor base as Fund I. We are currently actively investing on behalf of Fund II.

Asset ManagerTaylor Smith



In September 2016, Fund III, acting as general partner, acquired Sanctuary Park in partnership with an affiliate of a leading insurance company. Sanctuary Park is a 1.6 million-square-foot, best in class suburban office campus (9 buildings) in the high-growth North Fulton submarket of Atlanta. Despite having a history of above-market, long-term stabilized occupancy, the partnership acquired Sanctuary Park when the campus’ largest tenant, Verizon, planned to vacate its space reducing occupancy from 96% to 73%. This dynamic and the overall size of the transaction were key factors that limited the buyer pool for the asset. The partnership intends to aggressively pursue re-leasing the large block of quality vacancy left by Verizon, institute a capital plan to revitalize and differentiate the campus from its competition (through the construction an amenity center unique to the submarket) and further integrate the campus into the rapidly densifying micro market surrounding it.

The property is being marketed to large users given the limited blocks of space currently available on the Dulles Toll Road. The location offers an amenity-rich environment and the property is located within walking distance of Metro and the Whole Foods-anchored Plaza America shopping center. The renovation is expected to be completed in 2018.

Post-closing, the partnership razed 900,000 sf of obsolete space, leaving 500,000 sf to be redeveloped.  Subsequently, in October 2011, the partnership signed an agreement with Bayer Healthcare, LLC for the purchase of 94 acres (the North Campus), along with the obligation to complete its North American headquarters, which required an extensive reconstruction of the 500,000 sf of existing office and an additional 130,000 sf of new office; Bayer moved into the completed headquarters in October 2013.  In March 2016, a portion of the South Campus was sold to Bayer Healthcare, LLC.  The partnership subsequently developed a 185,000 sf build-to-suit for MetLife on the remaining acreage of the South Campus, with delivery in Summer 2016.

Date AcquiredDecember 2010


Asset ManagerStephen Evans



In December 2010, Fund I put this 24-acre parcel under contract, through an off-market process from a non-real estate seller, with the obligation to purchase contingent upon the successful rezoning of the site to allow for 221,000 sf of office.  After the site was successfully rezoned, Fund I closed on the land in December 2010.  At the time, the submarket had minimal Class A vacancy and it was believed that the Property would benefit substantially from the contractor tail that would follow the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s newly developed 2.3 million sf headquarters, as well as the demand related to nearby Fort Belvoir, which had become a "BRAC" recipient.  Since the project was delivered in Q4 2013, Fund I has continued to aggressively market the Property to prospective tenants.

Asset ManagerStephen Card



In October 2012, Fund I, in partnership with an affiliate of Vision Real Estate Partners, acquired The Crossings @ Jefferson Park in an off-market private negotiation from a global real estate investor seeking to liquidate the Property. Post-closing, the partnership completed an extensive capital plan, which included significant upgrades to the aesthetics and amenities, including building a transformative 11,000 sf amenity center, and renovation of the three main office buildings.  As a result of the improvements, a campus tenant, Barclays Capital, purchased the property in May 2017.   Barclays, which at the time of the sale leased ~20% of the campus, saw the value of the redeveloped corporate campus, including the newly developed amenity center, as a tool to draw more talent to its existing employee base in the Northern New Jersey market.
