Early life and education[edit]
Munter was born in California, in 1954, graduating from Claremont High School in 1972. He attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, graduated magna cum laude in 1976 with a B.A.,[6] and the universities of Freiburg and Marburg in Germany. He received a PhD in modern European history in 1983 from Johns Hopkins Universityin Baltimore, Maryland.
Postgraduate work[edit]
Munter taught European history at the University of California in Los Angeles (1982–1984) and directed European Studies at the Twentieth Century Fund in New York (1984–1985) before joining the Foreign Service.[2]
Career[edit]
Munter was sworn in as United States Ambassador to the Republic of Serbia on July 26, 2007, and stayed in this position until 2009 when he was transferred to work in Iraq. A career Foreign Service Officer, Munter was Deputy Chief of Mission at the American Embassy in Prague, Czech Republic, from August 2005 to June 2007. He volunteered to lead the first Provincial Reconstruction Team in Mosul, Iraq, from January through July 2006, and then returned to Prague. He came to Prague from Warsaw, Poland, where he served as Deputy Chief of Mission from 2002 to 2005.
Before these assignments, in Washington, D.C., Munter was Director for Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe at the National Security Council (1999–2001), Executive Assistant to the Counselor of the Department of State (1998–1999), Director of the Northern European Initiative (1998), and Chief of Staff in the NATO Enlargement Ratification Office (1997–1998).
He has also served overseas in Bonn, Germany (1995–1997), Prague (1992–1995), and Warsaw (1986–1988). His other domestic assignments include serving as Country Director for Czechoslovakia at the Department of State (1989–1991), Dean Rusk Fellow at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy (1991), and Staff Assistant in the Bureau of European Affairs (1988–1989).
Munter's ambassadorship to Pakistan, which began in 2010, was expected to last until 2013.[3] On May 7, 2012, however, Munter announced that he was resigning only 18 months into the job. His announcement followed the day after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a speech to an audience in Kolkata, India, contradicted statements Munter had previously made regarding a Pakistani national wanted by the United States for terrorism in connection with the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. The online newspaper Asia Times Online cited unnamed well-informed diplomats in the Pakistani capital that the apparent dissatisfaction with the ambassador's handling of that matter is likely an important factor in his resignation.[3] Another version attributed Munter's resignation is his disagreement with the U.S. policy of drone attacks in Pakistan, an opinion Munter shared with then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.[4] During a State Department press briefing on the day following Munter's announcement the department's spokesperson, responding to media questions, commented that Munter was resigning at a time that would seem to be the ordinary length for an ambassador to Pakistan and that Secretary Clinton had praised his efforts earlier the same day.[5]
In the summer of 2015, the Board of Directors of the EastWest Institute (EWI) announced the appointment of Munter as its new President and Chief Executive Officer, effective August 1, 2015. Munter succeeded John Edwin Mroz, EWI’s founder, who had died. In this capacity, Munter heads up the strategic direction of EWI, which facilitates international conflict resolution, around issues pertaining to cybersecurity, strategic trust-building, and economic and military security.

He came to Prague from Warsaw, Poland, where he served as Deputy Chief of Mission from 2002 to 2005.
Before these assignments, in Washington, D.C., Munter was Director for Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe at the National Security Council (1999–2001), Executive Assistant to the Counselor of the Department of State (1998–1999), Director of the Northern European Initiative (1998), and Chief of Staff in the NATO Enlargement Ratification Office (1997–1998).
He has also served overseas in Bonn, Germany (1995–1997), Prague (1992–1995), and Warsaw (1986–1988). His other domestic assignments include serving as Country Director for Czechoslovakia at the Department of State (1989–1991), Dean Rusk Fellow at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy (1991), and Staff Assistant in the Bureau of European Affairs (1988–1989).
Munter's ambassadorship to Pakistan, which began in 2010, was expected to last until 2013.[3] On May 7, 2012, however, Munter announced that he was resigning only 18 months into the job. His announcement followed the day after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a speech to an audience in Kolkata, India, contradicted statements Munter had previously made regarding a Pakistani national wanted by the United States for terrorism in connection with the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. The online newspaper Asia Times Online cited unnamed well-informed diplomats in the Pakistani capital that the apparent dissatisfaction with the ambassador's handling of that matter is likely an important factor in his resignation.[3] Another version attributed Munter's resignation is his disagreement with the U.S. policy of drone attacks in Pakistan, an opinion Munter shared with then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.[4] During a State Department press briefing on the day following Munter's announcement the department's spokesperson, responding to media questions, commented that Munter was resigning at a time that would seem to be the ordinary length for an ambassador to Pakistan and that Secretary Clinton had praised his efforts earlier the same day.[5]
In the summer of 2015, the Board of Directors of the EastWest Institute (EWI) announced the appointment of Munter as its new President and Chief Executive Officer, effective August 1, 2015. Munter succeeded John Edwin Mroz, EWI’s founder, who had died. In this capacity, Munter heads up the strategic direction of EWI, which facilitates international conflict resolution, around issues pertaining to cybersecurity, strategic trust-building, and economic and military security.

  EMAIL |  PHONE: +1-212-824-4110  







Ambassador Cameron Munter is the Chief Executive Officer and President of the EastWest Institute. 
Ambassador Munter has been a career diplomat, serving in some of the most conflict-ridden areas of the globe. He served as U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan from 2010-2012, where he guided U.S.-Pakistani relations through a strained period, including the operation against Osama bin Laden, while leading a 2,500-employee embassy. Previously he served as Ambassador to Serbia, where he negotiated Serbian domestic consensus for European integration and managed the Kosovo independence crisis. 
Ambassador Munter also served twice in Iraq, leading the first Provincial Reconstruction Team in Mosul and then overseeing U.S. civilian and military cooperation in planning the drawdown of U.S. troops. In Europe, he served in the Czech Republic and Poland, where he helped manage the American contribution to those countries’ integration into the global economy. He was a Director at the National Security Council at the White House, and had numerous other domestic assignments at the State Department in Washington.
Before joining the Foreign Service, Ambassador Munter taught European history at the University of California Los Angeles. He also has been Professor of International Relations at Pomona College in Claremont, taught at Columbia University School of Law, was a Fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and has two honorary doctoral degrees. 
Born in California in 1954, Ambassador Munter graduated magna cum laude from Cornell University and earned a doctorate in Modern European History from John Hopkins University.

Home> Member List>Cameron Munter < Member List Cameron Munter
Cameron Munter is the Chief Executive Officer and President of the EastWest Institute.


Munter has been a career diplomat, serving in some of the most conflict-ridden areas of the globe. He served as U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan from 2010-2012, where he guided U.S.-Pakistani relations through a strained period, including the operation against Osama bin Laden, while leading a 2,500-employee embassy. Previously he served as Ambassador to Serbia, where he negotiated Serbian domestic consensus for European integration and managed the Kosovo independence crisis.


Munter also served at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, overseeing U.S. civilian and military cooperation in planning the drawdown of U.S. troops. In Europe, he served in the Czech Republic and Poland, where he helped manage the American contribution to those countries’ integration into the global economy. He was a Director at the National Security Council at the White House, and had numerous other domestic assignments at the State Department in Washington.


Before joining the Foreign Service, Munter taught European history at the University of California Los Angeles. He also taught at Columbia University School of Law and has two honorary doctoral degrees. For the past two years, Munter has been Professor of International Relations at Pomona College in Claremont, California, as well as a Fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.


Born in California in 1954, Munter graduated magna cum laude from Cornell University and earned a doctorate in Modern European History from John Hopkins University.

Early life and education[edit]
Munter was born in California, in 1954, graduating from Claremont High School in 1972. He attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, graduated magna cum laude in 1976 with a B.A.,[6] and the universities of Freiburg and Marburg in Germany. He received a PhD in modern European history in 1983 from Johns Hopkins Universityin Baltimore, Maryland.
Postgraduate work[edit]
Munter taught European history at the University of California in Los Angeles (1982–1984) and directed European Studies at the Twentieth Century Fund in New York (1984–1985) before joining the Foreign Service.[2]
Career[edit]
Munter was sworn in as United States Ambassador to the Republic of Serbia on July 26, 2007, and stayed in this position until 2009 when he was transferred to work in Iraq. A career Foreign Service Officer, Munter was Deputy Chief of Mission at the American Embassy in Prague, Czech Republic, from August 2005 to June 2007. He volunteered to lead the first Provincial Reconstruction Team in Mosul, Iraq, from January through July 2006, and then returned to Prague. He came to Prague from Warsaw, Poland, where he served as Deputy Chief of Mission from 2002 to 2005.
Before these assignments, in Washington, D.C., Munter was Director for Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe at the National Security Council (1999–2001), Executive Assistant to the Counselor of the Department of State (1998–1999), Director of the Northern European Initiative (1998), and Chief of Staff in the NATO Enlargement Ratification Office (1997–1998).
He has also served overseas in Bonn, Germany (1995–1997), Prague (1992–1995), and Warsaw (1986–1988). His other domestic assignments include serving as Country Director for Czechoslovakia at the Department of State (1989–1991), Dean Rusk Fellow at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy (1991), and Staff Assistant in the Bureau of European Affairs (1988–1989).
Munter's ambassadorship to Pakistan, which began in 2010, was expected to last until 2013.[3] On May 7, 2012, however, Munter announced that he was resigning only 18 months into the job. His announcement followed the day after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a speech to an audience in Kolkata, India, contradicted statements Munter had previously made regarding a Pakistani national wanted by the United States for terrorism in connection with the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. The online newspaper Asia Times Online cited unnamed well-informed diplomats in the Pakistani capital that the apparent dissatisfaction with the ambassador's handling of that matter is likely an important factor in his resignation.[3] Another version attributed Munter's resignation is his disagreement with the U.S. policy of drone attacks in Pakistan, an opinion Munter shared with then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.[4] During a State Department press briefing on the day following Munter's announcement the department's spokesperson, responding to media questions, commented that Munter was resigning at a time that would seem to be the ordinary length for an ambassador to Pakistan and that Secretary Clinton had praised his efforts earlier the same day.[5]
In the summer of 2015, the Board of Directors of the EastWest Institute (EWI) announced the appointment of Munter as its new President and Chief Executive Officer, effective August 1, 2015. Munter succeeded John Edwin Mroz, EWI’s founder, who had died. In this capacity, Munter heads up the strategic direction of EWI, which facilitates international conflict resolution, around issues pertaining to cybersecurity, strategic trust-building, and economic and military security.

Career[edit]
Munter was sworn in as United States Ambassador to the Republic of Serbia on July 26, 2007, and stayed in this position until 2009 when he was transferred to work in Iraq. A career Foreign Service Officer, Munter was Deputy Chief of Mission at the American Embassy in Prague, Czech Republic, from August 2005 to June 2007. He volunteered to lead the first Provincial Reconstruction Team in Mosul, Iraq, from January through July 2006, and then returned to Prague. He came to Prague from Warsaw, Poland, where he served as Deputy Chief of Mission from 2002 to 2005.
Before these assignments, in Washington, D.C., Munter was Director for Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe at the National Security Council (1999–2001), Executive Assistant to the Counselor of the Department of State (1998–1999), Director of the Northern European Initiative (1998), and Chief of Staff in the NATO Enlargement Ratification Office (1997–1998).
He has also served overseas in Bonn, Germany (1995–1997), Prague (1992–1995), and Warsaw (1986–1988). His other domestic assignments include serving as Country Director for Czechoslovakia at the Department of State (1989–1991), Dean Rusk Fellow at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy (1991), and Staff Assistant in the Bureau of European Affairs (1988–1989).
Munter's ambassadorship to Pakistan, which began in 2010, was expected to last until 2013.[3] On May 7, 2012, however, Munter announced that he was resigning only 18 months into the job. His announcement followed the day after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a speech to an audience in Kolkata, India, contradicted statements Munter had previously made regarding a Pakistani national wanted by the United States for terrorism in connection with the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. The online newspaper Asia Times Online cited unnamed well-informed diplomats in the Pakistani capital that the apparent dissatisfaction with the ambassador's handling of that matter is likely an important factor in his resignation.[3] Another version attributed Munter's resignation is his disagreement with the U.S. policy of drone attacks in Pakistan, an opinion Munter shared with then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.[4] During a State Department press briefing on the day following Munter's announcement the department's spokesperson, responding to media questions, commented that Munter was resigning at a time that would seem to be the ordinary length for an ambassador to Pakistan and that Secretary Clinton had praised his efforts earlier the same day.[5]
In the summer of 2015, the Board of Directors of the EastWest Institute (EWI) announced the appointment of Munter as its new President and Chief Executive Officer, effective August 1, 2015. Munter succeeded John Edwin Mroz, EWI’s founder, who had died. In this capacity, Munter heads up the strategic direction of EWI, which facilitates international conflict resolution, around issues pertaining to cybersecurity, strategic trust-building, and economic and military security.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
