Wealth In Motion 


Our ProcessMacro ManagementFinancial ModelWealth In Motion SimulatorEstate PlanningProducts & Services 


We help individuals. Families and businesses focus on protectionand long-term wealth strategies by leveraging the power of earned incomein the early years.
Financial decisions made in the early stages will have the greatest impact on your financial future. We strive to get your money to work harder for you. The services we offer assist you in all of your personal finance decisions.
We offer a full array of financial products and services that, as part of your overall plan, can help you achieve your goals.
__________________________________________________________________
Estate Planning
We assist you with design and implementation of a program which ensures that your wealth is passed along to family or others, while mitigating the impact of estate or inheritance taxes. This service enables you to plan your personal estate with an aim of maximum distribution and conservation to future generations.
Retirement Planning
The ability to retire free from financial pressures remains the main focus for all of our clients, whether they're business owners or employees. It is critical for a retirement plan to be properly designed, implemented, communicated and administered in a way that allows them to remain dynamic, adapting as a clients' business and the relevant tax laws change. Retirement plans demand continued and careful analysis, particularly for ongoing IRS compliance. The appropriateness of a "qualified" or "non-qualified" plan for any individual should be determined based upon the individual's existing financial condition, in addition to their individual goals and dreams. 
College Funding
We work with you to determine whether your current savings strategy will cover college expenses for your children. If you dream of your child or grandchild going to college, it's important to recognize that higher education comes with a large price tag. However, with proper financial planning, it is far from an insurmountable problem. We'll help you calculate college costs, evaluate funding options and create an education strategy tailored to your unique goals, including:

State-sponsored college savings plans (529s)
Education Savings Accounts
Traditional and Roth IRAs
Custodial accounts (UGMA/UTMA)
Education Trusts

Will/Trust Analysis
Wills and Trusts are simply tools used in the larger process of Estate Planning. Unfortunately, there is a widespread misconception that this topic is of interest only to the wealthy. The truth is that an estate plan provides the legal mechanism for disposing of property upon death in a way that recognizes your final wishes while addressing the needs of your survivors — all while minimizing tax liability. It also covers planning for unexpected occurrences, such as disability, and takes into account deeply personal medical choices. Trusts play an important role in providing order to your financial affairs, assisting with tax planning, simplifying estate settlement and providing guidance for your family.
Asset Management
Asset management helps our clients enhance their wealth by maximizing post-tax returns while maintaining reasonable levels of risk. We accomplish this by integrating active portfolio management with a commitment to post-tax strategies across all appropriate asset classes. We work closely with you to design and manage a strategy which complements your individual investment objectives, providing a wealth of options such as quality money market funds, well-researched equities, and investment quality fixed-income obligations.
Life Insurance Ownership Management
Insurance is an essential component of a complete and diverse financial plan. It protects your heirs in the event of your death and provides security for you in the event of an unexpected disability. We help you determine what type of coverage is best for you by providing access to a variety of insurance products including term life, whole life, universal life, variable life, survivor-ship, single premium, long-term care and long-term disability insurance. As we build a relationship with you, we are better able to provide focused guidance and determine which insurance products serve you best.
Long Term Care
Should you ever require a nursing home, assisted living or some other form of home health care it can unfortunately become quite expensive. Studies show that more than half of the U.S. population will require long-term care at some point in their lives; are you willing to take a chance that someone else will be there to help you? Keep in mind that Medicare doesn't cover most long-term care costs and Medicaid benefits are only available to you after you've depleted all of your assets. We help you protect yourself from unexpected long-term care expenses with appropriate coverages.
Employee Benefits
Providing employee benefit packages that include quality, affordable health care coverage continues to be one of the greatest challenges for employers today. With our considerable experience in this field, Compass Financial Group works to deliver and offer many different alternatives to our clients. We evaluate the design of various packages to achieve the best pricing structure and offer expert advice on implementing options such as cafeteria plans so as to allow for employee cost-sharing through tax deductible contributions. In addition, we administer the benefits program and assist employers with the entire claims filing process.
Buy/Sell Strategies
Buy-Sell Agreements are simply written contracts made between the partner(s) or shareholder(s) of a business that specify buy out provisions in situations such as untimely death, disability, divorce, bankruptcy, voluntary termination, company dissolution, etc. The execution of a Buy-Sell Agreement secures a number of very tangible benefits for the shareholder(s), including:
 Continuity of management and control for the remaining owners

A ready market for typically non-marketable business interests
Liquidity to the decedent's estate for estate taxes and administration costs
Fair valuation of the business interest for federal estate tax purposes
Fair return to the decedent's estate for his/her business interests

Business Succession Planning
A key goal of many of our business owner clients is to someday transfer their business interest to either family members or key employees. Properly done, this offers both the current and successor owner a worry free, tax efficient method of business succession. Furthermore, the loss of a business owner through death or disability catches even the most efficiently managed small businesses off guard and, worse yet, leaves them unprepared to deal with the repercussions. Family businesses in particular are susceptible to erosion of capital due to estate taxes and legal fees—not to mention the possible hurdles of voting control being scattered among heirs with conflicting viewpoints, potentially impeding the business' operation and prospective growth.
Compass Financial Group provides a professional evaluation of your current business situation to aid you with avoiding future problems related to succession planning.
Executive Compensation
Non-qualified deferred compensation programs, typically employed to provide supplemental retirement benefits to senior management, include selective incentive plans wherein the company contributes to a fund on behalf of selected employees. Executive Compensation plans are a popular vehicle to attract and retain key individuals within your company.
Risk Management Analysis
Implementing a risk management program is fundamental to a company's ability to protect itself against the loss of key personnel through death, disability, injury or sickness. We offer expert advice on selecting life and disability insurance coverage for such instances.
By conducting a thorough financial security analysis to determine the appropriate protection for a company and their key executives, we ensure that your plan encompasses a proper evaluation of risk management needs and balances them with wealth accumulation objectives. We design risk management programs to be affordable, to fill both corporate and individual needs, and to remain flexible enough to allow for and adapt to changes as they occur. Our analysis also involves a review of existing coverages, if any, to ensure overall cost effectiveness and ensure employment of the most up-to-date features.
Through risk management analysis we deliver products valued and designed according to our clients' needs. They're not just policies; they're solutions.
Mutual Funds
Mutual funds pool money from many investors all sharing the same investment objective. Mutual funds provide everyday investors a variety of investment opportunities and permit them to benefit from the knowledge and experience of professional investment managers dedicated to security analysis, evaluation and selection. Investors have immediate access to their money by selling shares at the fund's net asset value. In addition, mutual funds typically invest across a wide range of securities (such as stocks and bonds), thereby providing easy diversification. Moreover, because mutual funds are sold in shares, regardless of how much you invest, you own a proportionate amount of all the fund's holdings. Finally, custody, tax reporting and record keeping are among the many services mutual fund companies provide in a highly cost-effective manner.
Variable Annuities
Variable annuities are personal retirement strategies aimed at providing a solid foundation for your financial future. You choose from among a full range of professionally managed investment portfolios and your investment returns fluctuate over time, reflecting the performance of the investment portfolios you chose. Variable annuity investments provide for tax-deferred growth so that you don't pay taxes on earnings until after you withdraw them. One of the most unique aspects of variable annuities is the guarantee you can place on your investments. As a result, variable annuities provide investment value protection by offering guaranteed death and living benefits (based upon the claims-paying ability of the insurer). Death benefits guarantee investment amounts for your beneficiaries and living benefits protect investment amounts for you. Additionally, to protect against outliving your income, all variable annuities provide for lifetime income options, which can help spread tax liability over a lifetime.
Variable Annuities are sold by prospectuses, which contain detailed statistical information including fees, contingent deferred sales charges, and other costs that may apply.
Managed Accounts
Every investor is unique, so our investment programs are designed to link specific investment needs to the appropriate method of professional investment management. In a world where traditional securities analysis and portfolio management are being questioned as out of date in relation to the "new" era of day trading, we remain committed to providing personalized investment management services to individuals, families, and fiduciaries. We emphasize the unique needs and goals of our clients and acknowledge that these needs deserve to be addressed differently. This approach has proven beneficial to clients of our firm for many years and we firmly believe that it will remain a successful approach far into the future

At Compass Financial Group we recognize the value in developinglong-term relationships with our clients as we help them navigatetheir financial lives.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
