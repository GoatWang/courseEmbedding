Opower IPO:  Big Data is a Big Deal for Climate Change


“Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the world” – Archimedes, c250 B.C.Today we are excited to be a part of Opower’s IPO—an amazing milestone for founders Dan Yates and Alex Laskey, who shared the vision that a software company using big data and behavioral science could one day affect climate change. We first met Dan and Alex six years ago when Opower was piloting a new kind of energy efficiency program to just a few thousand homes with a small utility in Sacramento, California.  The program had a simple hypothesis:  by giving people personalized data-driven insights about their energy consumption, you could help them save energy. Inspired by Dan and Alex’s enthusiasm and belief that Opower would one day become pervasive in the global utility industry, NEA led the their first round of institutional venture capital when the company had just 12 employees.Since 2008, my partner Harry Weller and I have had the privilege of being a part of Opower’s journey, and watching Dan and Alex’s dream become a reality.  Opower today reaches over 32 million households and businesses through 93 utilities in eight countries, analyzing over 100 billion meter reads a year.  Their IPO milestone today will enable the company to continue to deploy its products around the world, working hand in hand with some of the largest customers in the $2.2 trillion utility industry. The utility industry has historically underinvested in technologies such as CRM and consumer engagement (a company like Opower could not have been imagined just 10 years ago!)  In recent years the industry has changed, and utilities have come under increasing regulatory and environmental pressure to build fewer power plants, find cleaner sources of fuel, and compete with new entrants like solar installers.  Around the world, utilities are embracing Opower to leverage advanced behavioral science, cloud computing, and “Big Data” analytics to give us all a rich understanding of our energy use.  The results are inspiring – Opower provides utilities with a reliable low-cost alternative to building more power plants, saves money for consumers on energy bills, and prevents tons of wasteful carbon emissions every year. Opower was far from an overnight success and required amazing passion and persistence to overcome the odds.  The company’s remarkable journey can be attributed to two incredible entrepreneurs who have largely defied and debunked conventional wisdom:First, in an industry where billions of dollars are invested annually in R&D to supply the world with clean, cheap, renewable energy, Opower has always focused on transforming consumer demand through software. In doing so, they have become one of the largest “virtual power plants” in the world, generating nearly half the energy of the Hoover Dam. The founders have always been contrarian thinkers, and were never ones to follow a herd. Second, rather than attempt to disrupt the status quo, Dan and Alex made the hard decision early on to work side by side with utilities, state regulators, and governments around the world, educating them on the benefits of embracing modern solutions like cloud computing and behavioral science.  Their early investment in government relations ultimately proved that regulators can and do play an important role in accelerating, not impeding, the adoption of new technology.      Finally, Opower has from the very first day been a “double bottom line” company, one whose economic and environmental results were aligned.  Revenue generated by Opower results in energy savings for the planet, and ultimately reduces use of fossil fuel.  The unique alignment of these incentives is extremely hard to find in any company, let alone one that is publicly traded. Congratulations to Dan, Alex, and the Opower team.  You have proven that “Big Data” is a big deal in the fight against climate change, and have inspired us all to do our own small part.

Swiftype:  Making Site Search Simple As the Web Moves to Mobile


We are excited to announce our Series A investment in Swiftype, a rapidly growing “search as a service” platform that makes it possible for any website or mobile application to add modern search to their product in less than a minute.  As an early seed investor, we have had the privilege of watching Swiftype grow from a proof of concept to a service that is today used by over 100,000 customers including some of the largest e-commerce, media, and technology companies in the world.  This tremendous growth has largely been accomplished through word of mouth adoption and, remarkably, without any sales or marketing investment.  In the past 12 months since launching their service, Swiftype has quietly become the largest search engine you’ve never heard of!     Swiftype’s rapid adoption can be attributed to three major factors.  First, “search” has always been one of the hardest technical problems for engineering teams to solve.  With the exception of Google, Amazon, and a handful of web giants, most companies struggle to maintain a high quality search experience because it requires large engineering teams and heavy resource investment.  Swiftype makes search unbelievably simple by integrating into any application with just a few lines of Javascript and gives businesses unparalleled control over their search results.  Second, because consumers are rapidly moving to mobile devices as their primary mode of consumption, search is becoming critical for user engagement.  Users don’t have the luxury of using rich and complex navigation on a small screen, making search a more important feature for application developers.  Finally, Google, which has long been synonymous with search, has been quietly exiting the “search as a service” market by shutting down products like Google Commerce Search.  Google is has made it very clear that they are interested in making search great for Google’s bottom line, but not necessarily for anyone else. For several years NEA has been investing in the rapidly growing area of cloud services that simplify very complex tasks for technical users, such as Braintree for payments (recently acquired by eBay for $800 million) and CloudFlare for web security and performance.  As these companies have captured the hearts and minds of hundreds of thousands of businesses, they have achieved significant competitive advantage through network effects, scale, and data that have made them as formidable and knowledgeable as the largest tech companies in the world in their unique area of expertise.  Swiftype today is already seeing more than 200 million search queries a month, and we believe their focus will enable them to provide the very best “search as a service” for any website or mobile application as their platform expands over time. We are excited to work with Matt Riley and Quin Hoxie, the founders of Swiftype, who long ago asked why website search was inaccurate, inflexible, and expensive to implement.  With Swiftype, luckily we no longer have to search for an answer. 






Seeing the Future When Video Clouds Collide…


We are excited to be a part of today’s $50 million financing in Blue Jeans Network, the world’s fastest growing cloud-based video conferencing service.  NEA invested in Blue Jeans over 2 years ago and has had the privilege of watching the service grow from a proof-of-concept to a disruptive product now serving over 2,000 customers and 3 million participants.  The premise behind Blue Jeans is very simple – make video conferencing as pervasive and easy to use as audio conferencing by providing a service that works from any device with a two-way camera (across Cisco and Polycom room systems, Microsoft, Google, and Skype clients, and every browser and mobile phone).  By providing interoperability across these services, Blue Jeans has become the missing link in real-time collaboration and one of the fastest growing software-as-a-service companies in our portfolio. Blue Jeans is an incredibly simple service to use and describe, but it is an extremely complex technical solution that was not possible (or feasible) just 5 years ago.  First, high quality video bridging has traditionally been done through special purpose (expensive) processors, and it is only recently that multi-core processors have reached a price point for video interoperability to be performed on commodity hardware.  Second, significant advancements in H.264 compression have made it easier for high quality video to be streamed through low bandwidth connections.  Finally, pervasive cloud infrastructure has made it possible to scale up to support millions of users overnight, a requirement to meet the demands of the largest customers around the world.  The convergence of these technology trends has made it possible to launch Blue Jeans, and to unlock the true potential of video in the workforce. It is truly a privilege to work with the founders of Blue Jeans, Krish and Alagu, who have realized the vision of video as a “dial-tone” service that would connect the world around us.  Today we can see this vision coming to life, transforming many industries that have adopted their service.  We see universities using Blue Jeans to turn physical lecture halls into virtual classrooms that can bridge in students from multiple countries.  We see doctors using Blue Jeans to connect medical experts into emergency procedures, enabling patients to get the best care even in remote locations.  And in a workforce that is increasingly geographically dispersed, we see millions of people using Blue Jeans to see their customers and colleagues, and to discover what is possible with pervasive video.  Want to see the future?  Just try www.bluejeans.com!






Signal or Noise?  NEA’s Experience with Signaling Risk in Seed Investing


*This post is a follow-up to my “Ask a VC” interview with Leena Rao at TechCrunch who posed the question, “Why does a $2.6 billion fund make seed investments?”  NEA is one of the largest VC firms by assets under management, and has quietly become one of the most active seed investors in the industry. Launching a seed program was controversial, both within the firm and throughout the seed investment community.  The primary concern was “signaling risk”, or the notion that when a large VC fund makes a seed investment but chooses not to invest in a Series A round, the company’s ability to raise additional capital is significantly impaired. That negative “signal” could damage both the reputation of the company and the relationship between the entrepreneur and its investor.  After 35 years of building a reputation of trust and respect with entrepreneurs, we probably worried as much—or more—about this “signaling risk” than anyone. As a result, since launching a dedicated seed program in early 2011, it’s something we have proactively measured and monitored from day one. The early results so far have been surprising to many with whom we’ve shared the data. NEA’s seed program has made more than 50 investments totaling north of $20 million. The portfolio spans multiple sectors of technology (consumer, enterprise, healthcare, energy) and geography (Silicon Valley, Boston, New York, LA, and DC) and represents the diversity of interests and strategies employed by our global partnership. We have recently analyzed our first cohort of 35 seed investments, all of whom raised their initial seed rounds between March 2011 and July 2012.  The data is as follows:35 total companies (100%)5 Series A Investments Led by NEA (14%)9 Series A Investments Led by Other VCs (26%)14 Total Series A Investments (40%)5 Wind Downs or <2x M&A exits (~14%) 16 companies currently “too early to tell”* (46%)(*this category includes companies that have not yet tried to raise capital, have raised seed extensions in advance of Series A, or are otherwise too early to tell)Given all of our concern about signaling risk, we expected to see more companies that are NOT funded by NEA struggle to raise a Series A.  Instead, we have found the opposite. At this stage, 40% of our seed companies are getting financed by a VC firm, NEA or otherwise, at Series A.  Our best guess is that more than 50% will be successful when this cohort fully matures.Our seed funded companies have been almost 2x more likely to get financed by another VC firm, NOT NEA.  This is the exact opposite of what you would expect to see if signaling risk was significant in determining whether or not other VC firms would invest in NEA seeded companies.  The fact is that many VC firms choose to invest in NEA-seeded companies even if NEA does not lead the Series A.  There are many reasons why this occurs, but a few of the more consistent ones are:Strong Fundamentals Speak for Themselves:  When we seed a company, we invest in great people, differentiated products, and large market opportunities. These fundamentals tend to be more important than the brand name or composition of a company’s investor syndicate, and tend to be highly sought after by many VC firms including NEA.Entrepreneurs Have Many Choices:  We are privileged to work with great entrepreneurs who have many options for financing their company.  Many times other VCs are willing to offer more attractive options than we are able to provide.  We are thrilled when our seed companies reach these important milestones, independent of the dollar amounts we’ve invested.  We Are Not Always the Best Long Term Partner:  Seed companies change course frequently, and pivot into spaces or sectors that align better with other VC firms or partners. These shifts could also result in direct competition with companies in our existing portfolio, and when this occurs we do everything we can to manage conflict and maintain trust with our entrepreneurs and co-investors.  VCs Don’t Always Follow the Herd:  The VC community is diverse and sophisticated, and many firms weigh investments on their merits as they see them, not another firm’s opinion.  Herd mentality is less prevalent in venture capital than some might think.On this last point, it is important to remember that building a successful start-up is one of the hardest undertakings on the planet.  It should not be surprising that investing in start-ups is equally challenging.  When we make a decision to invest—or not—in a Series A, it does NOT always mean we’ve made the right call.  We are human and we make mistakes. We aim not to repeat those mistakes at Series B, Series C, and beyond. To be clear, we are not claiming that signaling risk does not exist.  To this day we are still very careful and selective about our seed investing for this very reason.  Entrepreneurs have many choices for how to build their seed syndicates, and those that choose to work with NEA get a partner with a long term perspective, at any and every stage of their growth, no matter how much money we’ve invested.  We aspire to help entrepreneurs build very large companies, and have a track record of doing so that spans four decades.  This is the strongest signal we send to our entrepreneurs, to our co-investors, and to the market, and it is a signal that hopefully continues to drown out the noise of signaling risk.  






Ask A VC: NEA’s Jon Sakoda On Why The Venture Firm Makes Seed Investments And More | TechCrunch


Why does a $2.6 billion fund make seed investments?  Good question from Leena Rao at Techcrunch!  






At This Altitude, Not Everyone Can Make the Climb


“You are on Mount Everest.  This is not for everyone” – Sherpa Tensing, June 2001Note:  I went on a trek to Everest Base Camp in 2001 prior to starting my first company.  I unexpectedly learned one of the hardest lessons about entrepreneurship, loyalty, and leadership while on the mountain.  This post is for entrepreneurs that have scaled their companies to the highest of altitudes, and have come face to face with the realization that not everyone on their team can make the climb.   The trek to Everest Base Camp is one of the most beautiful and challenging treks on earth.  Visited by thousands every year, most groups start their journey by flying into a small village at 9,000 feet in the heart of the Himalayas, and spend the next 7-10 days pushing up the mountain to nearly 19,000 feet*.  Those that come to Everest train hard to prepare themselves for the effects of ascending a mountain at such high altitude, but there are few places in the world to simulate such strenuous conditions.  The trail itself is steep and at extreme elevations your brain and muscles become deprived of oxygen.  Your body rapidly dehydrates.  You experience headaches, can’t sleep, and lose your appetite.  And the conditions only get harder every day as you climb higher.    At the beginning of the trek, the group is fueled by the pure adrenaline of being on the trail of the tallest mountain on earth.  But by 12,500 feet, the climb gets steeper and the effects of Everest begin to set in on everyone.  A few people begin to fall back, and the pack breaks into two – those that can keep pace, and those that cannot.  At ~14,000 feet, the gap between the leaders and stragglers grows larger and the landscape turns dry and barren – it is a startling reminder that the conditions do not allow for biological life to thrive.  By ~16,000 feet, everyone is starting to show concern for friends and colleagues that are struggling, and the group must stop to make tough decision.   The final stage of the trek, from ~16,000 to ~19,000 feet, is the greatest challenge.  Your guides inform you of the choice the group must make:  some people will get to Everest, and some people will have to stay back or go home.  It seems unfair that some of the hardest working and best prepared in the group are feeling the most fatigue, and that everyone has come so far only to turn back now.  But as the group approaches the highest altitudes on earth, the conditions are extreme and it is very clear who will need to stay back for the good of those that will continue the journey.   As an entrepreneur, you don’t need to go to Everest to know that there are a lot of parallels between climbing a mountain in extreme conditions and building a start-up.  Starting a company is one of the most physically and emotionally stressful activities you can undertake, and it will test even the best trained and qualified of individuals.  Similar to the beginning of any great expedition, start-ups can thrive on the adrenaline of the adventure ahead.  But as you scale your company, the path gets steeper and the conditions more challenging.  Whether you are at 50 or 500 employees, the road ahead is always more difficult than the already steep trail you’ve climbed and you must confront the reality that you are pushing your team to the highest of altitudes.    In a high growth company one of the hardest tests of leadership and loyalty is determining who can make the ascent and who will lag behind.  Paradoxically, the bonds of friendship, camaraderie, and trust that make start-up teams strong in the early part of a company’s life become the hardest obstacles to overcome in making the tough decisions that set up companies to take on the challenges ahead.  How can you lead your company through these transitions?  Here are some best practices I’ve seen great leaders follow through the years:Enforce an Honest “Bell Curve” Ranking and Don’t Inflate Grades – every manager loves their team and needs resources to accomplish their goals, but CEOs need to be honest about their “A” players (10-20%), “B” players” (60-70%), and “C” players (10-20%).  Stacked and forced rankings of every employee reveals who is likely to keep up, and who is likely not to make it.  Don’t Make “Churn” a Bad Word – in a scaling company, there is a relentless focus on hiring great talent to fill important roles.  But it is equally important to assess overall quality, not just quantity, along the way and to be honest about hiring mistakes that are inevitable in a hyper growth environment.  Make employee “churn” a metric that is measured every quarter, and don’t make “churn” a bad word.Look to Promote from Within – when it becomes clear that one of your managers isn’t keeping up, the natural tendency is to recruit a seasoned executive.  But one of the best, and frequently overlooked, sources of talented and fresh leadership is within your own organization.  Rather than force an outside hire, find the “A” players deep within your organization that are setting the pace for everyone else.Don’t Force People “Up or Out” – an “A” player can become a “B” player if given too much responsibility, too fast, and spread too thin.  Creating a culture that rewards and recognizes “A” players, even if they are in entry level and individual contributor roles, gives you the best chance at getting your entire team up the mountain. I am constantly reminded of and humbled by the trials of entrepreneurship at its highest level.  I have witnessed firsthand how difficult it is to challenge the loyalty entrepreneurs have for their teams in order to honestly assess who is ready for the road ahead.  But starting and scaling a large and successful company is one of the most challenging endeavors on earth.  Those blazing the trail must remember that at the highest of altitudes, not everyone can make the climb.  *Everest Base Camp is the START of professional expeditions to the top of Mount Everest.  Though thousands of tourists (like me) go to Base Camp every year, only a few hundred professional climbers successfully climb to the top and as many as a dozen die trying.

A Crisis in Education is a Terrible Thing to Waste


“A crisis is a terrible thing to waste” – Stanford Economist Paul Romer, speaking to a group of venture capitalists, 2004 The U.S. education system is facing a public crisis of confidence.  Students at the K-12 level consistently underperform in math, science and reading compared to peers in China, Japan and Australia[i].  School tuition is prohibitively expensive for many, and graduates of U.S. higher education institutions today carry more than $1 trillion in collective student debt.  Those who do graduate from college often struggle to find long-term employment, spurring some to question whether the return on a U.S. higher education merits the investment—particularly in a difficult economic environment where the quality of classroom education is increasingly threatened by lay-offs, downsized curriculum, and shut-down facilities at institutions struggling to survive.  With the prospects for over 75 million students and our economic future at stake, the U.S. has no choice but to confront these challenges.  We must reform and revive our education system, and everyone must do their part. The venture capital industry has a longstanding history of bringing U.S. innovation to market—fueling industries like the Internet, computing, telecommunications, semiconductors, biotechnology, and many more.  However, the industry that catalyzed the creation of companies such as Apple, Intel, and Google has been largely absent from the classroom, investing less than 3% of its dollars in education every year.  Today’s education crisis calls for more than politics and policy changes, but for a revitalization and re-imagination of our education system for the 21st century.  At New Enterprise Associates (NEA), we see a unique opportunity to invest in entrepreneurship and technology in this education crisis and believe that now is the time for our industry to step up and do its part.  Working hand in hand with entrepreneurs, we are already seeing amazing results today from schools investing in technology to transform their campuses and classrooms.  We are inspired by what teachers and students can do through innovation, and are confident that we are on the brink of a renaissance in education technology.    Entrepreneurs and investors have historically proceeded with caution in education, for two major reasons.  First, selling new technology directly to schools is expensive.  There are over 100,000 schools in the U.S. alone, with unique and often complex buying processes. Second, measuring the value of new technology in classrooms has been challenging in a sector that has diverse and often subjective methods of assessment. It has been difficult for schools and vendors to demonstrate the efficacy of new learning technologies without prohibitively expensive long-term studies requiring years of data collection. These hurdles have made it difficult for small start-ups to reach economies of scale without significant capital, resulting in only a handful of VC-backed success stories in education over the last 15 years. These historical perceptions are changing in an industry that is rapidly embracing new technology and reinventing its methods for teaching and learning. Advancements in cloud computing have made it possible to run courses online for free. The mass proliferation of tablets and smartphones has made it possible to introduce new educational content to millions of teachers and students without working through traditional publishers. Furthermore, low-cost bandwidth around the world has made it possible for anyone with an Internet connection to pursue a world-class education. These significant advancements have led to a Cambrian explosion in education start-ups here in the U.S., with VC dollars invested in the sector more than tripling over the last five years. There are four major themes shaping and disrupting the education industry as we know it today, which we believe create compelling investment opportunities:1.       Disappearing Classroom WallsThe classroom has traditionally been a broadcast-like experience confined to a physical space and time.  Teachers lecture, and students listen and learn (hopefully). Homework is assigned, and class is dismissed. This dated traditional model is being transformed by online and mobile platforms. Schools today are adopting “always-on” virtual classrooms that facilitate interactive learning anywhere, anytime.  Campuses are rapidly deploying wireless infrastructure to support laptops, tablets, and smartphones, enabling teachers and students to bring their own devices to class.  Instructors can host their content online, poll students on their laptops in class to see if they understand key concepts, and adapt their lessons in real-time based on student feedback. Teachers can connect on social learning sites like Edmodo and exchange K-12 content and curriculum with over 10,000 peers at other schools. Students can collaborate any time, day or night, just by touching an app on their phones, and discussion forums can be joined by anyone with an Internet connection. The virtual classroom has transformed how teachers and students engage, both within and beyond physical classroom walls, and has invigorated schools to rethink the way they teach. 2.        Democratizing Educational ContentThe textbook industry has been traditionally dominated by a handful of major publishers, concentrating control over the distribution of educational content to schools. The emergence of tablets and smartphones, coupled with free distribution channels such as YouTube and iTunes, has created an open marketplace for educational content of unprecedented scale. Schools today can create their own content at low cost, or source content from thousands of publishers offering both free and paid libraries of interactive educational material. As one example, the non-profit Khan Academy today offers over 3,000 free classes and has grown to six million monthly visitors in just four years.  EverFi has delivered financial literacy and substance abuse courses for free to more than 4 million students, one of a growing number of companies that are creating quality content online in partnership with corporations and foundations.  Education apps represent the second-largest category in Apple’s app store, with over 70,000 active applications from thousands of publishers. Parents and students now subscribe to education services such as BenchPrep to access hundreds of standardized test prep courses for just $20 per month. This democratization of content enables schools and students to choose the best product, from the best publisher, at the best price, forcing traditional publishers, non-profits, and aspiring entrepreneurs to compete on a more level playing field. 3.        Learning from Big Data AnalyticsAmazon.com, a pioneer in “Big Data” analytics, can recommend the best products for each customer in real-time based on prior behavior, and can even predict when you will abandon your shopping cart. Using similar technology, schools can improve student outcomes based on personalized learning pathways and can aid struggling students well before it is too late to act.  Using platforms such as Desire2Learn, administrators can aggregate learning analytics at the school district, state, or even national level, enabling best practices and insights to be shared among stakeholders. The State of Tennessee recently demonstrated the power of Desire2Learn’s statewide predictive analytics, lowering their annual dropout rate by 25% across 45 university campuses by looking at historical student data and identifying opportunities for faculty and administrators to intervene.  This is one of the most promising frontiers in education technology, only recently made possible by shifts to more competency-based (or outcomes-based) education (CBE / OBE), standardized curricula (e.g., Common Core) and analytic technologies such as Hadoop.4.       Transforming Local Campuses to Global InstitutionsThough the U.S. today is the largest market for education globally, it is far from the fastest growing.  China, India and Brazil are rapidly increasing their investment in education and have national aspirations and mandates to catch up with the developed world. China already graduates more college students with math, science and engineering degrees than the U.S., and Chinese citizens spend 3.5 times more of their disposable income on education than Americans on a percentage basis. The U.S., particularly in higher education, is home to the most respected learning institutions on the planet, and the emerging markets have seemingly insatiable demand to access it. More than one million students have registered for free for online classes through Coursera, which partners with more than 30 leading institutions like Stanford, Penn, and Michigan. Today the vast majority of those students are from outside the United States, forcing schools to rethink the boundaries of their campuses.  Technology has made distance learning effective and economically feasible, and schools must embrace a global student market if they are to thrive in tomorrow’s education economy. These four trends indicate a seismic shift in the education landscape, and they are creating unique opportunities for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to develop innovative technology that can bring about a critical transformation in education.  Through our growing portfolio of companies in this space, we can see what is possible when educators and entrepreneurs work together.  We are not naïve to the challenges ahead, nor to the obstacles that will be faced in reviving our education system.  But venture capitalists are by definition optimists, and we believe the technology we are helping to build today will empower the transformation of the education industry over the next decade.  We believe we can improve learning outcomes and decrease education costs.  We believe in our teachers and our schools.  And most importantly, we believe that we must invest in our entrepreneurs and education system to confront and address the challenges we face today.  We see amazing opportunity in this education crisis. And, after all, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.[i] OECD PISA Scores, 2009.  The United States failed to make the top 25 in Math and failed to make the top 15 in Science or Reading.  






Desire2Learn:  Leading the Renaissance in Education


Today we announced our investment in Desire2Learn, one of the largest and fastest growing cloud learning platforms for the education industry.  The $80 million financing is the first ever for the company and is one of the largest investments we’ve made in our latest $2.6 billion fund.  Over $1 trillion is spent on K-12 and higher education globally, and schools are in the midst of a technology renaissance that is re-inventing the classroom as we know it.  Textbooks are being re-imagined for a learning environment that revolves around mobile tablets and smart phones.  Online courses and lectures can be shared and students can collaborate around the world through social networks.  “Big Data” analytics can personalize educational content for each individual student.  And cloud computing and low cost bandwidth has made high-quality instruction and educational materials available to anyone with an Internet connection.  These enabling technologies are fueling a fundamental transformation in education, particularly among many of the world’s largest and most influential universities and school districts, and Desire2Learn is at the forefront of this shift with its leading software-as-a-service (SaaS) learning platform. NEA has a long history of investing in great SaaS companies who have disrupted client-server incumbents by offering more innovative cloud-based solutions, such as Salesforce.com and Workday. Desire2Learn is that disruptive force in the education industry, offering a unique alternative to legacy offerings and focusing specifically on the needs of the largest and most demanding customers in the industry.  Today over 700 clients and 8 million students use Desire2Learn, including several of the largest public universities in North America, the largest K-12 public school district in the US, and a roster of Fortune 1000 companies around the world. This substantial round of funding will enable Desire2Learn to grow its cloud infrastructure to meet customer demand, expand into new emerging markets, and continue to provide the most innovative products for schools undergoing this important transformation.  The largest learning institutions around the world are moving rapidly onto Desire2Learn’s cloud, enabling teachers, students, and administrators to lead the renaissance in education and leave their legacy solutions behind. The founder and CEO of Desire2Learn, John Baker, is an inspiring entrepreneur with a lifelong commitment to education.  The son of two teachers, John founded Desire2Learn while in college and has overseen its growth and expansion into one of the largest education software companies in the world.  It is a privilege to work with entrepreneurs like John, who aspire to build great businesses that meaningfully impact the world around us.  The demands for innovation in education have never been greater, and we’re inspired by what is possible with Desire2Learn.  






Joining the @MongoDB Revolution!  


Today we announced our investment in 10Gen, the commercial powerhouse behind MongoDB, the fastest growing open source database on the planet.  NEA led a $42 million investment in the company, providing a huge warchest for 10gen to continue its assault on the relational database market.  Frustrated by legacy products like Oracle and MySQL, developers have flocked to Mongo en mass – Mongo is downloaded nearly 150,000 times a month and today reaches ~8 million developers globally.  The mission behind MongoDB is simple – provide developers with an operational database that is scalable, robust, and easy to use.  Used by start-ups, internet juggernauts, and Fortune 1000 companies alike, Mongo is more than an open source movement – it is now a widespread revolt against Oracle and the incumbent relational database. NEA has long funded companies that have attacked the “one size fits all” database market at its point of greatest vulnerability –“Big Data” analytics.  Through our investments in companies such as Vertica (acquired by HP), MapR, and WibiData, we have seen the emergence of alternative data stores purpose built for web-scale analytics.  But Mongo has opened up a new front in the assault on Oracle, offering developers a true operational data store for rapid and agile development.  In a world where application development cycles have gone from months (or years) to days (or even hours), developers need databases that give them speed and flexibility.  Mongo gives developers a data model that frees them from the restrictions of relational mapping and complex schemas, yet is designed to scale horizontally as applications grow.  It’s a powerful approach that is a disruptive force in the industry, and is clearly capturing the hearts and minds of millions of developers around the world.Taking on Oracle in the RDBMS market is one of the greatest challenges and opportunities in the software industry.  By making this investment, we are privileged to work with Dwight Merriman, Eliot Horowitz, and Max Schireson, three executives whom we know have the leadership, determination, and raw horsepower required for the road ahead.  The world is ready for a new operational database, and we are formally joining the revolution…

Brandless:  Disrupting Everything in Consumer Packaged Goods


“Make it simple, but significant.”  – Don Draper, Mad Men, 2010I am excited to announce our recent investment
in Brandless, a bold new consumer packaged goods (CPG) company that officially
launched today.  Brandless’ mission is
simple but significant: offer health-conscious products at a disruptively low
price point that can’t easily be replicated by established CPG conglomerates.  Over the past several decades, consumers have
grown to believe that high quality, responsibly-sourced products (such as
organic or chemical-free food) should cost more than lesser counterparts sold
under national brands.  Brandless aims to
challenge this way of thinking, and in doing so change the way we shop for
everyday items.  The CPG industry is a $775 Billion market that
reaches every American household—from the kitchen counter, to the pantry and
beyond.  Decades ago this industry could introduce low-cost, high-margin
products to the world through television ad campaigns and national wholesale
distribution.  In recent years the traditional brand advertising approach
has largely grown stale in today’s digital era, and has eroded consumer trust across
an industry that has lost touch with modern buying behavior.  Today’s
consumers are often digital natives with discerning taste—seeking both value
(distinguishable quality) and values (healthy, responsibly sourced) in
the products they consume. Despite rapidly increasing supply and demand for
healthier, more sustainable food products, the CPG industry has largely kept
prices 40-50% higher than lower-quality alternatives under household brands.
 This price distortion has sadly made “eating right” and “buying right”
unaffordable aspirations for many, alienating today’s value (and values) oriented
consumer.   Brandless has a fresh take: a data-driven
approach to every SKU, working with the best suppliers around the globe to
introduce unique products that meet their incredibly high standards for
transparency, quality, and value.  Their
everyday essentials collection will include hundreds of hand-picked items that
reflect the most imperative product values (such as organic, non-GMO, free of
artificial colors and flavors) at an affordable price.  Everything at Brandless is $3, frequently
offering comparable quantities of better quality products than SKUs that
generally cost $5 to $10+ in ANY grocery store. 
For those who struggle with the sticker shock of $9 organic pasta sauce
and $8 organic granola, Brandless offers incredible alternatives for just
$3.  The value speaks for itself: from
cost, to quality, to taste—the products are filling and fulfilling, at a price
point that is simple, and hard to resist.  (Don’t just trust me, read more about the
products here!)Brandless can sell such high-quality products
at lower price points by removing the hidden “brand tax” from their cost
structure and sharing the savings directly with consumers.  Traditional
CPG incumbents incur a 40-50% increase in overall “cost” because of their
legacy supply chains, inefficient marketing channels, and high distributor
mark-ups — which is subsequently paid by consumers via higher prices for almost
everything we purchase on a regular basis.  New entrants are not plagued
by these same historic taxes, enabling Brandless to remove additional costs
from day one.  As a result, every product
offered has substantial savings when compared to traditional brands (as high as
70+% in some categories), depending on the size of the industry “brand tax”
that is stripped from its price.  If successful across many SKUs, this
disruptive approach will unbundle the “brand tax” from many aisles in grocery
stores today, and increase overall access to healthier, higher quality food and
household goods for everyone.  We
invest in entrepreneurs who challenge conventional wisdom and want to change
the world, and that’s exactly what I found when I met Tina Sharkey, Ido Leffler
and the whole Brandless team!  Tina and Ido have dedicated their careers
to building consumer products and brands in family, health, and education, and
their professional successes have been both cause-centric and double bottom
line.  They believed that a new, transparent, authentic supplier could
change the way we view price and value in grocery stores, ultimately liberating
us all from paying the “brand tax”.  Today is the beginning of a
significant movement, and I hope you will all join us in “Going Brandless!”

Doing our (small) part to invest in gender diversity


Good in depth look by Bloomberg at gender diversity in venture capital investments.  I am proud that NEA has invested in the most women-founded companies in the industry.  There is still much work to be done across the tech sector to bring more awareness to both conscious and unconscious bias, and we all must do our small part to move us forward.  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-31/at-top-vc-firms-more-women-partners-doesn-t-mean-more-women-funded






The Players’ Tribune:  Why Authenticity Matters in Media


Today we are excited to announce a $40 M financing for The Players’ Tribune, a sports media company founded by Derek Jeter in 2014.Derek’s vision was to create a media company that focused uniquely on the needs of athletes and fans, and he recruited an amazing group of athletes and entrepreneurs to his All-Star team.  It has been an amazing experience watching our company grow from a small blog to THE trusted media platform for the athlete community, and we are thrilled to have IVP and Google as investors in our latest round. In a world that is flooded with clickbait and fake news, The Players’ Tribune has differentiated itself by focusing on original, high quality, highly engaging content.  We break critical news and celebrate human achievement through sports, but more importantly we tell the stories that are left untold by traditional media outlets.  I am perhaps most proud of our athletes and editors who have taken bold positions on issues such as domestic violence, racism, and gender discrimination.  These stories require courage and conviction, and have had meaningful impact well beyond the sports world.  We are one of many important companies trying to re-build the media industry around authenticity and trust, and would not be able to do so without our amazing team and the faith of our >1,200 athlete contributors. The media world has undergone a dramatic shift over the course of the last decade, and the $40 billion sports media market is (finally) undergoing its transition from traditional to digital distribution.  This tectonic shift creates huge opportunities for new entrants to compete for audience and market share in one of the most of the valuable and largely untapped markets for start-ups.  Congrats to the team at The Players’ Tribune and stay tuned for more from us – we are just getting started!

HackerOne:  Cybersecurity is War, and We Need a New Army


“The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result”  – Albert Einstein, 1951 “It may sound crazy to try this.  But it is also irresponsible not to…” – Bill Gurley, 2015I am excited to
announce our investment in HackerOne, the leading cybersecurity marketplace which
connects enterprises and governments to responsible and ethical hackers.  Many of the largest Internet companies such as
Facebook, Google, and Microsoft learned years ago that in order to protect
their sites against attacks, they needed more than firewalls, vulnerability
scanners, and security consultants.  They
needed an army – and they quietly enlisted tens of thousands of developers
around the world to openly hack them.  
The results were astounding – at Facebook alone, public hackers reported
more bugs in 48 hours than had previously been discovered by their internal
team throughout the entire previous year. 
After paying out millions of dollars to hackers for successful
disclosure, these Internet platforms surprisingly pioneered one of the most
provocative and increasingly effective programs in the security industry
today:  the bug bounty.*  More than $80
billion is spent annually by enterprises and governments to secure their
digital assets – this number has grown substantially over the past 10 years,
but nonetheless there is increasing frustration that we’ve lost the war on
cybercrime.  In the past year alone, J.P.
Morgan lost consumer data for more than 80 million account holders, Target lost
more than 70 million credit and debit card numbers, and the federal government
lost over 4 million confidential records of employees with security clearance.  Furthermore, more than 80% of all
corporations have reported some type of breach, and it seems that every day we
learn about yet another important organization that has been compromised in
some way.  The cybersecurity industry
faces a spending paradox that perplexes many leaders sitting in boardrooms
today – “If we’re investing more money in security, why aren’t we any more
secure?”  There are
generally two widely accepted answers to this question:Most security solutions protect you from
known threats.  However, the threats that
matter the most are the threats you haven’t seen.  Security is not a technology problem –
it’s a human problem.  No amount of
software or computing power can fully protect you from the creativity, agility,
(and at times stupidity) of mankind.  These issues are
not new to the industry, but organizations that are using HackerOne are finally
tackling them head on.  First, HackerOne
helps companies enlist an army of humans into the war on cybercrime.  Today, more than 200 organizations have paid
out substantial bounties to tens of thousands of responsible hackers, and I
expect millions of software developers will ultimately join the fight to protect
the Internet.  Second, HackerOne’s
community is already finding vulnerabilities previously undetected by the most
advanced software, making it possible for organizations to see threats before
they are exploited.  Some surveys report
that only 1% of real threats are detected by today’s best security products.  HackerOne is finding orders of magnitude more
vulnerabilities from their community of hackers, giving organizations a chance
to see and fix their problems well advance of a significant attack.  As an
entrepreneur, I founded a security company and served with many friends in the
war against cybercrime.  I am personally
thrilled to work with the HackerOne team – the security industry has always
attracted some of the brightest minds in software development, but we’ve fallen
behind and need to embrace a completely new approach.  We need to enlist a new army to fight this
war, and with HackerOne we can build a community to make the Internet a safer
place.  Should your organization work
with hackers?  It would be insane not to.* One of the great testimonials of bug bounties is from
Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer of Facebook.  Click here

Why Derek Jeter is hitting a Home Run as an Entrepreneur


“I love it when people doubt me. It makes me work harder to prove them wrong.”  – Derek Jeter, 2015I am excited to
announce our investment in The Players’ Tribune, an innovative new media company
founded by Derek Jeter.  NEA has a longstanding history of working with
accomplished entrepreneurs, but few with a career as celebrated as Derek’s,
which includes 5 World Series titles and 14 All-Star appearances.  Derek
is known not only for his commitment to excellence and incredible work ethic,
but also for his humility and integrity both on and off the field.  Upon retirement from baseball, Derek has found
a new mission in The Players’ Tribune, and hopes to ultimately transform and
re-invent the way that athletes connect with fans.  In a very short period
of time he has attracted over 100 of the most influential athletes to
participate, and has recruited a world-class executive team to join
him.   The tectonic
plates of the $40 billion sports media industry have been shifting for years
due to the rapid adoption of mobile devices, the rising popularity of over the
top (OTT) content services, and the widespread use of social media.  These
technology waves have made it possible for new media companies such as The
Players’ Tribune to work directly with athletes to create unique and compelling
content that can reach millions of fans around the world.  Derek’s vision is to have The Players’
Tribune provide authentic editorial and live interactive experiences,
leveraging the most modern and disruptive technology available.  For
example, The Players’ Tribune recently partnered with video conferencing
pioneer Blue Jeans Network, another NEA portfolio company, to enable individual
athletes to communicate with over 10,000 fans using interactive 2-way
video.  This is just one of many ways that The Players’ Tribune is
transforming the relationship between athletes and fans – stay tuned as there
is much more to come! The great
entrepreneurs that NEA has backed throughout our 37 year history share a few
common traits:  (i) they are passionate
about their mission and vision, (ii) they are fearless and competitive, (iii)
they move with speed and agility, and (iv) they attract great talent and build amazing
teams.  It is fair to say that Derek has
already embodied these characteristics throughout his life – and though some
may ask whether he can have as successful a career as an entrepreneur as he
enjoyed in baseball, I personally don’t think you want to bet against him.

Q&A with NEA's Jon Sakoda on big tech challenges - Silicon Valley Business Journal

Do your VCs have an uncomfortably high burn rate?  


* This blog is a follow-up to Fortune’s Dan Primack and his post:  The startup world’s other ‘cash burn’ problem” where he suggests that venture capitalists, by and large, have a burn rate problem. Over the past several weeks, much attention has been placed on unquestionably high start-up burn rates and whether entrepreneurs should change their current operating models in the face of a potential downturn.   But an equally important question for entrepreneurs is whether the VC industry, and specifically the firms that have invested in YOUR start-up, have an uncomfortably high burn rate.  Have we invested too quickly in other start-ups and have alarmingly low cash reserves?  Have we prepared for a downturn? For many entrepreneurs, the idea that a VC firm could run out of money feels highly unlikely.  But VC firms have their own “burn rate”—they do not have unlimited capital and must manage their investable cash between new investments and reserves for follow-on investments.  The rule of thumb is that VC firms should reserve about $1 for every $1 invested in a portfolio company.  In good times, when capital from a variety of sources including hedge funds, mutual funds, and wealthy individuals chases after start-ups, VC firms tend to reserve a little less as they can rely on alternative sources of funding.  When the cycle turns, these alternative sources tend to exit the industry, leaving only “traditional” VCs who have the appetite, conviction, and CAPACITY to continue investing.  VC fund reserves enable the industry to fund its best companies during tough times; within NEA’s own portfolio, some of our biggest wins—companies like Groupon, Opower, Tableau Software, and Workday were supported through some of the darkest days of venture capital between 2008 and 2010.Is the venture industry prepared for a downturn? The following chart shows how much capital has been raised in the US venture industry over the past 5-plus years—over $100 billion since 2009.  It is very hard to know exactly how much has been invested by each individual firm, but it is possible to estimate how rapidly funds have deployed their capital over the past 5 years, and how much capital is reserved for a rainy day.  Most funds commit their capital over a 3-5 year investment period, with the vast majority of new investments made in the first 3 years and the remainder of the funds “reserved” for follow-on investments in that fund over the subsequent 5-7 years.  Using a set of assumptions* to gauge how fast each fund invests their capital, we can estimate how much capital is reserved across the industry.  Based on the chart below, our best guess is that the industry will have ~$40 billion of available capital and ~$26 billion of capital earmarked for reserves at the end of this year.  This may seem like a lot of money in aggregate, but for many entrepreneurs that have never experienced a severe downturn (when all of the non-traditional sources of venture capital flee the market), there are a few warnings:Venture backed companies (from all sources) are raising ~$10 billion PER QUARTER.  If the VC industry alone were to attempt to fund all current VC backed companies at today’s levels through a downturn, we would effectively run out of reserves in 3-4 quarters.  It is obvious that the industry investment pace would have to slow down dramatically, at least 30-50% from current levels, in order to extend the runway of our reserves through the cycle. The ~$26-40 billion in capital that is reserved must be shared across thousands of companies that have received >$160 billion in venture financings between 2009 and 2014.  That’s ~$0.16-0.25 of reserves for every $1 dollar invested in venture capital per company.  Under certain extraordinary circumstances, even the top quartile of VC funded companies will be fighting for their fair share. Though the above numbers may be alarming in aggregate, the good news is that many VC firms are resilient and prepared for times like these.  Some firms, like NEA, take a very conservative approach to creating reserves to ensure that we always have cash for our portfolio companies.  In addition, the industry has established many tools to extend cash runway, including fund recycling (investing profits from old investments into strong existing portfolio companies), and both formal and informal co-investment vehicles with LPs that can create more capacity for much needed capital.  These approaches are not universally employed, but they can mitigate the effects of a downturn and provide a boost to the industry’s reserve capacity to help companies through tough times.Our industry is nearly 50 years old, and has largely survived several economic downturns while keeping our best companies alive.  As an entrepreneur, it is tempting to be lured into a false sense of security or paranoia by knowing whether your existing investors can fund you through the next economic cycle.  Great companies find a way to attract capital no matter how difficult the financing environment, and average companies won’t survive a downturn, no matter how well capitalized or strong their VC syndicates.  As VC’s and entrepreneurs, we must cherish the capital we have been given, invest it wisely and efficiently, and together build great companies that can last.  This is the best way to survive a downturn, and ensure that together we can weather a storm.  *  The industry “burn rate” is calculated by measuring the % of VC funds that are deployed in any given year, based on their vintage year.  For purposes of this analysis, we included all NVCA / Moneytree US VC funds closed since 2009 and have modeled deployment of each fund such that ~70% of every fund is invested over 3 years, and ~30% is reserved over the following 5 years.  “Capital Remaining” includes capital for both new investments and reserves for follow-ons.  “Capital Reserved” includes only capital specifically earmarked for reserves after initial investments are made.  For more detail, please e-mail jsakoda@nea.com.Jon’s perspectives on VC and entrepreneurship can be found at www.jonsakoda.com or on Twitter @jonsakoda.






UPDATE:  Signal or Noise?  NEA’s Experience with Signaling Risk


*This updated post is a follow-up to my interview with Connie Loizos at StrictlyVC who posted my Q&A: Never Mind What Angels Say, VCs Have Your Back.  My original post was published in July 2013.NEA is one of the largest VC firms by assets under management, and has quietly become one of the most active seed investors in the industry. Launching a seed program was controversial, both within the firm and throughout the seed investment community.  The primary concern was “signaling risk”, or the notion that when a large VC fund makes a seed investment but chooses not to invest in a Series A round, the company’s ability to raise additional capital is significantly impaired. That negative “signal” could damage both the reputation of the company and the relationship between the entrepreneur and its investor.  After 35 years of building a reputation of trust and respect with entrepreneurs, we probably worried as much—or more—about this “signaling risk” than anyone. As a result, since launching a dedicated seed program in early 2011, it’s something we have proactively measured and monitored from day one. The early results so far have been surprising to many with whom we’ve shared the data. NEA’s seed program has made more than 75 investments totaling north of $30 million. The portfolio spans multiple sectors of technology (consumer, enterprise, healthcare, energy) and geography (Silicon Valley, Boston, New York, LA, and DC) and represents the diversity of interests and strategies employed by our global partnership. We have recently analyzed our first cohort of 50 seed investments, all of whom raised their initial seed rounds between March 2011 and August 2013.  The data is as follows:50 total companies (100%)10 Series A Investments Led by NEA (20%)15 Series A Investments Led by Other VCs (30%)25 Total Series A Investments (50%)12 Wind Downs or M&A exits (24%) 13 companies currently “too early to tell”* (26%)(*this category includes companies that have not yet tried to raise capital, have raised seed extensions in advance of Series A, or are otherwise too early to tell)Given all of our concern about signaling risk, we expected to see more companies that are NOT funded by NEA struggle to raise a Series A.  Instead, we have found the opposite. At this stage, 50% of our seed companies are getting financed by a VC firm, NEA or otherwise, at Series A.  Our best guess is that more than 60% will be successful when this cohort fully matures.Our seed funded companies have been 50% more likely to get financed by another VC firm, NOT NEA.  This is the exact opposite of what you would expect to see if signaling risk was significant in determining whether or not other VC firms would invest in NEA seeded companies.   The fact is that many VC firms choose to invest in NEA-seeded companies even if NEA does not lead the Series A.  There are many reasons why this occurs, but a few of the more consistent ones are:Strong Fundamentals Speak for Themselves:  When we seed a company, we invest in great people, differentiated products, and large market opportunities. These fundamentals tend to be more important than the brand name or composition of a company’s investor syndicate, and tend to be highly sought after by many VC firms including NEA.Entrepreneurs Have Many Choices:  We are privileged to work with great entrepreneurs who have many options for financing their company.  Many times other VCs are willing to offer more attractive options than we are able to provide.  We are thrilled when our seed companies reach these important milestones, independent of the dollar amounts we’ve invested.We Are Not Always the Best Long Term Partner:  Seed companies change course frequently, and pivot into spaces or sectors that align better with other VC firms or partners. These shifts could also result in direct competition with companies in our existing portfolio, and when this occurs we do everything we can to manage conflict and maintain trust with our entrepreneurs and co-investors.VCs Don’t Always Follow the Herd:  The VC community is diverse and sophisticated, and many firms weigh investments on their merits as they see them, not another firm’s opinion.  Herd mentality is less prevalent in venture capital than some might think.On this last point, it is important to remember that building a successful start-up is one of the hardest undertakings on the planet.  It should not be surprising that investing in start-ups is equally challenging.  When we make a decision to invest—or not—in a Series A, it does NOT always mean we’ve made the right call.  We are human and we make mistakes. We aim not to repeat those mistakes at Series B, Series C, and beyond. To be clear, we are not claiming that signaling risk does not exist.  To this day we are still very careful and selective about our seed investing for this very reason.  Entrepreneurs have many choices for how to build their seed syndicates, and those that choose to work with NEA get a partner with a long term perspective, at any and every stage of their growth, no matter how much money we’ve invested.  This is the strongest signal we send to our entrepreneurs, to our co-investors, and to the market, and it is a signal that hopefully continues to drown out the noise of signaling risk.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
