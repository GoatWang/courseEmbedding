Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.26% for DXCTX, 2.01% for DXSCX, and 1.01% for DXCIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

Source: Bloomberg. Data from 10/1/2010 – 6/30/2017. October 1, 2010 is the inception of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index. Index returns and correlations are historical and are not representative of any fund performance. Total returns of the index include reinvested dividends. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  One cannot invest directly in an index. The indexes are composite indexes of commodity sector returns representing unmanaged, unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that are broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities. 

S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&P GSCI), a composite index of commodity sector returns representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that is broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities;
Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index (BCOM TR), a broadly diversified index that allows investors to track 19 commodity futures through a single, simple measure
Deutsche Banc Liquid Commodity Optimum Yield Index (DBC CI), an index composed of futures contracts on 14 of the most heavily-traded and important physical commodities in the world.

Standard Deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.
Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.
Maximum Drawdown is the greatest percent decline from a previous high.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.26% for DXCTX, 2.01% for DXSCX, and 1.01% for DXCIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
