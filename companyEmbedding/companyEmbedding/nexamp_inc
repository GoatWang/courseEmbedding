I am currently a new Asset Manager for Nexamp, monitoring and maintaining the company’s operating solar portfolio. Only six months ago, I was finishing up my undergraduate studies, still somewhat unsure of my career trajectory. I studied English and Environmental Science at Wesleyan and I have always had a passion for current issues relevant to my generation. Environmental threats are only becoming more pressing and I was confident that coupling these problems with developing technologies would lead to a lot of untapped job growth in the industry. It was this initial lure that brought me to Washington, D.C. for an environmental policy internship just a few weeks after finishing up college.

Yesterday President Obama announced his Clean Energy Savings For All Initiative and its goal of bringing 1 gigawatt of solar to low- and moderate- income families by 2020. We here at Nexamp are proud to support this goal by committing to complete construction on 17 new community solar projects by the end of 2016, totalling 35 megawatts of projects that will serve nearly 2000 households, small businesses and non-profit organizations.

C-PACE comes to Rhode Island: An easier way to go Solar

Increasing your property’s value while supporting renewable energy has always been appealing, though not always economically compelling. Onsite solar projects can provide reliable and significant electricity cost savings. Especially in Rhode Island, where electricity rates are among the highest in the country, properties with solar installations can differentiate themselves - and even draw a premium - for progressive tenants drawn by industrial expansion and economic growth. Unfortunately, typical financing structures can limit the potential for these projects to become a reality for middle market commercial and industrial property owners.However, a new option is quickly gaining popularity in the Ocean State: Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE). C-PACE allows property owners to finance a solar project through voluntary charges on their property tax bill over the life the project. Following major successes in California and Connecticut, C-PACE legislation has been enacted in Rhode Island and 31 other states to help owners bring their properties into the new energy economy.

Nexamp, Inc. Announces Completion of Newest Community Solar Project
Jun 15 17
Nexamp, Inc. announced completion of its newest community solar project, a 700 kilowatt (kW) facility located in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. It is the first community solar project to serve Unitil customers in Massachusetts and will provide local residents and small businesses with access to the benefits of solar energy for the first time. Through Nexamp's innovative Solarize My Bill community solar program, participating Unitil customers, many of whom were previously unable to install solar panels on their own property, are now seeing reduced electricity charges through their subscription to the Fitchburg Solar project. In addition, the neighboring Town of Lunenburg will realize substantial energy cost savings through a long-term agreement to purchase discounted energy credits generated by the project. Together, the Town of Lunenburg and Nexamp's Solarize My Bill customers are expected to save hundreds of thousands of dollars through their participation in the project.

Notably, Downing will lead the company's entry into the burgeoning energy storage market, guiding efforts to align and implement new technologies within existing and developing national policy frameworks. Prior to joining Nexamp, Mr. Downing represented the state's Senate district, serving 52 communities across four counties in Western Massachusetts. During his decade-long tenure, Downing championed issues ranging from alternative energy deployment to reducing poverty, and supporting the expansion of civil transgender rights.

Comprehensive and Integrated Solutions: Many companies offer only one-dimensional solutions. Nexamp takes a multi-dimensional approach. We integrate all available options (renewable, energy efficiency, procurement) into the most cost-effective solutions for our clients’ needs. 
Client Centered: We believe that the best strategy for optimizing the value of energy and carbon reduction solutions is unique for each client.
Financially Sustainable: We know from experience that carbon reduction is not free. To minimize costs, we capture every source of cash savings, utilize all available federal and state financial incentives, and provide off-balance sheet financing, when needed.
Independent: We are not tied to any single supplier of equipment. Our sole criterion is how to deploy the most cost-effective technology solution for a given situation and client.

Connecticut Solar Panel Installers

	Connecticut, like many states in the New England United States, has abundant sunshine which makes it a great location to install solar power. Connecticut solar installers are among the busiest in the country and the state ranks fourth in the country for solar output according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. In 2010 Connecticut installed over 54 megawatts of solar power, more than doubling the 21 megawatts installed during 2009.

	Great incentives and rebates are available to home owners and businesses for Connecticut solar installation. For example, SRP has set aside funding for a total of 4.5 megawatts of residential solar electric installations through April 30, 2012. The incentive is offered at $1.00 to $1.35 per watt, for up to 5 kilowatts. Find out more by talking to one of the many Connecticut solar installers in our network today. We have solar installation professionals servicing Bridgeport, New Haven, Hartford,  Stamford, Waterbury, Norwalk and just about everywhere else in Connecticut.

	If you are like many people who don't have time to do the research or make inquiries yourself, then let us help you. Simply fill out our short solar inquiry form and we'll find you reputable and experienced Connecticut solar installers in your local area and put you in touch with company representatives who can evaluate your needs and provide proposals for you to review. It’s free, easy, and there is no obligation.
