	Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.



	On June 15, 2017, Extended Stay America, Inc. (the Company) entered into a preferred share repurchase agreement (the Share Repurchase
	Agreement) with certain entities affiliated with Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and The Blackstone Group L.P. (the Selling Stockholders) pursuant to which the Company repurchased, directly from the Selling Stockholders, 14,069 shares
	of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company (the Preferred Shares) on June 15, 2017. The preferred share repurchase was effected in a private, non-underwritten transaction at a price per share equal to $1,000 plus all accrued and
	unpaid dividends thereon through and including the date of the repurchase. The Company funded the preferred share repurchase from cash on hand. The preferred share repurchase was approved by the Companys audit committee. After this preferred
	share repurchase, the Company has 7,133 Preferred Shares outstanding and the Selling Stockholders no longer beneficially own any Preferred Shares. The foregoing description of the Share Repurchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is
	qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Share Repurchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

	Extended Stay America Announces Repurchase of Preferred Shares



	CHARLOTTE, N.C.June 15, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) Extended Stay America, Inc. (the Company) (NYSE: STAY) today announced that it entered
	into a preferred share repurchase agreement with certain selling stockholders affiliated with Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and The Blackstone Group L.P. (the Selling Stockholders) pursuant to which the Company repurchased directly from
	the Selling Stockholders 14,069 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company (the Preferred Shares). The preferred share repurchase was effected in a private, non-underwritten transaction at a price per share equal to $1,000 plus
	all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon through and including the date of the repurchase. The Company funded the preferred share repurchase from cash on hand. The preferred share repurchase was approved by the Companys audit committee. After
	this preferred share repurchase, the Company has 7,133 Preferred Shares outstanding and the Selling Stockholders no longer beneficially own any Preferred Shares. Following the closing of the preferred share repurchase, the repurchased Preferred
	Shares will be retired. The timing and method of any future Preferred Share repurchases (other than in connection with the exercise of any put rights), will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions and the Companys financial
	condition and are subject to the discretion of management.


	The Companys Chief Financial Officer, Jonathan Halkyard, commented, We are pleased
	to continue to improve our balance sheet and lower our cost of capital. Since returning to the public markets in 2013 and including this repurchase agreement, the Company has retired over $950 million in debt and has refinanced the entire balance
	sheet into long dated, low cost and flexible debt.

	Item 1.01.




	Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.





	On May 29, 2017, Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH
	Hospitality, Inc. (together, the Company) entered into a share repurchase agreement (the Share Repurchase Agreement) with the Selling Stockholders (as defined below) pursuant to which they intend to repurchase, directly from
	the Selling Stockholders, 583,530 Paired Shares, each Paired Share consisting of a share of common stock of Extended Stay America, Inc. and a share of Class B common stock of ESH Hospitality, Inc., which are attached and trade together as Paired
	Shares. The share repurchase will be effected in a private, non-underwritten transaction at a price per share equal to the price paid by the underwriters in the offering (as defined below). Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc.
	expect to fund the share repurchase from cash on hand. The share repurchase is expected to be consummated concurrently with the offering. Although the completion of the share repurchase will be conditioned upon the closing of the offering, the
	closing of the offering will not be conditioned upon the closing of the share repurchase. The share repurchase has been approved by the audit committees of Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc. and is pursuant to, and will count
	toward, the Companys existing combined Paired Share repurchase program. The foregoing description of the Share Repurchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Share
	Repurchase Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.




	 









	Item 8.01




	Other Events.





	On May 31, 2017, the Company issued a press release which announced the pricing of
	the underwritten secondary offering (the offering) of 25,000,000 Paired Shares. The Paired Shares were offered by certain entities affiliated with Centerbridge Partners, L.P., Paulson & Co. Inc. and The Blackstone Group L.P.
	(the Selling Stockholders), which is expected to result in gross proceeds of approximately $438,750,000. The Paired Shares may be offered by the underwriters from time to time to purchasers directly or through agents, or through brokers
	in brokerage transactions on the NYSE, or to dealers in negotiated transactions or in a combination of such methods of sale, at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, or at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to
	such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. The offering is expected to close on June 5, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.


	The
	Company will not sell any Paired Shares in the offering and will not receive any proceeds from the offering. In addition, none of the Companys officers or directors are selling any Paired Shares beneficially owned by them in the offering.


	A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

	Class B common stock of ESH Hospitality, Inc., which are attached and trade together as Paired Shares. The Paired Shares were offered by certain selling stockholders affiliated with Centerbridge Partners, L.P., Paulson & Co. Inc. and The
	Blackstone Group L.P. (the Selling Stockholders), which is expected to result in gross proceeds of approximately $438,750,000. The offering is expected to close on June 5, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.


	Following the completion of this offering and related distributions of an aggregate of 500,716 Paired Shares by funds and partnerships affiliated with
	Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and The Blackstone Group L.P. to their respective partners, Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and The Blackstone Group L.P. and their affiliated funds and partnerships will no longer beneficially own any Paired Shares and
	Paulson & Co. Inc. and its affiliated funds and accounts will continue to beneficially own approximately 1,800,000 Paired Shares. We currently expect that each of the directors of Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc.
	affiliated with the Selling Stockholders will continue to serve following the offering until the 2018 annual meetings of shareholders, the election of a successor or his resignation, as the case may be.


	The Company will not sell any Paired Shares in the offering and will not receive any proceeds from the offering. In addition, none of the Companys
	officers or directors are selling any Paired Shares beneficially owned by them in the offering.


	Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are acting as the
	underwriters for the offering.


	The offering is being made only by means of a prospectus and related prospectus supplement, copies of which may be
	obtained, when available, from: Citigroup, c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions, 1155 Long Island Avenue, Edgewood, NY 11717 (Tel: 800-831-9146); or Morgan StanleyAttn: Prospectus Department180 Varick Street, 2nd FloorNew York, NY
	10014.


	In addition, as previously announced, Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc. have entered into a share repurchase agreement with
	the Selling Stockholders pursuant to which they intend to repurchase 583,530 Paired Shares directly from the Selling Stockholders. Extended Stay America, Inc. also announced that, soon after the completion of the offering, it intends to redeem or
	otherwise repurchase shares of its mandatorily redeemable voting preferred stock held by certain of the Selling Stockholders and their affiliates (the preferred share redemption).


	The share repurchase will be effected in a private, non-underwritten transaction at a price per share equal to the price paid by the underwriters in the
	offering. Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc. expect to fund the share repurchase from cash on hand. The share repurchase is expected to be consummated concurrently with the offering. Although the share repurchase will be
	conditioned upon, among other things, the closing of the offering, the closing of the offering will not be conditioned upon the closing of the share repurchase. The share repurchase has been approved by the audit committees of Extended Stay America,
	Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc. and is pursuant to, and will count toward, the Companys existing combined Paired Share repurchase program. Following the closing of the share repurchase, the repurchased Paired Shares will be retired. The timing
	and method of any future repurchases, which will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions and the Companys financial condition, are subject to the discretion of management.


	Extended Stay America, Inc. expects to effect the preferred share redemption in a private transaction at a price to be determined as set forth in its amended
	and restated certificate of incorporation and to fund the preferred share redemption from cash on hand. Although the preferred share redemption has been approved by the audit committee of Extended Stay America, Inc., the terms and timing of the
	preferred share redemption, if any, will depend on a variety of factors, and there can be no assurance that the preferred share redemption will be completed on the expected timing or at all.
