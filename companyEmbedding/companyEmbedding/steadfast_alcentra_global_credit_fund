Steadfast Capital Markets Group Teams with Alcentra to Launch Global Credit Fund

Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund seeks to provide income through direct lending opportunities to private middle-market companies in the United States and Western Europe




Jun 5, 2017, 1:50pm EDT














IRVINE, Calif., June 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Steadfast Capital Markets Group ("Steadfast") and Alcentra NY LLC ("Alcentra"), a BNY Mellon investment boutique, today announced the launch of its latest alternative program, Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund, an unlisted closed-end fund that seeks to capitalize on the growing opportunity to provide direct lending to middle-market companies in the United States and Western Europe. 
Steadfast is teaming with Alcentra as the fund's investment sub-adviser.  Alcentra will source and actively manage the fund's direct lending investments, backed by its deep institutional expertise and experience in providing debt and equity financing to middle-market companies, both in the U.S. and Europe. The fund's objective is to provide qualified investors current income and capital preservation with the potential for capital appreciation. 
"Financial regulations introduced in the United States and Europe in recent years have resulted in constrained traditional bank lending to middle-market companies, providing a growing opportunity for alternative direct lenders such as Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund," said fund CEO Christopher Hilbert.  "Teaming with Alcentra, a proven alternative lending investment manager, Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund will seek to help finance the growth of successful private companies across the U.S. and Western Europe, while providing individual investors the opportunity to achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return and reliable income.
Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund will offer up to $3 billion in shares of its common stock for sale initially at $9.68 per share.  The fund's share price will periodically adjust based on the net asset value of the company's investment portfolio. The fund intends to use the proceeds of the offering to provide customized financing solutions to lower middle-market and middle-market companies in the form of floating and fixed rate senior secured loans, second lien loans, subordinated debt and to a lesser extent, minority equity investments.
David Scopelliti, chief investment officer of Alcentra's U.S. direct lending business, added, "One of the key advantages Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund enjoys as an unlisted closed-end fund is the ability to source global investments throughout the United States, as well as in Western European markets where Alcentra is an established leader.  Additionally, this structure enhances our ability to invest in opportunities that we believe will provide attractive yield and strong risk-adjusted returns to our investors."

Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund


Prior to reviewing information specific to Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund, you must first receive and carefully review a copy of the prospectus. You may download a copy of the prospectus via the following link: download prospectus.
An investment in Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund involves a high degree of risk. You should purchase shares only if you can afford a loss of some or all of your investment.
Past performance is no indication of future results and there can be no assurance that Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund will be able to execute the business plan for the properties or the offering.

You should carefully consider the information set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus for a discussion of material risk factors relevant to an investment in our common stock, including, but not limited to, the following: 

An investment in the Shares is not suitable for investors if they need access to the money they invest.
The Company's shareholders should consider that they may not have access to the money they invest for an indefinite period of time. See “Liquidity Strategy.”
Unlike an investor in most closed-end funds, shareholders should not expect to be able to sell their Shares regardless of how the Company performs.
If a shareholder is able to sell their Shares, the shareholder likely will receive less than their purchase price and the then current net asset value per Share (“NAV per Share”).
Unlike most closed-end funds, the Shares are not listed on any securities exchange and the Company may not seek to complete a liquidity event until two years following the termination of this offering or any follow-on offering.
Shareholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate future Company investments prior to purchasing Shares. As a result, the offering may be considered a “blind pool” offering.
To provide shareholders with limited liquidity, the Company intends to conduct quarterly repurchases of Shares beginning the first calendar quarter following the oneyear anniversary of the satisfaction of the Company's minimum offering requirement to raise at least $3,000,000 in proceeds from this offering within one year from the date of this prospectus (the “Minimum Offering Requirement”). Although the Company has implemented a share repurchase program, it may be discontinued at any time and only a limited number of Shares are eligible for repurchase. The Company currently intends to limit the number of Shares to be repurchased during any calendar year to the number of Shares the Company can repurchase with the proceeds it receives from the issuance of Shares under its distribution reinvestment plan. In addition, the Company will limit the number of Shares to be repurchased in any calendar year to 10% of the weighted average number of Shares outstanding in the prior calendar year, or 2.5% in each quarter, though the actual number of Shares that the Company offers to repurchase may be less in light of the limitations noted above. Shareholders that tender their Shares within one year of purchase will be subject to an early withdrawal charge of 2.0%.
The Company's distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to the Company for investment. Any capital returned to shareholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses, as well as selling commissions and/or dealer manager fees, if applicable.
Even if the Company does eventually list its Shares, shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to NAV per Share and this creates a risk of loss for investors who purchase Shares at the offering price. This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the Company's NAV per Share will decrease. 


The underlying assumptions and any forward looking statements herein may not be accurate, the projections herein shown may not occur, and your performance may vary significantly. To the extent the information in this brochure conflicts with the information in the prospectus, the information in the prospectus shall govern.

Please acknowledge that you have received a copy of the prospectus and have had an opportunity to review the summary risk factors above.

IRVINE, Calif., June 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Steadfast Capital Markets Group ("Steadfast") and Alcentra NY LLC ("Alcentra"), a BNY Mellon investment boutique, today announced the launch of its latest alternative program, Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund, an unlisted closed-end fund that seeks to capitalize on the growing opportunity to provide direct lending to middle-market companies in the United States and Western Europe. 








Steadfast is teaming with Alcentra as the fund's investment sub-adviser.  Alcentra will source and actively manage the fund's direct lending investments, backed by its deep institutional expertise and experience in providing debt and equity financing to middle-market companies, both in the U.S. and Europe. The fund's objective is to provide qualified investors current income and capital preservation with the potential for capital appreciation. 
"Financial regulations introduced in the United States and Europe in recent years have resulted in constrained traditional bank lending to middle-market companies, providing a growing opportunity for alternative direct lenders such as Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund," said fund CEO Christopher Hilbert.  "Teaming with Alcentra, a proven alternative lending investment manager, Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund will seek to help finance the growth of successful private companies across the U.S. and Western Europe, while providing individual investors the opportunity to achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return and reliable income.
Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund will offer up to $3 billion in shares of its common stock for sale initially at $9.68 per share.  The fund's share price will periodically adjust based on the net asset value of the company's investment portfolio. The fund intends to use the proceeds of the offering to provide customized financing solutions to lower middle-market and middle-market companies in the form of floating and fixed rate senior secured loans, second lien loans, subordinated debt and to a lesser extent, minority equity investments.
David Scopelliti, chief investment officer of Alcentra's U.S. direct lending business, added, "One of the key advantages Steadfast Alcentra Global Credit Fund enjoys as an unlisted closed-end fund is the ability to source global investments throughout the United States, as well as in Western European markets where Alcentra is an established leader.  Additionally, this structure enhances our ability to invest in opportunities that we believe will provide attractive yield and strong risk-adjusted returns to our investors."
