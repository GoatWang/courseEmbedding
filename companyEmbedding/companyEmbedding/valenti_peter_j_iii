Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

	Peter  J.  Valenti III
Division President, Breast and Skeletal Health SolutionsHologic Inc. 
Peter J. Valenti III is Division President, Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions, for Hologic Inc., a multi-billion dollar medical devices company he joined in early 2014. His division represents over $1B of revenue and is a global leader in Mammography, Interventional Breast Health and Bone. Previously, he was a partner for a Marketing Strategy firm, The New England Consulting Group. Prior to this he served as North America President, Vision Care and Corporate Vice President and Global President, Vision Care for Bausch + Lomb. Pete’s career as a healthcare executive has spanned over 20 years including roles with Covidien and over 12 years with Johnson & Johnson. He began his post MBA career with Procter & Gamble.
Pete’s leadership experience is mostly in turnaround or challenging business situations. All of the roles he has had in his post MBA career have been in slow or negative growth situations. Realizing that he enjoyed the leadership and business challenges, he thrived in and sought out these situations. They require urgent and intense focus on people, culture, innovative approaches and change management. Being able to be successful in these situations across a spectrum of smaller to larger businesses requires a speedy and intent-filled transition.
While just two years into his tenure at Hologic, his division has significantly accelerated revenue and transformed its approaches to product and service innovation, commercialization and people/team development. While it is still early, the future looks promising.
 
In his Bausch + Lomb Global President’s role, he successfully led the turnaround of the Vision Care business from a decade of decline to significant growth. This was done behind a relentless focus on the customer, creating a market leading product pipeline, embracing innovative marketing, overhauling the supply chain, and critical people/team development. He joined Bausch + Lomb in January, 2009. Bausch + Lomb completed its transformation as a private equity owned business as it was purchased at the end of 2013 by Canada based Valeant Pharmaceuticals.
Before joining Bausch + Lomb, Pete was Vice President and General Manager, Surgical Devices (U.S.), for Covidien, where he led sales and marketing strategy for its $1 billion product portfolio from 2007 to early 2009. Another successful turnaround, Covidien Surgical’s growth was reinvigorated behind breakthrough new approaches to customer and channel, transforming sales and marketing, and people/team development.
He earlier spent over 12 years with Johnson & Johnson, serving in a variety of U.S. and international roles managing consumer, pharmaceutical and device businesses. These included positions as Vice President, Global Strategy, Vice President, Marketing and Executive Director. It was through innovative approaches to strategy, marketing and new products that allowed Pete’s teams to generate transformational growth across numerous business and categories.
He presently serves as a Board member for three organizations.
Pete received his MBA from the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University in 1992, and a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Connecticut. He lives in Connecticut and is happily married with 3 children.
