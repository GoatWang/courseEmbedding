        "For over 3 years, Envirovault equipped trailer mounted tanks have been an asset to our company. With Envirovault equipped tanks, we don’t have to worry about anything freezing
        during the winter months. Envirovault is not only cost-effective for our operations, but they eliminate soil contamination by preventing any leakage. Envirovault sets the standard high for
        quality and we wouldn't use anything else!"

Rick Dubisar, Owner/Founder:    In 1999 Rick saw a need for a local concrete precasting company to fulfill the needs of the explosive growth happening in Central Oregon. He made a plan and executed it. That was 17years ago. Today, his business has grown into a large full scale operation and is a well-known leader in concrete precast products in Oregon.  Rick has worked in the construction industry for over 40 years, you can be confident that he understands the needs of his customers.  Rick’s idea of a ‘good day’ is when an idea is transformed from a proposal into a completed project.   Someone once said “Man thrives, oddly enough, only in the presence of a challenging environment.” Rick enjoys the daily challenges that this industry provides. When asked if a particularly difficult project can be completed his usual response is “probably.” No, is rarely used in Rick’s vocabulary.One of the most challenging parts of the precast industry is maintaining the standards and requirements mandated by various organizations and government entities. Rick takes pride in adhering to the guidelines set forth and staying in compliance with those organizations and entities. Regularly our materials are being tested and checked in order to maintain the high quality of our products.Rick and his wife Darla live in Terrebonne and enjoy traveling with their RV and spending time with their children and grandchildren.When you hire Advanced Precast Products you can be confident that you have the industry leader working for you.Milo Dubisar, Assistant Manager:In May of 2012 Milo joined the team.

He can also be reached by email at Milo@AdvancedPrecastOregon.com.Karee Miller, Office Manager:Karee joined the team in November 2012 and brought a new wave of clerical procedures to us. Having been around construction for most of her life and a native to the Central Oregon area Karee is able to help us apply new and up-to-date practices to our plethora of paperwork with an understanding of how things work in the construction industry. Karee is responsible for maintaining our books, answering the phones, ordering supplies and keeping us up to date with ODOT and OSHA.

Hoover Vault™ Tanks
Containment Solutions, Inc. (CSI) provides safe, affordable solutions for the storage of flammable and combustible liquids. If you are concerned about the effects fuel storage has on your bottom line, look at the advantages of aboveground fire-protected storage tanks.
Our steel Hoover Vault™ tanks meet the requirements of all national fire codes for fire-rated aboveground storage tanks and are labeled according to Underwriter’s Laboratories Standard 2085 “Insulated, Protected Secondary Containment”.
Vault tanks utilize patented designs with lightweight fireproofing materials, applied in the interstitial space of UL 142 double-wall tanks. These materials ensure that the inner tank is protected from the effects of fire. This design allows both the inner and the outer tanks to be pressure tested at the factory and in the field. In addition, the fireproofing materials allow liquid to migrate through to the monitoring tube, so leaks from the inner tank are detected. Rectangular vault tanks are space-saving in design.
Advantages of Hoover Vault Tanks:
UL 2085 listed for insulated, protected secondary containment

Two-hour fire rating using lightweight concrete
