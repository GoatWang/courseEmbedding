What is NIT? — Neurotechnology Innovations Translator




















































Translating neuroscience from concept to clinic




What is NIT?



















NIT started with a clean slate, asking a simple question: “How can neurotech companies pioneer these innovations in today’s medtech world?”  The result?  Neurotech development, completely reimagined. NIT is a cutting-edge translational center--a private, for-profit company, formed in collaboration with over a dozen Partners, with a mission to develop and commercialize pioneering neurotechnology solutions to improve patient well-being. Built with the vision of developing a select number of high-quality, commercially-oriented companies, NIT brings together the vision, leadership, expertise, network, resources, personnel and capital to create the pre-eminent development ecosystem in the compelling frontier of neuroscience. NIT's translational approach substantially reduces risk and required capital for companies and their investors by accelerating the development cycle, avoiding pitfalls, and propelling companies through development to commercial success. NIT will create or attract multiple companies sourced from a global pipeline of innovation. Whether an idea on a napkin, or a more mature neurotech company that is further along in the development pathway, NIT will invest in, and engage with, a select number of attractive neurotechnology companies that will benefit from NIT’s resources and model to accelerate their success.NIT and its Partners collectively have over $160M in total capital and service commitments dedicated for investment in the development of these innovative neurotechnology companies.NIT is not an incubator; not a venture capital firm; not a contract manufacturing house; not a clinical trialing organization...per se. Instead, NIT brings the best of what each of these other entities has tried to deliver, comprehensively, under one translational center, borrowing their best attributes, but transforming them into an entity that provides a cocoon for your company’s success in today’s challenging landscape. The result: far more than just capital or seasoned advice--a comprehensive solution, providing the expertise, resources, and capital to propel your company from concept-to-clinic, and subsequently to commercial success. Expertise. NIT's team works hands-on with your company, bringing considerable experience in nurturing start-ups in the neurotechnology space, including developing the early science, product development, managing clinical trials, marketing and strategy, commercialization, governance and finance.Resources. NIT has amassed a complete neuroscience development ecosystem that includes all the capabilities needed for translating neuroscience ideas to commercial reality.Capital. NIT offers investment capital from our own dedicated funds and via our committed institutional, industry and venture capital Partners. NIT and its partners can participate in and/or lead investment rounds at any stage.
