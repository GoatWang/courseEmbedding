Mynd / FAQs








Frequently Asked Questions





























General Questions







Are you a full-service property management company or do you just offer the app?


We are a full-service property management company that utilizes technology to create efficiencies in the typical property management workflow and provide owners with unprecedented transparency into operating and financial metrics. We have our own team of experienced, highly qualified property managers that run the operation. 










Are you a licensed property manager?


Mynd Management, Inc. is a licensed corporate brokerage. (BRE #02014508)










How do you work with an onsite manager?


We establish minimum requirements for each onsite manager to complete on a weekly and monthly basis. Additionally, onsite managers help with small repairs, some janitorial tasks, and some leasing and administrative functions.Onsite managers receive discounted rent and a set wage for time worked. Since we manage many buildings in concentrated areas, we enable onsite managers to generate more income by completing tasks at smaller, nearby buildings that don’t have onsite managers. If any work is completed at a site that does not have an onsite manager, the completed work will be charged to that property.










What type of rental properties do you manage?


We manage residential multifamily properties. We work with owners who want to invest in their properties and maximize their returns, so we only manage well-maintained buildings.










What geographic areas do you cover?


We currently manage properties in the East Bay (Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, Hayward, etc.) and the Greater San Jose Area. We will be launching in San Francisco soon. 










When are you coming to my region?


We will focus primarily on the Bay Area in 2017, but we intend to start adding new West Coast markets aggressively in 2018.We have plans to operate nationally in the future.
                                        






The Mynd Advantage







Why should I hire you?


We will provide an overall better experience by increasing your returns, providing complete transparency into your property’s operating results, and guarantee legal compliance for your real estate investment without you having to lift a finger. We expect to make your investment properties 5-10% more profitable on average. 










What property management professional experience do you have?


Our highly experienced team of property management professionals have collectively managed over  25,000 units across the country over a 20 + year period.Our property management team has 63 years of combined experience in the Bay Area.Our Founders were NorCal Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year winners in the Real Estate category.Our Management team managed the most profitable Single Family Rental REIT in the US in Starwood Waypoint (NYSE: SWAY)










How are you different from other property management companies?

We use professional photos and 3D tours on our ads to increase interest in the unit.Leasing: We utilize self-showings so prospective residents can choose a convenient time to view the unit themselves. They will receive a unique access code for the two-hour time frame they are permitted to enter and view the unit.

Interested prospects will be able to submit an application online or via smartphone upon completing the tour. This method expedites the leasing process and minimizes vacancy.
