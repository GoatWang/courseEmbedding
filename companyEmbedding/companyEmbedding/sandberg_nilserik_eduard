		  #1      hallo!sino agro food  ist ein interessanter stark wachsender china-wert , welcher in 2014 die weichen für eine erfolgreiche zukunft stellt/gestellt hat.--------------------------------------------------Introduction:1. Aquaculture, or fish farming, will provide close to two thirds of global food fish    consumption by 2030           en.mercopress.com/2014/02/06/...bal-food-fish-by-2030-says-fao2. Global Aquaculture Market Trends, Size Research Report 2020 at GrandViewResearch     www.benzinga.com/14/09/4853060/...ndviewresearch#ixzz3DZ7czPTB--------------------------------------------------About Sino Agro Food, Inc.:Sino Agro Food, Inc. (SIAF) is an integrated developer, producer and distributor of organic food and agricultural products in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). The Company is focused on developing, producing and distributing higher margin agricultural products to meet the increasing demands from China's emerging middle class consumers for wholesome, trustworthy, higher quality, and gourmet or medicinal food items. We specialize in producing the highest quality beef and seafood, and high value produce.Current lines of business include Aquaculture, Livestock Farming, Plantation Farming, Farm Services, and Marketing & Trading.The Company's largest and most scalable businesses are indoor and semi-enclosed open dam aquaculture production of a variety of seafood, prawns, and eel, and production of over 60 cuts of beef and lamb. Both businesses fit the Company's "farm to table" concept with protein foods being nurtured from birth with proprietary feeds and technology to end sale of packaged products. In the case of aquaculture, the Company uses a proprietary Recirculating Aquaculture System ("RAS") featuring indoor tanks with fresh water recirculating 60 to 120 times per hour, controlled feed and growth environments, and no use of hormones, antibiotics, or other drugs or chemicals. In the case of beef and lamb protein products, live cattle is grazed and grazed on specified grasses grown with our proprietary fertilizers and methods; raised and fattened using proprietary livestock feed; deboned and packaged at the Company's abattoir, and sold through Company owned butcher shop concessions at Tesco PLC stores, among other outlets.www.sinoagrofood.comwww.facebook.com/SinoAgroFoodInc --------------------------------------------------Accomplishments: 1. Dreagon Head Enterprise Status:On October 28, 2013 Sino Agro's majority controlled subsidiary SJAP (Qinghai Sanjiang A Power Agriculture Co., Ltd.) nomination to apply the merit credentials in China to become a certified China Dragon head Enterprise was approved by government authorities.This is a major achievement and marks a milestone in SJAP's business operations, plans, and prospects. "Dragon Head" designation both validates and promotes SJAP's transformation from purely a producer of whole live cattle to a producer, processor, and marketer of packaged, value added beef products. Such vertical integration presents a significant competitive advantage in the region. In the first quarter of 2014, a multiplier effect will begin to accrue across all financial measures.  "Dragon Head Enterprise" is a prestigious certification granted by the Government to businesses demonstrating corporate social responsibility ("CSR"), pioneering and leadership in business, and high standards of quality and services. It frequently leads to additional governmental grants and other forms of assistance. The Qinghai Province population has a larger percentage of ethnic minorities than most, and thereby businesses receive proportionately higher grants, incentives, assistances and subsidies from the Government. Stemming from its business model, SJAP has been well supported by the Government due to our CSR. The Company expects to receive even greater support from the Government with the approval of its "Dragon Head Enterprise" status. 2. Contracts with TESCO PLC:The Company is delighted to announce that its China joint venture company Qinghai Sanjiang A Power Agriculture Co., Ltd. ("SJAP") has entered into two contracts with Tesco, PLC to become both a supplier and an in-store butcher shop concessionaire of beef and lamb. The contracts became effective June 19, 2014 and run for five years.www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/...h-tesco-plc-264720691.html 3. Sino Agro Food Closed US $25 Million Convertible Note Funding:The Company is pleased to announce that it has closed a net US $24,975,000 convertible note funding with Euro China Capital AB ("ECAB"), a Nordic investment house, on the 29th of August, 2014. Euro China Capital AB's Managing Partner Fredrik Danielsson commented, "We have conducted extensive due diligence on Sino Agro Food over the past two years and are impressed by the operations that Mr. Lee and his team have managed to develop.uk.reuters.com/article/2014/09/04/...KnPn77ND49+8c+PRN20140904 4. Newly Operating Abattoir Facilities  (Slaughterhouse):SJAP slaughtered 158 head of cattle and de-boned 88 metric tons of meat in June. SJAP is on target to sell 20,000 head of cattle in 2014, raised by local cooperative farmers and grazed on land leased to SJAP to promote modern agriculture in the region.Rapidly increasing proportions of cattle will be processed through SJAP's abattoir and de-boning/packaging facility in the second half of 2014. From there, meats will be distributed to various resellers. Under the SJAP "Bull" brand, up to 60 different cuts of packaged beef will be prepared for resale at SJAP concession butcher shops located within TESCO stores in China. 5. Mega Prawn Farm:Sino Agro Foods has announced that its planned prawn farm complex will culture shrimp and prawns from hatchery to grow-out and packing all on its giant complex. With production expected to start in the second quarter of 2015. With a staggering production estimate of 300,000 metric tons, the company stated it hopes to reach this figure after ten years of production. The company has set a production target of 10,000 metric tons for the first two years, 30,000 metric tons in three years and 100,000 metric tons in five years.The farming system prides itself in being 100 per cent sustainable, as the shrimp/prawns are born, bred and grown in a closed indoor Re-circulating Aquaculture System (RAS). Sino Agro Foods' A Power Re-circulating Aquaculture System and Technology (APRAS) uses indoor tanks that re-circulate fresh water at a rate of 60 times an hour. As a closed system, it has low mortality rates of less than eight per cent and is less susceptible to the introduction of disease, meaning little or no risk of Early Mortality Syndrome. Most importantly, RAS is a green farming system since it does not require chemicals or antibiotics to recycle the water. Around 99.75 per cent of water within the tank can be recycled while the excrements of aquatic products can be used as organic fertilizer. It is these qualities which will also allowed the farm to use hydroponics to grow fruit and vegetables alongside the shrimp/prawns. This staggering project will also benefit the local community through the creation of 145,000 peripheral and direct jobs, a guaranteed sufficient food supply and an increase in local incomes - as direct employee jobs should have an average salary 25 per cent higher than average urban resident of Zhongshan and 100 per cent higher than the average rural resident.m.thefishsite.com/news/22837www.undercurrentnews.com/2014/03/26/...-a-whole-lot-of-prawns/sinoagrofood.investorroom.com/download/...ject_Information.pdf  -------------------------------------------------- Financial Reports:www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/...ro+food&owner=exclude&action=getcompany--------------------------------------------------NASDAQ:Sino Agro Food, Inc. is pleased to announce that on October 2, 2013 it applied to have its equity shares listed on NASDAQ's Capital Market® exchange.sinoagrofood.investorroom.com/...nc-Applies-for-NASDAQ-ListingFirst North:GUANGZHOU, China,  Feb. 19, 2013  /PRNewswire/ -- Sino Agro Food, Inc.

With this foundation and Mr. Lee's commitment to work with Euro China Capital now in place, we are confident that we have established a platform from which Sino Agro Food has the ability to transform its operational success into value for all its shareholders.--------------------------------------------------keine kaufempfehlung!disclosure: long       Melden           33 Beiträge ausgeblendet.

		Sino Agro's (SIAF) 2015 Results - Earnings Call Transcript"We have an offer from our construction subcontractor, one of the largest in China on new terms to build the second phase of the Zhongshan MegaFarm Project to construct it at a much faster pace and much cheaper construction cost in Prawn Farm 3 which will add 60,000 metric tons of production capacity per year.We are now calling the first phase of the MegaFarm Prawn Farm 3 and the second phase Prawn Farm 4. Prawn Farm 4 we will build in six modules, each module with approximate capacity of Prawn Farm 3 which itself has the capacity of approximately 10 Fish Farm 1s.""The aquaculture sector, during 2015 we harvested 6,762 metric tons of seafood, 21% growth over 2014. Since starting major operations in 2012, aquaculture production has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 56%"" Key operations at SJAP increased gross profits from value-added processing in 2015 more than offset decreases from sales of live cattle due to deteriorating prices.....we are expanding the deboning capacity to 12,500 MT/year and freezing capacity to 10,000 MT/year. In accordance with this plan value-added capacity production in SJAP will double.""Stockholders' equity totaled $483.5 million based on 2015 weighted average number of fully diluted outstanding shares. The 21% yearly increase of $83.9 million equals to $4.50 per share.""Tri-way will also serve as an excellent platform for raising debt capital. Restructuring the aqua [indiscernible] business segment into a standalone entity we undertake to incorporate a separate audit firm and Board of Director listing exercise et cetera. According to plan we projected Tri-way to generate healthy and growing revenue and profit in 2016 and 2017. By year end 2017 Tri-way is projected to generate sufficient profit to self finance further remaining development needs for capital expenditure and working capital at the Zhongshan MegaFarm project and other facilities.""Steps are also being taken to create suitable, attractive candidates for other of our subsidiary in preparation for separate listings.Having held numerous meetings with domestic Chinese other Asian and Nordic financial advisors in relation to separate listing of our assets we are pleased that two of our carve out candidate currently being worked on might well each achieved separate variation far greater than SIAF Group's variation.""The company currently has two options on the table, one consisting the merging of the HU Plantation with the health and the herbal company with change of health food change food shops. This option promotes positioning the [indiscernible] of the producer and retailer with selenium rich and calcium rich health products using the HU flowers and immortal plans at its core produce.....Work has progressed for the better part of two months on procedures preparing SJAP for listing on the NEEQ which is the National Equities Exchange & Quotation market in China i.e. the third board where it seems well-qualified for an invitation. We are encouraged by efforts to date and if all requisites are timely met, the separate listing of SJAP is projected within Q4 of this year."seekingalpha.com/article/...5-results-earnings-call-transcript          Melden                    gongo:

		  #36       SIAF Outlines Work Schedule for Aquaculture Carve-out"For aquaculture assets, we have begun the process of transferring contracts from Capital Award into our Hong Kong based Tri-way Industries Subsidiary, such that Tri-way will acquire the rights to attain ownership in Prawn Farms 1 and 2, and Prawn Farms 3 and 4 of the Zhongshan MegaFarm. Tri-way will receive the current commission fee income on said farms until acquisitions are made. This creates a separate legal entity suitable for listing on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility, one with clear visibility into the financial performance of the Aquaculture operations. Tri-way will also serve as an excellent platform for raising debt capital.The images below contain lists that itemize most necessary tasks, many of which are underway. The Company will publish progress on these steps as it occurs. The list also serves as a general template for the carve-outs of other assets:sinoagrofood.investorroom.com/aqua-plan--------------------------------------------------Additional Details on Prawn Farm 4 Contractor Offersinoagrofood.investorroom.com/news-releases?item=182--------------------------------------------------Artikel in Intrafish:translate.google.com/...Fnorsk%2Fnyheter%2Farticle1439151.ece          Melden                    gongo:

		der aktienkurs von siaf ist in den letzten monaten stark eingebrochen. der einbruch hat sich in jüngster zeit noch verstärkt. was sind die gründe des einbruchs?zur letzten cc wurde deutlich, dass investoren mit der performance von siaf stark unzufrieden sind. obwohl siaf in letzter zeit einige meilensteine ( Sino Agro Food Begins Stocking Zhongshan Aquaculture MegaFarm / Sino Agro Food Commences Trading on OTCQX / Sino Agro Food Approved for Trading on the Oslo Bors' Merkur Market, Stockholders' equity totaled $483.5 million etc.) erreicht hat. gleichzeitig war das eps in 2015 stark rückläufig (gründe hierfür sind sinkende preise auf produkte, schlechtes wetter, nachwirkungen der extremen verwässerung in der vergangenheit, etc). genauer, seit 2013 ist kein eps-wachstum mehr vorhanden. laut swedbank wird sich diese entwicklung erneut in 2016 fortsetzen. der wachstumsmotor scheint zum stillstand gekommen zu sein. grosse hoffnungen auf wachstum liegen in der mega-farm und ein listing des aqua-geschäftes an der börse in oslo. allerdings benötigt siaf geld, viel geld, um sich in die diversen aqua-farmen einzukaufen. woher dieses geld kommen soll, ist derzeit noch unklar. damit ist auch offen, ob und wann siaf diesen meilenstein (oslo listing) erreichen wird. kurz bis mittelfristig ist auch hier wohl kein zündstoff für den kurs zu erwarten.bleibt noch die hoffnung auf ein separates listing der tochtergesellschaften ( 1. merging of the HU Plantation with the health and the herbal company / 2. preparing SJAP for listing on the NEEQ) - womöglich noch in diesem jahr?ernüchterung hingegen ist eingetreten hinsichtlich euro china capital AB und fredrik danielsson ( einstieg sept.2014).  er hat es bisher nicht geschafft, den wert von siaf freizusetzen. zuletzt ( august 2015 ) sollte er ein mitglied im BOD werden. seitdem ist nichts passiert und es ist eher ruhig um ihn geworden. die bisherige errungenschaft von ECAB war das ende der grenzenlosen verwässerung. den wert der aktie nachhaltig zu steigern blieben jedoch bisher erfolglos. der aktienkurs befindet sich wieder auf niveau des einstieges von ecab in sino agro food. hat das vertrauen in fredrik danielsson damit einen derzeitigen tiefpunkt erreicht? das übergeordnete bild von siaf ist derzeit eher schlecht, nicht zuletzt deshalb finden sich wohl keine neuen investoren, trotz auch guter entwicklungen in jüngster vergangenheit. kann siaf das blatt erfolgreich wenden? noch sind nicht alle hoffnungen verloren, allerdings wird man hier wohl noch eine menge geduld mitbringen müssen...

It operates at the world's largest market. It produces the protein sources in a environmentally friendly way.It does have its drawbacks which relate mostly to corporate structure and location:conglomeratecomplex company structureUS OTC listedChinese corporate governance which causes fears of fraudulent activitiesLike I said earlier, I don't believe SIAF is a fraud. This is mainly because not all of SIAF's management team are Chinese.Now that it has gotten to the trial stocking of the MegaFarm, I see value in the upcoming spin-offs. This is the point I am going to follow with SIAF. The most important thing to keep an eye on is: What do the insiders do? Based on that, it can be figured whether the spin-off is done in a way it can create value to shareholders. Another important point is how the shares will be distributed. What I mean is Solomon Lee's A class share affect the distribution in the spin-off's case. If he gets to keep his vote over other shareholders, it probably would expel the institutional investors.Because of Solomon Lee's erratic behavior with different projects, and the money problems it leads to, SIAF has really had problems to stay on schedule with different projects. Also, 2016 has started weakly for the company and Q2 is likely to be weak another quarter. Therefore, I don't have any rush to buy the shares even though, to me, it seems that SIAF would be a profitable investment.SIAF has promised more info about the spin-offs in the coming weeks, so I will want to hear at least that until I invest money.seekingalpha.com/article/...ing-new-investments-sino-agro-food          Melden                      gongo:

The additional time needed to complete this exercise serves both the lending institution’s as well as the Company’s better interests since a combination of debt financing and pre-IPO funding is anticipated to secure the majority of funding necessary to complete the acquisition, providing adequate security for both parties while accelerating development and improved revenue streams through both project development services and subsequent product sales. The Company anticipates closing on the loan some time within later Q3 or early Q4 2016.Beef and Cattle (SJAP): The Company has been working closely with well regarded Securities Firms, a CPA firm and a China Law firm, to carve out and list SJAP through the National Equities and Exchange and Quotations Board (“NEEQ”), which operates the National Third Board exchange in China.

Overall, it was a very positive quarter, exhibited through improved gross margins, a stronger cash balance and significant operational progress in both the aquaculture and the cattle/beef businesses. "“To recap our high-level strategy, we are undertaking a series of initiatives to transition Sino Agro Food into an investment vehicle with positions in multiple independent, public companies operating within China’s agricultural industry. To this end, Sino Agro Food’s two largest and fast growing subsidiaries – the aquaculture and beef businesses – will be carved out from the parent company and listed on stock exchanges where we believe their shares will be able to trade at a market value commensurate with peers and substantially higher than their embedded values. As part of this carve out and IPO process, we are raising growth capital for these subsidiaries to accelerate their development, with Sino Agro Food expected to retain significant stakes in each of the companies after the spin offs have occurred."“One key focus right now is our aquaculture business, which we believe has the potential to develop into an extremely profitable and sustainable business model of much larger size. Through its proprietary indoor recirculating aquaculture systems (“RAS”) technology, the aquaculture business produces disease-free, superior quality and higher-margin seafood to the China markets all year-round. With aquaculture the fastest growing food production system in the world, and currently accounting for nearly 45% of world seafood supply, we are confident that our superior production methods position the aquaculture subsidiary as a competitive and significant player in a rapidly growing market."“By transferring all the assets from our wholly-owned subsidiary, Capital Awards, into a standalone entity, we expect to attract institutional investors who specialize in investing in high-growth business opportunities, spurring higher valuations for the “new” entities, as well as SIAF. We strongly believe this strategy is the most efficient way to enable the aquaculture business to grow rapidly, benefiting all shareholders."“During the third quarter, we took necessary steps to commence work at the aqua-farms. This has curtailed production in the short term, but is expected to expand capacity, and therefore revenues, as early as Q4 2016. The Company was able to secure $8.2 million in working capital to facilitate these efforts while continuing to work closely with a major Asian bank toward securing a larger loan to accelerate the growth of the company. The larger loan is taking longer to complete since the prospective lender is agreeing to help underwrite the IPO as well. Thus, while the overall review and approval process for the “entire package” consumes more time, it also provides the Company’s shareholders a much greater return on investment than would other available alternatives, at this time. In the interim we will continue to develop the aquaculture farms organically via internally generated cash flow. With our plan to develop the world’s largest RAS farm, we are confident the aquaculture business can grow into a highly profitable company, driven by demand from the burgeoning middle classes in China.""“SJAP, our cattle and beef subsidiary, is also undergoing several strategic changes to maximize its value. Specifically, we are restructuring the business with the goal of listing it on a stock exchange in early 2017. As with the aquaculture business, the carve-out will make it easier to more accurately value the company and is expected to attract more investors at a higher valuation."“SJAP is transitioning toward production of higher quality beef which, as well as generating improved margins for the company, allows us to tap into an underserved niche. Currently, there is limited supply of premium quality beef in China and products on the market are typically imported from abroad. However, as Chinese consumers become wealthier and more discerning about food quality, the consumption of premium beef is expected to grow significantly. Sino Agro Food is one of the foremost players in this market and our leadership position in the industry provides an advantage going forward. During the quarter, we continued to transition toward premium cattle breeds. Coupled with higher prices for domestic beef, the transition led to a marked improvement in gross margins.""In the short term our cash flow is constrained by ongoing investments in these business segments; yet, results from our strategy have already begun to materialize. As obscure as it may seem, the Company is reaching an inflection point in its growth trajectory and reiterates its appreciation to shareholders who remain confident in the Company’s mission going forward.”Earnings Call InformationThe Company will host an earnings call on Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 10:00 AM EDT/4:00 PM CET to discuss quarterly financial results.www.businesswire.com/news/home/...Food-Reports-Q3-2016-Results          Melden                    gongo:

Our primary objectives for 2017 are to see increasing returns from our aquaculture investment at larger scale; likewise, for other business segments as the right opportunities surface; to capitalize on new capacity developed in 2015 and 2016; and to move toward actualizing properly appreciated IPO valuations.“To recap our vision for Sino Agro Food, we are executing on our strategy to become a ‘solutions destination’ investment company, with associate investments that supply premium protein foods to the relatively new and underserved middle class in China. In 2016, we laid much of the groundwork for growth of our aquaculture and Integrated Cattle Farm (SJAP) businesses, in support of our plans to spin off these entities into publicly traded companies . In 2017 we shall continue to evaluate and work diligently on other divisional businesses of the group by exploring opportunities aiming to create more benefits for our shareholders. We believe that completing these carve-outs for eventual spinoff and subsequent listing will allow them to trade at market values commensurate with their peers. To support these businesses, SIAF has rapidly grown its revenues from $22M in 2009 to $342.9M in 2016 by investing in production facilities and processes to maximize economies of scale, commencing production, and ramping production at our facilities. We have achieved a lot to date and, with stockholders’ equity of USD 604.8M, or USD 26.08 per share as of 12/31/2016, we believe the company is now in a strong position to achieve sustainable and rapid growth.“In 2016 we took several steps to modernize our aquaculture facilities into integrated high-yielding stations in support of the carve-out/spin-off (“COSO”) strategy to create a concentrated stand-alone entity of sufficient scale and potential to attract IPO interest at valuations rewarding to the Company’s shareholders. “These activities were followed by the completion of the carve-out of the aquaculture operations contributing to strong overall financial results in 2016 and setting the stage for further growth and value recognition in 2017. We recorded a deemed gain on sale of $56.9M, and hold a certified fair value of $124.7M in the new entity at the time of the carve-out. The new organization for the aquaculture business will support accelerated growth, as it is better suited for infusions of working and development capital at, what we expect to be, more favorable valuations. We have long believed that our assets are undervalued, and that our organizational structure limited our opportunities to convert existing and planned development to business advantage. Completing the carve-out was a significant milestone toward unleashing this value. We expect significant accretion to SIAF earnings per share via our equity interest in the carved-out company as compared to 2016.“By taking on a new role in our involvement with the aquaculture operations, we are able to concentrate resources on our other businesses, and we expect certain positive trends in our other businesses to continue in 2017. It is important to point out that Capital Award remains a wholly owned subsidiary, focused on consulting, engineering, and construction of A-Power Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (”APRAS”). Capital Award is the turnkey solutions provider for the new operators of Aquafarms 1-5. Part of the carve-out agreement calls for CA to license its APRAS technology for ongoing and future development (currently $100,000 per A-Power Module (“APM”)). Therefore, post separation of assets, SIAF will record recurring income in three ways:    The sale of goods, reported as a separate item derived from our  investment    Continuing project development    Turnkey engineering and technology fees, coupled with licensing fees for the APRAS technology “Project development showed healthy gains in 2016, largely as a result of the portion of the aquaculture gain on sale attributable to master licenses for Capital Award technology. In a sense, this category will become recurring revenue/income in 2017 and beyond as more APM and open dam recirculating aquaculture systems (“ODRAS”) are built and developed in China over the years by Tri-way, generating license fees for CA for A-Power Modules. As a frame of reference, AF4 uses 144 APMs and plans for AF5 call for 864. Because of the new organization, and depending on the timing of investment, the pace of project development is expected to quicken during 2017.“At SJAP, the transition of our herd of cattle to premium brands is expected to add to the sale of live cattle in 2017, while the business also grows its other product lines to meet growing demand for livestock feed and fertilizer.“Revenue from the Import/Export business segment grew from $6.4M in the first quarter of 2016 to $23.1M in the fourth quarter. We expect the segment to benefit in 2017 from a full year of production approaching capacity.“As a key part of the carve out and IPO processes, we are raising growth capital for proposed carve-out candidates to accelerate their development, with Sino Agro Food expected to retain a significant stake in each of the companies after the spinoffs have occurred. We look forward to providing updates on progress throughout 2017. We are excited to move forward with our plans toward redefining Sino Agro Food as a ‘solutions destination’ investment company in China, supporting a wide range of agriculture endeavors through the delivery of value-added technology. We are pleased with the progress made in 2016, which has positioned us to execute on the next milestones in our COSO strategies during 2017.”Earnings Call InformationDate: April 7, 2017Time: 10:00 AM, EDT/4:00 PM CET          Melden                    gongo:

		  #53       Sustaining the aquaculture revolutionSome companies see sustainability concerns as a business opportunity. One way farms can avoid impacting the environment is to move indoors. In the Pearl River Delta region of Southeast China, Sino Agro Food is building what will be dozens of 8,000-m2 facilities to grow freshwater giant prawns.Constructing the buildings and equipping them with recirculating water filtration systems requires a lot of up-front capital, says Anthony C. Ostrowski, chief scientific officer of Sino Agro. But the company benefits from higher-density, year-round prawn production.Local consumers pay more for Sino Agro’s live prawns than for chilled or frozen ones, Ostrowski says. “And there is high demand for product that is certified sustainable, raised in a good environment, with no chemicals or antibiotics.” Over the next 20 years, he predicts, indoor farms will grow in importance. They require less land than ponds, and the fish don’t escape into the wild.cen.acs.org/articles/95/i18/...ing-aquaculture-revolution.html          Melden                    gongo:

These videos are presented here, along with photos of adjunct processes and businesses. Please check this page for on-going progress updates on Aquaculture Farms 4 and 5.www.sinoagrofood.com/content/AF4_2017--------------------------------------------------Aquafarm 1:www.sinoagrofood.net/content/JFD--------------------------------------------------Aquafarm 2:www.sinoagrofood.net/content/EBAPCD--------------------------------------------------"As part of this convertible bond, Sino Agro Food has undertaken a commitment to cease the issuance of new shares.....Our ambition is that the equity will never again be used as currency...." (SIAF 2014) - 11/2016: increase in authorized shares (von 22,727,723 auf 27,000,000)- 07/2017: increase in authorized shares (von 27,000,000 auf 50,000,000)- 11/2016: outstanding shares: 22mio- 07/2016: outstanding shares: 25,6mioStatement IR:Raising the authorized share count does not mean raising the outstanding share count. In fact, under the heading "Effects,..." the following is stated:"At present, the board of directors has no plans to issue the additional shares of Common Stock authorized by the Amendment.I am told that the impetus for the change was to comply with regulations with respect to having shares available to cover any ECAB convertible loan contingencies. Rather than raise the share count regularly to account for this -- even though it might not necessitate share issuance in the future either -- the Company decided to do it all at once.The following provision in the filing is also relevant:"The board of directors believes that the increase in our authorized Common Stock will provide us with greater flexibility with respect to our capital structure for purposes including stock based acquisitions."The provision you cited in the ECAB loan, as I recall, referred to the practice of issuing equity to pay debts, mostly supplier debt; it did not handcuff the Company for all other future endeavors, such as using shares for collateral, nor for limited employee compensation, etc.          Melden               Auf neue Beiträge prüfen        Ich:
