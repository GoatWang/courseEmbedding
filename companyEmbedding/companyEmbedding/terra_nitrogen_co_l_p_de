	Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements








	1. Background and Basis of Presentation




	Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. ("TNCLP," "we," "our" or "us") is a Delaware limited partnership that produces nitrogen fertilizer products. Our principal products are anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) and urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN), which we manufacture at our facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma.




	We conduct our operations through an operating partnership, Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP or the Operating Partnership, and collectively with TNCLP, the Partnership). Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP or the General Partner), a Delaware corporation, is the general partner of both TNCLP and TNLP and owns a


	0.025%


	 general partner interest in each of TNCLP and TNLP. The General Partner is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF Industries), a Delaware corporation. Ownership of TNCLP is composed of the general partner interests and the limited partner interests. The general partner interest in TNCLP is represented by


	4,720


	 general partner units. Limited partner interests are represented by common units, which are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TNH," and Class B common units. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, we had


	18,501,576


	 common units and


	184,072


	 Class B common units issued and outstanding. CF Industries through its subsidiaries owned


	13,889,014


	 common units (representing approximately


	75.1%


	 of the total outstanding common units) and all of the Class B common units as of


	March 31, 2017


	.




	We are a master limited partnership (MLP). Partnerships are generally not subject to federal income tax, although publicly traded partnerships (such as TNCLP) are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes (and therefore are subject to federal income tax), unless at least 90% of the partnership's gross income is "qualifying income" as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As we currently satisfy the requirements to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, no federal income taxes are paid by the Partnership.




	On January 19, 2017, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a MLP. For calendar year MLPs, the effective date of the regulations is January 1, 2018. The regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the MLP rules, subject to certain transition provisions. The regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource (including fertilizer) as activities that generate qualifying income, but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizer-related activities. However, the IRS has issued a private letter ruling to a taxpayer in the fertilizer industry unrelated to TNCLP which would indicate that each taxpayer's fertilizer manufacturing activities should produce qualifying income for purposes of determining whether 90% of the partnership's gross income is qualifying income. The entity to which this private letter ruling was issued would appear to operate a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business that is similar to ours. While this private letter ruling provides some insight into the manner in which the IRS analyzed fertilizer manufacturing activities at the time this ruling was issued, this private letter ruling is specific to a different entity. Thus, the IRS is not bound to follow it in respect of TNCLP, nor may we rely on it as precedent when determining whether we satisfy the MLP 90% gross income test. Any change in the federal income tax treatment of income from fertilizer-related activities as qualifying income could have a material impact on the taxation of the Partnership and could have a material adverse impact on unitholder distributions. We continue to monitor these IRS regulatory activities.




	The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial reporting. In the opinion of management, these statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments, that are necessary for the fair representation of the information for the periods presented. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Operating results for any period presented apply to that period only and are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period.




	The preparation of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and certain financial statement disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions in these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include net realizable value of inventories, environmental remediation liabilities, environmental and litigation contingencies, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, the assumptions used in the evaluation of potential impairment of property, plant and equipment and the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.

	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures included in our


	2016


	 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on


	February 23, 2017


	.




	Throughout this document, the term "affiliates of the General Partner" refers to consolidated subsidiaries of CF Industries, including TNGP.








	2. New Accounting Standards




	Recently Adopted Pronouncement




	On January 1, 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. ASU No. 2015-11 changes the inventory measurement principle for entities using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods. For entities utilizing one of these methods, the inventory measurement principle changed from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. We follow the FIFO or average cost methods and the adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.




	Recently Issued Pronouncement




	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments. Additionally, the costs to obtain and fulfill a contract, including assets to be recognized, are to be capitalized and such capitalized costs are to be disclosed. In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of this ASU through the issuance of ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, to December 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date. Accordingly, we will adopt ASU No. 2014-09, as amended, beginning in our first quarter of 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the Amendment to the General and Administrative Services and Product Offtake Agreement (the Services and Offtake Agreement), through which we sell all of our fertilizer products to affiliates of the General Partner, and the related impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are also reviewing our business processes, systems, controls, and disclosures to determine if any changes are needed to support adoption of ASU No. 2014-09.








	3. Agreement of Limited Partnership




	We make quarterly distributions to holders of our general partner interest and limited partner interests based on Available Cash for the quarter as defined in our agreement of limited partnership. Available Cash is defined generally as all cash receipts less all cash disbursements, less certain reserves (including reserves for future operating and capital needs) established as the General Partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary or appropriate. Changes in working capital affect Available Cash as increases in the amount of cash invested in working capital items (such as increases in receivables or inventory and decreases in accounts payable) reduce Available Cash, while declines in the amount of cash invested in working capital items increase Available Cash. During the

	6. Derivative Financial Instruments




	Derivative financial instruments are executed on our behalf by an affiliate of the General Partner to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices for natural gas. Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based fertilizers.




	The derivatives that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. The derivative contract prices are based on NYMEX future prices based on physical delivery of natural gas at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, the most common and financially liquid location of reference for derivative financial instruments related to natural gas. However, we purchase natural gas for our manufacturing facility from suppliers whose prices are based primarily on the ONEOK index (based on physical delivery of natural gas in Oklahoma, rather than at the Henry Hub). This creates a location basis differential between the derivative contract price and the price we pay for physical delivery of natural gas. Accordingly, the prices underlying the derivative financial instruments we use may not exactly match the prices of natural gas we purchase and consume. We enter into natural gas derivative contracts with respect to gas to be consumed by us in the future, and settlements of those derivative contracts are scheduled to coincide with our anticipated purchases of natural gas used to manufacture nitrogen products during those future periods. We use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting.




	We report derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in cost of goods sold in the period of change. Cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities.

	The gross fair values of derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets are shown below. All balance sheet amounts from derivatives arise from natural gas derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. For additional information on derivative fair values, see Note

	As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, we had open natural gas derivative contracts for


	24.2 million


	 MMBtus (millions of British thermal units) and


	29.4 million


	 MMBtus of natural gas, respectively. The derivative portfolio at


	March 31, 2017


	 includes natural gas derivatives that economically hedge a portion of anticipated natural gas purchases through December 2018. For the


	three


	 months ended


	March 31, 2017


	, we used derivatives to cover approximately


	46%


	 of our natural gas consumption.




	The counterparties to our derivative contracts are multinational commercial banks, major financial institutions and large energy companies. The derivatives are executed with several counterparties generally under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements. Most of the ISDA agreements contain credit-risk-related contingent features such as cross-default provisions and credit support thresholds that are dependent upon the credit ratings of the General Partner affiliate. In the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade of the General Partner affiliate, the counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require the General Partner affiliate to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position. The General Partner affiliate’s revolving credit agreement, at any time when it is secured, provides a cross collateral feature for those derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to, or affiliates of parties to, the revolving credit agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives. In the event the General Partner affiliate's revolving credit agreement becomes unsecured, the General Partner affiliate could be required to post separate collateral in connection with such derivatives. As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was


	$2.5 million


	 and


	$1.6 million


	, respectively, which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of assets needed to settle the obligations if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered and the General Partner affiliate was unable to post collateral at the reporting dates. As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, we and the General Partner affiliate had


	no


	 cash collateral on deposit for derivative contracts. The credit support documents executed in connection with certain ISDA agreements generally provide the General Partner affiliate and the counterparties the right to set off collateral against amounts owing under the ISDA agreements upon the occurrence of a default or a specified termination event.

	Cash Equivalents




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market mutual funds that invest in U.S. treasuries and direct investments in U.S. treasuries with original maturities of three months or less.




	Natural Gas Derivatives




	The derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options traded in the OTC markets with multi-national commercial banks, other major financial institutions and large energy companies. The derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods. These contracts settle using NYMEX futures prices and accordingly, to determine the fair value of these instruments, we use quoted market prices from NYMEX and standard pricing models with inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as forward curves supplied by an industry-recognized unrelated third party. See Note 


	6—Derivative Financial Instruments


	 for additional information.




	Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis




	We also have assets that may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. These include long-lived assets that may be written down to fair value as a result of impairment. We determined that these fair value measurements rely primarily on Partnership-specific inputs and the Partnership's assumptions about the use of the assets. Since certain of the assumptions would involve inputs that are not observable, these fair values would reside within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

	Scheduled replacements and overhauls of machinery and equipment include the dismantling, repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping, valves, motors, turbines, pumps, compressors, heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs. Scheduled inspections are also conducted during full plant shutdowns, including required safety inspections which entail the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers, pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications. Internal employee costs and overhead are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized.








	9. Related Party Transactions




	TNCLP and TNGP have no employees. We have entered into several agreements with a subsidiary of CF Industries relating to the operation of our business and the sale of the fertilizer products produced at our Verdigris facility. We believe that each of these agreements is on terms that are fair and reasonable to us.




	Services and Offtake Agreement




	Pursuant to the Services and Offtake Agreement, the Partnership sells all of its fertilizer products to affiliates of the General Partner at prices based on market prices for the Partnership's fertilizer products as defined in the Services and Offtake Agreement. Title and risk of loss transfer to affiliates of the General Partner as the product is shipped from the plant gate. The Services and Offtake Agreement was effective initially for a one-year term and is extended automatically for successive


	one


	-year terms unless terminated by one of the parties prior to renewal.




	Directly Incurred Charges




	Since we have no employees, we rely on employees from an affiliate of the General Partner to operate our Verdigris facility. As a result, the payroll and payroll-related expenses and benefit costs, such as health insurance and pension costs, are incurred by an affiliate of the General Partner and directly charged to us. Payroll, payroll-related expenses and other employee-related benefit costs directly charged to us for the


	three


	 months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	 were


	$7.0 million


	 and


	$7.2 million


	, respectively. We report these expenses as services provided by affiliates of the General Partner in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations.




	Allocated Charges




	CF Industries, together with its affiliates, also provides certain services to us under the Services and Offtake Agreement. These services include production planning, manufacturing management, logistics, procurement, accounting, legal, risk management, investor relations and other general and administrative functions. Allocated expenses charged to us in each of the


	three


	 months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	 were


	$3.9 million


	. We report these expenses as selling, general and administrative services provided by affiliates of the General Partner in our consolidated statements of operations.




	Amounts Due to/from Affiliates of the General Partner




	We receive cash and make expenditures directly from our cash accounts. Because we sell our products to and receive payroll and other services from affiliates of the General Partner, the affiliates of the General Partner continue to be both debtors and creditors to us. As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, we had a net balance due from (to) affiliates of the General Partner of


	$18.3 million


	 and


	$(0.1) million


	, respectively.




	Spare Parts Sharing Agreement




	Affiliates of CF Industries own and operate nitrogen fertilizer complexes that utilize some equipment that is similar to equipment at our Verdigris nitrogen complex. Each of the various manufacturing complexes maintains spare parts for use in its facilities. In the event that an unplanned need arises and to help minimize manufacturing downtime, we have entered into a spare parts sharing agreement with affiliates of CF Industries that permits spare parts to be shared among the manufacturing complexes from time to time. Parts that are borrowed from another complex under the agreement are either refurbished and returned to the lender or replaced.




	Leases




	We entered into an amended and restated lease with an affiliate of the General Partner under which the ammonia assets in our terminal in Blair, Nebraska are leased by the affiliate. The lease is effective for a


	five


	-year term ending on December 31, 2018, and the affiliate of the General Partner has options to renew for


	three


	 additional


	five


	-year terms. The quarterly lease payment is


	$100,000


	, subject to an annual inflation adjustment, and additional rent will be paid equal to all costs, expenses, and obligations incurred by the affiliate of the General Partner related to the use, occupancy and operation of the terminal.








	12








	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	We also have leased certain of our rail cars to an affiliate of the General Partner for quarterly rental payments of


	$3,600


	 per car. This lease was effective initially for a


	one


	-year term and is extended automatically for successive


	one


	-year terms unless terminated by either party thereto prior to renewal.




	In each of the


	three


	 months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	, we recognized rental income of


	$0.1 million


	. We report this income as other income from an affiliate of the General Partner in our consolidated statements of operations.

	ITEM 2.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.




	You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.'s ("TNCLP," "we," "our" or "us") annual consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in our


	2016


	 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on


	February 23, 2017


	 (


	2016


	 Annual Report), as well as our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes thereto contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. The section entitled "Risk Factors" contained in Item 1A of our


	2016


	 Annual Report, and similar discussions in our other SEC filings, describe some of the important risk factors that may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity. You should read and consider carefully those risks, in addition to the other information in this report and in our other filings with the SEC.




	Company Overview




	TNCLP is a Delaware limited partnership that produces nitrogen fertilizer products. Our principal products are anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) and urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN), which we manufacture at our facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma.




	We conduct our operations through an operating partnership, Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP or the Operating Partnership, and collectively with TNCLP, the Partnership). Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP or the General Partner), a Delaware corporation, is the general partner of both TNCLP and TNLP and owns a 0.025% general partner interest in each of TNCLP and TNLP. The General Partner is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF Industries), a Delaware corporation. Throughout this document, the term "affiliates of the General Partner" refers to consolidated subsidiaries of CF Industries, including TNGP.




	CF Industries, through its subsidiaries, is a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of nitrogen products, serving both agricultural and industrial customers. CF Industries operates world-class nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and distributes plant nutrients through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States.




	We are dependent on CF Industries for our success in a number of respects. TNCLP and TNGP have no employees. Affiliates of the General Partner provide certain services to us under the Amendment to the General and Administrative Services and Product Offtake Agreement (the Services and Offtake Agreement). Pursuant to the Services and Offtake Agreement, the Partnership sells all of its fertilizer products to affiliates of the General Partner at prices based on market prices for the Partnership's fertilizer products as defined in the Services and Offtake Agreement. Title and risk of loss transfer to affiliates of the General Partner as the product is shipped from the plant gate. Under the Services and Offtake Agreement, affiliates of the General Partner provide certain services to us, including production planning, manufacturing management, logistics, procurement, accounting, legal, risk management, investor relations and other general and administrative services. For additional information concerning CF Industries, refer to CF Industries' filings with the SEC on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, and for further information regarding our agreements with CF Industries and the General Partner, see Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, Note

	Nitrogen Fertilizer Market Conditions




	Our products are global commodities and are subject to price competition. The customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. The selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions and changes in supply and demand.




	Over the past decade, strong demand, high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen production facilities, which resulted in an increase in global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity. As a result, global nitrogen fertilizer supply increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand, creating the current global oversupply in the market, and leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices.




	A significant amount of new nitrogen production capacity came on line in 2016, and additional production capacity is expected to come on line in 2017, including a significant increase in production capacity in North America. This new nitrogen production capacity includes the capacity expansion projects that were completed in 2016 by affiliates of our General Partner. The new nitrogen production capacity will further increase supply. We expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line.

	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	The


	first


	 quarter of


	2017


	 was significantly impacted by lower selling prices. Our average selling prices for ammonia and UAN declined by


	23%


	 and


	24%


	, respectively, during the


	first


	 quarter of


	2017


	 as compared to the


	first


	 quarter of


	2016


	, which reduced both our net sales and gross margin in the


	first


	 quarter of


	2017


	 by


	$36.9 million


	. 




	Results of Operations




	We reported net earnings of


	$42.2 million


	 for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 on net sales of $


	119.0 million


	, compared with net earnings of


	$37.7 million


	 for the three months ended


	March 31, 2016


	 on net sales of


	$108.0 million


	. Net earnings per common unit for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017

	2016


	 net sales of


	$108.0 million


	. The


	increase

	 quarter of


	2017


	 versus the


	first


	 quarter of

	 quarter of


	2017


	 compared to the


	first


	 quarter of


	2016


	 as a result of an unplanned outage in one of our ammonia and UAN plants in the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, favorable spring weather conditions in the southern United States caused earlier demand for our products. The increase in volume was partially offset by lower average selling prices for both UAN and ammonia.

	2017


	 relative to the lower production in the prior-year period as a result of the unplanned outage in the

	 from


	$143


	 per ton in the


	first


	 quarter of


	2016


	. The


	23%




	decrease


	 in the average cost of goods sold per ton was due primarily to higher sales volume in the


	first


	 quarter of


	2017


	 and the non-recurrence of costs incurred as a result of the unplanned outage in the


	first


	 quarter of


	2016


	 as shown in the line titled Other in the table above. These factors were partially offset by a


	$7.9 million


	 unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives for the


	first


	 quarter of


	2017

	$2.3 million


	 unrealized net mark-to-market loss for the

	2016


	. The derivative portfolio at


	March 31, 2017


	 includes natural gas derivatives that hedge a portion of anticipated natural gas purchases through December 2018.

	 from


	39.9%


	 during the


	first


	 quarter of


	2016


	 as a result of the impact of lower average selling prices for both UAN and ammonia and higher unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives in the


	first


	 quarter of 2017 compared to the


	first


	 quarter of


	2016

	$42.2 million


	 in the

	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	Our principal funding needs and uses of cash are working capital, plant turnaround costs, capital expenditures, and quarterly distributions. Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of


	March 31, 2017


	 was


	$41.2 million


	,


	an increase


	 of


	$1.7 million


	 from


	$39.5 million


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	. See further discussion below under "Cash Flows." Our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of money market mutual funds that invest in U.S. treasuries and direct investments in U.S. treasuries with original maturities of three months or less.




	Cash Flows




	The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the

	Operating Activities




	Net cash provided by operating activities was


	$41.6 million


	 in the first


	three


	 months of


	2017


	 compared to


	$45.8 million


	 in the same period of


	2016


	, or a


	decline


	 of


	$4.2 million


	. This decrease was due primarily to a higher amount of cash invested in working capital in the


	first


	 quarter of


	2017


	 versus the


	first


	 quarter of


	2016


	, partially offset by higher earnings. The largest portion of the increase in working capital in the


	first


	 quarter of


	2017


	 as compared to the


	first


	 quarter of


	2016


	 was due to an increase in the receivables due from our General Partner as a result of higher selling prices for ammonia and UAN in the


	first


	 quarter of


	2017


	 versus the fourth quarter of


	2016


	 and higher production of ammonia and UAN in the


	first


	 quarter of


	2017


	 due to the unplanned outage in one of our ammonia and UAN plants in the


	first


	 quarter of


	2016


	. Net earnings included depreciation and amortization expense of


	$10.7 million


	 and


	$10.0 million


	 during the


	three


	 months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	, respectively, and unrealized net mark-to-market loss of


	$7.9 million


	 and


	$2.3 million


	 during the


	three


	 months ended


	March 31, 2017


	, and


	2016


	, respectively, on natural gas derivatives.




	Investing Activities




	Net cash used in investing activities was


	$11.3 million


	 in the first


	three


	 months of


	2017


	 compared to


	$13.8 million


	 in the first


	three


	 months of


	2016


	. The


	$2.5 million


	 decrease in cash used in investing activities in the first


	three


	 months of


	2017


	 was due to higher capital expenditures in the first


	three


	 months of


	2016


	 due to the unplanned outage in one of our ammonia plants in the


	first


	 quarter of


	2016


	.




	Financing Activities




	Net cash used in financing activities was


	$28.6 million


	 in the first


	three


	 months of


	2017


	 compared to


	$90.2 million


	 in the first


	three


	 months of


	2016


	, and consists of distributions paid to our unitholders. The distributions paid are based on Available Cash, as defined in our agreement of limited partnership. See further discussion below under "Partnership Distributions."




	Capital Expenditures




	Capital expenditures totaled


	$11.3 million


	 during the


	three


	 months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 compared to


	$13.8 million


	 during the


	three


	 months ended


	March 31, 2016


	 with the decrease primarily resulting from the unplanned ammonia plant outage in the


	first


	 quarter of


	2016


	. Capital expenditures are made to sustain our asset base, to increase capacity, to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental, health and safety requirements. Due to the size, scope and timing of capital projects, certain projects require more than a year to complete.




	In


	2017


	, we currently expect to make capital expenditures in the range of


	$25 million


	 to


	$35 million


	. Planned maintenance, capital expenditures, and turnarounds are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals and/or permitting, unanticipated increases in cost, changes in scope and completion time, performance of third parties, delay in the receipt of equipment, adverse weather, defects in materials and workmanship, labor or material shortages, transportation constraints, and other unforeseen difficulties. We anticipate a planned turnaround of one-half of our Verdigris nitrogen complex








	17








	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	will occur in 2018. We had previously estimated that this turnaround would occur in late 2017, but the turnaround has been delayed due to a delay in receiving certain equipment. The turnaround will result in lower ammonia and UAN production, lower sales and lower profitability during the period of the turnaround, which will reduce Available Cash for distributions to unitholders. We expect this turnaround will cost approximately


	$40 million


	, and the calculation of Available Cash for the


	three


	 months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 included a reserve of approximately one-half of this amount.




	General Partner




	The General Partner is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CF Industries. Under the General Partner's governing documents, neither we nor the General Partner may make any bankruptcy filing (or take similar action) without the approval of the General Partner's independent directors, except in specified circumstances if there are not two independent directors on the General Partner's board of directors.




	Partnership Distributions




	We make quarterly distributions to holders of our general partner interest and limited partner interests based on Available Cash for the quarter as defined in our agreement of limited partnership. Available Cash is defined generally as all cash receipts less all cash disbursements, less certain reserves (including reserves for future operating and capital needs) established as the General Partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary or appropriate. Changes in working capital affect Available Cash, as increases in the amount of cash invested in working capital items (such as increases in receivables or inventory and decreases in accounts payable) reduce Available Cash, while declines in the amount of cash invested in working capital items increase Available Cash. During the


	three


	 months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	, we declared and paid partnership distributions of


	$28.6 million


	 and


	$90.2 million


	, respectively.




	We receive 99% of the Operating Partnership's Available Cash (as defined in the Operating Partnership's agreement of limited partnership) and 1% of the Operating Partnership's Available Cash is distributed by the Operating Partnership to the General Partner and its affiliates. Pursuant to our agreement of limited partnership, distributions of our Available Cash are made 99.975% to common and Class B common unitholders and 0.025% to the General Partner except that the General Partner is entitled, as an incentive, to a larger percentage of our distribution of Available Cash to the extent that cumulative distributions of Available Cash exceed specified target levels above the Minimum Quarterly Distributions (MQD) of $0.605 per unit. The General Partner has assigned its right to receive such incentive distributions to an affiliate of the General Partner.




	On


	May 3, 2017


	, we announced a


	$0.97


	 cash distribution per common unit, payable on


	May 31, 2017


	 to holders of record as of


	May 15, 2017


	. In the


	first


	 quarter of


	2017


	, we exceeded the cumulative MQD amounts and will distribute Available Cash as summarized in the following table:

	General Partner Option to Effect Mandatory Redemption of Partnership Units




	At


	March 31, 2017


	, the General Partner and its affiliates owned approximately 75.1% of our outstanding common units. When not more than 25% of the issued and outstanding common units are held by persons other than the General Partner and its affiliates (collectively, non-affiliated persons), as was the case at


	March 31, 2017


	, we, at the General Partner's sole discretion, may call, or assign to the General Partner or its affiliates, our right to acquire all, but not less than all, such outstanding common units held by non-affiliated persons. If the General Partner elects to acquire all outstanding common units, we are required to give at least 30 but not more than 60 days' notice of our decision to purchase the outstanding common units, and the purchase price per unit would be the greater of (1) the average of the previous 20 trading days' closing prices as of the








	18








	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	date five days before the purchase is announced or (2) the highest price paid by the General Partner or any of its affiliates for any unit within the 90 days preceding the date the purchase is announced.




	Cash Transactions with Affiliates




	We receive cash and make expenditures directly from our cash accounts. Because we sell our products to and receive payroll and other services from affiliates of the General Partner, the affiliates of the General Partner continue to be both debtors and creditors to us.




	Derivatives




	We purchase natural gas at market prices to meet production requirements at our manufacturing facility. Natural gas prices are volatile, and our natural gas acquisition policy allows us to establish derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements. The derivatives that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter markets.




	Natural gas derivatives involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts. The counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are multi-national commercial banks, major financial institutions and large energy companies. For derivatives that are in net asset positions, we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties. Credit risk is controlled through the use of multiple counterparties, credit limits, credit monitoring procedures, cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements.




	Contractual Obligations, Critical Accounting Policies and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, there were no material changes to our contractual obligations, critical accounting policies or off-balance sheet arrangements relative to those disclosed in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our


	2016


	 Annual Report.




	Internal Revenue Service Regulation Impacting Master Limited Partnerships




	We are a master limited partnership (MLP). Partnerships are generally not subject to federal income tax, although publicly traded partnerships (such as TNCLP) are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes and therefore are subject to federal income tax, unless at least 90% of the partnership's gross income is "qualifying income" as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As we currently satisfy the requirements to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, no federal income taxes are paid by the Partnership.




	On January 19, 2017, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a MLP. For calendar year MLPs, the effective date of the regulations is January 1, 2018. The regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the MLP rules, subject to certain transition provisions. The regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource (including fertilizer) as activities that generate qualifying income, but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizer-related activities. However, the IRS has issued a private letter ruling to a taxpayer in the fertilizer industry unrelated to TNCLP which would indicate that each taxpayer's fertilizer manufacturing activities should produce qualifying income for purposes of determining whether 90% of the partnership's gross income is qualifying income. The entity to which this private letter ruling was issued would appear to operate a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business that is similar to ours.  While this private letter ruling provides some insight into the manner in which the IRS analyzed fertilizer manufacturing activities at the time this ruling was issued, this private letter ruling is specific to a different entity. Thus, the IRS is not bound to follow it in respect of TNCLP, nor may we rely on it as precedent when determining whether we satisfy the MLP 90% gross income test. Any change in the federal income tax treatment of income from fertilizer-related activities as qualifying income could have a material impact on the taxation of the Partnership and could have a material adverse impact on unitholder distributions. We continue to monitor these IRS regulatory activities.

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS




	From time to time, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as in other written reports and oral statements, we make forward-looking statements that are not statements of historical fact and may involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements may also relate to our prospects, future developments and business strategies. We have used the words "anticipate," "believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "predict," "project," "will" or "would" and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions, to identify forward-looking statements in this document. These forward-looking statements are made based on currently available competitive, financial and economic data, our current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industries and markets in which we operate and management's beliefs and assumptions concerning future events affecting us. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Therefore, our actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements.

	•






	conditions in the U.S. agricultural industry;
















	•






	the volatility of natural gas prices in North America;
















	•






	difficulties in securing the supply and delivery of raw materials, increases in their costs or delays or interruptions in their delivery;

	ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.




	We are exposed to the impact of changes in the price of natural gas which we use in the manufacture of our nitrogen fertilizer products. Because natural gas prices are volatile, we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments.




	The derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options. These contracts settle using NYMEX futures prices, which represent the basis for fair value at any given time. The derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods.




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, we had open natural gas derivative contracts for


	24.2 million


	 MMBtus and


	29.4 million


	 MMBtus, respectively. A $1.00 per MMBtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas as of


	March 31, 2017


	, would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions by


	$22.1 million


	, and a $1.00 per MMBtu decrease would change their fair value unfavorably by


	$22.1 million


	.











	ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.




	(a)


	    Disclosure Controls and Procedures.


	    TNGP's management, with the participation of TNGP's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, TNGP's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in (i) ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to TNGP's management, including TNGP's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	(b)


	    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.


	    There have not been any changes in the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended


	March 31, 2017


	 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.

	"Notes" referenced throughout this document refer to financial statement note disclosures that are found in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.




	Overview




	Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. ("TNCLP," "we," "our" or "us") is a Delaware limited partnership that produces nitrogen fertilizer products. Our principal products are anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) and urea ammonium nitrate solutions (UAN), which we manufacture at our facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma.




	We conduct our operations through an operating partnership, Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP or the Operating Partnership, and collectively with TNCLP, the Partnership). Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP or the General Partner), a Delaware corporation, is the general partner of both TNCLP and TNLP and owns a 0.025% general partner interest in each of TNCLP and TNLP. The General Partner is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF Industries), a Delaware corporation. Ownership of TNCLP is composed of the general partner interests and the limited partner interests. Limited partner interests are represented by common units, which are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TNH" and Class B common units. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had


	18,501,576


	 common units and


	184,072


	 Class B common units issued and outstanding. CF Industries through its subsidiaries owned


	13,889,014


	 common units (representing approximately 75.1% of the total outstanding common units) and all of the Class B common units as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	CF Industries, through its subsidiaries, is a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of nitrogen products, serving both agricultural and industrial customers. CF Industries operates world-class nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and distributes plant nutrients through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States.




	For the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, we sold


	2.2 million


	 tons of nitrogen fertilizers, recognized net sales of


	$418.3 million


	 and generated net earnings of


	$209.3 million


	. Additional financial information about our business is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.




	TNCLP and TNGP have no employees. Affiliates of the General Partner provides certain services to us under the Amendment to the General and Administrative Services and Product Offtake Agreement (the Services and Offtake Agreement). Pursuant to the Services and Offtake Agreement, the Partnership sells all of its fertilizer products to affiliates of the General Partner at prices based on market prices for the Partnership's fertilizer products as defined in the Services and Offtake Agreement. Title and risk of loss transfer to affiliates of the General Partner as the product is shipped from the plant gate. For further information regarding our agreements with CF Industries and the General Partner, see Note 


	10—Related Party Transactions


	.




	We are a master limited partnership (MLP). Partnerships are generally not subject to federal income tax, although publicly traded partnerships (such as TNCLP) are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes (and therefore are subject to federal income tax), unless at least 90% of the partnership's gross income is "qualifying income" as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As we currently satisfy the requirements to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, no federal income taxes are paid by the Partnership.




	On January 19, 2017, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a MLP. For calendar year MLPs, the effective date of the regulations is January 1, 2018. The regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the MLP rules, subject to certain transition provisions. The regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource (including fertilizer) as activities that generate qualifying income, but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizer-related activities. However, the IRS has issued a private letter ruling to a taxpayer in the fertilizer industry unrelated to TNCLP which would indicate that each taxpayer's fertilizer manufacturing activities should produce qualifying income for purposes of determining whether 90% of the partnership's gross income is qualifying income. The entity to which this private letter ruling was issued would appear to operate a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business that is similar to ours.  While this private letter ruling provides some insight into the manner in which the IRS analyzed fertilizer manufacturing activities at the time this ruling was issued, this private letter ruling is specific to a different entity. Thus, the IRS is not bound to follow it in respect of TNCLP, nor may we rely on it

	as precedent when determining whether we satisfy the MLP 90% gross income test. Any change in the federal income tax treatment of income from fertilizer-related activities as qualifying income could have a material impact on the taxation of the Partnership and could have a material adverse impact on unitholder distributions. We continue to monitor these IRS regulatory activities.




	Throughout this document, references to "affiliates of the General Partner" refer to consolidated subsidiaries of CF Industries, including TNGP. CF Industries acquired Terra Industries, Inc. (Terra) in April 2010, and acquired the General Partner and Terra's ownership in the Partnership at that time.




	We make available free of charge through CF Industries' Internet website,


	www.cfindustries.com


	, all of our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed electronically with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Copies of the General Partner's Corporate Governance Guidelines and charters for the Audit Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the General Partner's Board of Directors (TNGP Board of Directors) are also available on CF Industries' Internet website. We will provide electronic or paper copies of these documents free of charge upon written request delivered to our principal executive offices at the address below. The SEC also maintains a website at


	www.sec.gov


	 that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.




	Our principal executive offices are located outside of Chicago, Illinois, at 4 Parkway North, Suite 400, Deerfield, Illinois 60015.




	Product Tons and Nutrient Tons




	Unless otherwise stated, we measure our production and sales volume in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in product tons, which represents the weight of the product measured in short tons (one short ton is equal to 2,000 pounds). 




	We also provide certain supplementary volume information measured in nutrient tons. Nutrient tons represent the weight of the product’s nitrogen content, which varies by product. Ammonia product tons represent 82% nitrogen content and UAN product tons assume a 32% nitrogen content basis. 




	Our Products




	Our principal products are ammonia and UAN, which we manufacture at our Verdigris, Oklahoma facility. Our nitrogen products are used primarily by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops. Although ammonia and UAN are often interchangeable, each has its own characteristics, and customer product preferences vary according to the crop planted, soil and weather conditions, regional farming practices, relative prices and the cost and availability of appropriate storage, handling and application equipment.




	Our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the following table. The sales shown do not reflect product used internally in the manufacture of other products (for example, in


	2016


	 we used approximately 0.7 million tons of ammonia in the production of UAN).

	Our Facilities




	Our sole production facility, in Verdigris, Oklahoma, is the second largest UAN production facility in North America. It has two ammonia plants, two nitric acid plants and two UAN plants, providing us with some flexibility to adjust our product mix between ammonia and UAN. It has the annual capacity to produce approximately 1.2 million tons of ammonia (most of which is upgraded to UAN) and 2.0 million tons of UAN. The Verdigris facility represents approximately 5% of North American ammonia capacity and 13% of North American UAN capacity.

	Gross ammonia production, including amounts subsequently upgraded to UAN.







	Our Verdigris location is well suited to serve the midwestern U.S. corn belt. Verdigris is strategically located on approximately 800 acres near Tulsa's Port of Catoosa on the Verdigris River. We lease a port terminal from the Tulsa-Rogers County Port Authority, which provides access to transport fertilizer by way of river barges. In addition, Verdigris is located on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, providing access to rail transport. We also have access to a 1,100-mile ammonia pipeline. The complex has on-site storage for 60,000 tons of ammonia and 100,000 tons of UAN, providing us with flexibility to handle temporary disruptions to shipping activities without impacting production.




	Our capital expenditures are primarily related to plant maintenance and turnaround projects to sustain our asset base, to increase capacity, to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental, health and safety requirements. Occasionally, we have had other capital expenditure projects related to items such as the installation of new plant control systems or construction of additional on-site storage, including the construction of a new 50,000 ton capacity UAN tank that was completed in 2015. Planned capital expenditures and plant turnarounds are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals and/or permitting, unanticipated increases in cost, changes in scope and completion time, performance of third parties, adverse weather, defects in materials and workmanship, labor or material shortages, transportation constraints, and other unforeseen difficulties. Capital expenditures also reduce the Available Cash (as defined in our agreement of limited partnership) for unitholder distributions.




	Customers




	We sell all of the fertilizer products that we produce to affiliates of the General Partner, making it our only customer.




	Raw Materials




	Natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in our ammonia production process. In


	2016


	, natural gas accounted for approximately 58% of our total cost of goods sold for nitrogen fertilizers and a higher percentage of cash production costs (total production costs less depreciation and amortization). Our Verdigris facility has access to abundant, competitively-priced natural gas through a transportation arrangement connecting it to ONEOK Gas Transportation, L.L.C.'s intrastate pipeline system.




	In


	2016


	, our Verdigris facility consumed approximately


	41 million


	 MMBtus of natural gas. We purchase natural gas from a variety of suppliers to maintain a reliable, competitively-priced supply of natural gas. We also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices. For further information about our natural gas hedging activities, see Note 


	7—Derivative Financial Instruments


	.




	Distribution




	Our production facility in Verdigris is located near the agricultural areas of the midwestern United States, and has ready access to barge, truck and rail transportation. In addition, the Verdigris facility has access to an ammonia pipeline to transport product to high demand regions.




	Competition




	The market for nitrogen fertilizer products is global and intensely competitive. Competition in the nitrogen fertilizer market is based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality. During the peak demand periods, product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers. Agrium Inc., Koch Nitrogen Company, CVR Partners, LP, LSB Industries, Inc. and CF Industries are all large North American-based producers of nitrogen fertilizer products. Additionally, Iowa Fertilizer Company and Yara BASF are expected to bring new nitrogen fertilizer production facilities located in North America on line in 2017. There is also significant competition from product sourced from other regions of the world, including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs.

	Seasonality




	The fertilizer business is seasonal. However, the sales pattern of our business can change significantly from year to year due to weather conditions and other factors impacting the agricultural industry. The strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. Wholesale buyers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.




	Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters




	We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation; the generation, treatment, storage, disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes; and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases. These laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Toxic Substances Control Act and various other federal, state and local statutes. Violations can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment.




	We may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental, health and safety laws in the future. Additionally, future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures. Our costs to comply with, or any liabilities under, these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.




	Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners, Limited Partnership (a former owner and operator of the Partnership's production facilities) has retained liability for certain environmental matters originating prior to the Partnership's acquisition of these facilities.




	Environmental, Health and Safety Expenditures




	Our environmental, health and safety capital expenditures in


	2016


	 totaled approximately


	$3.5 million


	. In 2017 we estimate that we will spend approximately $0.8 million for environmental, health and safety capital expenditures. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations. Such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.




	Legislation and Regulation of Greenhouse Gases




	We are subject to greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued federal GHG regulations that impact our facility, including a mandatory GHG reporting rule that required us to commence monitoring GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2010 and begin reporting the previous year's emissions annually starting in 2011. In addition, if we seek to modify or expand our facility and as a result are required to obtain a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) air construction permit, we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to GHGs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants. Such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such facility modifications and expansions.




	On December 12, 2015, 195 countries, including the United States, adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement has been accepted by the United States and went into effect in November 2016. However, as a result of the recent presidential election, the United States may decide to withdraw from the Paris Agreement (or the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which would also result in withdrawal from the Paris Agreement) or, prior to taking such actions, could disregard its commitments under the Paris Agreement. The impact of such actions, if they take place, on the future implementation of the








	4









	Table of Contents





	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	Paris Agreement is uncertain. If the Paris Agreement remains in effect, it could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce GHG emissions. There are substantial uncertainties as to the nature, stringency and timing of any future regulations. More stringent GHG limitations, if they are enacted, are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facility emits GHGs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas, a fossil fuel, is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process. Regulation of GHGs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs, reduce our efficiency, limit our output, require us to make capital improvements to our facilities, increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy, raw materials or transportation, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders. In addition, to the extent GHG restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the United States, our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us.




	New Source Performance Standards for Nitric Acid Plants




	On August 14, 2012, the EPA issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed, reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants. The regulations will apply to our nitric acid plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications, including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at the plants. The regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants, and, accordingly, the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants. The EPA regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide (a greenhouse gas).

	ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS.




	 


	In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in TNCLP's common units. These risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.




	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS




	We are wholly dependent on our Verdigris manufacturing facility, and any operational disruption could result in a reduction of sales volumes and could cause us to incur substantial expenditures.




	Our manufacturing operations, located at a single site in Verdigris, Oklahoma, are subject to significant operating hazards and interruptions. Any significant curtailment of production at one or more of our production units could result in materially reduced revenues and cash flows for the duration of any shutdown. Operations at our manufacturing facility could be curtailed or partially or completely shut down, temporarily or permanently, as the result of a number of circumstances, most of which are not within our control, such as unscheduled maintenance or catastrophic events like a major accident or fire, damage by severe weather or other natural disaster or sabotage or terrorist incidents. The manufacturing operations at our facility could also be subject to interruption if our ammonia storage facilities were to be removed from service due to damage from an accident or natural disaster or sabotage or terrorist incidents, or due to problems discovered during inspections associated with long-term maintenance or safety requirements.




	Our business is cyclical, resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders tend to be negatively affected.




	Historically, selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions. Demand is affected by planted acreage and fertilizer application rates, driven by population growth, changes in dietary habits and non-food usage of crops, such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels, among other things. Supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs and availability, government policies and global trade.




	Periods of strong demand, high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to stimulate global investment in production capacity. The construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry, plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets, increase nitrogen supply and affect the supply and demand balance. In recent years, fertilizer producers, including CF Industries, have built new production facilities or expanded capacity of existing production assets, or announced plans to do so. In the current environment, global nitrogen fertilizer supply has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand, creating a global nitrogen fertilizer oversupply leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices. Lower global production costs driven by lower feedstock costs and foreign exchange rate changes, and reduced ocean freight costs, have further contributed to the lower priced environment.




	In 2016, selling prices reached multi-year lows last seen in 2009. The average selling price for our products in 2016 was


	$193


	 per ton compared to


	$279


	 per ton in 2015, a decrease of


	31%


	. 




	Additional production capacity has recently come on line, including capacity from CF Industries’ expansion projects, and more production capacity is expected to come on line over the next 12 months. We cannot predict the extent to which the current oversupply environment, global or local economic and financial conditions or changes in such conditions, or other factors may cause delays, cancellation or acceleration of other announced and/or ongoing projects.




	We expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line.




	During periods of industry oversupply, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines, resulting in possible reduced profit margins, write-downs in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production. Our financial performance, the amount of our cash distributions, and the trading price for our common units have been negatively impacted by the lower selling prices resulting from the current global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer. The period of time that these conditions will persist and the degree to which they will impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions are uncertain.

	Our products are global commodities, and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers.




	We are subject to intense price competition from our competitors. Most fertilizers are global commodities, with little or no product differentiation, and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality.




	We compete with many producers, including state-owned and government-subsidized entities. Consolidation in the industry has increased, and future consolidation is expected to further increase, the resources of several of our competitors. For example, in September 2016, our competitors Agrium Inc. and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. announced plans to merge. Some of our competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales, which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities. Furthermore, certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals. Our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources, either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships.




	China, the world's largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers, currently has significant capacity surplus and many high-cost plants. As a result, the domestic nitrogen industry in China is operating at low rates. If Chinese government policy, devaluation of the Chinese renminbi or decreases in Chinese producers' underlying costs such as the price of Chinese coal encourage increased production capacity utilization, the resulting export volume could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.




	A decline in U.S. agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the demand for our products.




	Conditions in the U.S. agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results. The U.S. agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors, including weather patterns and field conditions, current and projected grain inventories and prices, domestic and international demand for U.S. agricultural products and U.S. and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products. These factors are outside of our control.




	State and federal governmental policies, including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs, as well as the prices of fertilizer products, may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted, the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications. Ethanol production in the United States contributes significantly to corn demand, due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels. An increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the United States and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics. While the current Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) encourages continued high levels of corn-based ethanol production, a continuing "food versus fuel" debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate, or to eliminate or reduce corn-based ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate. This could have an adverse effect on corn-based ethanol production, planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand.




	Developments in crop technology, such as nitrogen fixation, the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate, or nitrogen-efficient varieties, could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products. Widespread adoption of emerging application technologies could disrupt traditional application practices, affecting the volume or types of products used and timing of applications. In addition, from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment. Any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products, including any limitation on the use and application of chemical fertilizer, could affect the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.




	Our business is dependent on North American natural gas, the prices of which are subject to volatility.




	Natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce our nitrogen products. Natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products. The price of natural gas in North America has been volatile in recent years. During 2016, the daily closing price at the Henry Hub, the most heavily-traded natural gas pricing point in North America, reached a low of


	$1.49


	 per MMBtu on three consecutive days in March 2016 and a high of


	$3.77


	 per MMBtu on


	December 8, 2016


	. During the three year period ended


	December 31, 2016


	, the daily closing price at the Henry Hub reached a low of


	$1.49


	 per MMBtu on three consecutive days in March 2016 and a high of


	$7.94


	 per MMBtu on

	Changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices. If high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders. We sell all of our output of fertilizer products to affiliates of the General Partner at prices determined based on market prices for our fertilizer products as defined in the Services and Offtake Agreement.




	The price of natural gas in North America and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves, including shale gas, and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques, such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas. Additionally, increased demand for natural gas, particularly in the Gulf Coast Region, due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices. If such reduced production or increased demand were to occur, or if other developments adversely impact the supply/demand balance for natural gas in the United States or elsewhere, natural gas prices could rise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.




	Our operations are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties, and any delay or interruption in the delivery of raw materials may adversely affect our business.




	We use natural gas in the manufacture of fertilizers. We purchase the natural gas from third party suppliers. Our natural gas is transported by pipeline to our facility by third party transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties. Delays or interruptions in the delivery of natural gas may be caused by, among other things, severe weather or natural disasters, unscheduled downtime, labor difficulties, insolvency of our suppliers or their inability to meet existing contractual arrangements, deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents, or mechanical failures. In addition, the transport of natural gas by pipeline is subject to additional risks, including delays or interruptions caused by capacity constraints, leaks or ruptures. Any delay or interruption in the delivery of natural gas, even for a limited period, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.




	Our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers and are subject to environmental, safety and regulatory oversight. This exposes us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposes us to additional liability.




	We rely on railroad, truck, pipeline, and river barge companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing complex, to coordinate and deliver finished products into CF Industries' distribution system and to ship finished products to CF Industries' customers. We also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products. These transportation operations, equipment and services are subject to various hazards, including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system, extreme weather conditions, system failures, work stoppages, delays, accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and operating hazards. Additionally, due to the aging infrastructure of certain bridges, roadways, rail lines, river locks, and equipment that our third party service providers utilize, we may experience delays in the shipment of finished product while repairs, maintenance or replacement activities are conducted. Also, certain third party service providers, particularly railroads, have experienced periodic service slowdowns due to capacity constraints in their systems which impact the shipping times of our products.




	These transportation operations, equipment and services are also subject to environmental, safety, and regulatory oversight. Due to concerns related to accidents, discharges or other releases of hazardous substances, terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives, local, state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products.




	If shipping of our products is delayed as a result of these transportation companies' failure to operate properly, or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment, or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment, our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected.




	The railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads' potential liability stemming from the transportation of Toxic Inhalation Hazard materials, such as the anhydrous ammonia that we transport to and from our facilities. For example, various railroads have implemented tariffs that include provisions that purport to shift liability to shippers to the extent that liabilities arise from third parties with insufficient resources. These initiatives could materially and adversely affect operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care, custody and control of the railroads, for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable. New regulations also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products.

	Increases in transportation costs, or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors, and any railroad industry initiatives that may impact our ability to transport our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.




	Our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards. We are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. Therefore, our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses.




	Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacture, transportation, storage and distribution of chemical products, including ammonia, which is highly toxic and corrosive. These hazards include: explosions; fires; severe weather and natural disasters; train derailments, collisions, vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents; leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks, pipelines and rail cars; spills, discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases; deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents; mechanical failures; unscheduled plant downtime; labor difficulties and other risks. Some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities.




	We are currently insured under CF Industries' property, business interruption, casualty and liability insurance policies, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. If we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders. CF Industries' insurance policies are subject to various self-retentions, deductibles and limits. The policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder. CF Industries' insurance policies are generally renewed annually. As a result of market conditions, insurance premiums, self-retentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances (including if CF Industries had fully utilized the purchased coverage), certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. In addition, significantly increased costs could lead CF Industries to decide to reduce, or possibly eliminate, coverage. There can be no assurance that CF Industries or we will be able to buy and maintain insurance with adequate limits and reasonable pricing terms and conditions.




	Cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results.




	The information management systems that we use are those provided by CF Industries, while we own the computer control systems that operate our plants. We rely on information technology and computer control systems in many aspects of our business, including internal and external communications, the management of our accounting, financial and supply chain functions and plant operations. Business and supply chain disruptions, plant and utility outages and information technology system and network disruptions due to cyber attacks could seriously harm our operations and materially adversely affect our operating results. Cyber security risks include attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers, damage or loss of information due to viruses, the unintended disclosure of confidential information, the misuse or loss of control over computer control systems, and breaches due to employee error. Our exposure to cyber security risks includes exposure through third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business. We routinely review and implement security procedures and measures in order to protect our systems and information from being vulnerable to evolving cyber attacks. We believe these measures and procedures are appropriate. However, we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate, prevent, or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Compromises to our information and control systems could have severe financial and other business implications.




	Adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products, increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations.




	Weather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting, growing, harvesting or application periods may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer, which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following application period, resulting in lower demand for our products.




	Adverse weather conditions during or following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall. Weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields, which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from CF Industries' customers. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.




	Weather conditions or, in certain cases, weather forecasts, also can affect the price of natural gas, the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products. Colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use, which can increase the cost and/or








	9









	Table of Contents





	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	decrease the availability of natural gas. In addition, adverse weather events such as very low temperatures leading to well freeze-offs or hurricanes affecting the Gulf of Mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise.




	We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, as well as potential environmental liabilities, which may require us to make substantial expenditures.




	We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the United States, including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes; the cleanup of hazardous substance releases; the discharge of regulated substances to air or water; and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure. These laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, CERCLA, the Toxic Substances Control Act and various other federal, state and local laws.




	As a fertilizer company working with hazardous substances, our business faces risks of spills, discharges or other releases of those substances into the environment. Certain environmental laws, including CERCLA, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment. Given the nature of our business, we have incurred, are incurring currently, and are likely to incur periodically in the future, liabilities under CERCLA and other environmental cleanup laws at our facility, adjacent or nearby third-party facilities or offsite disposal locations. The costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material. Additionally, we may become liable to third parties for damages, including personal injury and property damage, resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment.




	Violations of environmental, health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. Environmental, health and safety laws change regularly and have tended to become more stringent over time. As a result, we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental, health and safety laws in the future. Additionally, future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures. Our costs to comply with, or any liabilities under, these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.




	From time to time, our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury. To date, our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material. However, we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us, or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses.




	We hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at our Verdigris facility. Expansion or modification of our operations is predicated upon securing necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, or a determination that we have violated a law or permit as a result of a governmental inspection of our facility could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the Verdigris facility and on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders. On October 1, 2015, the EPA released a final regulation lowering the national ambient air quality standard for ozone. Ozone attainment designations are expected by October 2017, and this action is expected to result in additional areas of the country being classified as being in nonattainment with the ozone standard and subject to more stringent permitting requirements, which in turn could make it much more difficult and expensive to obtain permits to construct new facilities or expand our existing operations.




	Future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.




	We are subject to GHG regulations. There are substantial uncertainties as to the nature, stringency and timing of any future GHG regulations. On December 12, 2015, 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement has been accepted by the United States and went into effect in November 2016. However, as a result of the recent presidential election, the United States may decide to withdraw from the Paris Agreement (or the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which would

	also result in withdrawal from the Paris Agreement) or, prior to taking such actions, could disregard its commitments under the Paris Agreement. The impact of such actions, if they take place, on the future implementation of the Paris Agreement is uncertain. If the Paris Agreement remains in effect, it could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce GHG emissions. More stringent GHG limitations, if they are enacted, are likely to have a significant impact on us, because our production facility emits GHGs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas, a fossil fuel, is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process. Regulation of GHGs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs, reduce our efficiency, limit our output, require us to make capital improvements to our facilities, increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy, raw materials or transportation, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders. In addition, to the extent that GHG restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the United States, our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us.




	Our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality.




	The fertilizer business is seasonal. However, the sales pattern of our business can change significantly from year to year due to weather conditions and other factors impacting the agricultural industry. The strongest demand for fertilizer products occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. Wholesale buyers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season.




	As a result of this seasonality, you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance. In addition, as a consequence of our seasonality, our Available Cash for distributions can be volatile, and will vary quarterly and annually.




	Our business is subject to risks involving derivatives, including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses.




	We often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas, the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogen-based fertilizers. We have used fixed-price, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges.




	Our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for, or to which we do not apply, hedge accounting. To the extent that our derivative positions lose value, we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties, adversely affecting our liquidity and our ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.




	Hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist. In addition, our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us. For example, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position. The counterparties to our derivatives are multi-national commercial banks, major financial institutions or large energy companies. We monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary. We also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties, credit limits, credit monitoring procedures, cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements. However, our liquidity and cash available for distributions to unitholders could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments.




	Our limited access to capital in a time of need could materially adversely impact our business.




	We invest capital in our business to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations and policies, maintain our manufacturing assets, improve our production capabilities and capitalize on growth opportunities. The primary source of capital invested in our business is cash from operations. In the event that cash generated from operations is insufficient to fund capital investments, we would need to obtain additional funding in the form of loans or equity. Our ability to obtain such funding would be determined by market conditions at the time of the capital need. Our partnership structure, our reliance on a single manufacturing facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma and our reliance on affiliates of the General Partner as our only customer could impede our ability to obtain such capital, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.

	Acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business.




	Like other companies with major industrial facilities, we may be the target of terrorist activities. Our Verdigris facility stores significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled. Any damage to infrastructure facilities, such as electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, or injury to employees, who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism, may affect our operations. Any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace, repair or insure our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.




	In addition, due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives, we are subject to various security laws and regulations. These security laws include the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and the Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards regulation. In addition, President Obama issued Executive Order 13650 Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators. Governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants, terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers. These regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs, lower revenues and reduced profit margins.




	We are dependent on CF Industries and its employees for the success of our business.




	We are dependent on CF Industries for our success in a number of respects. CF Industries, through subsidiaries, purchases all of the production from our manufacturing facility and, together with its affiliates, provides certain services to us, including staffing, benefits, human resources administration, production planning, manufacturing management, procurement, logistics, accounting, legal, risk management, investor relations and other general and administrative services. CF Industries and its wholly-owned subsidiaries have debt and debt service requirements and we currently do not. Although CF Industries is affected by most of the factors that affect us, a higher level of debt could put CF Industries at greater risk than us in the event business conditions deteriorate materially. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders might be adversely affected by any financial or operational difficulties at CF Industries, including any potential default by CF Industries or its subsidiaries on their debt or any bankruptcy proceeding by CF Industries. Information regarding CF Industries can be obtained in its various filings with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.




	Deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders.




	A slowdown of, or persistent weakness in, economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways, among others: conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of CF Industries' customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses. We also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to CF Industries' customers' reluctance to replenish inventories. Changes in global economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such changes can be difficult to ascertain, resulting in anxiety among market participants that can persist for protracted periods. For example, concern and uncertainty over the potential impact on the global economy of the referendum in the United Kingdom in June 2016, which resulted in a vote in favor of exiting the European Union, has resulted in increased volatility in the global financial markets. The overall impact of changes in global economic conditions on us is difficult to predict, and our business could be materially adversely impacted.




	In addition, conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizers significantly influence our operating results. The international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates, including the relative value of the U.S. dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen fertilizers into the United States, foreign agricultural policies, the existence of, or changes in, import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate that affect foreign trade and investment.

	RISKS RELATED TO OUR PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE




	The General Partner's discretion in determining the level of cash reserves may adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.




	Our cash distributions to our unitholders are based on Available Cash as defined in our agreement of limited partnership. Our agreement of limited partnership provides that the General Partner may reduce Available Cash by establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business or the business of the Operating Partnership (including reserves for future operating and capital needs), to provide funds for future distributions to our unitholders in any one or more of the next four quarters or to comply with applicable law or any agreement or obligation to which we or the Operating Partnership are a party or otherwise bound. These cash reserves will affect the amount of cash available for current distribution to our unitholders.




	Our unitholders have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect the General Partner or the General Partner's directors.




	Unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business. Unitholders have no right to elect the General Partner or the TNGP Board of Directors on an annual or other continuing basis. The TNGP Board of Directors, including the independent directors, is chosen entirely by CF Industries as the indirect owner of the General Partner and not by our common unitholders. Unlike publicly-traded corporations, we do not hold annual meetings of our unitholders to elect directors or conduct other matters routinely conducted at annual meetings of shareholders. Furthermore, even if our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of the General Partner, the General Partner may only be removed by a vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding common units, including any common units held by the General Partner and its affiliates (including CF Industries). As a result, given that the General Partner and its affiliates own approximately 75.1% of our outstanding common units, holders of our publicly-traded common units are not able to remove the General Partner under any circumstances.




	The control of the General Partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.




	There is no restriction in our agreement of limited partnership on the ability of CF Industries to transfer its equity interest in the General Partner to a third party. The new equity owner of the General Partner would then be in a position to replace the TNGP Board of Directors and the officers of the General Partner with its own choices and to influence the decisions taken by the TNGP Board of Directors and officers of the General Partner.




	The TNGP Board of Directors and officers of the General Partner have fiduciary duties to TNGP and its stockholders, and the interests of TNGP and its stockholders may differ significantly from, or conflict with, the interests of our public common unitholders.




	The General Partner is responsible for managing us. Although the General Partner has, as limited and reduced by the agreement of limited partnership, fiduciary duties to manage us in a manner that is beneficial to our common unitholders, the directors and officers of the General Partner also have fiduciary duties to manage the General Partner in a manner beneficial to TNGP and its stockholders. The interests of TNGP and its stockholders may differ from, or conflict with, the interests of our common unitholders. In resolving these conflicts, the General Partner may favor its own interests or the interests of holders of TNGP's common stock over our interests and those of our common unitholders.




	The potential conflicts of interest include, among others, the following:













	•






	the General Partner's determination of the amount of our cash expenditures, borrowings and reserves;
















	•






	the issuance of additional units or the purchase, call, or redemption of outstanding units;
















	•






	transactions with CF Industries and its affiliates;


















	•






	the decision to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services on our behalf;
















	•






	the decision by affiliates of the General Partner to engage in activities that would compete with us; and
















	•






	the fact that all executive officers of the General Partner, and the majority of the directors of the General Partner, also serve as executive officers of CF Industries. Such executive officers, including the General Partner's chief executive officer, chief financial officer and senior vice presidents, divide their time between our business and the business of CF Industries. These executive officers will face conflicts of interest from time to time in making decisions which may benefit either us or CF Industries.

	The agreement of limited partnership limits the liability and reduces the fiduciary duties of the General Partner and restricts the remedies available to us and our common unitholders for actions taken by the General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.




	The agreement of limited partnership limits the liability and reduces the fiduciary duties of the General Partner and its directors and officers, while also restricting the remedies available to our common unitholders for actions that, without these limitations and reductions, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. For example:















	•






	The agreement of limited partnership provides that none of the General Partner, any of its affiliates, or any director or officer of the General Partner or any of its affiliates will have any liability for monetary damages to us or our unitholders for any act or omission if such person acted in good faith.
















	•






	The agreement of limited partnership provides broad flexibility for the directors and officers of the General Partner to be involved in the management of the businesses of the owners of the General Partner, including any businesses that are in competition with our business, and specifically permits the owners of the General Partner to engage in activities that are competitive with our business. The agreement of limited partnership provides that no such activities will constitute a breach of any fiduciary duty owed by the General Partner.
















	•






	The agreement of limited partnership provides that in connection with its resolution of any conflict of interest by the General Partner, the General Partner may consider: the relative interests of any party involved in such conflict or affected by such action, agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interest, as well as any additional factors as the General Partner determines in its sole discretion to be relevant, reasonable or appropriate under the circumstances. The agreement of limited partnership further provides that, in the absence of bad faith by the General Partner, the resolution provided by the General Partner with respect to any conflict of interest will not constitute a breach of the agreement of limited partnership or any standard of care or duty imposed in the agreement of limited partnership or under any law, rule or regulation.








	By purchasing a common unit, a unitholder becomes bound by the provisions of the agreement of limited partnership, including the provisions described above.




	CF Industries and its affiliates are also engaged in fertilizer manufacturing.




	The agreement of limited partnership does not prohibit CF Industries and its affiliates, other than TNGP, from owning and operating nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing plants and storage and distribution assets or engaging in any businesses which could compete with our business. In addition, CF Industries has recently constructed certain assets related to our business and may in the future acquire, construct or dispose of additional assets related to our business, without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct any of these assets.




	As a publicly-traded partnership we qualify for, and are relying on, certain exemptions from the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).




	As a publicly-traded partnership, we qualify for, and are relying on, certain exemptions from the NYSE's corporate governance requirements, including:













	•






	the requirement that a majority of the TNGP Board of Directors consist of independent directors; and
















	•






	the requirement that the TNGP Board of Directors have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.







	As a result of these exemptions, the TNGP Board of Directors is not comprised of a majority of independent directors, and the TNGP Board of Directors did not establish a compensation committee. Accordingly, unitholders do not have the same protections afforded to equity holders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.




	Common units are subject to the General Partner's call right.




	The General Partner and its affiliates own approximately 75.1% of our outstanding common units. When not more than 25% of the issued and outstanding common units are held by persons other than the General Partner and its affiliates (collectively, non-affiliated persons), we, at the General Partner's sole discretion, may call, or assign to the General Partner or its affiliates, our right to acquire all such outstanding common units held by non-affiliated persons. The purchase price per unit will be the greater of (i) the average of the previous 20 trading days' closing prices as of the date five days before the purchase is announced and (ii) the highest price paid by the General Partner or any of its affiliates for any common unit within the








	14









	Table of Contents





	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	90 days preceding the date the purchase is announced. As a result of this right, unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on their investment. Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their common units.




	Limited partners of TNCLP may not have limited liability if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business.




	A general partner of a limited partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. TNCLP is organized under Delaware law and the Operating Partnership conducts business in Oklahoma. Limited partners of TNCLP (Limited Partners) could be liable for our obligations as if such Limited Partners were general partners if a court or government agency determined that:















	•






	we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state's partnership statute; or

	TAX RISKS TO OUR COMMON UNITHOLDERS




	TNCLP's tax treatment depends on its status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as well as it not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the Internal Revenue Service were to treat TNCLP as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or if it were to become subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, then TNCLP's Available Cash would be substantially reduced.

	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	The anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on TNCLP being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. To maintain TNCLP's status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, current law requires that 90% or more of our gross income for every taxable year consist of "qualifying income," as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). We have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") on this or any other matter affecting us.




	If TNCLP were to be treated as a corporation in any taxable year, its income, gains, losses, deductions and credits would be reflected on its tax return rather than being passed through to unitholders, and its net income would be taxed at corporate rates. In addition, distributions made to unitholders would be treated as dividend income, to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits, and in the absence of earnings and profits, as a nontaxable return of capital (to the extent of a unitholder's basis in his units) or as capital gain (after a unitholder's basis in his units has been reduced to zero). If the IRS were to challenge the federal income tax status of TNCLP, it could result in an audit of a unitholder's entire tax return and in adjustments to items on that return which are unrelated to the ownership of our units. In addition, each unitholder would bear the cost of any expenses incurred in connection with an examination of its personal tax return.




	There can be no assurance that TNCLP will continue to satisfy the requirements for treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that the law will not be changed to make TNCLP taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. If such a new law were enacted, then the Minimum Quarterly Distribution (as defined in our agreement of limited partnership) and each of the target distribution levels would be adjusted downward. In such an event, the Minimum Quarterly Distribution and first, second and third target distributions for each quarter thereafter would be reduced to take into account the federal, state and local taxes applicable to TNCLP that would be imposed on the earnings used to make such distributions. For additional information regarding cash distributions, see the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.




	If the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any IRS contest will reduce our Available Cash.




	We have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to TNCLP's treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other matter. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of our positions. Any contest with the IRS could materially and adversely impact the market for our units and the price at which they trade. In addition, the costs of any contest with the IRS will be borne indirectly by our unitholders because the costs would reduce our Available Cash.

	The tax treatment of publicly-traded partnerships or an investment in our units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.




	The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly-traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our units, may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. On January 19, 2017, the IRS issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a MLP. For calendar year MLPs, the effective date of the regulations is January 1, 2018. The regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the MLP rules, subject to certain transition provisions. The regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource (including fertilizer) as activities that generate qualifying income, but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizer-related activities. However, the IRS has issued a private letter ruling to a taxpayer in the fertilizer industry unrelated to TNCLP which would indicate that each taxpayer's fertilizer manufacturing activities should produce qualifying income for purposes of determining whether 90% of the partnership's gross income is qualifying income. The entity to which this private letter ruling was issued would appear to operate a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business that is similar to ours.  While this private letter ruling provides some insight into the manner in which the IRS analyzed fertilizer manufacturing activities at the time this ruling was issued, this private letter ruling is specific to a different entity. Thus, the IRS is not bound to follow it in respect of TNCLP, nor may we rely on it as precedent when determining whether we satisfy the MLP 90% gross income test. Any change in the federal income tax treatment of income from fertilizer-related activities as qualifying income could have a material impact on the taxation of the Partnership and could have a material adverse impact on unitholder distributions.




	Our unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of TNCLP income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us.




	A unitholder is required to pay U.S. federal income tax and, in certain cases, state and local income taxes on its allocable share of TNCLP's income, whether or not such unitholder receives cash distributions from us. No assurance is given that our unitholders will receive cash distributions equal to their allocable share of taxable income from us.




	We prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of units as of the close of business on the last day of the preceding month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred.




	We prorate our items of income and loss between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units as of the close of business on the last day of the preceding month instead of the date a particular unit is transferred. As a result of this monthly allocation, a unitholder transferring units may be allocated income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized after the transfer. The use of these proration methods may not be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code ("Treasury Regulations"). If the IRS were to challenge this method or new Treasury Regulations regarding allocation methods were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.




	Tax gain or loss on disposition of our units could be more or less than expected.




	If a unitholder sells its units, for income tax purposes, the unitholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and that unitholder's adjusted tax basis in those units. Because distributions in excess of a unitholder's allocable share of our net taxable income decrease that unitholder's tax basis in its units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units sold will, in effect, become taxable income allocated to that unitholder if the unitholder sells such units at a price greater than that unitholder's tax basis in those units, even if the price received is less than the original cost. Furthermore, a portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. In addition, because the amount realized may include a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if a unitholder sells its units, such unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received from the sale.




	Tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning our units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.




	Investment in our common units by tax-exempt entities, including employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs), and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, substantially all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from U.S. federal income tax, including IRA's, pension plans and other retirement plans and arrangements, will constitute unrelated business taxable income and may be taxable to such unitholders. Distributions to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes imposed at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-U.S. persons will be required to file U.S. federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income. Any tax-exempt entity








	17









	Table of Contents





	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	or non-U.S. person should consult its tax advisor before investing in our units. Any tax-exempt entity or non-U.S. person who currently holds our units should consult with their tax advisor as to the U.S. federal and state tax consequences of their holding of our units, including the taxability of income and/or distributions to them.




	We treat each purchaser of our units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of our units.




	Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of our units and to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of our common units, we have adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to these positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to a unitholder or the value of our common units.




	The sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve-month period will result in a termination of TNCLP for federal income tax purposes.




	TNCLP and the Operating Partnership will be considered to have constructively terminated for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in TNCLP capital and profits within a 12-month period. For purposes of determining whether the 50% threshold has been met, multiple sales of the same interest are counted only once. Because CF Industries currently owns approximately 75.1% of the outstanding common units and all of the outstanding Class B common units of TNCLP, a sale or exchange of all or a substantial portion of CF Industries' interests in TNCLP (including sales or transfers to affiliates of CF Industries), when combined with trading in the open market, may constitute a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interest in TNCLP. A constructive termination would, among other things, result in the closing of TNCLP's taxable year for all unitholders and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. In the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a calendar year, the closing of a tax year of TNCLP may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being included in such unitholder's taxable income for the year of termination. Termination could also subject us to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred and therefore failed to make necessary elections in a timely manner.




	A unitholder whose units are loaned to a "short seller" to cover a short sale may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, the unitholder would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.




	Because a unitholder whose units are loaned to a "short seller" to cover a short sale may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units, the unitholder may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan, and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners should modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units.




	As a result of investing in our units, a unitholder may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire property.




	In addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or are otherwise deemed to be taxable now or in the future, even if our unitholders do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders may be required to file state income tax returns and pay state income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with such requirements.




	Income allocated to our common unitholders may be subject to the 3.8% Health Care Surtax.




	Beginning in 2013, for federal income tax purposes, certain investment income earned by unitholders has become subject to an additional 3.8% surtax enacted as part of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the "Health Care Surtax"). Unitholders will need to take into consideration the Health Care Surtax for estimated tax purposes, as well as in the filing of their income tax returns. Gross income from a passive activity, or a trade or business of trading in financial instruments or commodities can be subject to the Health Care Surtax. A "passive activity" is defined to be a trade or business in which the taxpayer does not "materially" participate. This category could include net business income from MLPs such as TNCLP. Investors in our common units are encouraged to consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of the Health Care Surtax to their particular tax situation.

	K-1 Reporting Information is dependent upon proper reporting of purchases and sales by unitholders, their representatives and/or their brokers to TNCLP.




	Under applicable federal law, we are permitted and do rely on brokerage firms, investor representatives and investors to report sales and dispositions of TNCLP units to us. This information forms the basis of our tax reporting to unitholders. If an investor (or their broker) fails to timely report a purchase or disposition of a unitholder’s interest in TNCLP, the investor will receive an inaccurate Form K-1. The failure to properly report a disposition of a unitholder’s interest does not mean that a unitholder is a continuing unitholder in TNCLP, rather it means that the investor, their representative or their broker have failed to meet its reporting obligations to us. We accept no responsibility for the failure of unitholders, their representatives or their brokers to comply with their reporting obligations to us.




	If the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, it may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.




	Pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns, it may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us. Generally, we expect to elect to have our General Partner and our unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, but there can be no assurance that such election will be effective in all circumstances. If we are unable to have our General Partner and our unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own units in us during the tax year under audit. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced. These rules are not applicable to us for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017.

	Ownership of TNCLP is composed of the general partner interests and the limited partner interests. The Limited Partners' interests consist of


	18,501,576


	 common units and


	184,072


	 Class B common units. CF Industries through its subsidiaries owned

	 common units and all of the Class B common units as of


	December 31, 2016


	. Based on information received from TNCLP's transfer and service agent, the number of registered unitholders as of


	February 16, 2017


	 was 86.




	Under TNCLP's agreement of limited partnership, cash distributions to unitholders are based on Available Cash for the quarter as defined therein. Available Cash is defined generally as all cash receipts less all cash disbursements, less certain reserves (including reserves for future operating and capital needs) established as the General Partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary or appropriate. For additional information regarding cash distributions, see the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

	Company Overview




	Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. ("TNCLP," "we," "our" or "us") is a Delaware limited partnership that produces nitrogen fertilizer products. Our principal products are anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) and urea ammonium nitrate solutions (UAN), which we manufacture at our facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma.




	We conduct our operations through an operating partnership, Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP or the Operating Partnership, and collectively with TNCLP, the Partnership). Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP or the General Partner), a Delaware corporation, is the general partner of both TNCLP and TNLP and owns a 0.025% general partner interest in each of TNCLP and TNLP. The General Partner is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF Industries), a Delaware corporation. Ownership of TNCLP is composed of the general partner interests and the limited partner interests. Limited partner interests are represented by common units, which are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TNH" and Class B common units. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had


	18,501,576


	 common units and


	184,072


	 Class B common units issued and outstanding. CF Industries through its subsidiaries owned


	13,889,014


	 common units (representing approximately 75.1% of the total outstanding common units) and all of the Class B common units as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	CF Industries, through its subsidiaries, is a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of nitrogen products, serving both agricultural and industrial customers. CF Industries operates world-class nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and distributes plant nutrients through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States.




	TNCLP and TNGP have no employees. Affiliates of the General Partner provides certain services to us under the Amendment to the General and Administrative Services and Product Offtake Agreement (the Services and Offtake Agreement). Pursuant to the Services and Offtake Agreement, the Partnership sells all of its fertilizer products to affiliates of the General Partner at prices based on market prices for the Partnership's fertilizer products as defined in the Services and Offtake Agreement. Title and risk of loss transfer to affiliates of the General Partner as the product is shipped from the plant gate. For further information regarding our agreements with CF Industries and the General Partner, see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 


	10—Related Party Transactions


	.




	Throughout this document, references to "affiliates of the General Partner" refer to the consolidated subsidiaries of CF Industries, including TNGP.

	Nitrogen Fertilizer Market Conditions




	Our products are global commodities and are subject to price competition. The customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. The selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions and changes in supply and demand. In the current environment, global nitrogen fertilizer supply has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand, creating the current global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer and leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices.




	Our


	2016


	 results were impacted by excess global nitrogen supply and the resulting low nitrogen fertilizer selling prices. The U.S. Gulf is a major global fertilizer pricing point due to the volume of nitrogen fertilizer that trades there. Through most of 2016, nitrogen pricing at the U.S. Gulf declined, often trading below parity with other international pricing points due to low U.S. import demand. Seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices reaching multi-year lows last seen in 2009 in the second half of the year. Our average selling prices for ammonia and UAN declined by


	32%


	 and


	29%


	, respectively, as compared to


	2015


	, which reduced both our net sales and gross margin in


	2016


	 by


	$178.5 million


	. In addition, during periods of declining prices, customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation of prices in the future being lower than current prices.




	Customers and farmers delayed purchasing through most of 2016 in response to lower selling prices, which reduced inventory levels in the supply chain. Increases in demand for the 2017 spring application caused higher pricing as 2016 ended as customers began taking deliveries in anticipation of the spring application season. A significant amount of new nitrogen production capacity came on line in 2016, and additional production capacity is expected to come on line in 2017, including a significant increase in capacity located in North America. This new capacity will further increase supply. We expect nitrogen fertilizer prices to rise going into the 2017 spring application season due to seasonal demand. However, we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line.

	Our production and sales volume in 2016 was impacted by an unscheduled outage, while in 2015 our production and sales volume was impacted by a scheduled turnaround. In the first quarter of 2016, we experienced an unscheduled outage for maintenance on one of the Verdigris nitrogen complex’s two ammonia plants, resulting in approximately one-half of the complex's ammonia capacity being shut down for approximately two months, and approximately one-half of the complex's UAN capacity being shut down for approximately one month. Maintenance was completed and the affected ammonia plant was restarted in March 2016. In the first quarter of 2015, we commenced planned turnarounds of an ammonia plant and a UAN plant, together representing approximately one-half of the production capacity of the Verdigris nitrogen complex. The ammonia plant turnaround was completed in the first quarter of 2015 and the UAN plant turnaround, including certain follow-on maintenance, was completed in the second quarter of 2015. The net impact of these actions was marginally higher production in 2016, which contributed to higher sales volume for UAN.

	In the first quarter of 2015, we commenced planned turnarounds of an ammonia plant and a UAN plant, together representing approximately one-half of the production capacity of the Verdigris nitrogen complex. The ammonia plant turnaround was completed in the first quarter of 2015 and the UAN plant turnaround, including certain follow-on maintenance, was completed in the second quarter of 2015. These turnarounds reduced production in the year ended

	2015


	 from


	$255

	 tons from


	331,000


	 tons in


	2014


	 as a result of the impact of the turnaround of the UAN plant which increased the amount of ammonia available for sale. Additionally, an early spring application window, together with customer preferences for ammonia contributed to the increase. Ammonia selling prices

	Capital Expenditures




	Capital expenditures totaled


	$33.1 million


	 in


	2016


	 compared to


	$87.8 million


	 in


	2015


	 with the decrease due primarily to higher capital expenditures in 2015 due to planned plant turnaround activities. Capital expenditures are made to sustain our asset base, to increase capacity, to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental, health and safety requirements. Due to the size, scope and timing of capital projects, certain projects require more than a year to complete.




	In


	2017


	, we expect to make capital expenditures in the range of


	$75 million


	 to


	$85 million


	. Approximately one-half of the projected capital expenditures relate to a plant turnaround expected to occur beginning late in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2017. The planned plant turnaround will result in lower ammonia and UAN production, lower sales and lower profitability during the period of the turnaround, which will reduce Available Cash for distributions to unitholders. Additionally, planned maintenance, capital expenditures, and turnarounds are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals and/or permitting, unanticipated increases in cost, changes in scope and completion time, performance of third parties, adverse weather, defects in materials and workmanship, labor or material shortages, transportation constraints, and other unforeseen difficulties. Capital expenditures also reduce the Available Cash for unitholder distributions. The plant turnaround expected to begin in the third quarter of 2017 is estimated to cost approximately $40 million, and the calculation of Available Cash for the fourth quarter of 2016 included a reserve of approximately one-third of that amount.




	General Partner




	The General Partner is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CF Industries. Under the General Partner’s governing documents, neither we nor the General Partner may make any bankruptcy filing (or take similar action) without the approval of the General Partner’s independent directors, except in specified circumstances if there are not two independent directors on the General Partner's Board of Directors (the TNGP Board of Directors).




	Partnership Distributions




	We make quarterly distributions to holders of our general partner interest and limited partner interests based on Available Cash for the quarter as defined in our agreement of limited partnership. Available Cash is defined generally as all cash receipts less all cash disbursements, less certain reserves (including reserves for future operating and capital needs) established as the General Partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary or appropriate. Changes in working capital affect Available Cash, as changes in the amount of cash invested in working capital items (such as increases in inventory and decreases in accounts payable) reduce Available Cash, while declines in the amount of cash invested in working capital items increase Available Cash. We paid distributions of


	$257.5 million


	,


	$294.8 million


	 and


	$304.1 million


	 to our unitholders in


	2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, respectively.




	We receive 99% of the Operating Partnership's Available Cash (as defined in the Operating Partnership's agreement of limited partnership) and 1% of the Operating Partnership's Available Cash is distributed by the Operating Partnership to the General Partner and its affiliates. Pursuant to our agreement of limited partnership, distributions of our Available Cash are made 99.975% to common and Class B common unitholders and 0.025% to the General Partner except that the General Partner is entitled, as an incentive, to a larger percentage of our distribution of Available Cash to the extent that cumulative distributions of Available Cash exceed specified target levels above the Minimum Quarterly Distributions (MQD) of $0.605 per unit. The General Partner has assigned its right to receive such incentive distributions to an affiliate of the General Partner.




	On


	February 6, 2017


	, we announced a


	$1.22


	 cash distribution per common unit, payable on


	February 28, 2017


	 to holders of record as of


	February 17, 2017


	. In the fourth quarter of

	General Partner Option to Effect Mandatory Redemption of Partnership Units




	At


	December 31, 2016


	, the General Partner and its affiliates owned approximately 75.1% of our outstanding common units. When not more than 25% of the issued and outstanding common units are held by persons other than the General Partner and its affiliates (collectively, non-affiliated persons), as was the case at


	December 31, 2016


	, we, at the General Partner's sole discretion, may call or assign to the General Partner or its affiliates, our right to acquire all, but not less than all, such outstanding common units held by non-affiliated persons. If the General Partner elects to acquire all outstanding common units, we are required to give at least 30 but not more than 60 days' notice of our decision to purchase the outstanding common units. The purchase price per unit will be the greater of (1) the average of the previous 20 trading days' closing prices as of the date five days before the purchase is announced or (2) the highest price paid by the General Partner or any of its affiliates for any unit within the 90 days preceding the date the purchase is announced.




	Cash Transactions with Affiliates




	We receive cash and make expenditures directly from our cash accounts. Because we sell our products to and receive payroll and other related services from affiliates of the General Partner, the affiliates of the General Partner continue to be both debtors and creditors to us.




	Derivatives




	We purchase natural gas at market prices to meet production requirements at our manufacturing facility. Natural gas prices are volatile, and our natural gas acquisition policy allows us to establish derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements. The derivatives that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter markets.




	Natural gas derivatives involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts. The counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are multi-national commercial banks, major financial institutions and large energy companies. For derivatives that are in net asset positions, we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties. Credit risk is controlled through the use of multiple counterparties, credit limits, credit monitoring procedures, cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements.




	Internal Revenue Service Regulation Impacting Master Limited Partnerships




	We are a master limited partnership (MLP). Partnerships are generally not subject to federal income tax, although publicly-traded partnerships (such as TNCLP) are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes and therefore are subject to federal income tax, unless at least 90% of the partnership's gross income is "qualifying income" as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As we currently satisfy the requirements to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, no federal income taxes are paid by the Partnership.




	On January 19, 2017, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a MLP. For calendar year MLPs, the effective date of the regulations is January 1, 2018. The regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the MLP rules, subject to certain transition provisions. The regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource (including fertilizer) as activities that generate qualifying income, but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizer-related activities. However, the IRS has issued a private letter ruling to a taxpayer in the fertilizer industry unrelated to TNCLP which would indicate that each taxpayer's fertilizer manufacturing activities should produce qualifying income for purposes of determining whether 90% of the partnership's gross income is qualifying income. The entity to which this private letter ruling was issued would appear to operate a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business that is similar to ours.  While this private letter ruling provides some insight into the manner in which the IRS analyzed fertilizer manufacturing activities at the time this ruling was issued, this private letter ruling is specific to a different entity. Thus, the IRS is not bound to follow it in respect of TNCLP, nor may we rely on it as precedent when determining whether we satisfy the MLP 90% gross income test. Any change in the federal income tax treatment of income from fertilizer-related activities as qualifying income could have a material impact on the taxation of the Partnership and could have a material adverse impact on unitholder distributions. We continue to monitor these IRS regulatory activities.

	Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates




	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts, and the most recent information available to us. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate. The following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates.




	Inventory Valuation




	We review our inventory account balances at least quarterly, and more frequently if required by market conditions, to determine whether the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their market value. This review process incorporates current industry and customer-specific trends, current operating plans, historical price activity, and selling prices expected to be realized. If the carrying amount of our inventories exceeds its estimated market value, we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly. Upon inventory liquidation, if the actual sales prices are less than our most recent estimate of market value, additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation. Fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventories but are charged directly to cost of sales in the period incurred.




	Property, Plant and Equipment




	Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets. The useful lives used in computing depreciation and amortization expenses are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us. Useful lives are based on historical experience, manufacturers' or engineering estimates, valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans. We review the useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment on a periodic basis, and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews.

	Table of Contents





	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	Scheduled inspections, replacements and overhauls of machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facility during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds. We account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method, as opposed to the direct expense or built-in overhaul methods. Under the deferral method, expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized in property, plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straight-line basis over the period benefited, which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years. Should the estimated period between turnarounds change, we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period, which would lead to higher depreciation and amortization costs. If we used the direct expense method, turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred. Scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant and equipment include the dismantling, repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping, valves, motors, turbines, pumps, compressors, heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs. Scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shutdown, including required safety inspections, which entail the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers, pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications. Capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented. Internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized. Turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.




	Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets




	We review the carrying values of our property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP in order to assess recoverability. Factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume, selling prices, raw material costs, operating expenses, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates and capital spending. Significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors, which include inherent uncertainties. The factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process. The recoverability of the values associated with our long-lived assets is dependent upon future operating performance. Certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business. Adverse changes in demand for our products, increase in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review. The recoverability and impairment tests of long-lived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

	3—New Accounting Standards


	 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.

















	ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.




	We are exposed to the impact of changes in the price of natural gas which we use in the manufacture of our nitrogen fertilizer products. Because natural gas prices are volatile, we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments.




	The derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options. These contracts settle using NYMEX futures prices, which represent the basis for fair value at any given time. The derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, we had open natural gas derivative contracts for


	29.4 million


	 MMBtus and


	59.6 million


	 MMBtus, respectively. A $1.00 per MMBtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas as of


	December 31, 2016


	 would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions by


	$27.3 million


	, and a $1.00 per MMBtu decrease would change their fair value unfavorably by


	$27.3 million


	.

	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm









	The Partners of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.:




	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (a Limited Partnership) (the Partnership) and subsidiaries as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, and the related consolidated statements of operations, partners' capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended


	December 31, 2016


	. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.




	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. and subsidiaries as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended


	December 31, 2016


	, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.




	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.'s internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	, based on criteria established in


	Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)


	 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated


	February 23, 2017


	 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.

	Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements








	1


	.     Background and Basis of Presentation




	Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. ("TNCLP," "we," "our" or "us") is a Delaware limited partnership that produces nitrogen fertilizer products. Our principal products are anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) and urea ammonium nitrate solutions (UAN), which we manufacture at our facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma.




	We conduct our operations through an operating partnership, Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP or the Operating Partnership, and collectively with TNCLP, the Partnership). Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP or the General Partner), a Delaware corporation, is the general partner of both TNCLP and TNLP and owns a


	0.025%


	 general partner interest in each of TNCLP and TNLP. The General Partner is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF Industries), a Delaware corporation. Ownership of TNCLP is composed of the general partner interests and the limited partner interests. The general partner interest in TNCLP is represented by 4,720 general partner units. Limited partner interests are represented by common units, which are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "TNH" and Class B common units. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had


	18,501,576


	 common units and


	184,072


	 Class B common units issued and outstanding. CF Industries through its subsidiaries owned


	13,889,014


	 common units (representing approximately


	75.1%


	 of the total outstanding common units) and all of the Class B common units as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	We are a master limited partnership (MLP). Partnerships are generally not subject to federal income tax, although publicly traded partnerships (such as TNCLP) are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes (and therefore are subject to federal income tax), unless at least 90% of the partnership's gross income is "qualifying income" as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As we currently satisfy the requirements to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, no federal income taxes are paid by the Partnership.




	On January 19, 2017, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a MLP. For calendar year MLPs, the effective date of the regulations is January 1, 2018. The regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the MLP rules, subject to certain transition provisions. The regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource (including fertilizer) as activities that generate qualifying income, but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizer-related activities. However, the IRS has issued a private letter ruling to a taxpayer in the fertilizer industry unrelated to TNCLP which would indicate that each taxpayer's fertilizer manufacturing activities should produce qualifying income for purposes of determining whether 90% of the partnership's gross income is qualifying income. The entity to which this private letter ruling was issued would appear to operate a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business that is similar to ours.  While this private letter ruling provides some insight into the manner in which the IRS analyzed fertilizer manufacturing activities at the time this ruling was issued, this private letter ruling is specific to a different entity. Thus, the IRS is not bound to follow it in respect of TNCLP, nor may we rely on it as precedent when determining whether we satisfy the MLP 90% gross income test. Any change in the federal income tax treatment of income from fertilizer-related activities as qualifying income could have a material impact on the taxation of the Partnership and could have a material adverse impact on unitholder distributions. We continue to monitor these IRS regulatory activities.




	Throughout this document, references to "affiliates of the General Partner" refer to the consolidated subsidiaries of CF Industries, including TNGP.




	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).

	.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




	Consolidation




	The consolidated financial statements of TNCLP and the accompanying notes include the accounts of the Partnership. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Income is allocated to the General Partner and the limited partners of TNCLP (Limited Partners) in accordance with the provisions of the TNCLP agreement of limited partnership that provides for allocations of income between the Limited Partners and the General Partner in the same proportion as cash distributions declared during the year.

	Table of Contents





	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	Use of Estimates




	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to, net realizable value of inventories, environmental remediation liabilities, environmental and litigation contingencies, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, the assumptions used in the evaluation of potential impairments of property, plant and equipment and the allowances for doubtful accounts receivable.




	Revenue Recognition




	The basic criteria necessary for revenue recognition are: 1) evidence that a sales arrangement exists, 2) delivery of goods has occurred, 3) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and 4) collectability is reasonably assured. The title and risk of loss passes to an affiliate of the General Partner as the product is shipped from the plant gate. We recognize revenue when these criteria have been met and when title and risk of loss have been transferred to an affiliate of the General Partner.




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.




	Due to/from Affiliates of the General Partner




	We receive cash and make expenditures directly from our cash accounts. Because we sell our products to and receive payroll and other related services from affiliates of the General Partner, the affiliates of the General Partner continue to be both debtors and creditors to us.




	Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts




	Accounts receivable are recorded at face amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is an estimate based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions, and a review of the current status of each customer's trade accounts receivable. A receivable is past due if payments have not been received within the agreed upon invoice terms. Account balances are charged-off against the allowance when management determines that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.




	Inventories




	Inventories are reported at the lower of cost or market and are determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) and average cost basis. Inventories include the cost of materials, production labor and production overhead. Market value is reviewed quarterly. Fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventories but are charged directly to cost of sales.




	Property, Plant and Equipment




	Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimate useful life of the property, plant and equipment. Useful lives for property, plant, and equipment range from


	10


	 to


	40 years


	 for buildings and


	5


	 to


	30 years


	 for machinery and equipment. We periodically review these useful lives and change the estimates to reflect the results of those reviews.




	Scheduled inspections, replacements and overhauls of machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facility are referred to as plant turnarounds. Plant turnarounds are accounted for under the deferral method, as opposed to the direct expense or built-in overhaul methods. Under the deferral method, expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straight-line basis over the period benefited, which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to


	5 years


	. If the direct expense method were used, all turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred. Internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized. Turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. For additional information, see Note 


	9—Property, Plant and Equipment—Net


	.

	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets




	We review property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets in order to assess recoverability based on expected future undiscounted cash flows whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.




	Leases




	Leases are classified as either operating leases or capital leases. Assets acquired under capital leases are depreciated on the same basis as property, plant and equipment. We currently do not have any capital leases. Rental payments, including rent holidays, leasehold incentives, and scheduled rent increases, if any, are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.




	Income Taxes




	As a partnership, we are not subject to income taxes. For additional information, see Note


	1—Background and Basis of Presentation


	. The income tax liability of the individual partners is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.




	Derivative Financial Instruments




	Natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia and UAN. We manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments. The derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter markets. These derivatives reference NYMEX futures contract prices, which represent the basis for fair value at any given time. The derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We have elected to not apply hedge accounting to our derivatives; as a result, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in cost of goods sold on our consolidated statements of operations.




	Derivatives are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. For additional information on derivatives, see Note 


	7—Derivative Financial Instruments


	.




	Asset Retirement Obligations




	Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets. AROs are initially recognized as liabilities as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value. When initially recognized, the fair value based on discounted future cash flows is recorded both as a liability and an increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. In subsequent periods, depreciation of the asset and accretion of the liability are recorded. For additional information on AROs, see Note 


	11—Asset Retirement Obligations


	.




	Environmental




	Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that increase the capacity or extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety or efficiency of the operations, or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized. Liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred, the costs can be reasonably estimated, and the liability would not be discounted.




	Litigation




	From time to time, the Partnership is subject to ordinary, routine legal proceedings related to the usual conduct of its business. From time to time, the Partnership also is involved in legal proceedings regarding public utility and transportation rates, environmental matters, taxes and permits relating to the operations of its plant and facilities. Accruals for such contingencies are recorded to the extent management concludes their occurrence is probable and the financial impact of an adverse outcome is reasonably estimable. Disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided if the likelihood of occurrence is at least reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, many factors are considered. These factors include, but are not limited to, past history, scientific and other evidence, and the specifics and status of each matter. If the assessment of various factors changes, the estimates may change. Predicting the outcome of claims and litigation, and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals. Legal fees are

	expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general, and administrative services provided by affiliates of the General Partner on our consolidated statements of operations.

	In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes the lease accounting requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 840, Leases. This ASU will require lessees to recognize the rights and obligations resulting from virtually all leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease) on their balance sheets as right-of-use assets with corresponding lease liabilities. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and requires the modified retrospective method of adoption. We expect the adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.




	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (an update to Topic 330, Inventory), effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU No. 2015-11 changes the inventory measurement principle for entities using the FIFO or average cost methods. For entities utilizing one of these methods, the inventory measurement principle will change from lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. We use the FIFO and average cost methods and expect the adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.




	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments. Additionally, information concerning the costs to obtain and fulfill a contract, including assets to be recognized, is to be capitalized and disclosed. In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of this ASU through the issuance of ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, to December 15, 2017 for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date. Early adoption of the standard as of December 15, 2016 (for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date) is permitted by the FASB. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the Amendment to the General and Administrative Services and Product Offtake Agreement (the Services and Offtake Agreement), through which we sell all of our fertilizer products to affiliates of the General Partner, and the related impact on our consolidated financial statements.

	.     Agreement of Limited Partnership




	Ownership of TNCLP is composed of the general partner interests and the limited partner interests (see Note


	1—Background and Basis of Presentation


	). Holders of common units and Class B common units do not have preemptive rights. Holders of common units are entitled to one vote per common unit with respect to each matter on which holders of common units are entitled to vote. The Class B common units have no voting rights on any matter. Unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management's decisions regarding our business. Unitholders have no right to elect the General Partner or the TNGP Board of Directors on an annual or other continuing basis. Furthermore, the General Partner may only be removed by a vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding common units, including any common units held by the General Partner and its affiliates (including CF Industries). Given that the General Partner and its affiliates own approximately 75.1% of our outstanding common units, holders of our publicly-traded common units are not able to remove the General Partner under any circumstances.




	We make quarterly distributions to holders of our general partner interest and limited partner interests based on Available Cash for the quarter as defined in our agreement of limited partnership. Available Cash is defined generally as all cash receipts less all cash disbursements, less certain reserves (including reserves for future operating and capital needs) established as the General Partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary or appropriate. Changes in working capital affect Available Cash as changes in the amount of cash invested in working capital items (such as increases in inventory and decreases in accounts payable) reduce Available Cash, while declines in the amount of cash invested in working capital items increase Available Cash. We declared and paid distributions of


	$257.5 million


	,


	$294.8 million


	 and


	$304.1 million


	 to our unitholders in


	2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, respectively.




	We receive


	99%


	 of the Operating Partnership's Available Cash (as defined in the Operating Partnership's agreement of limited partnership) and


	1%


	 of the Operating Partnership's Available Cash is distributed by the Operating Partnership to the

	Table of Contents





	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	General Partner and its affiliates. Pursuant to our agreement of limited partnership, distributions of our Available Cash are made


	99.975%


	 to common and Class B common unitholders and


	0.025%


	 to the General Partner except that the General Partner is entitled, as an incentive, to a larger percentage of our distribution of Available Cash to the extent that cumulative distributions of Available Cash exceed specified target levels above the Minimum Quarterly Distributions (MQD) of


	$0.605


	 per unit. The General Partner has assigned its right to receive such incentive distributions to an affiliate of the General Partner.




	On


	February 6, 2017


	, we announced a

	.     Derivative Financial Instruments




	Derivative financial instruments are executed on our behalf by an affiliate of the General Partner to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices for natural gas. Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based fertilizers.




	The derivatives that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. The derivative contract prices are based on NYMEX future prices based on physical delivery of natural gas at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, the most common and financially liquid location of reference for derivative financial instruments related to natural gas. However, we purchase natural gas for our manufacturing facility from suppliers whose prices are based primarily on the ONEOK index (based on physical delivery of natural gas in Oklahoma, rather than at the Henry Hub). This creates a location basis differential between the derivative contract price and the price we pay for physical delivery of natural gas. Accordingly, the prices underlying the derivative financial instruments we use may not exactly match the prices of natural gas we purchase and consume. We enter into natural gas derivative contracts with respect to gas to be consumed by us in the future, and settlements of those derivative contracts are scheduled to coincide with our anticipated purchases of natural gas used to manufacture nitrogen products during those future periods. We use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting.




	We report derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in cost of goods sold in the period of change. Cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities.




	The gross fair values of derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets are shown below. All balance sheet amounts from derivatives arise from natural gas derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. For additional information on derivative fair values, see Note

	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, we had open natural gas derivative contracts for


	29.4 million


	 MMBtus of natural gas and


	59.6 million


	 MMBtus of natural gas, respectively. The derivative portfolio includes natural gas derivatives that hedge a portion of anticipated natural gas purchases through December 2018. For the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, we used derivatives to cover approximately


	74%


	 of our natural gas consumption.




	The counterparties to our derivative contracts are multinational commercial banks, major financial institutions and large energy companies. The derivatives are executed with several counterparties, generally under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements. The ISDA agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for OTC derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk, in part, by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff, the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement. These rights are described further below:















	•






	Settlement netting generally allows the parties to net, into a single net payable or receivable, ordinary settlement obligations arising under the ISDA agreement on the same day, in the same currency, for the same types of derivative instruments, and through the same pairing of offices.
















	•






	Close-out netting rights are provided in the event of a default or other termination event (as defined in the ISDA agreements), including bankruptcy. Depending on the cause of early termination, the non-defaulting party may elect to terminate all or some transactions outstanding under the ISDA agreement. The values of all terminated transactions and certain other payments under the ISDA agreement are netted, resulting in a single net close-out amount payable to or by the non-defaulting party. Termination values may be determined using a mark-to-market approach or based on a party's good faith estimate of its loss. If the final net close-out amount is payable by the non-defaulting party, that party's obligation to make the payment may be conditioned on factors such as the termination of all derivative transactions between the parties or payment in full of all of the defaulting party's obligations to the non-defaulting party, in each case regardless of whether arising under the ISDA agreement or otherwise.
















	•






	Setoff rights are provided by certain of the ISDA agreements and generally allow a non-defaulting party to elect to set off, against the final net close-out payment, other matured and contingent amounts payable between the parties under the ISDA agreement or otherwise. Typically, these setoff rights arise upon the early termination of all transactions outstanding under an ISDA agreement following a default or specified termination event.

	Most of the ISDA agreements contain credit-risk-related contingent features such as cross-default provisions and credit support thresholds that are dependent upon the credit ratings of the General Partner affiliate. In the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade of the General Partner affiliate, the counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require the General Partner affiliate to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position. The General Partner affiliate’s revolving credit agreement, at any time when it is secured, provides a cross collateral feature for those derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to, or affiliates of parties to, the revolving credit agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives. In the event the General Partner Affiliate's revolving credit agreement becomes unsecured, the General Partner affiliate could be required to post separate collateral in connection with such derivatives. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, the aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in net liability positions was


	$1.6 million


	 and


	$27.9 million


	, respectively, which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of assets needed to settle the obligations if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered and the General Partner affiliate was unable to post collateral at the reporting dates. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, we and the General Partner affiliate had


	no


	 cash collateral on deposit for derivative contracts. The credit support documents executed in connection with certain ISDA agreements generally provide the General Partner affiliate and the counterparties the right to set off collateral against amounts owing under the ISDA agreements upon the occurrence of a default or a specified termination event.

	Cash Equivalents




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market mutual funds that invest in U.S. treasuries and direct investments in U.S. treasuries.




	Natural Gas Derivatives




	The derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options traded in the OTC markets with multi-national commercial banks, other major financial institutions and large energy companies. The derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods. These contracts settle using NYMEX futures prices and accordingly, to determine the fair value of these instruments, we use quoted market prices from NYMEX and standard pricing models with inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as forward curves supplied by an industry-recognized unrelated third party. See Note 


	7—Derivative Financial Instruments


	 for additional information.




	Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis




	We also have assets that may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. These include long-lived assets that may be written down to fair value as a result of impairment. We determined that these fair value measurements rely primarily on Partnership-specific inputs and the Partnership's assumptions about the use of the assets. Since certain of the assumptions would involve inputs that are not observable, these fair values would reside within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

	.   Related Party Transactions




	TNCLP and TNGP have no employees. We have entered into several agreements with a subsidiary of CF Industries relating to the operation of our business and the sale of the fertilizer products produced at our Verdigris facility. We believe that each of these agreements is on terms that are fair and reasonable to us.




	Services and Offtake Agreement




	Pursuant to the Services and Offtake Agreement, the Partnership sells all of its fertilizer products to affiliates of the General Partner at prices based on market prices for the Partnership's fertilizer products as defined in the Services and Offtake Agreement. Title and risk of loss transfer to affiliates of the General Partner as the product is shipped from the plant gate. The Services and Offtake Agreement was effective initially for a one-year term and is extended automatically for successive


	one


	-year terms unless terminated by one of the parties prior to renewal.




	Directly Incurred Charges




	Since we have no employees, we rely on employees from an affiliate of the General Partner to operate our Verdigris facility. As a result, the payroll, payroll-related expenses and benefit costs, such as health insurance and pension costs, are incurred by an affiliate of the General Partner and directly charged to us. Payroll, payroll-related expenses and other employee-related benefit costs directly charged to us for the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	 were


	$27.9 million


	,


	$27.9 million


	 and


	$24.0 million


	, respectively. We report these expenses as services provided by affiliates of the General Partner in cost of goods sold.




	Allocated Charges




	CF Industries, together with its affiliates, also provides certain services to us under the Services and Offtake Agreement. These services include production planning, manufacturing management, logistics, procurement, accounting, legal, risk management, investor relations and other general and administrative functions. Allocated expenses charged to us for the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	 were


	$15.7 million


	,


	$15.7 million


	 and


	$15.6 million


	, respectively. We report these expenses as selling, general and administrative services provided by affiliates of the General Partner.




	Amounts Due to/from Affiliates of the General Partner




	We receive cash and make expenditures directly from our cash accounts. Because we sell our products to and receive payroll and other related services from affiliates of the General Partner, the affiliates of the General Partner continue to be both debtors and creditors to us. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, we had a net balance due (to)/from affiliates of the General Partner of


	$(0.1) million


	 and


	$5.9 million


	, respectively.




	Spare Parts Sharing Agreement




	Affiliates of CF Industries own and operate nitrogen fertilizer complexes that utilize some equipment that is similar to equipment at our Verdigris nitrogen complex. Each of the various manufacturing complexes maintains spare parts for use in its facilities. In the event that an unplanned need arises and to help minimize manufacturing downtime, we have entered into a spare parts sharing agreement with affiliates of CF Industries that permits spare parts to be shared among the manufacturing complexes from time to time. Parts that are borrowed from another complex under the agreement are either refurbished and returned to the lender or replaced.




	Leases




	We entered into an amended and restated lease with an affiliate of the General Partner under which the ammonia assets in our terminal in Blair, Nebraska are leased by the affiliate. The lease is effective for a


	five


	-year term ending on December 31, 2018, and the affiliate of the General Partner has options to renew for


	three


	 additional


	five


	-year terms. The quarterly lease payment is


	$100,000


	, subject to an annual inflation adjustment, and additional rent will be paid equal to all costs, expenses, and obligations incurred by the affiliate of the General Partner related to the use, occupancy and operation of the terminal.




	We also have leased certain of our rail cars to an affiliate of the General Partner for quarterly rental payments of


	$3,600


	 per car. This lease was effective initially for a


	one


	-year term and is extended automatically for successive


	one


	-year terms unless terminated by either party thereto prior to renewal.




	We recognized rental income related to the above lease agreements for the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	 of


	$0.6 million


	, which is reflected in other income from an affiliate of the General Partner in our consolidated statements of operations.

	.   Asset Retirement Obligations




	Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets. AROs are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value. We have unrecorded AROs at our Verdigris facility that are conditional upon cessation of operations. These AROs include certain decommissioning and pond closure activities, and the removal and disposal of certain chemicals, waste materials, structures, equipment, vessels, piping and storage tanks. The most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these AROs expressed in


	2016


	 dollars is


	$4.1 million


	. We have not recorded a liability for these conditional AROs as of


	December 31, 2016


	 because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at this facility, which is necessary in order to estimate fair value. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the historical performance of the facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance, asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment, which if conducted as in the past, can extend the physical lives of the facility indefinitely. We also considered the possibility of changes in technology, risk of obsolescence, and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion.








	12


	.   Commitments




	The Operating Partnership is committed to various non-cancelable operating leases for land, buildings and equipment. Total minimum rental payments for operating leases are insignificant for


	2017


	.




	Rent expense under non-cancelable operating leases for years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	 was insignificant.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had commitments of approximately


	$26.3 million


	 related to firm quantities of gas and open purchase orders. The natural gas commitments are based on a firm quantity of natural gas at market prices. These natural gas commitments are priced at the beginning of the month of the scheduled activity. We have the option to receive and use the natural gas in our manufacturing operations or we can sell the committed natural gas at current market prices, which may be different than the price that we pay for the natural gas.

	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.










	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm









	The Partners of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.:




	We have audited Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.'s (a Limited Partnership) (the Partnership) internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	, based on criteria established in


	Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)


	 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Partnership's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.




	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.




	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.




	In our opinion, Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	, based on criteria established in


	Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)


	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).




	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. and subsidiaries as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, and the related consolidated statements of operations, partners' capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended


	December 31, 2016


	, and our report dated


	February 23, 2017


	 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

	The TNGP Board of Directors has determined that the above mentioned policy has been implemented appropriately when, and has been effective in, determining the qualifications of potential director candidates to the TNGP Board of Directors.




	The current Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter was adopted by the TNGP Board of Directors on October 27, 2015, and is reviewed annually by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. A copy can be viewed on CF Industries' Internet website at www.cfindustries.com by selecting "Investors" and "Terra Nitrogen Investors" and "IR Menu' and "Corporate Profile" and "Governance Documents." The charter is also available in print upon request as described in Item 1, Business—Overview, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.




	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance




	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) requires the Partnership's executive officers, directors and greater than 10 percent beneficial owners to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership with the SEC and the NYSE. TNCLP and the Operating Partnership have no executive officers, directors, or employees. Therefore, the executive officers and directors of TNGP are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Partnership with copies of reports of ownership and changes in ownership of our common units they file. Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms furnished to the Partnership and written representations from TNGP's executive officers and directors, we believe all of the Partnership's officers, directors and greater than 10 percent beneficial owners made all required filings during and with respect to


	2016


	 in a timely manner.

	Corporate Governance Matters




	TNGP has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which meet the requirements of the NYSE. Because TNGP is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CF Industries whose officers are all officers of CF Industries, the CF Industries' Code of Corporate Conduct applies to TNGP's executive officers (including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer) and other officers. In addition, the CF Industries Code of Corporate Conduct applies to TNGP's non-management directors in the same fashion as it applies to CF Industries' non-management directors. The CF Industries Code of Corporate Conduct also meets the requirements of the NYSE. A copy of the General Partner's Corporate Governance Guidelines and CF Industries' Code of Corporate Conduct can be viewed on CF Industries' Internet website at www.cfindustries.com by selecting "Investors" and "Terra Nitrogen Investors" and "IR Menu" and "Corporate Profile" and "Governance Documents." A copy of each is also available in print upon request by following the directions contained in Item 1, Business—Overview, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We intend to disclose on CF Industries' Internet website any amendment to any provision of the CF Industries Code of Corporate Conduct that relates to any element of the definition of "code of ethics" enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act and any waiver from any such provision granted to TNGP's principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions.




	The TNGP Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that Messrs. Bailey and Jackson, and Ms. Lloyd each meet the criteria for independence required by the NYSE listing standards. Following its evaluation, the TNGP Board of Directors concluded that none of these directors were involved in any transaction, relationship or arrangement not otherwise disclosed that would impair his or her independence.




	During


	2016


	, in accordance with the General Partner's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the independent directors met at regularly scheduled executive sessions of the TNGP Board of Directors without management or management directors. The executive sessions are held at TNGP Board of Directors meetings and the independent directors choose one of the independent directors to lead the discussion and preside at each such meeting.




	Communication




	Interested parties who wish to communicate a message to the TNGP Board of Directors, the independent directors, or any committee may do so by contacting Ms. Anne H. Lloyd, Chairman of the Audit Committee, Terra Nitrogen GP Inc., 4 Parkway North, Suite 400, Deerfield, IL 60015-2590.

	ITEM 11.    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.




	Compensation Discussion and Analysis




	We do not have any executive officers or employees. Instead, we are managed by the General Partner, TNGP, the executive officers of which are officers of CF Industries or its subsidiaries. CF Industries indirectly owns approximately 75.1% of the outstanding common units and all of the outstanding Class B common units representing our limited partnership interests and CF Industries is also the indirect 100% owner of TNGP. The executive officers of TNGP are provided compensation and benefits directly from subsidiaries of CF Industries. The compensation committee of the Board of Directors of CF Industries is responsible for the compensation decisions relating to the executive officers of TNGP. The TNGP Board of Directors does not have a compensation committee and does not make any decisions with respect to the compensation of TNGP's executive officers. For more discussion regarding the compensation provided to the executive officers of TNGP by CF Industries, see the Schedule 14A definitive proxy statement of CF Industries, which will be filed with the SEC when available (the Proxy Statement).




	Since neither TNCLP nor TNGP provides any compensation directly to TNGP's executive officers and neither has any involvement in determining their compensation, we have concluded that a discussion of the compensation awarded to, earned by and paid to TNGP's named executive officers, as contemplated by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K, would not be meaningful. Therefore, our Compensation Discussion and Analysis does not resemble that of most public companies. Instead, we think it is more meaningful to describe the arrangement pursuant to which we receive services from CF Industries.




	Since we have no executive officers or employees, all employment-related functions, including production planning, manufacturing management, logistics, accounting, legal, risk management, investor relations and other general and administrative functions are provided to us by employees of subsidiaries of CF Industries.




	We reimburse subsidiaries of CF Industries for a portion of the compensation expenses incurred with respect to TNGP's executive officers and other employees of CF Industries and its affiliates who provide services to us. Compensation expenses for production and manufacturing services are charged directly to us based on actual costs. Compensation expenses for selling, general and administrative related functions, including the compensation of the TNGP's executive officers, are reimbursed based on a quarterly fixed fee arrangement.




	Further discussion of our arrangements with subsidiaries of CF Industries can be found in Note 


	10—Related Party Transactions


	, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.








	Compensation Committee Report




	TNCLP has no directors or executive officers and the TNGP Board of Directors serves as TNCLP's governing body. TNGP does not have a compensation committee. Therefore, the full TNGP Board of Directors reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with TNGP's management. Based on such review and discussions, the TNGP Board of Directors recommended that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in TNCLP's Annual Report on Form 10-K.

	SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE




	Pursuant to the SEC's executive compensation disclosure rules, a required table may be omitted if there has been no compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to any named executive officer that is required to be reported in that table. Therefore, we have not included a Summary Compensation Table or any other table regarding compensation paid to named executive officers, because we have no employees, and, as such, no compensation was paid to any named executive officer by either TNGP or us during


	2016

	This column represents the fair value under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 718, Stock Compensation, with respect to TNCLP phantom units granted to each director in


	2016


	, including additional phantom units received in connection with quarterly distributions to TNCLP common unitholders during the year on phantom units held by the director. The phantom unit awards granted to directors in


	2016


	 will settle in cash based upon the average closing price per common unit for the 20-trading-day period that immediately precedes the vesting date (unless deferred pursuant to the terms of the TNGP Phantom Unit Program). Additional information with respect to the TNGP Phantom Unit Program is set forth below under "Director Phantom Unit Awards."







	Director Fees Paid in Cash




	In


	2016


	, each non-employee director of the TNGP Board of Directors received an annual retainer of $50,000 (paid quarterly). We do not pay meeting fees to our non-employee directors. Ms. Lloyd received an additional annual cash retainer of $10,000 (paid quarterly) for serving as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Mr. Bailey received an additional annual cash retainer of $2,500 (paid quarterly) for serving as Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. In


	2016


	, Messrs. Barnard, Bohn, Kelleher and Hoker served on the TNGP Board of Directors and were employees of CF Industries, and therefore receive no additional compensation for serving on the TNGP Board of Directors.




	The TNGP Board of Directors recently determined to revise the compensation of non-employee directors for 2017. Effective January 1, 2017, each non-employee of the TNGP Board of Directors will receive an annual retainer of $60,000 (paid quarterly). The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be entitled to an additional annual cash retainer of $10,000 (paid quarterly) and the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will be entitled to an additional annual cash retainer of $2,500 (paid quarterly).




	Director Ownership Guidelines




	The TNGP Board of Directors has established a minimum ownership guideline for non-employee directors of 2,000 common units (the Ownership Guide). Newly elected directors have a period of five years to satisfy the Ownership Guide. The Ownership Guide may be satisfied by ownership of common units, accrual of phantom units under TNGP Board of Directors-approved compensation programs or any combination of the two.




	Director Phantom Unit Awards




	Non-employee directors of the TNGP Board of Directors receive compensation in the form of TNCLP phantom units. A phantom unit entitles the holder to a cash payment equal to the value of a TNCLP common unit at the time of vesting. In addition, each phantom unit entitles the holder to additional phantom units when quarterly cash distributions are made to TNCLP common unitholders. Non-employee directors receive an annual award of a number of phantom units determined by dividing a value fixed by the TNGP Board of Directors by the average month-end closing price of TNCLP common units for the six-month period preceding the date of grant. Starting in 2012, the grant date value of the annual award was fixed at $90,000. The annual awards are granted upon the first meeting of the TNGP Board of Directors each year.




	The annual awards are governed by the Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. Non-Employee Director Phantom Unit and Deferred Compensation Plan (the TNGP Phantom Unit Program). Each phantom unit granted pursuant to the TNGP Phantom Unit Program is unvested on the date of grant. For grants made prior to 2015, each phantom unit vested automatically on the first anniversary of the grant date, provided that the director continued to serve on the TNGP Board of Directors through such date. For grants made during or after 2015, each phantom unit vests automatically on the earlier of (i) a director's separation from service that is other than a removal for cause or (ii) the date of the first meeting of the TNGP Board of Directors of the calendar year following the date of grant of the award. Unless a director elected to defer phantom units (as described below), upon

	Table of Contents





	TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.








	vesting, the director will receive a cash payment in respect of the phantom units (including any additional phantom units received in connection with quarterly distributions to TNCLP common unitholders following the date of grant). The amount paid with respect to each such phantom unit will be equal to the average closing price per common unit for the 20-trading-day period immediately preceding the vesting date.




	Under the TNGP Phantom Unit Program, directors may elect to defer receipt of phantom units granted pursuant to the TNGP Phantom Unit Program. Each non-employee director may elect in writing, prior to December 31 of any year, to defer receipt of payment with respect to all or a portion (but not less than 25%) of phantom units that may be awarded during the following year. Phantom units (including any additional phantom units received in connection with quarterly distributions to TNCLP common unitholders following the date of the grant) that a non-employee director elects to defer are credited to an unfunded deferred compensation account. Deferred phantom units are generally required to be held in an unfunded deferred compensation account until the date of the director's departure from the TNGP Board of Directors. Pursuant to the terms of the TNGP Phantom Unit Program, amounts credited to a director's deferred compensation account shall be deemed to be invested in TNCLP common units or in such form of alternative unit as the director designates from among the options made available from time to time by TNGP. Upon departure, the deferred compensation account value is paid out in cash based on the average closing price of TNCLP common units or alternative unit, as applicable, for the 20-trading-day period immediately following departure. However, in the event of a sale of TNCLP (including by merger or other corporate transaction) or a sale of substantially all of TNCLP's assets, the value of deferred phantom units will be paid in a lump sum upon consummation of the transaction.




	In 2005, the TNGP Board of Directors adopted a phantom unit program (the 2005 Phantom Unit Program) which entitled each non-employee director of TNGP to an annual grant of 1,250 TNLP phantom units. All phantom unit awards granted pursuant to the 2005 Phantom Unit Program are generally required to be held in an unfunded deferred compensation account until the date of the director's departure from the TNGP Board of Directors. Amounts credited to a director's deferred compensation account shall be deemed to be invested in TNCLP common units or in such form of alternative unit as the director designates from among the options made available from time to time by TNGP. Upon departure, the deferred compensation account value is paid out in cash based on the average closing price of TNCLP common units or alternative units, as applicable, for the 20-trading-day period immediately following departure. However, in the event of a sale of TNCLP (including by merger or other corporate transaction) or a sale of substantially all of TNCLP's assets, the value of the deferred phantom units will be paid in a lump sum upon consummation of the transaction.




	The following table sets forth the number of phantom units held by each non-employee director as of


	February 16, 2017


	, and awards vested in

	Other Director Compensation




	TNGP reimburses all directors for reasonable travel and other necessary business expenses incurred in the performance of their services for TNGP and TNCLP. Non-employee directors do not receive any additional payments or perquisites.




	Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation




	TNGP does not have a compensation committee. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of CF Industries has made executive officer compensation decisions with respect to those TNGP executive officers who are also key employees of CF Industries. The Compensation Committee of CF Industries is composed of the directors named as signatories to the "Report on Executive Compensation" as set forth in CF Industries' Proxy Statement. No such director has any direct or indirect material interest in or relationship with TNGP other than as related to his or her position as a director of CF Industries. During


	2016


	, no officer of TNGP served on the board of directors of any other entity, where any officer or director of such other entity also served on the TNGP Board of Directors or CF Industries' Compensation Committee. None of the members of CF Industries' Compensation Committee are employees of CF Industries or its subsidiaries.

	In connection with its resolution of any conflict of interest, the General Partner may consider:















	•






	the relative interests of any party involved in such conflict or affected by such action, agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interest;

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.'s ("TNCLP," "we," "our" or "us") annual consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 23, 2017 (2016 Annual Report), as well as our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes thereto contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. The section entitled "Risk Factors" contained in Item 1A of our 2016 Annual Report, and similar discussions in our other SEC filings, describe some of the important risk factors that may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity. You should read and consider carefully those risks, in addition to the other information in this report and in our other filings with the SEC. Company Overview TNCLP is a Delaware limited partnership that produces nitrogen fertilizer products. Our principal products are anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) and urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN), which we manufacture at our facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma. We conduct our operations through an operating partnership, Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP or the Operating Partnership, and collectively with TNCLP, the Partnership). Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP or the General Partner), a Delaware corporation, is the general partner of both TNCLP and TNLP and owns a 0.025% general partner interest in each of TNCLP and TNLP. The General Partner is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF Industries), a Delaware corporation. Throughout this document, the term "affiliates of the General Partner" refers to consolidated subsidiaries of CF Industries, including TNGP. CF Industries, through its subsidiaries, is a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of nitrogen products, serving both agricultural and industrial customers. CF Industries operates world-class nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and distributes plant nutrients through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States. We are dependent on CF Industries for our success in a number of respects. TNCLP and TNGP have no employees. Affiliates of the General Partner provide certain services to us under the Amendment to the General and Administrative Services and Product Offtake Agreement (the Services and Offtake Agreement). Pursuant to the Services and Offtake Agreement, the Partnership sells all of its fertilizer products to affiliates of the General Partner at prices based on market prices for the Partnership's fertilizer products as defined in the Services and Offtake Agreement. Title and risk of loss transfer to affiliates of the General Partner as the product is shipped from the plant gate. Under the Services and Offtake Agreement, affiliates of the General Partner provide certain services to us, including production planning, manufacturing management, logistics, procurement, accounting, legal, risk management, investor relations and other general and administrative services. For additional information concerning CF Industries, refer to CF Industries' filings with the SEC on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, and for further information regarding our agreements with CF Industries and the General Partner, see Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9-Related Party Transactions. Nitrogen Fertilizer Market Conditions Our products are global commodities and are subject to price competition. The customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. The selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions and changes in supply and demand. Over the past decade, strong demand, high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen production facilities, which resulted in an increase in global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity. As a result, global nitrogen fertilizer supply increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand, creating the current global oversupply in the market, and leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices. A significant amount of new nitrogen production capacity came on line in 2016, and additional production capacity is expected to come on line in 2017, including a significant increase in production capacity in North America. This new nitrogen production capacity includes the capacity expansion projects that were completed in 2016 by affiliates of our General Partner. The new nitrogen production capacity will further increase supply. We expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line.  TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.  The first quarter of 2017 was significantly impacted by lower selling prices. Our average selling prices for ammonia and UAN declined by 23% and 24%, respectively, during the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016, which reduced both our net sales and gross margin in the first quarter of 2017 by $36.9 million.   Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 2017 vs. 2016 (in millions, except as noted) Net sales $ 119.0 $ 108.0 $ 11.0 10 % Cost of goods sold 72.4 64.9 7.5 12 % Gross margin 46.6 43.1 3.5 8 % Gross margin percentage 39.2 % 39.9 % (0.7 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 4.4 5.4 (1.0 ) (19 )% Net earnings $ 42.2 $ 37.7 $ 4.5 12 % Net earnings allocable to common units $ 38.8 $ 26.7 $ 12.1 45 % Net earnings per common unit (dollars per common unit) $ 2.10 $ 1.44 $ 0.66 46 % Sales volume (tons in thousands): Ammonia 127 91 36 40 % UAN(1) 532 362 170 47 % Total 659 453 206 45 % Average selling prices (dollars per ton): Ammonia $ 286 $ 373 $ (87 ) (23 )% UAN(1) $ 154 $ 203 $ (49 ) (24 )% Cost of natural gas (dollars per MMBtu): Purchased natural gas costs(2) $ 3.06 $ 1.99 $ 1.07 54 % Realized derivatives (gain) loss(3) (0.03 ) 0.89 (0.92 ) N/M Cost of natural gas $ 3.03 $ 2.88 $ 0.15 5 % Production volume by product (tons in thousands): Ammonia(4) 327 208 119 57 % UAN(1) 518 325 193 59 % _______________________________________________________________________________ N/M - Not Meaningful  (1) The nitrogen content of UAN is 32% by weight.

Excludes unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on natural gas derivatives.  (4) Gross ammonia production, including amounts subsequently upgraded on-site into UAN.  First Quarter of 2017 Compared to the First Quarter of 2016 Our net sales for the first quarter of 2017 were $119.0 million, an increase of $11.0 million, or 10%, from the first quarter of 2016 net sales of $108.0 million. The increase was primarily due to higher UAN and ammonia sales volume in the first quarter of 2017 versus the first quarter of 2016 due to higher production in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 as a result of an unplanned outage in one of our ammonia and UAN plants in the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, favorable spring weather conditions in the southern United States caused earlier demand for our products. The increase in volume was partially offset by lower average selling prices for both UAN and ammonia.  TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.  of 2017 relative to the lower production in the prior-year period as a result of the unplanned outage in the first quarter of 2016. UAN selling prices declined by 24% from $203 per ton in the first quarter of 2016 to $154 per ton in the first quarter of 2017 due to the global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer products.   Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 2017 vs. 2016 (in millions, except per ton amounts) Realized natural gas costs $ 34.3 $ 23.9 $ 10.4 44 % Unrealized mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives 7.9 2.3 5.6 N/M Payroll-related expenses 7.0 7.2 (0.2 ) (3 )% Other 23.2 31.5 (8.3 ) (26 )% Total cost of goods sold $ 72.4 $ 64.9 $ 7.5 12 % Average cost of goods sold per ton $ 110 $ 143 $ (33 ) (23 )% ______________________________________________________________________________ N/M - Not Meaningful  TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.

We had previously estimated that this turnaround would occur in late 2017, but the turnaround has been delayed due to a delay in receiving certain equipment. The turnaround will result in lower ammonia and UAN production, lower sales and lower profitability during the period of the turnaround, which will reduce Available Cash for distributions to unitholders. We expect this turnaround will cost approximately $40 million, and the calculation of Available Cash for the three months ended March 31, 2017 included a reserve of approximately one-half of this amount.

When not more than 25% of the issued and outstanding common units are held by persons other than the General Partner and its affiliates (collectively, non-affiliated persons), as was the case at March 31, 2017, we, at the General Partner's sole discretion, may call, or assign to the General Partner or its affiliates, our right to acquire all, but not less than all, such outstanding common units held by non-affiliated persons. If the General Partner elects to acquire all outstanding common units, we are required to give at least 30 but not more than 60 days' notice of our decision to purchase the outstanding common units, and the purchase price per unit would be the greater of (1) the average of the previous 20 trading days' closing prices as of the  TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.  date five days before the purchase is announced or (2) the highest price paid by the General Partner or any of its affiliates for any unit within the 90 days preceding the date the purchase is announced.

An affiliate of the General Partner provides certain services to us under the Amendment to the General and Administrative Services and Product Offtake Agreement (the Services and Offtake Agreement). Pursuant to the Services and Offtake Agreement, the Partnership sells all of its fertilizer products to affiliates of the General Partner at prices based on market prices for the Partnership's fertilizer products as defined in the Services and Offtake Agreement. Title and risk of loss transfer to affiliates of the General Partner as the product is shipped from the plant gate. For further information regarding our agreements with CF Industries and the General Partner, see Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9-Related Party Transactions. Nitrogen Fertilizer Market Conditions Our products are global commodities and are subject to price competition. The customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. The selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions and changes in supply and demand. In the current environment, global nitrogen fertilizer supply has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand, creating the current global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer and leading to lower selling prices. The third quarter and first nine months of 2016 were significantly impacted by declining selling prices. Our average selling prices for ammonia and UAN declined by 35% and 33%, respectively, during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015, which reduced both our net sales and gross margin in the third quarter of 2016 by $45.2 million. During the first nine months of 2016, our average selling prices for ammonia and UAN declined by 29% and 24%, respectively, which reduced both our net sales and gross margin in the first nine months of 2016 by $114.9 million.  TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.  Over the past several years, strong demand, high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen production facilities, which resulted in an increase in global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity and the current surplus of supply in the market. Global investment in nitrogen production facilities includes the capacity expansion projects that are being completed by affiliates of our General Partner. In addition, lower global production costs, driven by lower feedstock costs and foreign exchange rate changes, and reduced ocean freight costs have further contributed to the lower priced environment.

Third Quarter of 2016 Compared to the Third Quarter of 2015 Our net sales for the third quarter of 2016 were $90.2 million, a decrease of $60.0 million, or 40%, from the third quarter of 2015 net sales of $150.2 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices for both UAN and ammonia in the third quarter of 2016 versus the third quarter of 2015 and lower UAN sales volume, partially offset by higher ammonia sales volume. UAN selling prices declined by 33% from $211 per ton in the third quarter of 2015 to $142 per ton in the third quarter of 2016 due to the global fertilizer industry oversupply for all nitrogen fertilizer products. UAN sales volume decreased by 24% in the third quarter of 2016 to 415,000 tons from 544,000 tons in the third quarter of 2015 as customers for our products delayed purchases in anticipation of lower prices due to the global oversupply conditions. Ammonia average selling prices declined by 35% from $459 per ton in the third quarter of 2015 to $297 per ton in the third quarter of 2016 due to the global fertilizer industry oversupply for all nitrogen fertilizer products. Ammonia sales volume increased by 37% from 75,000 tons in the third quarter of 2015 to 103,000 tons in the third quarter of 2016, due to more favorable demand conditions for ammonia versus UAN in the current oversupply environment and lower production of UAN.

The 10% decrease in the average cost of goods sold per ton was due primarily to lower unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives. We recorded a $3.3 million unrealized net mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives for the third quarter of 2016, compared to a $17.0 million unrealized net mark-to-market loss for the third quarter of 2015. The derivative portfolio at September 30, 2016 includes natural gas derivatives that hedge a portion of anticipated natural gas purchases through December 2018.  TERRA NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.

Is Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. Destined for Greatness?
Let's see what the numbers say about Terra Nitrogen (TNH).

Investors love stocks that consistently beat the Street without getting ahead of their fundamentals and risking a meltdown. The best stocks offer sustainable market-beating gains, with robust and improving financial metrics that support strong price growth. Does Terra Nitrogen (NYSE:TNH) fit the bill? Let's take a look at what its recent results tell us about its potential for future gains.
What we're looking for The graphs you're about to see tell Terra Nitrogen's story, and we'll be grading the quality of that story in several ways:

Growth: are profits, margins, and free cash flow all increasing?
Valuation: is share price growing in line with earnings per share?
Opportunities: is return on equity increasing while debt to equity declines?
Dividends: are dividends consistently growing in a sustainable way?

What the numbers tell you Now, let's take a look at Terra Nitrogen's key statistics:

How we got here and where we're going Like its share price and most of its core metrics, Terra Nitrogen has fallen from the technically perfect score it earned on the first assessment it went through in 2013. The seeds of a slowdown were scarcely evident then, but they've become hard to miss today as all of Terra's key metrics have dropped to lower growth rates -- and in the case of dividend payouts, have actually declined -- earning the fertilizer MLP a decent, but not great, four out of eight passing grades. Commodity MLPs must often contend with economic forces beyond their control, but can Terra regain its footing and again become the dividend darling it once was? Let's dig deeper to find out.
Investors have had to deal with an unusually high degree of volatility from Terra over the past two quarters, which is undoubtedly frustrating after the stock became the second-best stock of an entire decade following the dot-com crash -- it was a 123-bagger from 2002 to 2012! Fool writer Bob Ciura (among others) has highlighted the fact that Terra is subject to a number of different factors it simply can't control, from the cost of its natural-gas inputs to the conditions out on the farms where its fertilizer is put to work. While ammonia-based fertilizer prices now seem to be stabilizing after last year's plunge, Terra still has to grapple with natural gas prices that remain nearly 30% higher today than they were two years ago:






Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price data by YCharts
The net effect of this has been to smash profit margins for major natural gas fertilizer makers. On this measure, at least, Terra has held up far better than its close competitor Rentech Nitrogen Partners (NYSE:RNF), which has endured a steep collapse in profit margins into the red over the past two years:

TNH Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts
The drop in ammonia fertilizer prices has also hit CVR Partners (NYSE:UAN) hard on the bottom line, even though its primary input -- petroleum coke -- is derived from raw material that has not endured the same price growth (the price of a barrel of oil based on the West Texas Intermediate price has grown about 13% in the past two years). The only related fertilizer company to not endure similar drops in the latest quarter, CF Industries (NYSE:CF), is likely to see its trailing 12-month profit margins shrink again over the course of the year as the one-time impact of the recent sale of its phosphate-fertilizer business moves further into the past. In fact, when we examine gross margins instead, CF's profit-margin performance over the past two years is already worse than all but Rentech's.





As a result, all of Terra's MLP fertilizer peers have slashed their dividend payouts over the past two years. CVR Partners' payout is 25% below what it was in 2012, and Rentech's is a fraction of the dollar-plus quarterly payouts it boasted two years ago. CF, which isn't a MLP, had the wiggle room to boost its payouts a year ago, but its yield is still the lowest of the pack. To drive home the point of these data points, Fool energy specialist Matt DiLallo points out the inherent hazards of investing in tightly focused MLPs with variable payouts, particularly when (as in Terra's case) their primary asset is tied to the cost of a single input processed at a single location. He notes that such MLPs shouldn't form the core of any retirement portfolios, and it's hard to disagree in this instance, since Terra seems to have reached the limits of its once-meteoric growth.
Putting the pieces together Today, Terra Nitrogen has some of the qualities that make up a great stock, but no stock is truly perfect. Digging deeper can help you uncover the answers you need to make a great buy -- or to stay away from a stock that's going nowhere.

TERRA NITROGEN CO L P /DE - 10-K - 20080228 - BUSINESS





	 




	Part I






	 






	Item 1.   Business








	 




	General




	 


	Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP, we, our or us) is a
	Delaware limited partnership that produces and distributes
	nitrogen fertilizer products. Our principal products are
	anhydrous ammonia (or ammonia) and urea ammonium nitrate
	solutions (UAN), which we manufacture at our facility in
	Verdigris, Oklahoma.


	 


	We conduct our operations through an operating partnership,
	Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP or the Operating
	Partnership and collectively with TNCLP, the Partnership). Terra
	Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP or General Partner), a Delaware
	corporation, is the general partner of both TNCLP and TNLP and
	owns a consolidated 0.05% interest in the Partnership. The
	General Partner is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Terra
	Industries Inc. (Terra), a Maryland corporation. Terra is a
	leading North American producer and marketer of nitrogen
	products, serving agricultural and industrial markets.


	 




	2007
	Overview




	 


	The North American nitrogen industry experienced substantial
	growth in 2007 earnings due to higher product prices in response
	to increased demand for nitrogen products as inputs for key
	commodities, including corn and wheat, and combined with
	relatively stable natural gas prices.


	 




	Business
	Overview




	 


	We produce and distribute nitrogen products, which are used
	primarily by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their
	crops. Our product sales are heavily weighted toward UAN, and
	all of our products are sold on a wholesale basis. Although
	ammonia and UAN are often interchangeable, each has its own
	characteristics, and customer product preferences vary according
	to the crop planted, soil and weather conditions, regional
	farming practices, relative prices and the cost and availability
	of appropriate storage, handling and application equipment.


	 


	Financial information about our business is included in
	Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of
	Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in
	Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of
	this Annual Report on

	Form 10-K.



	 




	Our
	Products




	 




	Overview




	 


	One of the principal forms of globally traded nitrogen
	fertilizer is ammonia. UAN is used principally in North America
	and has only recently been traded in international markets.
	UANs high water content and need for transportation in
	tankers can cause transportation costs per unit of nitrogen to
	be higher than for other forms of internationally traded
	nitrogen products. The location of our sole production facility
	in Verdigris, Oklahoma provides us a competitive advantage in
	serving agricultural customers in the Central and Southern
	Plains and the Corn Belt regions of the United States. We do not
	sell our products internationally.




	1









	 





	Our nitrogen products and 2007 production are described in
	greater detail below.


	 




	Urea Ammonium
	Nitrate Solutions (UAN)




	 


	UAN is a liquid fertilizer and, unlike ammonia, is odorless and
	does not require refrigeration or pressurization for
	transportation or storage. UAN is produced by combining liquid
	urea, liquid ammonium nitrate (AN) and water. The nitrogen
	content of UAN ranges from 28% to 32% by weight. (Unless we
	state otherwise, all references to UAN assume a 28% nitrogen
	content). Because of its high water content, UAN is relatively
	expensive to transport, making it largely a regionally
	distributed product.


	 


	UAN can be applied to crops directly or mixed with crop
	protection products, permitting the application of several
	materials simultaneously, reducing energy and labor costs and
	accelerating field preparation for planting. UAN may be applied
	from ordinary tanks and trucks and sprayed or injected into the
	soil, or applied through irrigation systems. In addition, UAN
	may be applied throughout the growing season, providing
	significant application flexibility. Due to its stability, UAN
	may be used for no-till row crops where fertilizer is spread on
	the surface of the soil.


	 


	In 2007 we produced and sold approximately 2.3 million tons
	of UAN, primarily to U.S. fertilizer dealers and
	distributors.


	 




	Anhydrous
	Ammonia




	 


	Ammonia is the simplest form of nitrogen fertilizer and the
	feedstock for the production of other nitrogen fertilizers,
	including urea, AN and UAN. Ammonia is produced when natural gas
	reacts with steam and air at high temperatures and pressures in
	the presence of catalysts. Ammonia has a nitrogen content of 82%
	by weight and is generally the least expensive form of
	fertilizer on a per-pound-of-contained-nitrogen basis. Although
	generally the cheapest source of nitrogen available to
	agricultural customers, ammonia can be less desirable to
	end-users than urea, AN and UAN because of its need for
	specialized application equipment and its limited application
	flexibility.


	 


	In 2007, we produced approximately 1.1 million tons of
	ammonia. We sold a total of 0.3 million tons of ammonia and
	consumed approximately 0.8 million tons of ammonia as a raw
	material to manufacture our other nitrogen products.


	 




	Marketing and
	Distribution




	 


	We sell our products primarily in the Central and Southern
	Plains and Corn Belt regions of the U.S. Our sole
	production facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma is located near the
	major crop producing and consuming areas of the U.S., and has
	ready access to barge, truck and rail transportation. In
	addition, the Verdigris facility has an ammonia pipeline to
	transport product to primary markets. Our products are marketed
	and distributed by Terra Industries Inc. based in Sioux City,
	Iowa, which provides services to the Partnership. For further
	information on the combined organizations of the General Partner
	and our affiliates, see Note 9 to Item 8,

	Financial
	Statements and Supplementary Data

	of this Annual Report on

	Form 10-K.



	 


	All of our sales are at the wholesale level. Our customers for
	fertilizer products are dealers, national farm retail chains,
	distributors and other fertilizer producers and traders.
	National farm retail chains have both distribution and
	application capabilities. Distributors operate as wholesalers
	and sell directly to dealers and national farm retail chains,
	which, in turn, sell directly to farmers. Many dealers maintain
	year-round storage capacity for inventory as well as application
	equipment. We sell a majority




	2









	 





	of our nitrogen fertilizer products to dealers. No single
	customer accounted for more than 10% of our 2007 sales.


	 




	Transportation




	 


	We use several modes of transportation to ship product to
	customers, including railcars, common carrier trucks, barges and
	common carrier pipelines. Railcars are the primary mode of
	transportation for shipments from our Verdigris facilities. We
	utilize railcars that are currently leased by Terra for all of
	its businesses. Terra currently leases approximately 2,872
	railcars. We also use approximately 30 liquid and ammonia
	fertilizer terminal storage facilities in numerous states.


	 


	We transport purchased natural gas to our Verdigris, Oklahoma
	facility via an intrastate pipeline. This pipeline is not an
	open-access carrier, but is nonetheless part of a widespread
	regional system through which Verdigris can receive natural gas
	from any major Oklahoma source. We also have limited access to
	out-of-state natural gas supplies for this facility.


	 




	Nitrogen Industry
	Overview




	 


	The three major nutrients required for plant growth are
	phosphorous, mined as phosphate rock; potassium, mined as
	potash; and nitrogen, produced from natural gas. Phosphorus
	plays a key role in the photosynthesis process. Potassium is an
	important regulator of plants physiological functions.
	Nitrogen is an essential element for most organic compounds in
	plants because it promotes protein formation. Nitrogen is also a
	major component of chlorophyll, which helps promote green
	healthy growth and high yields. There are no known substitutes
	for nitrogen fertilizers in the cultivation of high-yield crops.
	These three nutrients occur naturally in the soil to a certain
	extent, but must be replaced because crops remove them from the
	soil. Nitrogen, to a greater extent than phosphate and potash,
	must be reapplied each year in areas of intense agricultural
	usage because of nitrogen absorption by crops and its tendency
	to escape from the soil by evaporation or leaching.
	Consequently, demand for nitrogen fertilizer tends to be more
	consistent on a

	year-by-year,


	per-acre-planted

	basis than is demand for phosphate or potash fertilizer.


	 


	The major nitrogen consuming crop in North America is corn.
	Certain crops, such as soybeans and other legumes, can better
	absorb atmospheric nitrogen and do not require nitrogen
	fertilizers.


	 




	Demand




	 


	Global demand for fertilizers typically grows at predictable
	rates and tends to correspond to growth in grain production.
	Global fertilizer demand is driven in the long term primarily by
	population growth, increases in disposable income and associated
	improvements in diet. Short-term demand depends on world
	economic growth rates and factors creating temporary imbalances
	in supply and demand. These factors include weather patterns,
	the level of world grain stocks relative to consumption,
	agricultural commodity prices, energy prices, crop mix,
	fertilizer application rates, farm income and temporary
	disruptions in fertilizer trade from government intervention,
	such as changes in the buying patterns of China or India. Grain
	consumption has historically grown at approximately 1.2% per
	year. According to IFA, International Fertilizer Industry
	Association, over the last 45 years global fertilizer
	demand has grown 3.7% annually and global nitrogen fertilizer
	demand has grown at a faster rate of 4.8% annually. During that
	period, North American nitrogen fertilizer demand has grown 3.3%
	annually.


	 




	Supply




	 


	Over the past seven years, global ammonia capacity has remained
	relatively flat, growing at an average of 2.1% per annum. This
	result was attributable principally to the combination of new
	project capacity




	3









	 





	being offset by permanent plant closings in the U.S and Europe.
	As global operating rates and prices have risen, so have plans
	for new capacity.


	 


	This anticipated new global capacity will come primarily from
	advantaged natural gas regions of the world, such as the Middle
	East and Africa. This expansion of capacity could be limited,
	however, by high capital and construction costs, lower nitrogen
	prices and increasing natural gas prices. Russia has increased
	domestic gas prices as well as prices paid by their export
	customers. This has increased the production costs for new and
	existing plants in the former Soviet Union and Europe.


	 


	Imports account for a significant portion of U.S. nitrogen
	product supply. Producers from the former Soviet Union, Canada,
	the Middle East, Trinidad and Venezuela are major exporters to
	the U.S. These export producers are often competitive in
	regions close to the point of entry for imports, primarily the
	Gulf coast and east coast of North America. Due to higher
	freight costs and limited distribution infrastructure, importers
	are less competitive in serving the main corn-growing regions of
	the U.S., which are more distant from these ports. According to
	Fertecon, a leading industry publication, world trade in ammonia
	grew from 15.4 million tons in 2000 to 19.3 million
	tons by 2006 due to the exceptional increase in gas prices in
	the U.S. and Europe during this period and the consequent
	closure of U.S. capacity.


	 




	Outlook




	 


	Fertecon forecasts that global nitrogen fertilizer demand is
	expected to rise by around 2% per year from 2005 to 2015,
	increasing by 21 million tons or close to 22% over the
	period. In North America, nitrogen fertilizer consumption is
	expected to increase from 2005 to 2015 from 13.9 million
	tons to 16 million tons, a 15% increase.


	 


	The continued growth in demand for nitrogen products has helped
	stabilize global ammonia capacity utilization rates, which
	averaged 85% between 2005 and 2006. According to Fertecon,
	global ammonia utilization rates are forecasted to remain in the
	low 80s through 2015. North American ammonia utilization
	rates are forecast to decrease from 82% in 2006 to 78% by 2015
	due in part to projected long-term growth in worldwide capacity
	and in imports.


	 


	To help meet the growing global demand for fertilizers,
	especially in high growth areas like China and India, new
	ammonia capacity is expected to come on stream globally in the
	next nine years. According to Fertecon, global ammonia capacity
	is forecast to increase by 22.9 million tons by 2015, a
	total increase of 7.5%. This projected additional capacity
	excludes plants constructed in China as product produced in
	China is not expected to be distributed in global markets. There
	are a number of new capacity projects expected or underway in
	gas advantaged regions; however, increased construction costs
	and changes in market dynamics have delayed a number of projects.


	 


	World trade in ammonia is expected to increase by
	1.8 million tons or 8% in the period to 2010, according to
	Fertecon, representing more modest growth than seen from 2000 to
	2005. Fertecon projects that higher gas costs for Russian and
	Ukrainian exporters and the lower-than-previous gas price
	outlook for the U.S. would appear to support continued
	operating rates for remaining U.S. ammonia capacity,
	limiting the near-term growth in ammonia imports.


	 




	Seasonality and
	Volatility




	 


	The fertilizer business is seasonal, based upon the planting,
	growing and harvesting cycles. Nitrogen fertilizer inventories
	must be accumulated to permit uninterrupted customer deliveries,
	and require significant storage capacity. This seasonality
	generally results in higher fertilizer prices during peak




	4









	 





	consumption periods, with prices normally reaching their highest
	point in the spring, decreasing in the summer, and increasing
	again in the fall-early winter period as depleted inventories
	are restored.


	 


	The fertilizer business can also be volatile as a result of a
	number of other factors. The most important of these factors are:












	 


	 


	Weather patterns and field conditions (particularly during
	periods of high fertilizer consumption);




	 


	 


	Quantities of fertilizers imported to primary markets;




	 


	 


	Current and projected grain inventories and prices, which are
	heavily influenced by U.S. exports, worldwide grain
	markets, and domestic demand (food, feed, and biofuel); and




	 


	 


	Price fluctuations in natural gas, the principal raw material
	used to produce nitrogen fertilizer.




	 


	Governmental policies may directly or indirectly influence the
	number of acres planted, the level of grain inventories, the mix
	of crops planted and crop prices, as well as environmental
	demands.


	 




	Raw
	Materials




	 


	The principal raw material used to produce manufactured nitrogen
	products is natural gas. Natural gas costs in 2007 accounted for
	approximately 64% of our total costs and expenses. Significant
	increases in natural gas costs that are not hedged or recovered
	through higher selling prices would have an adverse impact on
	our business, financial conditions and results. We believe there
	will be a sufficient supply of natural gas for the foreseeable
	future. We will, as opportunities present themselves, enter into
	firm transportation contracts to minimize the risk of
	interruption or curtailment of natural gas supplies during the
	peak-demand winter season when we

	and/or

	our
	customers generally build inventories in anticipation of the
	peak-sales spring season. We use a combination of spot and term
	purchases of varied duration from a variety of suppliers to
	obtain natural gas.


	 


	We use derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our natural
	gas purchases. We have implemented a policy setting boundaries
	to ensure coverage of fixed forward sales as well as potential
	outstanding forward priced quotes and prepay programs. Our
	policy is designed to hedge exposure to natural gas price
	fluctuations for production required for forward sales
	estimates. We hedge natural gas prices through the use of supply
	contracts, financial derivatives and other instruments.


	 


	The settlement dates of forward-pricing contracts coincide with
	gas purchase dates as well as shipment periods on forward
	committed sales. Forward-pricing contracts are based on a
	specified price referenced to spot market prices or appropriate
	New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures contract prices.


	 




	Competition




	 


	Nitrogen products are global commodities, and our customers
	include distributors, industrial end-users, dealers and other
	fertilizer producers. Customers make purchasing decisions
	principally on the delivered price and availability of the
	product. We compete with a number of domestic and foreign
	producers, including state-owned and government-subsidized
	entities. Some of our principal competitors may have greater
	total resources and may depend less on earnings from nitrogen
	fertilizer sales. Some foreign competitors may have access to
	lower cost or government-subsidized natural gas supplies,
	particularly those with facilities in warmer climates. Natural
	gas comprises a significant portion of our raw materials cost
	for nitrogen products. Competitive natural gas purchasing is
	essential to maintaining a low-cost product position. We compete
	with other manufacturers of nitrogen products on delivery terms
	and availability of products, as well as on price.

	Environmental and
	Other Regulatory Matters




	 


	Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local
	environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including
	laws relating to air quality, hazardous and solid wastes and
	water quality. Our facilities require operating permits that are
	subject to review by governmental agencies. We are also involved
	in the manufacture, handling, transportation, storage and
	disposal of materials that are or may be classified as hazardous
	or toxic by federal, state or other regulatory agencies. We take
	precautions to reduce the likelihood of accidents involving
	these materials. We may be responsible under the Comprehensive
	Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)
	or analogous laws for all or part of the costs of such
	investigation and remediation if such materials have been or are
	disposed of at sites that are targeted for investigation and
	remediation by federal or state regulatory authorities.
	Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners, Limited Partnership (a
	former owner and operator of the Partnerships production
	facilities) has retained liability for certain environmental
	matters originating prior to the Partnerships acquisition
	of these facilities.


	 


	We may be required to install additional air and water quality
	control equipment, such as low nitrogen oxide (NOx) burners,
	scrubbers, ammonia sensors and continuous emission monitors, at
	our facility to comply with Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and
	similar requirements. These equipment requirements also
	typically apply to competitors as well.


	 


	We endeavor to comply in all material respects with applicable
	environmental, health and safety regulations and have incurred
	substantial costs in connection with such compliance. Because
	these regulations are expected to continue to change, and
	generally to be more restrictive than current requirements, the
	costs of compliance will likely increase. We do not expect our
	compliance with these regulations to have a material adverse
	effect on our results of operations, financial position or net
	cash flows.


	 


	Our capital expenditures related to environmental control in
	2007 were approximately $0.5 million. Environmental capital
	expenditures are projected to be approximately $3.5 million
	in the aggregate for the three years 2008, 2009 and 2010. The
	majority of these expenditures are for voluntary pollution
	prevention projects.


	 


	We believe that our policies and procedures now in effect comply
	with applicable environmental laws and with the permits relating
	to our facility in all material respects. However, in the normal
	course of our business, we are exposed to risks relating to
	possible releases of hazardous substances into the environment.
	Such releases could cause substantial damage or injuries.
	Although environmental expenditures in 2007 were not material,
	it is impossible to predict or quantify the impact of future
	environmental liabilities associated with releases of hazardous
	substances from our facility.


	 




	Employees




	 


	TNGP, the General Partner is responsible for managing our
	business. As of December 31, 2007, the General Partner had
	no employees. Terra Nitrogen Corporation (TNC), a
	Terra subsidiary and the prior general partner had
	161 employees, who, along with Terra, provide services to
	us under the October 2007 Amended and Restated General and

Notes to
Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements


1.
Background and Basis of Presentation

Terra
Nitrogen Company, L.P. ("TNCLP," "we," "our" or "us") is a
Delaware limited partnership that produces nitrogen fertilizer
products. Our principal products are anhydrous ammonia (ammonia)
and urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN), which we manufacture at
our facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma.

We conduct
our operations through an operating partnership, Terra Nitrogen,
Limited Partnership (TNLP or the Operating Partnership, and
collectively with TNCLP, the Partnership). Terra
Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP or the General Partner), a
Delaware corporation, is the general partner of both TNCLP and TNLP
and owns a consolidated 0.05% general partner interest in the
Partnership. The General Partner is an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of CF Industries Holdings, Inc.
(CF Industries), a Delaware corporation. Ownership of TNCLP is
comprised of the general partner interests and the limited partner
interests. Limited partner interests are represented by common
units, which are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol "TNH" and Class B common units. As of
September 30, 2016 , we had 18,501,576 common units and
184,072 Class B common units issued and outstanding. CF
Industries through its subsidiaries owned 13,889,014 common units
(representing approximately 75% of the total outstanding common
units) and all of the Class B common units as of
September 30, 2016 .

We are a
master limited partnership (MLP). Partnerships are generally not
subject to federal income tax, although publicly traded
partnerships (such as TNCLP) are treated as corporations for
federal income tax purposes (and therefore are subject to federal
income tax), unless at least 90% of the partnership's gross income
is "qualifying income" as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the partnership is not
required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. As we currently satisfy the requirements to be
treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, no
federal income taxes are paid by the Partnership.

On May 6,
2015, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published proposed
regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute
or generate qualifying income of an MLP. The proposed regulations
would have the effect of limiting the types of income and
activities that qualify under the MLP rules, subject to certain
transition provisions. The proposed regulations include certain
processing or refining and transportation activities with respect
to any mineral or natural resource (including fertilizer) as
activities that generate qualifying income, but the proposed
regulations reserve on specific proposals regarding
fertilizer-related activities. Any change in the federal income tax
treatment of income from fertilizer-related activities as
qualifying income could have a material impact on the taxation of
the Partnership and could have a material adverse impact on
unitholder distributions. We continue to monitor these IRS
regulatory activities.

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 , in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States for interim financial reporting. In the opinion of
management, these statements reflect all adjustments, consisting
only of normal and recurring adjustments, that are necessary for
the fair representation of the information for the periods
presented. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to
such rules and regulations. Operating results for any period
presented apply to that period only and are not necessarily
indicative of results for any future period.

The
preparation of the unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements requires management to make use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities, revenue and expenses and certain financial statement
disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Significant estimates and assumptions in these unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements include net realizable value of
inventories, environmental remediation liabilities, environmental
and litigation contingencies, useful lives of property, plant and
equipment, and the assumptions used in the evaluation of potential
impairment of property, plant and equipment.

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures included in our 2015
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2016
.

Throughout
this document, the term "affiliates of the General Partner" refers
to consolidated subsidiaries of CF Industries, including

2. New
Accounting Standards

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic
842), which supersedes the lease accounting requirements in
Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 840, Leases. This ASU
will require lessees to recognize the rights and obligations
resulting from virtually all leases (other than leases that meet
the definition of a short-term lease) on their balance sheets as
right-of-use assets with corresponding lease liabilities. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant
judgments made by management, will be required to provide greater
insight into the extent of income and expense recognized and
expected to be recognized from existing contracts. This ASU is
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption
permitted, and requires the modified retrospective method of
adoption. We expect the adoption of this ASU will not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

In July
2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330):
Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, effective for annual and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU No. 2015-11
changes the inventory measurement principle for entities using the
first-in, first out (FIFO) or average cost methods. For entities
utilizing one of these methods, the inventory measurement principle
will change from lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and
net realizable value. We follow the FIFO or average cost methods
and are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU
on our consolidated financial statements.

In May
2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition
requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU
is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the
transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be
entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also
requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing,
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer
contracts, including significant judgments. Additionally, the costs
to obtain and fulfill a contract, including assets to be
recognized, are to be capitalized and such capitalized costs should
be disclosed. As modified by ASU No. 2015-14, Deferral of the
Effective Date, the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 is for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with
early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the
impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, as amended, on our
consolidated financial statements.


3.
Agreement of Limited Partnership

We make
quarterly distributions to holders of our general partner interest
and limited partner interests based on Available Cash for the
quarter as defined in our agreement of limited partnership.
Available Cash is defined generally as all cash receipts less all
cash disbursements, less certain reserves (including reserves for
future operating and capital needs) established as the General
Partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary or
appropriate. Changes in working capital affect Available Cash as
changes in the amount of cash invested in working capital items
(such as increases in inventory and decreases in accounts payable)
reduce Available Cash, while declines in the amount of cash
invested in working capital items increase Available Cash. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 , we
declared and paid partnership distributions of $208.5 million
and $207.3 million , respectively.

We receive
99% of the Available Cash from the Operating Partnership and 1% is
distributed by the Operating Partnership to the General Partner.
Cash distributions from the Operating Partnership generally
represent the Operating Partnership's Available Cash from
operations. Our cash distributions are made 99.975% to common and
Class B common unitholders and 0.025% to the General Partner
except when cumulative distributions of Available Cash exceed
specified target levels above the Minimum Quarterly Distributions
(MQD) of $0.605 per unit. Under such circumstances, the General
Partner is entitled to receive Incentive Distribution
Rights.

issued and outstanding units are held by non-affiliates of the
General Partner, as was the case at September 30, 2016 , we,
at the General Partner's sole discretion, may call, or assign to
the General Partner or its affiliates, our right to acquire all,
but not less than all, such outstanding units held by
non-affiliated persons. If the General Partner elects to acquire
all outstanding units, we are required to give at least 30 but not
more than 60  days' notice of our decision to purchase the
outstanding units. The purchase price per unit will be the greater
of (1) the average of the previous 20 trading days' closing prices
as of the date five days before the purchase is announced or (2)
the highest price paid by the General Partner or any of its
affiliates for any unit within the 90  days preceding the date
the purchase is announced.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative
financial instruments are executed on our behalf by an affiliate of
the General Partner to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity
prices for natural gas. Natural gas is the largest and most
volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based
fertilizers.

The
derivatives that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps
and natural gas options traded in the over-the-counter (OTC)
markets. The derivative contract prices are based on NYMEX future
prices based on physical delivery of natural gas at the Henry Hub
in Louisiana, the most common and financially liquid location of
reference for derivative financial instruments related to natural
gas. However, we purchase natural gas for our manufacturing
facility from suppliers whose prices are based primarily on the
ONEOK index (based on physical delivery of natural gas in Oklahoma,
rather than at the Henry Hub). This creates a location basis
differential between the derivative contract price and the price we
pay for physical delivery of natural gas. Accordingly, the prices
underlying the derivative financial instruments we use may not
exactly match the prices of natural gas we purchase and consume. We
enter into natural gas derivative contracts with respect to gas to
be consumed by us in the future, and settlement of those derivative
contracts are scheduled to coincide with our anticipated purchases
of natural gas used to manufacture nitrogen products during those
future periods. We use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge
of gas price risk, but without the application of hedge
accounting.

We report
derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
Changes in fair value are recognized in cost of goods sold in the
period of change. Cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are
reported as operating activities.

The gross
fair values of derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets are
shown below. All balance sheet amounts from derivatives arise from
natural gas derivatives that are not designated as hedging
instruments. For additional information on derivative fair values,
see Note  7—Fair Value Measurements .

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , we had open
derivative contracts for 36.9 million MMBtus (millions of British
thermal units) and 59.6 million MMBtus, respectively, of
natural gas. The derivative portfolio at September 30, 2016
includes natural gas derivatives that hedge a portion of
anticipated natural gas purchases through December 2018. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 , we used derivatives to
cover approximately 77% of our natural gas consumption.

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , the aggregate
fair values of the derivative instruments with credit-risk-related
contingent features in a net liability position were
$6.2 million and $27.9 million , respectively, which also
approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional
collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle
the obligations if the credit-risk-related contingent features were
triggered at the reporting dates. As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 , we had no cash collateral on deposit with
counterparties for derivative contracts. The credit support
documents executed in connection with International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements generally provide the
right to set off collateral against amounts owing under the ISDA
agreements upon the occurrence of a default or a specified
termination event.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , our cash and
cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market mutual funds
that invest in U.S. treasuries and government obligations or direct
investments in U.S. and Canadian treasury bills.

Natural
Gas Derivatives

The
derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed
price swaps and options traded in the OTC markets with
multi-national commercial banks, other major financial institutions
and large energy companies. The derivatives are traded in months
forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated
gas purchases during those future periods. These contracts settle
using NYMEX futures prices and accordingly, to determine the fair
value of these instruments, we use quoted market prices from NYMEX
and standard pricing models with inputs derived from or
corroborated by observable market data such as forward curves
supplied by an industry-recognized unrelated third party. See
Note  6—Derivative Financial Instruments for additional
information.

Assets
Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

We also
have assets that may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis; that is, the assets are not measured at fair value on an
ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain
circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment. These
include long-lived assets that may be written down to fair value as
a result of impairment. We determined that these fair value
measurements rely primarily on Partnership-specific inputs and the
Partnership's assumptions about the use of the assets. Since
certain of the assumptions would involve inputs that are not
observable, these fair values would reside within Level 3 of
the fair value hierarchy.

Related Party Transactions

TNCLP and
TNGP have no employees. We have entered into several agreements
with a subsidiary of CF Industries relating to the operation of our
business and the sale of the fertilizer products produced at our
Verdigris facility. We believe that each of these agreements is on
terms that are fair and reasonable to us.

General
and Administrative Services and Product Offtake
Agreement

Pursuant
to the Amendment to the General and Administrative Services and
Product Offtake Agreement (the Services and Offtake Agreement), the
Partnership sells all of its fertilizer products to affiliates of
the General Partner at prices based on market prices for the
Partnership's fertilizer products as defined in the Services and
Offtake Agreement. Title and risk of loss transfer to affiliates of
the General Partner as the product is shipped from the plant gate.
The Services and Offtake Agreement is effective for annual terms
starting as of January 1st and will be extended
automatically for successive one -year terms unless terminated by
one of the parties prior to renewal.

Directly
Incurred Charges

Since we
have no employees, we rely on employees from an affiliate of the
General Partner to operate our Verdigris facility. As a result, the
payroll and payroll-related expenses and benefit costs, such as
health insurance and pension costs, are incurred by an affiliate of
the General Partner and directly charged to us. Payroll,
payroll-related expenses and other employee-related benefit costs
directly charged to us for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were $7.2 million and $21.3 million ,
respectively, and for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015 were $6.6 million and $20.7 million ,
respectively. We report these expenses as services provided by
affiliates of the General Partner in cost of goods sold.

Allocated
Charges

CF
Industries, together with its affiliates, also provides certain
services to us under the Services and Offtake Agreement. These
services include production planning, manufacturing management,
logistics, procurement, accounting, legal, risk management,
investor relations and other general and administrative functions.
Allocated expenses charged to us for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were $4.0 million and $11.8 million ,
respectively, and for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015 were $3.9 million and $11.8 million ,
respectively. We report these expenses as selling, general and
administrative services provided by affiliates of the General
Partner.

Amounts
Due to/from Affiliates of the General Partner

We receive
cash and make expenditures directly from our cash accounts. Because
we sell our products to and receive payroll and other related
services from affiliates of the General Partner, the affiliates of
the General Partner continue to be both debtors and creditors to
us. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , we
had a net balance due from affiliates of the General Partner of
$4.3 million and $5.9 million , respectively.

Spare
Parts Sharing Agreement

Affiliates
of CF Industries own and operate nitrogen fertilizer complexes that
utilize some equipment that is similar to equipment at our
Verdigris nitrogen complex. Each of the various manufacturing
complexes maintains spare parts for use in its facilities. In the
event that an unplanned need arises and to help minimize
manufacturing downtime, we have entered into a spare parts sharing
agreement with affiliates of CF Industries that permits spare parts
to be shared among the manufacturing complexes from time to time.
Parts that are borrowed from another complex under the agreement
are either refurbished and returned to the lender or
replaced.

Leases

We entered
into an amended and restated lease with an affiliate of the General
Partner under which the ammonia assets in our terminal in Blair,
Nebraska are leased by the affiliate. The lease is effective for a
five -year term ending on December 31, 2018, and the affiliate
of the General Partner has options to renew for three additional
five -year terms. The quarterly lease payment is $100,000 , subject
to an annual inflation adjustment, and additional rent will be paid
equal to all costs, expenses, and obligations incurred by the
affiliate of the General Partner related to the use, occupancy and
operation of the terminal.

We also
have leased certain of our rail cars to an affiliate of the General
Partner for quarterly rental payments of $3,600 per car. This lease
was effective initially for a one -year term and is extended
automatically for successive one -year terms unless terminated by
either party thereto prior to renewal.

For both
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ,
we recognized rental income of $0.1 million and $0.4 million ,
respectively. We report this income as other income from an
affiliate of the General Partner.

Company
Overview

TNCLP is a
Delaware limited partnership that produces nitrogen fertilizer
products. Our principal products are anhydrous ammonia (ammonia)
and urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN), which we manufacture at
our facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma.

TNCLP and
TNGP have no employees. An affiliate of the General Partner
provides certain services to us under the Amendment to the General
and Administrative Services and Product Offtake Agreement (the
Services and Offtake Agreement). Pursuant to the Services and
Offtake Agreement, the Partnership sells all of its fertilizer
products to affiliates of the General Partner at prices based on
market prices for the Partnership's fertilizer products as defined
in the Services and Offtake Agreement. Title and risk of loss
transfer to affiliates of the General Partner as the product is
shipped from the plant gate. For further information regarding our
agreements with CF Industries and the General Partner, see Notes to
Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 
9—Related Party Transactions .

Nitrogen
Fertilizer Market Conditions

Our
products are global commodities and are subject to price
competition. The customers for our products make their purchasing
decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a
lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. The selling
prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market
conditions and changes in supply and demand. In the current
environment, global nitrogen fertilizer supply has increased faster
than global nitrogen fertilizer demand, creating the current global
oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer and leading to lower selling
prices.

The third
quarter and first nine months of 2016 were significantly impacted
by declining selling prices. Our average selling prices for
ammonia and UAN declined by 35% and 33% , respectively, during the
third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015
, which reduced both our net sales and gross margin in the
third quarter of 2016 by $45.2 million . During the first
nine months of 2016 , our average selling prices for ammonia and
UAN declined by 29% and 24% , respectively, which reduced both
our net sales and gross margin in the first nine months of 2016 by
$114.9 million .

TERRA
NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.

 

Over the
past several years, strong demand, high capacity utilization and
increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen
fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen
production facilities, which resulted in an increase in global
nitrogen fertilizer production capacity and the current surplus of
supply in the market. Global investment in nitrogen production
facilities includes the capacity expansion projects that are being
completed by affiliates of our General Partner. In addition, lower
global production costs, driven by lower feedstock costs and
foreign exchange rate changes, and reduced ocean freight costs have
further contributed to the lower priced environment.

We expect
the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and
demand become more balanced through a combination of continued
demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower
realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off
line.

Third
Quarter
of 2016 Compared to the
Third Quarter of
2015

Our net
sales for the third quarter of 2016 were $90.2 million , a decrease
of $60.0 million , or 40% , from the third quarter of 2015 net
sales of $150.2 million . The decrease was primarily due to lower
average selling prices for both UAN and ammonia in the third
quarter of 2016 versus the third quarter of 2015 and lower UAN
sales volume, partially offset by higher ammonia sales
volume.

UAN
selling prices declined by 33% from $211 per ton in the third
quarter of 2015 to $142 per ton in the third quarter of 2016 due to
the global fertilizer industry oversupply for all nitrogen
fertilizer products. UAN sales volume decrease d by 24% in the
third quarter of 2016 to 415,000  tons from 544,000  tons
in the third quarter of 2015 as customers for our products delayed
purchases in anticipation of lower prices due to the global
oversupply conditions.

Ammonia
average selling prices declined by 35% from $459 per ton in the
third quarter of 2015 to $297 per ton in the third quarter of 2016
due to the global fertilizer industry oversupply for all nitrogen
fertilizer products. Ammonia sales volume increase d by 37% from
75,000 tons in the third quarter of 2015 to 103,000 tons in the
third quarter of 2016 , due to more favorable demand conditions for
ammonia versus UAN in the current oversupply environment and lower
production of UAN.

The
average cost of goods sold decrease d to $111 per ton in the third
quarter of 2016 from $123 per ton in the third quarter of 2015 .
The 10% decrease in the average cost of goods sold per ton was due
primarily to lower unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas
derivatives. We recorded a $3.3 million unrealized net
mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives for the third
quarter of 2016 , compared to a $17.0 million unrealized net
mark-to-market loss for the third quarter of 2015 . The derivative
portfolio at September 30, 2016 includes natural gas
derivatives that hedge a portion of anticipated natural gas
purchases through December 2018.

Our gross
margin was $32.8 million  in the third quarter of 2016
compared to $74.1 million in the third quarter of 2015 . Gross
margin as a percentage of net sales decrease d to 36.4% during the
third quarter of 2016 from 49.3% during the third quarter of 2015
as a result of the impact of lower average selling prices for both
UAN and ammonia and lower UAN sales volume in the third quarter of
2016 compared to the third quarter 2015, partially offset by lower
unrealized net mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives
during the third quarter of 2016 and higher ammonia sales
volume.

Total
selling, general and administrative expenses, including other
general and administrative expenses, were $4.0 million in the
third quarter of 2016 compared to $4.7 million in the third
quarter of 2015 . The decline was due primarily to a loss in the
third quarter of 2015 on the disposal of certain machinery and
equipment.

Our net
earnings were $28.8 million in the third quarter of 2016 , a
decrease of $40.6 million , or 59% , as compared to
$69.4 million in the third quarter of 2015 . Net earnings
decreased primarily due to the lower gross margin driven by lower
average selling prices, as discussed above.

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
to Nine Months Ended September 30,
2015

In the
first quarter of 2016, we experienced an unscheduled outage for
maintenance on one of the facility’s two ammonia plants,
resulting in one-half of the complex's ammonia capacity being shut
down for approximately two months, and one-half of the complex's
UAN capacity being shut down for approximately one month.
Maintenance was completed and the affected ammonia plant was
restarted in March 2016. In the first quarter of 2015, we had a
planned turnaround of an ammonia plant and a UAN plant, together
representing approximately one-half of our production capacity. The
ammonia plant turnaround was completed in the first quarter of 2015
and the UAN plant turnaround, including certain follow-on
maintenance, was completed in the second quarter of 2015. These
turnarounds reduced production in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 .

Our net
sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $324.9
million , a decrease of $105.5 million , or 25% , from net sales of
$430.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 .
This decrease was due primarily to a decrease in UAN and ammonia
average selling prices as a result of the global fertilizer
industry oversupply for all nitrogen fertilizer products. This was
partially offset by higher UAN and ammonia sales volume compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 .

UAN
selling prices declined by 24% from $234 per ton in the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 to $177 per ton in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 due to the global fertilizer industry
oversupply for all nitrogen fertilizer products. UAN sales volume
increase d by 2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016
to 1,231,000  tons from 1,207,000  tons in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 due to increased UAN
production.

Ammonia
selling prices decreased by 29% from $492 per ton in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 to $347 per ton in the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 . The decrease in ammonia
selling prices was due to the global fertilizer industry oversupply
for all nitrogen fertilizer products. Ammonia sales volume
increased from 296,000 tons in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 to 306,000 tons in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 , due to increased production.

The
average cost of goods sold per ton decrease d to $95 per ton in the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $125 per ton in the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 . The 24% decrease in the
average cost of goods sold per ton was due primarily to an
unrealized mark-to-market gain of $21.7 million in the first nine
months of 2016 compared to an unrealized mark-to-market loss of
$10.5 million in the same period in 2015, as well as lower
idle plant costs due to the turnarounds that occurred in the first
half of 2015.

Our gross
margin was $178.6 million  in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $242.8 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 . The gross margin in the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 declined 26% from the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to lower UAN and
ammonia average selling prices partially offset by an unrealized
net mark-to-market gain in natural gas derivatives and higher sales
volume in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine
months of 2015. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased
to 55.0% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from
56.4% during the nine months ended September 30, 2015
.

Total
selling, general and administrative expenses, including other
general and administrative expenses, were $13.5 million in the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $15.1 million
in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 . The decline was
due primarily to a loss in the first nine months of 2015 on the
disposal of certain machinery and equipment.

TERRA
NITROGEN COMPANY, L.P.

 

Our net
earnings were $165.2 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 , a decrease of $62.5 million , or 27% , as
compared to $227.7 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015 . Net earnings decreased primarily due to
the lower gross margin driven by lower average selling prices, as
discussed above.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Our
principal funding needs and uses of cash are working capital, plant
turnaround costs, capital expenditures, and quarterly
distributions. Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of
September 30, 2016 was $48.7 million , a decrease of
$57.7 million from $106.4 million as of December 31,
2015 . See further discussion below under "Cash Flows." Our cash
and cash equivalents consist primarily of money market mutual funds
that invest in U.S. treasuries and government obligations or direct
investments in U.S. and Canadian treasury bills.

Because we
sell our products to, and receive payroll and other related
services from, affiliates of the General Partner, the affiliates of
the General Partner continue to be both debtors and creditors to
us.

Exhibit 99.1FOR MORE INFORMATION, CONTACT:Martin Jarosick Vice President, Investor Relations847-405-2045mjarosick@cfindustries.comTerra Nitrogen Company, L.P. Reports Fourth Quarter2016 ResultsDEERFIELD, IL (February 15, 2017)—Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP) (NYSE: TNH) today reported net earnings of $44.1 million on net sales of $93.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. This compares to net earnings of $79.2 million on net sales of $151.3 million for the 2015 fourth quarter.  Net earnings allocable to common units was $34.3 million ($1.85 per common unit) and $46.2 million ($2.49 per common unit) for the 2016 and 2015 fourth quarters, respectively. Results for the fourth quarter of 2016 included an unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives of $13.6 million compared to a loss of $12.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The derivative portfolio at December 31, 2016 includes natural gas derivatives that hedge a portion of natural gas purchases through 2018.For the full year 2016, TNCLP reported net earnings of $209.3 million on net sales of $418.3 million. This compares to net earnings of $306.9 million on net sales of $581.7 million for the full year 2015. Net earnings allocable to common units was $139.9 million ($7.56 per common unit) and $186.2 million ($10.06 per common unit) for the full year 2016 and 2015, respectively. Results for the full year 2016 included an unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives of $35.3 million compared to an unrealized net mark-to-market loss of $23.1 million for the full year 2015.Analysis of ResultsNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled $93.4 million, compared to $151.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, as lower average realized selling prices for ammonia and UAN and decreased sales volumes of ammonia were partially offset by increased sales volumes of UAN. Ammonia and UAN average selling prices declined in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 due to excess global nitrogen supply. Ammonia sales volume decreased 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 as unfavorable weather and farm level economic considerations, including declining year-over-year farmer disposable income and crop futures prices favoring soybeans over corn, led many farmers to delay fertilizer application and planting decisions until spring. UAN sales volume increased 15 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 as customers built inventories in preparation for spring after delaying purchases earlier in the year. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2016 to 2015, TNCLP’s:•Ammonia average selling prices decreased by 43 percent and UAN average selling prices decreased by 40 percent;•Ammonia sales volume decreased by 16 percent and UAN sales volume increased by 15 percent; and•Realized natural gas cost per MMBtu increased by 12 percent.Cash DistributionCash distributions depend on TNCLP’s earnings as well as cash requirements for working capital needs and capital and other expenditures. For the full year 2016, capital expenditures were $33.1 million as compared to $87.8 million in 2015, with the decrease primarily due to the large plant turnaround activities in 2015 that did not recur in 2016. In 2017, TNCLP expects to make capital expenditures in the range of $75 million to $85 million. Approximately $40 million of the projected capital expenditures relate to a plant turnaround scheduled to start in the third quarter of 2017 and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2017, and the calculation of available cash for the fourth quarter of 2016 included a reserve of approximately one-third of that amount. The plant turnaround will result in lower ammonia and UAN production, lower sales and lower profitability during the period, which will reduce available cash for distributions to unitholders. Additionally, planned maintenance, capital expenditures, and turnarounds are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals, and/or permitting, unanticipated increases in cost, changes in scope and completion time, performance of third parties, adverse weather, defects in materials, workmanship, labor or material shortages, transportation constraints, and other unforeseen difficulties. Capital expenditures also reduce the available cash for unitholder distributions.TNCLP reported on February 6, 2017, the declaration of a cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, of $1.22 per common unit payable February 28, 2017 to holders of record as of February 17, 2017. This compares to a cash distribution of $2.88 per common unit for the quarter ended December 31, 2015.1
