			Mr. Formica has served as a member of our Board of Directors since August 2003, bringing considerable legal knowledge to the Board as well as a substantial familiarity and significant understanding of the rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq stock market. Mr. Formica is also the Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, and a member of the Compensation and Audit Committees.
 
Since 1999, Mr. Formica has served as a legal consultant and expert in corporate securities and securities industry litigation and arbitration. From 1969 until 1999, Mr. Formica held various positions with the National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD"), now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), the self-regulatory organization responsible for the regulation of registered broker-dealers in the United States. His positions have included Vice President and Deputy General Counsel, Director of the NASD's Corporate Financing Department and Director of the Congressional and State Liaison Department. Mr. Formica's career began in 1969 with the NASD's Office of General Counsel as an enforcement attorney handling broker/dealer administrative proceedings at the national level as well as drafting and interpreting NASD rules and regulations. In 1977 he was named Vice President and Deputy General Counsel responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Office including litigation, administrative proceedings before the Board of Governors and the SEC, legal advice to the Board of Governors, and drafting and adopting NASD rules, interpretations and policies.
 
In 1984 he was named Director of the NASD's Corporate Financing Department which was responsible for the review of underwriting arrangements and after-market trading of public offerings of securities and the rules and regulations relating to sales practices in those offerings. The Department was also responsible for the regulation of the distribution and sale of limited partnerships and other direct participation programs. In 1990 Mr. Formica became Director of the NASD's Congressional and State Liaison Department which represented the NASD before the United States Congress, the federal banking regulatory agencies and state legislatures and securities administrators. In that capacity he worked with the various committees of the US Congress on legislation and other matters affecting the financial markets and the regulation of those markets. He also worked with state securities administrators and the SEC on coordination of enforcement activities and other areas involving the regulation of brokers/dealers. Mr. Formica retired from the NASD in 1999.
 
Mr. Formica received his Juris Doctor degree from the Washington College of Law at American University and an undergraduate degree from Ohio University. He is a retired member of the New York State Bar. He has been a frequent speaker in programs relating to securities laws and regulations including the American Bar Association, the Practicing Law Institute, the NY Law Institute, the Securities Industry Association, the Real Estate Securities Syndication Institute, the North American Securities Administrators Association and NASD compliance conferences. Mr. Formica's extensive and high level experience in the corporate securities industry and as well as his education in the law and experience in government relations, enable Mr. Formica to make very significant contributions to the Board's decision-making processes especially in matters of securities laws and regulations, and corporate governance.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.
