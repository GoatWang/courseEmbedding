By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

 Leading provider of product development and integrated healthcare services, Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc. Q  held a secondary offering of 10.6m shares, of which they repurchased $300m worth.   Stock Performance    In the last three months, Quintiles' shares have increased roughly 11.57% against the Zacks categorized Medical Services'  sub-industry's loss of 2.58%. The current level is higher than the S&P 500's return of 3.31% over the same time frame. Finally, a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 13.02% instills confidence in investors.    The estimate revision for the stock has been unfavorable. The current quarter has seen seven estimates move south over the last month compared with one movement in the opposite direction. As a result, earnings estimates for the current quarter have declined 4 cents to $1.05 over the same period. Quintiles' carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).             The transaction is expected to close on May 31, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions. The company expects to fund the repurchase with cash on hand and borrowings from its revolving credit facility. As of Mar 31, 2017, the company had $862 million of cash and cash equivalents in its books.    Looking forward, we believe inorganic expansion has acted as a major catalyst for the company. The strategic alliance with DaVita Clinical Research, a wholly owned subsidiary of DaVita HealthCare, is a notable development. From this transaction, Quintiles is expected to gain nephrology expertise and enhance its global delivery capabilities, which will fortify its position in the field of clinical research. The company has 30 years of experience in the field of clinical trial research, especially in therapeutics.    The launch of Continuous Glucose Monitoring service is a major growth driver for Quintiles. Notably, the solution offers innovative and wearable technology for diabetes-focused clinical trials, which is highly exclusive in the market. In this regard, a report by Markets and Markets forecasts that the global market for glucose, dextrose and maltodextrin is projected to reach a worth of $42.20 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 6.7%.   Key Picks    Better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include Luminex Corporation LMNX  , Edwards Lifesciences Corp. EW  and Inogen Inc INGN  . Inogen and Luminex sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Edwards Lifesciences carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” “target,” similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words.

IMS Health and Quintiles caution readers that these and other forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to risks and uncertainties related to (i) the ability to obtain shareholder and regulatory approvals, or the possibility that they may delay the transaction or that such regulatory approval may result in the imposition of conditions that could cause the parties to abandon the transaction, (ii) the risk that a condition to closing of the merger may not be satisfied; (iii) the ability of IMS Health and Quintiles to integrate their businesses successfully and to achieve anticipated cost savings and other synergies, (iv) the possibility that other anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction will not be realized, including without limitation, anticipated revenues, expenses, earnings and other financial results, and growth and expansion of the new combined company’s operations, and the anticipated tax treatment, (v) potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction that could be instituted against IMS Health, Quintiles or their respective directors, (vi) possible disruptions from the proposed transaction that could harm IMS Health’s or Quintiles’ business, including current plans and operations, (vii) the ability of IMS Health or Quintiles to retain, attract and hire key personnel, (viii) potential adverse reactions or changes to relationships with clients, employees, suppliers or other parties resulting from the announcement or completion of the merger, (ix) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the merger that could affect IMS Health’s and/or Quintiles’ financial performance, (x) certain restrictions during the pendency of the merger that may impact IMS Health’s or Quintiles’ ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions, (xi) continued availability of capital and financing and rating agency actions, (xii) legislative, regulatory and economic developments and (xiii) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the proposed transaction, will be more fully discussed in the joint proxy statement/prospectus that will be included in the registration statement on Form S-4 that will be filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction.

The combined company, which will have a market value of nearly $18 billion, will offer drug and medical device makers services ranging from helping run clinical trials to tracking sales once a product has hit the market. The deal underscores the growing importance of information technology and data analytics in medical research and comes at a time when pharmaceutical companies are cutting costs by increasingly outsourcing drug development. While Quintiles is one of the world's largest contract research provider, IMS Health provides market and sales research services to the healthcare industry. The combined company - Quintiles IMS Holdings Inc - will be led by IMS Health Chief Executive Ari Bousbib. Quintiles CEO Tom Pike will become the vice chairman. After the deal, IMS Health shareholders will own about 51.4 percent of the new entity, while Quintiles shareholders will own the rest. Bousbib said it had become hard to identify patients for trial enrollment and create study design as companies develop treatments for complex and rare diseases. "By having data at our fingertips ... we can significantly improve that process and really change the game," Bousbib said on a conference call with analysts. Quintiles will offer 0.384 of its shares, valuing each IMS Health share at $26.53, based on Quintiles' Monday close. Quintiles' shares were down 8.2 percent at $63.41, while IMS Health's shares fell 7.5 percent to $24.85. The offer values the all-stock deal at about $9 billion, based on 339.3 million IMS diluted shares outstanding as of Dec. 31, according to Reuters data. William Blair analysts said initial investor reaction was muted given that neither side was receiving a merger-related premium and that integration risks are usually higher in a merger-of-equals. "There is an interesting strategic case to be made for putting Quintiles and IMS together, particularly for late-stage, post-approval work," the analysts wrote in a note. The merger expands on an existing research agreement between Quintiles and IMS related to clinical trials and "real world" research. The deal is expected to add to the combined company's 2017 adjusted earnings. IMS Health was advised by Goldman Sachs. Its legal adviser was Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Quintiles' financial adviser was Barclays. Its legal advisers were Bryan Cave LLP and Smith, Anderson, Blount, Dorsett, Mitchell & Jernigan.
