WHAT DOG SHOWS ARE ALL ABOUT

 During the past couple of decades, exhibiting purebred dogs has developed into one of the more popular family sports activities in the United States. The entire household can join in the fun and become actively involved in raising, training, feeding, conditioning and grooming just one dog. 
	Since cable TV began telecasting the annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and other major championship events in prime time, interest in dog sports in general has grown dramatically. In 1970 AKC�s annual registration figures exceeded one million for the first time. That year there were 823 AKC All-Breed Shows and 1,700 Specialties, with a combined entry of less than one million dogs. Today there are more than 1,400 All-Breed events, 2,000 Specialty Shows and 2,250 Obedience Trials, with some 40 different titles obtainable in specialized or breed specific events. Approximately two million dogs participate in some kind of official AKC competition annually. More than 20,000 Championships, 10,000 obedience titles and many other titles are awarded annually to successful participants. The United Kennel Club (UKC), Canadian Kennel Club (CKC), the American Rare Breed Association (ARBA) and many international canine organizations conduct competitive events similar to those of the AKC. (See Resources for details.)
	With the introduction of cluster shows in the 1970s (allowing kennel clubs to hold two or more shows on consecutive days at the same venue), the number of events exhibitors could attend annually increased dramatically. It has been estimated that, since their inception, clusters make it 25 to 30 percent easier for dogs to earn titles.
A NEWCOMER CAN SHOW SUCCESSFULLY

	Even so, the cost of employing a professional handler to campaign a top winning Group or Best in Show dog is a tad rich for average folks. Simply attaining a title is easier and cheaper. But many of today�s exhib-itors see the do-it-yourself method as a personally satisfying and less costly alternative.
	Showing dogs can still be an expensive pastime, and all who choose to participate deserve a fair shake. Anyone who believes that it is only the expense of the entry fee that accords exhibitors access to a judge�s opinion is conveniently ignoring the cost of transportation, hotel or motel, possibly lost wages and other incidentals that can make that opinion several times more costly than the average trip to the doctor's office. After all this, exhibitors certainly are entitled to an honest, unbiased appraisal and nothing less. Yet judges are only human and prone to make mistakes. One has to take the good with the bad. 
	Evidence suggests that a significant number of initially enthusiastic newcomers abandon the sport each year as a direct result of disheartening experiences or misadventures in the ring. Fortunately for exhibitors, capricious behavior by judges is not as prevalent or as acceptable today as it was in the past. 
	However, fledgling exhibitors may still find themselves thrust into a seemingly alien environment. First-time exhibitors are often unfamiliar with correct ring procedure. At most shows one can spot bewildered beginners who have no idea how to handle their dogs or conduct themselves in the ring. Why anyone would enter a competitive event without first learning the basics is a mystery. 
	Being unprepared is the ex-hibitor's fault; one cannot fault the system for that. It is true that seasoned show-goers are preoccupied with their own agendas�rarely is helping newcomers high on their priority list. However, during a relatively quiet spell, most experienced breeders and handlers are willing to advise or otherwise help beginners get started. Good timing and a tactful approach will make all difference.
	How can newcomers best learn what they need to know? They would be wise to watch the experts, keep their eyes and ears open, and then copy the winners to the best of their ability�but only if and when it�s right for them to do so. With a reasonably nice dog and sufficient preparation, most rookie exhibitors should be able to compete with confidence and win�but not necessarily overnight. As with most other endeavors, fate favors the ready. The better the preparation, the better the outcome. 
GETTING STARTED 

	In addition to handling technique per se, knowing what pitfalls to avoid in the ring may improve a beginner�s chance of success as much as his or her understanding of basic skills. 
	Showing dogs is one of very few sports where amateurs and pros compete for the same prize. Amateurs and pros coexist in the majority sports from bowling to yacht racing, but few are vying for the same awards the way dog fanciers do. We have no consolation prizes, no "Pro-am," no "Amateur Champions," just "Champions" and wannabes.
	By definition, amateurs pursue a given discipline for personal enjoyment and its recreational benefits, or for intrinsic motivation. Professionals follow similar pursuits to pay the rent, or for extrinsic motivation. The two are in serious conflict.
	Lack of alternatives has exasperated many amateurs over the years, especially when owner-handlers with quality dogs were ousted by pros. Competition may seem unfair at times, and occasionally it is. Favor-itism, bad judging and/or dubious officiating can and does occur, but that applies to all sports. Today�s judges are not as immune to disciplinary action by the AKC as they once were. To some extent, that helps to level the playing field for everyone.
	In the overall scheme of things, it's hard work and experience that favors the pros. Unlike amateurs, most of whom work with their dogs on a limited basis, professionals do so seven days a week. Keeping the dogs in tip-top condition is part of the job. Their livelihoods depend on it.
	Few amateurs are expected to beat the pros in other competitive events, and rightly so. Name your poison: Whether tennis, golf, pool, bowling, running, cycling, chess, games of skill or games of chance, the overall level of ability invariably favors the pros. However, amateur dog handlers who have what it takes can and do prevail. Although not all successful amateurs choose to turn professional, once having attained the required skills many do, thereby restoring the status quo. It happens in every sport.
	Before novice or not-so-novice owner-handlers aspire to dethrone the experts, they must be adequately prepared for the task. How often do low-handicap amateur golfers beat the pros, despite the benefit of a handicap? Not often enough. Yet, illogical as it may be, first-timers will enter the show ring totally unprepared but still hopeful of winning. It will never happen. (If it does, it will surely happen to someone else.)
	Fortunately perhaps, certain breeds tend to favor owner-handlers more than others. Unfortunately, with some exceptions, these breeds are usually the least successful in Group and BIS competition. To play the game effectively and win, one must first know the rules�not the AKC rules, but the rules for winning. Even then, not everyone has the natural talent to become a top handler. Individuals have varying amounts of intuitive ability or raw talent. Exactly how much is real and how much imaginary one never knows without trying.
	A case in point involved a dedicated handling student who worked hard with his English Springer but repeatedly came up short. After sixteen shows without a single ribbon he was ready to quit. To make matters worse, the dog's breeder, probably annoyed for having sold the dog as  "pet quality," kept urging him to stop showing the dog. 
	When his handling instructor disagreed with the breeder, the confused owner asked the pro to take the dog into the ring and settle the dispute. Handled by an expert, the dog won Best of Breed (BB), beating a highly regarded Best in Show winner in the process. "Spike" earned his title with an impressive string of BB wins over numerous champions, placed third in the Group the day he finished and was never shown again.
