You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

AC Kerazyme®


Active Concepts is able to supply a vegan version of AC Kerazyme®, known as AC Vegan Kerazyme®. AC Kerazyme® is an all-natural, formaldehyde-free alternative to the hugely successful Brazilian Hair Straightener. Exposure to formaldehyde solutions raises health concerns and limits the user’s styling options as this technology cannot enhance curl retention. Unlike formaldehyde-based hair straightening systems, AC Kerazyme® is capable of modifying hair shape while protecting it from styling damage. Whether the desire is for smooth, straight hair or voluminous curls, consumers are interested in hair care products that improve ease of styling and shape retention. AC Kerazyme® is an ideal ingredient for use in a wide range of hair care applications. As an added benefit, the botanically derived enzyme and all natural ingredient coincides perfectly with trends for natural and NPA compliant products.






Efficacy Assays




Curl Retention Assay
Assesses the ability of a test material to retain a curly hair style... Read More



Curl Retention Assay
Based on the results, it is clear from viewing the swatches that AC Kerazyme® is capable of retaining curls better than the unloaded vehicle seen in swatch 2. 5% AC Kerazyme® retained curls by 96% whereas the unloaded vehicle only retained them 72% after four hours. For this reason, AC Kerazyme® is an ideal ingredient to add to hair care applications designed to provide curl retention over a longer period.




Straightening Retention Assay
Assesses the ability of a test material to maintain straight, heat styled hair... Read More



Straightening Retention Assay
A half head assay indicated that AC Kerazyme® promotes east of styling, as 1-2 passes with the flat iron are necessary to effectively straighten curly hair. The hair was clearly smoother, straighter and healthier looking than the side that had no treatment prior to using the flat iron. AC Kerazyme® is ideal for the overall straightening process.




Cross Linking Assay

Cross Linking Assay
Shows the cross linking ability of AC Kerazyme® with proteins.




ORAC Assay
Measures a material's potential to protect against oxidative stress or ROS... Read More



ORAC Assay
Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) is a measure of a materials potential to protect against oxidative stress or reactive oxygen species (ROS). AC Kerazyme® demonstrated significant antioxidant activity by reducing the presence of ROS compared with Trolox®, the vitamin E analog.




Heat Protection Assay
Analyzes the heat protection benefits of a material... Read More



Heat Protection Assay
Unlike formaldehyde based hair systems, AC Kerazyme® is an all-natural ingredient that is capable of modifying hair shape while protecting it from styling damage. This unique ingredient consists of a blend of hydrolyzed keratin and Trametes versicolor extract. Trametes versicolor is a type of mushroom that contains an oxidative enzyme called laccase. AC Kerazyme® also helps strengthen hair while protecting it from styling damage. The enzyme is capable of annealing disulphide bonds which help enhance hair strength. The hydrolyzed keratin further enriches and conditions the hair to further optimize its integrity. The purpose of this assay is to analyze the heat protection benefits of AC Kerazyme®.

I purchased a split system A/C unit from Evergreen.  The staff is wonderful.  Jimmy came and advised on how and where we could install the unit in our space.  He told us all the requirements for the electrician to install a separate line and disconnect switch.  The technicians who came to install the unit, Solomon and Vanya, were pleasant, accomodating and cleaned-up.  Everything went very well.

The unit is terrific. Really cools down the space and it is soooooo quiet.

Definitely recommend them.







BEWARE of this company.  They sold we three units to my home and NONE of them have worked properly.  We have complained multiple times and they just hang up on your when you call them.  They avoid my calls now and I have found out that they have sold the same "lemons" to my neighbors.  AVOID using them at all costs.  We even had to pay another company to come and tell us what the problem is since they refused to come back and help.  They were the meanest and nastiest company that I have ever used for AC.  I wish that I had read the other reviews before using them and wasting thousands of dollars.







Terrible company.  Purchased 2 units which were complete lemons and they never worked right.  The people at the company were horrible, nasty individuals and I finally gave up and got rid of my 2 almost new units because they continued to break and the company took no responsibility.  Do not cause yourself the aggravation.  Find another company to buy air conditioning units from.







We had Evergreen/Metro Air LLC came in to service our HVAC and I told them the system needed to be flushed.  They came, didn't do that, just turn on/off the switch and said the HVAC was working.  Yes, it worked for 30mins and it stopped working again.  I've been trying to reach them for a week, they're avoiding and redirecting my call to voicemails.  I spoke with Anthony in the Servicing department and he said he'll investigate and call me back in 30m.  And he never did.  Horrible service, horrible company.  Please don't use them to service your HVAC.







Just The worst. Scroll down and read every real review by all the real users.  I say this because it would be virtually impossible to give more than 1 star when dealing with this company.   Just try and get someone on the phone. Been tryin' for 2 weeks already.    I unfortunately bought my condo with three of these units already there, so I inherited this problem.







Do not ever buy one of their air conditioners.  We purchased 2 roughly 3 years ago, and both of them have failed (by which I mean completely stopped working) at least twice during that time.  One unit caused a large water leak that did extensive damage to our hardwood floor.

The units we replaced were from the late 80's and never failed in 6 years we had them.  The Evergreen A/C's themselves are lemons, but it is the service that is the worst.  

Recently, we had a unit that has failed.  Unable to reach anyone in several attempts via phone, I scheduled an appointment online.  This requires payment in advance via Paypal.  The company took the money, did not call to confirm the appointment, and did not show up.  I scheduled the appointment 2 weeks ago and still haven't had that appointment confirmed or had my original call from prior week returned.  I ended up buying a new A/C from a different company and had to file a complaint with PayPal to get my money back.

Absolutely terrible customer service.  I would give this company negative stars if I could.







Buyer beware. We bought a new construction condo in 2010 that had Evergreen PTAC units installed and they have been a problem for us and most of the other 38 units in the building.  In four years, we've had to call Service three times. The first year was a leaking unit covered under warranty which was good however since then we've racked up over $500 in repairs and now one of the units has completely stopped working and needs to be replaced....after just four years!!! The units are so bad that the guys who come out for the service calls will tell you the Evergreen units made years ago were great but now they are made in China and they are terrible.  Needless to say now that I have to replace the unit I'll be looking for a different brand.







Great Service! The guys who came to fix my air conditioner were very professional and answered all my questions regarding our PTAC unit.
I would diffidently recommend this company.







Wow!  Jimmy and Evergreen are the best!  Great pricing...lightning fast professional installation...great communication...rapid and dependable service.  Jimmy has been awesome.   He stands behind his products 100% and has been a pleasure to deal with.  He will be my first call for all my heating and air conditioning needs.   Thanks Jimmy and Evergreen for a job well done and a very satisfied customer!







When I needed to get an air conditioner in my first apartment, I wasn't sure who to call in Woodside. However, I followed the reviews for Evergreen Products and ended up very satisfied with the service and price. The installer was very helpful and explained to me everything that he was doing so that I wasn't skeptical about his service and I knew exactly what I was paying for. This is something that is important to me because I always like to know where my money is going! As someone who didn't know what to expect, I felt comfortable and at ease throughout the entire process. I also didn't have any problems with my AC unit throughout the summer, and it worked perfectly just as I needed it to for the months of summer when it was very hot. I would recommend Evergreen Products especially to those who are new to buying this type of service.







I had a similar 'no show' experience as previous reviewers. Terrible company and customer service. First it was 'we'll call you right back' to confirm an appointment. They called back four days later. Then I agreed to an appointment time. Took the agreed upon day off to be home, and they never showed. They had even called that morning to ask if 3 hours later would work. No show. No call. This was for a several thousand dollar installation of new AC. Before that even happened I had to repeat my request three times with three different people, providing all measurements and additional details for a quote. All that and they never managed to show up!







I found this company online searching for someone to come work on my AC unit.  I called around to other places and no one could come for almost two weeks.  These guys were able to come the next day and were also very accommodating with my schedule since I couldn't miss work.  They worked fast and even explained what the issue was to me.  No issues with my unit since.







Highly Recommend. Excellent service. Knowledgeable and efficient. Would definitely use again!







Absolutely terrible.  Their PTAC units in my condo have had numerous problems and broken down several times over the past 3 years.  It's a major production to get through to anyone at the company to come fix them.  The head of repair dept does not answer voicemails or return calls.  The people in the other departments are unapologetic and will not help.  I may have to file a claim in small claims court.  Do not buy an air conditioner from this company.







This company has the absolute worst service of any company I have EVER dealt with. We've been stood up once, cancelled on once (for a more important customer,) and have had all around bad service. It has taken a month and a half just to get someone out to look at our air conditioner and when the service guy finally did come he wasn't prepared to fix the problem even though they'd received a detailed description of what was broken weeks before. The only reason we're still dealing with this company is that no other company will repair their equipment. The previous owners of our home have left us stuck with them. Rest assured I will NEVER choose them in the future. Save yourself a huge headache and choose ANY other heating and air company.







Terrible experience.

I made an appointment with this company and took off a half day of work to make sure I would be home when they came by.  I was given a block of time (1-4pm) during which they would come by to service the unit.  When 4pm came and went I called the company to see what was going on.  The lady who answered the phone said she would check on things and call me back except she didn't. I called back and she said she was still checking and that she'd get back to me. 5pm comes and goes and nothing.  I call back and get no response.  So I leave to run an errand and what do I find when I get back?  Just a notice from the company saying "not at home." Naturally I called to complain about the lack of communication but no one called to discuss this issue until I posted a negative review and then it was just to complain about the review!  I feel completely dismissed and will never use this company again.







They are very profession and excellent service!! The call time was faster then expected during this heat wave and they still managed to book me an appointment under a week. Awesome would definitely use this again.







horrific company!!!! stay away. products are defective had to replace my unittwice and still not working. service was even worse.  rude, disrespectful and inexperience waste of money







I moved into a new condo with 3 PTAC units by evergreen and all 3 have some sort of issue. Additionally, they are only covered under warranty for one year from installation so even though I am the first and only person to have lived in my condo, they were not covered because the unit was empty for over a year from purchase. And to add to the insult I was quoted $100 just to make the visit to my apartment to see what was wrong with the units. I would recommend going with another provider that can ensure reliability and a warranty program that actually stands behind the quality of their products.

Do not ever buy one of their air conditioners.  We purchased 2 roughly 3 years ago, and both of them have failed (by which I mean completely stopped working) at least twice during that time.  One unit caused a large water leak that did extensive damage to our hardwood floor.The units we replaced were from the late 80's and never failed in 6 years we had them.  The Evergreen A/C's themselves are lemons, but it is the service that is the worst.  Recently, we had a unit that has failed.  Unable to reach anyone in several attempts via phone, I scheduled an appointment online.  This requires payment in advance via Paypal.  The company took the money, did not call to confirm the appointment, and did not show up.  I scheduled the appointment 2 weeks ago and still haven't had that appointment confirmed or had my original call from prior week returned.  I ended up buying a new A/C from a different company and had to file a complaint with PayPal to get my money back.Absolutely terrible customer service.  I would give this company negative stars if I could.

When I needed to get an air conditioner in my first apartment, I wasn't sure who to call in Woodside. However, I followed the reviews for Evergreen Products and ended up very satisfied with the service and price. The installer was very helpful and explained to me everything that he was doing so that I wasn't skeptical about his service and I knew exactly what I was paying for. This is something that is important to me because I always like to know where my money is going! As someone who didn't know what to expect, I felt comfortable and at ease throughout the entire process. I also didn't have any problems with my AC unit throughout the summer, and it worked perfectly just as I needed it to for the months of summer when it was very hot. I would recommend Evergreen Products especially to those who are new to buying this type of service.

I had a similar 'no show' experience as previous reviewers. Terrible company and customer service. First it was 'we'll call you right back' to confirm an appointment. They called back four days later. Then I agreed to an appointment time. Took the agreed upon day off to be home, and they never showed. They had even called that morning to ask if 3 hours later would work. No show. No call. This was for a several thousand dollar installation of new AC. Before that even happened I had to repeat my request three times with three different people, providing all measurements and additional details for a quote. All that and they never managed to show up!

I found this company online searching for someone to come work on my AC unit.  I called around to other places and no one could come for almost two weeks.  These guys were able to come the next day and were also very accommodating with my schedule since I couldn't miss work.  They worked fast and even explained what the issue was to me.  No issues with my unit since.

Absolutely terrible.  Their PTAC units in my condo have had numerous problems and broken down several times over the past 3 years.  It's a major production to get through to anyone at the company to come fix them.  The head of repair dept does not answer voicemails or return calls.  The people in the other departments are unapologetic and will not help.  I may have to file a claim in small claims court.  Do not buy an air conditioner from this company.

This company has the absolute worst service of any company I have EVER dealt with. We've been stood up once, cancelled on once (for a more important customer,) and have had all around bad service. It has taken a month and a half just to get someone out to look at our air conditioner and when the service guy finally did come he wasn't prepared to fix the problem even though they'd received a detailed description of what was broken weeks before. The only reason we're still dealing with this company is that no other company will repair their equipment. The previous owners of our home have left us stuck with them. Rest assured I will NEVER choose them in the future. Save yourself a huge headache and choose ANY other heating and air company.

Terrible experience.I made an appointment with this company and took off a half day of work to make sure I would be home when they came by.  I was given a block of time (1-4pm) during which they would come by to service the unit.  When 4pm came and went I called the company to see what was going on.  The lady who answered the phone said she would check on things and call me back except she didn't. I called back and she said she was still checking and that she'd get back to me. 5pm comes and goes and nothing.  I call back and get no response.  So I leave to run an errand and what do I find when I get back?  Just a notice from the company saying "not at home." Naturally I called to complain about the lack of communication but no one called to discuss this issue until I posted a negative review and then it was just to complain about the review!  I feel completely dismissed and will never use this company again.

I moved into a new condo with 3 PTAC units by evergreen and all 3 have some sort of issue. Additionally, they are only covered under warranty for one year from installation so even though I am the first and only person to have lived in my condo, they were not covered because the unit was empty for over a year from purchase. And to add to the insult I was quoted $100 just to make the visit to my apartment to see what was wrong with the units. I would recommend going with another provider that can ensure reliability and a warranty program that actually stands behind the quality of their products.

I purchased a split system A/C unit from Evergreen.  The staff is wonderful.  Jimmy came and advised on how and where we could install the unit in our space.  He told us all the requirements for the electrician to install a separate line and disconnect switch.  The technicians who came to install the unit, Solomon and Vanya, were pleasant, accomodating and cleaned-up.  Everything went very well.

The unit is terrific. Really cools down the space and it is soooooo quiet.

Definitely recommend them.







BEWARE of this company.  They sold we three units to my home and NONE of them have worked properly.  We have complained multiple times and they just hang up on your when you call them.  They avoid my calls now and I have found out that they have sold the same "lemons" to my neighbors.  AVOID using them at all costs.  We even had to pay another company to come and tell us what the problem is since they refused to come back and help.  They were the meanest and nastiest company that I have ever used for AC.  I wish that I had read the other reviews before using them and wasting thousands of dollars.







Terrible company.  Purchased 2 units which were complete lemons and they never worked right.  The people at the company were horrible, nasty individuals and I finally gave up and got rid of my 2 almost new units because they continued to break and the company took no responsibility.  Do not cause yourself the aggravation.  Find another company to buy air conditioning units from.







We had Evergreen/Metro Air LLC came in to service our HVAC and I told them the system needed to be flushed.  They came, didn't do that, just turn on/off the switch and said the HVAC was working.  Yes, it worked for 30mins and it stopped working again.  I've been trying to reach them for a week, they're avoiding and redirecting my call to voicemails.  I spoke with Anthony in the Servicing department and he said he'll investigate and call me back in 30m.  And he never did.  Horrible service, horrible company.  Please don't use them to service your HVAC.







Just The worst. Scroll down and read every real review by all the real users.  I say this because it would be virtually impossible to give more than 1 star when dealing with this company.   Just try and get someone on the phone. Been tryin' for 2 weeks already.    I unfortunately bought my condo with three of these units already there, so I inherited this problem.







Do not ever buy one of their air conditioners.  We purchased 2 roughly 3 years ago, and both of them have failed (by which I mean completely stopped working) at least twice during that time.  One unit caused a large water leak that did extensive damage to our hardwood floor.

The units we replaced were from the late 80's and never failed in 6 years we had them.  The Evergreen A/C's themselves are lemons, but it is the service that is the worst.  

Recently, we had a unit that has failed.  Unable to reach anyone in several attempts via phone, I scheduled an appointment online.  This requires payment in advance via Paypal.  The company took the money, did not call to confirm the appointment, and did not show up.  I scheduled the appointment 2 weeks ago and still haven't had that appointment confirmed or had my original call from prior week returned.  I ended up buying a new A/C from a different company and had to file a complaint with PayPal to get my money back.

Absolutely terrible customer service.  I would give this company negative stars if I could.







Buyer beware. We bought a new construction condo in 2010 that had Evergreen PTAC units installed and they have been a problem for us and most of the other 38 units in the building.  In four years, we've had to call Service three times. The first year was a leaking unit covered under warranty which was good however since then we've racked up over $500 in repairs and now one of the units has completely stopped working and needs to be replaced....after just four years!!! The units are so bad that the guys who come out for the service calls will tell you the Evergreen units made years ago were great but now they are made in China and they are terrible.  Needless to say now that I have to replace the unit I'll be looking for a different brand.







Great Service! The guys who came to fix my air conditioner were very professional and answered all my questions regarding our PTAC unit.
I would diffidently recommend this company.







Wow!  Jimmy and Evergreen are the best!  Great pricing...lightning fast professional installation...great communication...rapid and dependable service.  Jimmy has been awesome.   He stands behind his products 100% and has been a pleasure to deal with.  He will be my first call for all my heating and air conditioning needs.   Thanks Jimmy and Evergreen for a job well done and a very satisfied customer!







When I needed to get an air conditioner in my first apartment, I wasn't sure who to call in Woodside. However, I followed the reviews for Evergreen Products and ended up very satisfied with the service and price. The installer was very helpful and explained to me everything that he was doing so that I wasn't skeptical about his service and I knew exactly what I was paying for. This is something that is important to me because I always like to know where my money is going! As someone who didn't know what to expect, I felt comfortable and at ease throughout the entire process. I also didn't have any problems with my AC unit throughout the summer, and it worked perfectly just as I needed it to for the months of summer when it was very hot. I would recommend Evergreen Products especially to those who are new to buying this type of service.







I had a similar 'no show' experience as previous reviewers. Terrible company and customer service. First it was 'we'll call you right back' to confirm an appointment. They called back four days later. Then I agreed to an appointment time. Took the agreed upon day off to be home, and they never showed. They had even called that morning to ask if 3 hours later would work. No show. No call. This was for a several thousand dollar installation of new AC. Before that even happened I had to repeat my request three times with three different people, providing all measurements and additional details for a quote. All that and they never managed to show up!







I found this company online searching for someone to come work on my AC unit.  I called around to other places and no one could come for almost two weeks.  These guys were able to come the next day and were also very accommodating with my schedule since I couldn't miss work.  They worked fast and even explained what the issue was to me.  No issues with my unit since.







Highly Recommend. Excellent service. Knowledgeable and efficient. Would definitely use again!







Absolutely terrible.  Their PTAC units in my condo have had numerous problems and broken down several times over the past 3 years.  It's a major production to get through to anyone at the company to come fix them.  The head of repair dept does not answer voicemails or return calls.  The people in the other departments are unapologetic and will not help.  I may have to file a claim in small claims court.  Do not buy an air conditioner from this company.







This company has the absolute worst service of any company I have EVER dealt with. We've been stood up once, cancelled on once (for a more important customer,) and have had all around bad service. It has taken a month and a half just to get someone out to look at our air conditioner and when the service guy finally did come he wasn't prepared to fix the problem even though they'd received a detailed description of what was broken weeks before. The only reason we're still dealing with this company is that no other company will repair their equipment. The previous owners of our home have left us stuck with them. Rest assured I will NEVER choose them in the future. Save yourself a huge headache and choose ANY other heating and air company.







Terrible experience.

I made an appointment with this company and took off a half day of work to make sure I would be home when they came by.  I was given a block of time (1-4pm) during which they would come by to service the unit.  When 4pm came and went I called the company to see what was going on.  The lady who answered the phone said she would check on things and call me back except she didn't. I called back and she said she was still checking and that she'd get back to me. 5pm comes and goes and nothing.  I call back and get no response.  So I leave to run an errand and what do I find when I get back?  Just a notice from the company saying "not at home." Naturally I called to complain about the lack of communication but no one called to discuss this issue until I posted a negative review and then it was just to complain about the review!  I feel completely dismissed and will never use this company again.







They are very profession and excellent service!! The call time was faster then expected during this heat wave and they still managed to book me an appointment under a week. Awesome would definitely use this again.







horrific company!!!! stay away. products are defective had to replace my unittwice and still not working. service was even worse.  rude, disrespectful and inexperience waste of money







I moved into a new condo with 3 PTAC units by evergreen and all 3 have some sort of issue. Additionally, they are only covered under warranty for one year from installation so even though I am the first and only person to have lived in my condo, they were not covered because the unit was empty for over a year from purchase. And to add to the insult I was quoted $100 just to make the visit to my apartment to see what was wrong with the units. I would recommend going with another provider that can ensure reliability and a warranty program that actually stands behind the quality of their products.

Do not ever buy one of their air conditioners.  We purchased 2 roughly 3 years ago, and both of them have failed (by which I mean completely stopped working) at least twice during that time.  One unit caused a large water leak that did extensive damage to our hardwood floor.The units we replaced were from the late 80's and never failed in 6 years we had them.  The Evergreen A/C's themselves are lemons, but it is the service that is the worst.  Recently, we had a unit that has failed.  Unable to reach anyone in several attempts via phone, I scheduled an appointment online.  This requires payment in advance via Paypal.  The company took the money, did not call to confirm the appointment, and did not show up.  I scheduled the appointment 2 weeks ago and still haven't had that appointment confirmed or had my original call from prior week returned.  I ended up buying a new A/C from a different company and had to file a complaint with PayPal to get my money back.Absolutely terrible customer service.  I would give this company negative stars if I could.

Buyer beware. We bought a new construction condo in 2010 that had Evergreen PTAC units installed and they have been a problem for us and most of the other 38 units in the building.  In four years, we've had to call Service three times. The first year was a leaking unit covered under warranty which was good however since then we've racked up over $500 in repairs and now one of the units has completely stopped working and needs to be replaced....after just four years!!! The units are so bad that the guys who come out for the service calls will tell you the Evergreen units made years ago were great but now they are made in China and they are terrible.  Needless to say now that I have to replace the unit I'll be looking for a different brand.

When I needed to get an air conditioner in my first apartment, I wasn't sure who to call in Woodside. However, I followed the reviews for Evergreen Products and ended up very satisfied with the service and price. The installer was very helpful and explained to me everything that he was doing so that I wasn't skeptical about his service and I knew exactly what I was paying for. This is something that is important to me because I always like to know where my money is going! As someone who didn't know what to expect, I felt comfortable and at ease throughout the entire process. I also didn't have any problems with my AC unit throughout the summer, and it worked perfectly just as I needed it to for the months of summer when it was very hot. I would recommend Evergreen Products especially to those who are new to buying this type of service.

I had a similar 'no show' experience as previous reviewers. Terrible company and customer service. First it was 'we'll call you right back' to confirm an appointment. They called back four days later. Then I agreed to an appointment time. Took the agreed upon day off to be home, and they never showed. They had even called that morning to ask if 3 hours later would work. No show. No call. This was for a several thousand dollar installation of new AC. Before that even happened I had to repeat my request three times with three different people, providing all measurements and additional details for a quote. All that and they never managed to show up!

I found this company online searching for someone to come work on my AC unit.  I called around to other places and no one could come for almost two weeks.  These guys were able to come the next day and were also very accommodating with my schedule since I couldn't miss work.  They worked fast and even explained what the issue was to me.  No issues with my unit since.

Absolutely terrible.  Their PTAC units in my condo have had numerous problems and broken down several times over the past 3 years.  It's a major production to get through to anyone at the company to come fix them.  The head of repair dept does not answer voicemails or return calls.  The people in the other departments are unapologetic and will not help.  I may have to file a claim in small claims court.  Do not buy an air conditioner from this company.

This company has the absolute worst service of any company I have EVER dealt with. We've been stood up once, cancelled on once (for a more important customer,) and have had all around bad service. It has taken a month and a half just to get someone out to look at our air conditioner and when the service guy finally did come he wasn't prepared to fix the problem even though they'd received a detailed description of what was broken weeks before. The only reason we're still dealing with this company is that no other company will repair their equipment. The previous owners of our home have left us stuck with them. Rest assured I will NEVER choose them in the future. Save yourself a huge headache and choose ANY other heating and air company.

Terrible experience.I made an appointment with this company and took off a half day of work to make sure I would be home when they came by.  I was given a block of time (1-4pm) during which they would come by to service the unit.  When 4pm came and went I called the company to see what was going on.  The lady who answered the phone said she would check on things and call me back except she didn't. I called back and she said she was still checking and that she'd get back to me. 5pm comes and goes and nothing.  I call back and get no response.  So I leave to run an errand and what do I find when I get back?  Just a notice from the company saying "not at home." Naturally I called to complain about the lack of communication but no one called to discuss this issue until I posted a negative review and then it was just to complain about the review!  I feel completely dismissed and will never use this company again.

I moved into a new condo with 3 PTAC units by evergreen and all 3 have some sort of issue. Additionally, they are only covered under warranty for one year from installation so even though I am the first and only person to have lived in my condo, they were not covered because the unit was empty for over a year from purchase. And to add to the insult I was quoted $100 just to make the visit to my apartment to see what was wrong with the units. I would recommend going with another provider that can ensure reliability and a warranty program that actually stands behind the quality of their products.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
