Portfolio Management
RhumbLine manages a broad spectrum of passive strategies in both separate client accounts and pooled funds. Our investment team uses modern quantitative tools to manage passive portfolios that closely track any of the standard indexes our institutional investors may choose. We also create customized indexes and portfolios that track those indexes to meet client needs. For many clients we incorporate lists of companies they wish to exclude from portfolios while still seeking to track the unrestricted index.
In addition to managing pension, defined contribution and endowment non-taxable portfolios, these quantitative tools also allow us to effectively manage taxable portfolios. For those portfolios we have the capability to minimize realized gains as well as harvesting gains or losses as needed.
Lastly, RhumbLine offers an enhanced index product, RhumbLine Advisers Multi-Factor Strategy, that seeks to deliver returns that exceed an index while maintaining the same overall characteristics and risk level of the index.
Please note that RhumbLine does not utilize securities lending in any of its commingled index products.

What are analysts saying about Accenture PLC stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Accenture PLC stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "The leading outsourcing and consultancy services provider, Accenture has outperformed the broader market in the last one year time frame. We are positive about Accenture’s latest product additions in the analytics application space, given the increasing demand for digital solutions. Moreover, Accenture’s strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging. The acquisitions have enabled Accenture to enter new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain its leading position. Nonetheless, Accenture’s recent announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results in our opinion. Furthermore, increasing competition from peers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent." (5/30/2017)
2. Cantor Fitzgerald analysts commented, "The initial Digital phase involving customers is maturing. (Click Here for Our Most Recent ACN Note). Digital began with a focus on customers and servicing or interfacing with the customer. Consumers drove the demand. The customer phase continues, but is evolving from the basic servicing of the customer to the full experience. Accenture has acquired capabilities to help them enhance the client experience, which is the next stage of focus for consumers on the Digital front. Digital engagements differ from the traditional Accenture engagements in that they start small and grow rather than being one large project." (5/29/2017)
3. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "A mostly in-line quarter and increases to the low-end of revenue/EPS guides were not enough to satisfy elevated Street expectations. However, an optimistic 2H17 outlook, with broad-based momentum across its business and an expected recovery in 2 of 3 pressured verticals supports sustainable and balanced growth. With leading strength in Digital, Accenture remains a long-term top pick." (3/27/2017)
4. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "ACN missed our/consensus CC rev growth estimates for the second straight quarter. In addition, we thought bookings were weak. However, we believe 2H growth will accelerate from improvement in Energy/Chemicals, easier comps, and more M&A help. We think Accenture is executing a sound and reasonable strategy. However, with approximately 5% organic CC revenue growth, we don't believe multiple expansion is warranted. Further, as we have stated previously, we think margin expansion will be limited, given the growth of digital business and current headcount in GDN relative to total headcount." (3/24/2017)
5. Deutsche Bank AG analysts commented, "ACN reported 2Q17 revs of $8,318m (4.7% Y/Y, ~6% cc) below our est. of $8,369m while EPS of $1.33 beat st. and our est. of $1.30 driven by a lower tax rate ($0.04 benefit). Despite weaker than expected revenues and bookings, ACN believes cc rev growth will improve in 2H17 partly driven by a pick-up in acquisitions. Bookings of $9.2bn (-3% Y/Y) missed st. and our est. of $10.1bn but are expected to be stronger in 2H17 and y-o-y headcount growth inflected slightly up in 2Q17, which bodes well for a slight reacceleration in revenues, in our view. Although consulting moderated in 2Q17 to 5%cc from 7% cc in 1Q17, the company expects growth to improve to mid- to high-single-digits in 2H17 driven by an improvement in strategy and consulting. In addition, 2 of the 3 industries (Energy, Chemicals/ Nat Resources, Communications) which have had negative growth are also expected to turn positive in 2H17. Due to the $0.03 EPS beat, the anticipated rebound in revs, and a lower tax rate, we are raising our FY17/18/19 EPS est. by $0.09/$0.14/$0.11 to $5.91/$6.47/$7.09, respectively and as a result, increasing our TP to $133. Maintain Buy." (3/24/2017)
