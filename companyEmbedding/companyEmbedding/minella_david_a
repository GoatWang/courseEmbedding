	                        Singer Liza Minnelli and her husband David Gest pose for photographers backstage of the "Miracle on 34th Street" concert hosted by radio station WKTU in New York City, December 18, 2002.
	                        
	                    



David Gest, a music producer, reality TV star and former husband of Liza Minnelli, was found dead Tuesday at a London hotel. He was 62.
Gest's friend Imad Handi confirmed his death, remembering Gest as "a natural star and a genuine celebrity."
"David was truly larger than life. He was not just a huge talent and a dear friend but a showbiz icon," Handi said.
The Metropolitan Police force said officers were called to "reports of an unexplained death of a man in his 60s" at the Four Seasons Hotel in London's Canary Wharf on Tuesday morning.
The force said an autopsy would take place "in due course" to determine the cause of death.
Gest and Minnelli married in 2002, at a celebrity-studded ceremony with Michael Jackson as best man and Elizabeth Taylor as maid of honor. They separated in 2003, with Gest accusing his wife of beating him. After a lengthy legal battle, they were divorced in 2007.
Gest remained a friend of Jackson and produced a 2011 documentary about the King of Pop, "Michael Jackson: The Life of an Icon."
Gest gained a following in Britain with appearances on reality TV shows including "Celebrity Big Brother."
He was due to tour the U.K. this summer in a musical show called David Gest Is Not Dead, But Alive With Soul.

Moyer  By Justin Wm. Moyer   April 13, 2016  Follow @justinwmmoyer          Music producer David Gest, who was the former husband of Liza Minnelli, died in London on April 12 at the age of 62. (Reuters)   When Michael Jackson both introduces you to your wife and serves as best man at your wedding, expectations are high. Alas, after David Gest — concert producer, reality TV star and short-time husband of Liza Minnelli — died this week at 62, a large part of his legacy appeared to be his failed marriage. Because, though Jackson is not known for his creative missteps, that marriage failed spectacularly. The King of Pop introduced Gest, the producer of two special concerts and a TV special commemorating the 30th anniversary of Jackson becoming a solo artist, to Minnelli in 2001. Some thought them an unlikely couple. Gest was seven years Minnelli’s junior — in show business, age differences usually go the other way. There were whispers that Gest was gay. There were whispers that he was after Minnelli’s fortune, though the troubled, thrice-divorced daughter of troubled, four-times divorced Judy Garland was struggling with medical problems, weight problems and a history of substance abuse and depression. But Liza was smitten. She had decided to get well, she said, and made some progress — that’s why Gest hired her to perform in Jackson’s 30th anniversary celebration before they were together. Still, she found the impresario gave her a much-needed boost. “I’m the kind of woman who can only go so far without someone saying, ‘Come on, you can make it,'” she told “The View” in 2002. “And that’s what David did. He said, ‘You can do anything.'”   [David Gest, music impresario and ex-husband of Liza Minnelli, dies at 62]   The couple married in 2002.    Liza Minnelli with husband David Gest in 2003. (Sang Tan/AP)  “She’s the most beautiful woman in the world,” Gest said he thought at their wedding — an elaborate, star-studded affair that Donald Trump declared “the best” he had ever attended. “And that this is who I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.” Gest dismissed rumors that he was a gold digger. His bank accounts were already bulging. “I was already set for life when I met her,” he said. “I had just done a Michael Jackson 30th anniversary celebration. We did well over $20 million. And we owned that, Michael and I. She was, as she said in interviews, basically broke. So I didn’t marry her for anything that she could give me as far as financially. I just loved the woman. I mean, I just loved her, unconditionally loved her.” Minnelli, who launched a comeback after the wedding, credited Gest with pressing reset on her career. “Every time I asked David for help … he’d call somebody, he’d know somebody,” she said. “And the encouragement that he gave me really helped.” The era of good feelings would last little more than a circle around the sun. Gest said he thought he could keep Minnelli clean, but he overestimated his influence. “On stage, don’t go near her,” Gest said in 2004 — the year after the pair had filed for divorce, and he had sued Minnelli for $10 million, claiming she beat him so badly he needed to be hospitalized. “She’s the best performer in the world. But when alcohol comes in, start running. Because there’s a demon there, and it goes back to her childhood.” Gest alleged that Minnelli, 5’4″ and closer to 60 than 50, had fists of fury. “She just kept hitting me in the head with her fists, over, and over and over,” Gest said. “The pain was so enormous that I get now 80 shots around the head to deaden the nerves.” One set of blows came in London in June 2003, Gest said, after Minnelli downed a bottle of vodka. “She was saying everything, all the things that she resented me for,” Gest said. “That I used her to become a star.” The couple’s bodyguard, whom Gest allegedly called to stop the attack, remarked: “I’m like, whoa. She can punch.” Minnelli, who denied she had attacked Gest, countersued for $2 million, saying Gest had pocketed money from the comeback tour he had helped put together. But Gest said that was ridiculous, pointing out he had put up significant money for concerts billed “Liza’s Back.” “I bought up the first two nights thinking if you can pack them the first two nights, by the time the reviews came out, she’d be able to sell tickets,” he said. He added: “I didn’t care. It’s my wife. Nobody, nobody would have done that for somebody unless they loved them.” Then things got uglier. Minnelli alleged Gest tried to poison her. Gest said Minnelli gave him herpes. Divorce proceedings dragged on until 2007, when the couple agreed to a no-fault divorce, dropping other litigation. Gest never married again — and neither has Minnelli. Yet. “I will always love her,” Gest said in 2004. “If you even hear I’m getting married, hit me over the head and take me outta there!” Minnelli said in 2012.         national  morning-mix Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false          Please provide a valid email address.

The status of GTCR-backed Aligned Asset Managers is unclear after the departure of CEO Dave Minella, who the firm hired to build the company.
Minella said he left Aligned in August. He currently leads Minella Capital Management, a private holding company looking to invest in financial services.
Aligned doesn’t appear to have replaced Minella, and the company’s website still lists him as CEO.
GTCR hired Minella in January 2011 to form Aligned Asset Managers and committed to invest $200 million in the platform. LLM Capital Partners was a minority investor. GTCR built the company around Minella, a veteran financial services executive who was previously the CEO of Value Asset Management and Lichtenstein Global Trust.
Stamford, Conn.-based Aligned was tasked to invest in asset management deals. The following August, Aligned acquired The Townsend Group, a specialty real estate advisory and investment firm. A meaningful portion of the $200 million went to fund Aligned’s acquisition of Townsend, press reports said.
Aligned has not done any more deals since the Townsend transaction, and it is not pursuing any deals, a source with knowledge of the company said. Townsend, instead, is functioning as a GTCR portfolio company, the person said. Minella sits on Townsend’s board.
Minella said that high prices in financial services prevented Aligned from doing more transactions. “It’s not the right the time to commit more capital into financial services at these prices,” he said.
