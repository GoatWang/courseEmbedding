BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: BPFH) (the "Company" or 
      "BPFH") today announced the appointment of Kimberly S. Stevenson to its 
      Board of Directors. Ms. Stevenson was also elected to the Board of 
      Directors of Boston Private Bank & Trust Company, a wholly owned 
      subsidiary of the Company.
    


      "We are very excited to be able to add a Board member with Kim’s skills 
      to our Board of Directors," said Stephen M. Waters, Chairman of the 
      Board of Directors of the Company and the Bank. “Kim has unparalleled 
      experience in the information technology space where she has been the 
      Chief Information Officer at Intel for nearly four years. With the 
      financial services industry increasingly reliant on technology and 
      capabilities around information technology, we believe Kim will bring 
      exactly the right talent to our Board at this time.”
    

      Clayton G. Deutsch, BPFH Chief Executive, stated “Over the past year, we 
      have made tremendous strides in bringing both highly experienced and 
      technically expert people to our Board. Kim’s deep background in the 
      information technology arena will help us to accelerate our strategy 
      around delivery of extremely high quality products and services in 
      formats and through media that our clients are seeking. She will provide 
      our Company with insights that will help direct our trajectory in mobile 
      banking, information security, overall customer facing applications, and 
      big data, among other things. Kim is also very active in engaging girls 
      and women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) areas, and 
      this is a high priority for our Company. With Kim’s addition to the 
      Board, Boston Private will have women holding 55% of our independent 
      director positions. This election also reflects our continuing 
      commitment to the 2020 Women on Boards campaign. We could not be happier 
      to have Kim join us at this pivotal point in our Company’s history.”
    

      Ms. Stevenson is corporate vice president and Chief Information Officer 
      (CIO) of Intel Corporation, where she has more than 6,000 IT 
      professionals under her leadership. Stevenson currently leads the Intel

      Thought Leadership and Outreach, and she speaks on the topic both 
      internally and externally. She was recognized by STEMconnector® as a 100 
      Diverse Corporate Leader and 100 CIO/CTO for actively contributing to 
      incorporate more diverse STEM professionals and changing the pipeline 
      based on strong STEM education.
    

      Previously, Stevenson held the position of vice president and general 
      manager of Intel's Global IT Operations and Services, where she led both 
      the strategic and tactical support of Intel's worldwide infrastructure 
      components, including data centers, network and telecommunications,

      desk.
    

      Prior to joining Intel, Stevenson spent seven years at the former EDS,

Kimberly S. Stevenson, MBA ’01
Robert J. Swieringa Young Alumni Service Award Recipient

7/1/15


In the business world, Kimberly (Kim) S. Stevenson, MBA ’01, chief information officer and vice president at Intel, has made a splash by being the kind of transformational leader that exemplifies a Johnson MBA. Now known for raising IT’s profile at Intel, she has elevated it to become an integral part of the business rather than simply a support capability.At the same time, Stevenson has been giving back to Johnson — through both funding and time — since she graduated. A contributor at the Tower Club or Dean’s Circle Level annually, she served on the Johnson Advisory Council, 2009-2013. She was selected to receive the Robert J. Swieringa Young Alumni Service Award in recognition of her leadership and alumni engagement. Unable to attend the Alumni Awards gala in New York City to receive her award in person, Stevenson sent her thanks and a brief address to the Johnson community via prerecorded video, in which she said: “I’m honored and humbled to receive this award.”   Upon her promotion in 2012 from VP and general manager of IT operations and services to CIO at Intel, Stevenson set about upgrading IT’s role by deploying advanced machine-learning software to analyze operating and business metrics, and used the findings to recommend new procedures for sales, pricing, and inventory.Within a year, Stevenson’s contributions to the bottom line were apparent to any shareholder looking at Intel’s 2014 annual report: IT was responsible for generating more than $351 million in revenue. (See articles in Forbes, Intel CIO Shakes Up IT's Culture In First 100 Days, and the Wall Street Journal, How Intel’s CIO Helped the Company Make $351 Million). “Information technology has become not only the foundation of how companies run, but in many cases the source of competitive advantage,” said Stevenson. As CIO, she added, she has a top-level view of what works and what doesn’t, at a distance that allows for analysis and reflection. “This creates a unique ability to drive operational improvements in the company that are challenging to implement, but rewarding when done,” she noted. And, as CIO of an organization that itself develops IT products, Stevenson says: “I am able to see five to ten years in the future in terms of what technology will be created — which is exciting!”Stevenson says that her Johnson background has helped her considerably throughout the course of her career. After graduating from Johnson, she joined Hewlett-Packard’s EDS as a vice-president (she had worked as a vice president at IBM before starting her MBA). She moved to Intel in 2009. “The broad general-management skills I learned at Johnson — such as marketing, finance, strategy, supply-chain operations — are enormously helpful in my role,” said Stevenson.That knowledge and those skills set the stage for her recent breakthrough performance at Intel. “As the CIO, you have to have a reasonable understanding of all business functions of the company if you’re going to help them transform,” Stevenson said. “The foundation for this understanding was built at Johnson.”Stevenson has remained ever-appreciative of the Johnson community. She makes an ongoing effort to stay connected — speaking to faculty, networking with alumni, and helping students advance in their careers. Staying in touch with the community, she says, helps her in her everyday endeavors. “I have found that often the best way to solve a problem is to look through a different lens — and your professional colleagues often have the same lens as you,” Stevenson explained. “Having access to the Johnson faculty, research, and alumni make finding a different lens easy.“To me, learning is a lifelong process,” she added. “By staying connected to the school, you’re exposed to different topics and debates through leadership that you will not run into in your daily routine. This is a form of learning that creates a unique perspective and allows you to excel in your professional goals.”

Lenovo Group Ltd. »
While the Lenovo brand came into existence only in 2004, the company has a much longer history. In 1984, Legend Holdings was formed with 25,000 RMB in a guard house in China. The company was incorporated in Hong Kong in 1988 and would grow to be the largest PC company in China. Legend Holdings changed its name to Lenovo in 2004 and, in 2005, acquired the former Personal Computer Division of IBM, the company that invented the PC industry in 1981.

Today, Lenovo is a US$21 billion personal technology company and the world’s second-largest PC vendor. We have more than 26,000 employees in more than 60 countries serving customers in more than 160 countries. A global Fortune 500 company, we have headquarters in Beijing, China and Morrisville, North Carolina, U.S.; major research centers in Yokohama, Japan; Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, China; and Morrisville; and we have manufacturing around the world from Greensboro, North Carolina and Monterrey, Mexico to India, China and Brazil.

We create and build exceptionally engineered personal technology, but we are much more than a tech company. We are defining a new way of doing things as a next generation global company. We have our core strength in China, rapid growth in emerging markets and a unique global footprint. Lenovo builds on its dominant position in China to grow globally. The expansion from East to West— introducing our newest products in China and then spreading across the globe— is a new way of viewing the world, one we believe will be the way of the future.

That means we are years ahead of the game in terms of understanding what it will take to win 5 or even 10 years from now. That focus on the future is based on a strong history of success that is driving results today.

We have momentum. Long the leader in China with more than 30 percent market share in PCs, Lenovo is growing rapidly and winning market share in all parts of the world. Lenovo has realized strong, balanced growth while achieving a number of major breakthroughs. Achieving optimal balance in all that we do is Lenovo’s operating philosophy. This mindset encompasses every aspect of Lenovo’s business, from balancing leadership with consensus-building, to valuing both short- and long-term thinking. As a result, we have created a balanced business model and strategy that take maximum advantage of profit and investment across both core and new businesses.

Lenovo has consistently outgrown the worldwide PC market in unit shipments and gained market share across all geographies, products and customer segments, making it the fastest growing of the four major PC companies in the world for two years running.

    We are the number one PC company in China and now in Japan.
    We are the number one PC company in the world for large business and the public sector.
    We have been the fastest growing major consumer PC brand on the planet in the past year.
    We make the fastest booting notebook in the world. It’s a ThinkPad—and in 18 years, 60 million of them have been sold.
    We make a smart phone in China and every day our app store there delivers more than 25,000 downloads.
    We have launched a family of tablets targeting both the consumer and commercial markets internationally.
    We’re growing in triple digits in the all-in-one market worldwide, funding an application developers’ movement in China, and growing our retail presence from Germany to Japan.

Lenovo’s business is built on product innovation, a highly efficient global supply chain and strong strategic execution. The company develops, manufactures and markets reliable, high-quality, secure and easy-to-use technology products and services for customers who want technology that does more— because people have a lot more to do. Our product lines include legendary Think-branded commercial PCs and Idea-branded consumer PCs, as well as servers, workstations and a family of mobile internet devices, including tablets and smart phones.

We have a long-term goal of becoming the leading personal technology company in the world. We aspire to achieve this goal by leading in three key areas:

    Personal Computers: Lead in PCs and be respected for our product innovation and quality.
    Convergence: Lead the industry with an ecosystem of devices, services, applications and content for people to seamlessly connect to people and Web content.
    Culture: Become recognized as one of the best, most trusted and most well-respected companies to work for and do business with.

And we want to do it the right way— the Lenovo Way— with our own perspective, our own global point of view and our own commitment to building technology for people who view technology as a tool to accomplish great things.
Our Values

At Lenovo we view our culture as a critical asset as important as an effective business model. We call our culture the Lenovo Way, and at its most basic, that culture is reflected in the statement: We do what we say and own what we do.

Our values serve as the foundation of our company and define who we are and how we work. Principal among them are:

    Serving Customers
    Trust and Integrity
    Teamwork Across Cultures
    Innovation and Entrepreneurial Spirit

Our Heritage

Lenovo came about as the result of the merger of two of the most storied companies in technology and business: Legend Holdings in China and IBM’s Personal Computing Division in the United States. The merger was heralded as a watershed event in global business with the potential for integrating two disparate cultures, languages, processes and markets.

As a result, Lenovo embodies unique market possibilities in combining the best of East and West— joining North American and China-based technology players in the creation of a unified global personal technology leader with growing market positions in developed and emerging markets alike.

Everyone at Lenovo takes great pride in our ability to attract top talent from diverse backgrounds, representing a broad collection of nationalities and languages. We view our differences and diversity as a source of strength in building a collaborative culture with one unified language and vision: to build the world’s most exceptionally engineered personal technology products and services.
