Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Key Developments

Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces the Publication of A Preclinical Report
Jul 11 17
Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced the publication of a preclinical report demonstrating that entinostat, Syndax's oral, Class-I histone deacetylase inhibitor, enhances the antitumor effect of PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) blockade through the inhibition of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Researchers tested the effect of combining entinostat with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody that enhances the T cell-mediated antitumor immune response. The studies were conducted in two mouse models of renal cell carcinoma and lung cancer and included a series of in vitro experiments aimed at characterizing the effects of this combined treatment on the myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a highly immunosuppressive population of tumor infiltrating immature myeloid cells. The results indicated that entinostat has an inhibitory effect on MDSC immunosuppressive function both in vivo and in vitro, which results in enhanced anti-tumor activity of the combination.


Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces Results from Phase 2 ENCORE 601 Trial of Entinostat in Combination with Keytruda for the Treatment of Advanced Melanoma
May 17 17
Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced results from the melanoma cohort of the ongoing Phase 2 ENCORE 601 trial of entinostat in combination with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), Merck's anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy, which will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting being held June 2-6, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois. ENCORE 601 (NCT02437136) is a Phase 1b/2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of entinostat in combination with KEYTRUDA in melanoma patients whose disease had progressed despite prior treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. Responses were seen both in patients who had, as well as those who had not, received prior treatment with YERVOY® (ipilimumab) in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy, either (OPDIVO® (nivolumab) or KEYTRUDA). Of note, 1 patient with a confirmed PR converted from a PD-L1 negative, non-inflamed gene signature in a pre-treatment tumor biopsy to PD-L1 positive, inflamed gene signature post-treatment with the entinostat-KEYTRUDA combination. Correlative analyses of peripheral blood and tumor tissue biomarkers across the entire patient cohort are ongoing. The combination of entinostat and KEYTRUDA also appears to have a manageable toxicity profile, with 8 patients having a treatment emergent adverse event with severity of Grade = 3, and with 1 patient discontinuing treatment due to an adverse event (transaminitis that was deemed to be likely related to KEYTRUDA).


Syndax Pharmaceuticals to Present Data from Melanoma Study at 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting
May 17 17
Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has announced that it will present results from the melanoma cohort of the ongoing Phase II ENCORE 601 trial of entinostat in combination with KEYTRUDA, pembrolizumab, Merck's anti-PD-1, programmed death receptor-1, therapy at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, Annual Meeting in
Chicago, Illinois. The Company recently reported that the first cohort of 13 melanoma patients who had progressed on or after prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in ENCORE 601 met the pre-specified objective response criteria, with a minimum of 2 patients demonstrating a confirmed or unconfirmed objective response, to advance into the second stage of the trial. Data from the first cohort of patients indicate that 4 patients achieved an objective response (ORR) by irRECIST criteria (3 patients had a confirmed response; 1 patient had an unconfirmed response; 31% ORR, 95% CI: 9 - 61%). Of the 4 responders, 2 patients had stable disease (SD) and 2 patients had progressive disease (PD) as best response to their prior anti-PD-1 therapy prior to progressing, with a median duration on prior anti-PD-1 therapy of 4.9 months (range 2.7-12.5). Three patients remain on treatment, without progression, as of the data cutoff, 1 with a partial response (PR), and 2 with SD.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $-2.61      Market Cap $285.72 M     Shares Outstanding 22.00 M     Public Float 13.96 M     Yield SNDX has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.     Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (07/14/17)    Shares Sold Short 647,808     Change from Last  -25.81%      Percent of Float 4.64%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.59      Net Money Flow ($)  -149,963    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
