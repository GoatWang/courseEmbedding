			Avalon Advanced Materials: Lithium Hydroxide Product Successfully Tested as Lithium Ion Battery Cathode Material		



                        Lithium                    




Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - July 6, 2017) - Avalon Advanced Materials Inc. (TSX: AVL) (OTCQX: AVLNF) ("Avalon" or the "Company") is pleased to report on the results from laboratory testing of its lithium hydroxide product conducted recently by the National Research Council of Canada ("NRC"). The lithium hydroxide product was made from petalite concentrate using Avalon's proprietary hydrometallurgical process developed for the Separation Rapids Lithium Project, Kenora, ON.
The product sample, technically referred to as Lithium Hydroxide Monohydrate (LiOH.H2O), was evaluated by NRC as a potential feed material for lithium ion battery cathodes. Elemental analysis of Avalon's lithium hydroxide product confirmed that it was of high purity with very minor amounts of non-lithium metal impurities within the range reported by commercial suppliers of battery grade lithium hydroxide materials.
A lithium and manganese-rich nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LMR-NMC) cathode material was synthesised using Avalon's lithium hydroxide product and demonstrated "excellent electrochemical performance" exhibiting a high capacity rate (209 mA/h/g), high initial coulombic efficiency (86%) and very little capacity fade (<1% after 60 cycles): all comparable to the performance of material synthesised from a reference lithium hydroxide product.
NRC reported that the Avalon lithium hydroxide product would be a suitable precursor for the synthesis of lithium and manganese-rich NMC-type cathode materials. Avalon has also identified opportunities to further improve the purity of its initial lithium hydroxide product and will be following up with further testwork in the near future. This work will be supported by funding received from Northern Innovation Program of the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation ("NOHFC") as disclosed in the Company's news release dated June 27, 2017. The Northern Innovation Program is designed to support the development and commercialization of new technologies that will contribute to future prosperity in Northern Ontario.
The Company's Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") disclosed in the news release dated September 27, 2016, outlined a scenario for economic production of a high purity lithium hydroxide product from its concentrate of the lithium mineral petalite using its proprietary hydrometallurgical process. Avalon is now in the process of preparing an updated technical report to reflect the revised mineral resource estimate following the recent drilling program, updated product pricing and modifications to the process flowsheet.
Avalon is now planning to develop a Phase 1 demonstration plant in the Kenora area to not only confirm the efficiency of its proprietary petalite flotation and lithium hydroxide production processes but also to provide large volume trial samples for customers interested in its lithium hydroxide product and other lithium mineral by-products. Avalon is targeting an initial production capacity for the demonstration plant of between 650 and 1,300 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per annum.
The technical information included in this news release has been reviewed and approved by the Company's Senior Vice President, Metallurgy and Technology Development, David Marsh, FAusIMM (CP), and Donald S. Bubar, P.Geo. both Qualified Persons under NI 43-101.

                        Lithium                    




Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 6, 2017) - Avalon Advanced Materials Inc. (TSX: AVL) (OTCQX: AVLNF) ("Avalon" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has received results from recent laboratory testwork on lepidolite (lithium mica) mineralization from the Separation Rapids lithium deposit confirming that a 99.88% pure lithium carbonate product can be made from this material. The work was conducted by Lepidico Ltd., of Perth, Australia ("Lepidico") using its patented L-Max® hydrometallurgical process technology. The results are summarized in more detail in Lepidico's news release dated January 25, 2017 (http://www.lepidico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LPD-170125-L-Max-Delivers-High-Recoveries-and-Battery-Grade-Lithium-Carbonate.pdf).
Avalon and Lepidico have subsequently entered into a non-binding letter of intent ("LOI") under which it is contemplated that Avalon would sell a minimum of 15,000 tonnes per annum of lepidolite concentrate produced from its planned demonstration-scale pilot plant to Lepidico for processing at Lepidico's planned Phase 1 commercial lithium carbonate production facility. Lepidico is currently preparing a Pre-feasibility Study for this plant which it plans to be located near large consumers of lithium battery materials. Lepidico is also planning to complete a definitive feasibility study by December, 2017. Both companies anticipate initiating construction of their respective process plants in 2018.
Avalon's President, Don Bubar commented "We are pleased to have identified a second opportunity to recover a lithium battery material from the Separation Rapids deposit, in addition to the lithium hydroxide product that can be recovered from the known petalite resource as documented in the Company's recent Preliminary Economic Assessment. This gives us potential to increase the recoverable lithium resources in the deposit and serve more markets with our lithium products, as well as other potential by-products such as rubidium and cesium."
Avalon plans to proceed with a winter drilling program by the end of February, 2017 to test known extensions of the Separation Rapids lithium deposit and expand the mineral resource. This will include a number of holes designed to better delineate the lepidolite-bearing sub-zones to the east of the main petalite resource and bring them into the total lithium resources on the property.
The technical information included in this news release has been reviewed and approved by the Company's Senior Vice President, Metallurgy and Technology Development, Mr. David Marsh, FAusIMM (CP), and Donald S. Bubar, P.Geo. both Qualified Persons under NI 43-101. For questions and feedback, please e-mail the Company at This email address is being protected from spambots.

Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - July 6, 2017) - 

Avalon Advanced
Materials Inc.
 (
TSX:
AVL) (
OTCQX:
AVLNF) ("Avalon" or the "Company") is pleased to report on the
results from laboratory testing of its lithium hydroxide product
conducted recently by the National Research Council of Canada
("NRC"). The lithium hydroxide product was made from petalite
concentrate using Avalon's proprietary hydrometallurgical process
developed for the Separation Rapids Lithium Project, Kenora,
ON.
The product sample, technically referred to as Lithium Hydroxide
Monohydrate (LiOH.H
2O), was evaluated by NRC as a potential feed material
for lithium ion battery cathodes. Elemental analysis of Avalon's
lithium hydroxide product confirmed that it was of high purity with
very minor amounts of non-lithium metal impurities within the range
reported by commercial suppliers of battery grade lithium hydroxide
materials.
A lithium and manganese-rich nickel manganese cobalt oxide
(LMR-NMC) cathode material was synthesised using Avalon's lithium
hydroxide product and demonstrated "excellent electrochemical
performance" exhibiting a high capacity rate (209 mA/h/g), high
initial coulombic efficiency (86%) and very little capacity fade
(<1% after 60 cycles): all comparable to the performance of
material synthesised from a reference lithium hydroxide
product.
NRC reported that the Avalon lithium hydroxide product would be
a suitable precursor for the synthesis of lithium and
manganese-rich NMC-type cathode materials. Avalon has also
identified opportunities to further improve the purity of its
initial lithium hydroxide product and will be following up with
further testwork in the near future. This work will be supported by
funding received from 
Northern Innovation Program of the Northern Ontario
Heritage Fund Corporation ("NOHFC") as disclosed in the Company's
news release dated 


June 27, 2017
. The 
Northern Innovation Program is designed to support the
development and commercialization of new technologies that will
contribute to future prosperity in Northern Ontario.
The Company's Preliminary Economic Assessment ("PEA") disclosed
in the news release dated 

September 27, 2016, outlined a scenario for economic production
of a high purity lithium hydroxide product from its concentrate of
the lithium mineral petalite using its proprietary
hydrometallurgical process. Avalon is now in the process of
preparing an updated technical report to reflect the revised
mineral resource estimate following the recent drilling program,
updated product pricing and modifications to the process
flowsheet.
Avalon is now planning to develop a Phase 1 demonstration plant
in the Kenora area to not only confirm the efficiency of its
proprietary petalite flotation and lithium hydroxide production
processes but also to provide large volume trial samples for
customers interested in its lithium hydroxide product and other
lithium mineral by-products. Avalon is targeting an initial
production capacity for the demonstration plant of between 650 and
1,300 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per annum.
The technical information included in this news release has been
reviewed and approved by the Company's Senior Vice President,
Metallurgy and Technology Development, David Marsh, FAusIMM (CP),
and Donald S. Bubar, P.Geo. both Qualified Persons under NI
43-101.

Avalon’s Lithium Hydroxide Product Successfully Tested as Lithium Ion Battery Cathode Material 
InvestorIntel |
        July 06, 2017 |
        No Comments


July 6, 2017 (Source) – Avalon Advanced Materials Inc. (TSX: AVL) (OTCQX: AVLNF) (“Avalon” or the “Company”) is pleased to report on the results from laboratory testing of its lithium hydroxide product conducted recently by the National Research Council of Canada (“NRC”). The lithium hydroxide product was made from petalite concentrate using Avalon’s proprietary hydrometallurgical process developed for the Separation Rapids Lithium Project, Kenora, ON.
The product sample, technically referred to as Lithium Hydroxide Monohydrate (LiOH.H2O), was evaluated by NRC as a potential feed material for lithium ion battery cathodes. Elemental analysis of Avalon’s lithium hydroxide product confirmed that it was of high purity with very minor amounts of non-lithium metal impurities within the range reported by commercial suppliers of battery grade lithium hydroxide materials.
A lithium and manganese-rich nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LMR-NMC) cathode material was synthesised using Avalon’s lithium hydroxide product and demonstrated “excellent electrochemical performance” exhibiting a high capacity rate (209 mA/h/g), high initial coulombic efficiency (86%) and very little capacity fade (<1% after 60 cycles): all comparable to the performance of material synthesised from a reference lithium hydroxide product.
NRC reported that the Avalon lithium hydroxide product would be a suitable precursor for the synthesis of lithium and manganese-rich NMC-type cathode materials. Avalon has also identified opportunities to further improve the purity of its initial lithium hydroxide product and will be following up with further testwork in the near future. This work will be supported by funding received from Northern Innovation Program of the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation (“NOHFC”) as disclosed in the Company’s news release dated June 27, 2017. The Northern Innovation Program is designed to support the development and commercialization of new technologies that will contribute to future prosperity in Northern Ontario.
The Company’s Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) disclosed in the news release dated September 27, 2016, outlined a scenario for economic production of a high purity lithium hydroxide product from its concentrate of the lithium mineral petalite using its proprietary hydrometallurgical process. Avalon is now in the process of preparing an updated technical report to reflect the revised mineral resource estimate following the recent drilling program, updated product pricing and modifications to the process flowsheet.
Avalon is now planning to develop a Phase 1 demonstration plant in the Kenora area to not only confirm the efficiency of its proprietary petalite flotation and lithium hydroxide production processes but also to provide large volume trial samples for customers interested in its lithium hydroxide product and other lithium mineral by-products. Avalon is targeting an initial production capacity for the demonstration plant of between 650 and 1,300 tonnes of lithium hydroxide per annum.
