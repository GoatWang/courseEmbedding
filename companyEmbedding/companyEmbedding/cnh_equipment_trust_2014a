                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Takes Various Rating Actions on CNH Equipment Trust 2014-A



2015-12-08 21:29:00









CHICAGO--Fitch Ratings takes various rating actions on CNH Equipment Trust 2014-A. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this rating action commentary.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
The affirmations of the class A notes and the upgrade to the class B notes reflect loss coverage levels consistent with the ratings of 'AAAsf' and 'AAsf', respectively. The Stable Outlook for the class A notes reflects Fitch's expectation for loss coverage and credit enhancement to continue to improve as the transaction amortizes. Maintaining the Positive Outlook for the class B notes reflects the possibility for positive rating actions in the next 12 to 18 months.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy, which would impact available loss coverage. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage. In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to 1.5x and 2.5x higher of Fitch's base case loss expectation. Initial key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the new issue report published Feb. 10, 2014.
To date, the transaction has exhibited strong performance with losses within Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, continued strong performance for the transaction would most likely result in continued stable ratings. Conversely, a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.
Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of CNH 2014-A can be found in 'CNH Equipment Trust 2014-A - Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.
Fitch has taken the following rating actions on CNH Equipment Trust 2014-A:
--Class A-2 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
--Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
--Class A-4 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
--Class B upgraded to 'AAsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Positive.

Fitch Rates CNH Equipment Trust 2014-C | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates CNH Equipment Trust 2014-C
    





October 23, 2014 04:19 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the CNH Equipment Trust 
      2014-C notes:
    

      --$219,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$280,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$350,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$127,587,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,479,000 class B 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the 
      presale report titled 'CNH Equipment Trust 2014-C', dated Oct. 8, 2014, 
      which is available on Fitch's web site. The presale report details how 
      Fitch addresses the key rating drivers summarized below.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High AG Concentration: The 2014-C collateral pool consists of 91.51% AG 
      and 8.49% CO. While the 2014-C AG concentration is consistent with CNH 
      Industrial Capital securitizations going back to 2009, the AG 
      concentrations in all these transactions are significantly higher 
      relative to CNH Industrial Capital transactions issued prior to 2009, 
      which consisted of approximately 18% - 32% CO.
    

      Consistent Collateral Concentrations: The pool contains 46.23% used 
      equipment and is comparable to the prior transactions, which typically 
      had concentrations ranging from 46.00% - 50.00%. Furthermore, the pool 
      consists of 67.88% annual-pay contracts, which historically have 
      experienced a lower level of losses than other payment types.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Hard credit enhancement (CE) for the 
      2014-C transaction is unchanged from the prior eight transactions. Class 
      A and class B hard CE remains at 4.50% and 2.25%, respectively. Excess 
      spread of 2.10% (per annum [p.a.]) is up from 2014-B's 1.91%. These CE 
      levels are sufficient for the structure to support Fitch's initial base 
      case proxy of 1.15% for the rating levels listed above.
    

      Quality Origination, Underwriting, and Servicing: CNH Industrial Capital 
      has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and 
      servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of 
      securitized trusts and the managed portfolio.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings to increased losses over the 
      life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display 
      limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing limited 
      impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of at least two 
      rating category under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated Oct. 8, 2014. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'CNH Equipment Trust 2014-C - Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated April 17, 2012.

      presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com'

Fitch Affirms CNH Equipment Trust 2014-C | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms CNH Equipment Trust 2014-C
    





September 23, 2015 11:44 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings takes various rating actions on CNH Equipment Trust 
      2014-C. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this ratings 
      action commentary.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations of the class A and the upgrade to the class B notes 
      reflect loss coverage levels consistent with the ratings of 'AAAsf' and 
      'AAsf', respectively. As of the September 2015 reporting period, 
      cumulative net losses totaled 10 basis points, and as such, the 
      transaction is extrapolating below Fitch's initial base case loss proxy. 
      The Stable Outlook for the class A notes reflects Fitch's expectation 
      for loss coverage and credit enhancement to continue to improve as the 
      transaction amortizes. The Outlook revision to Positive for the class B 
      notes reflects the possibility for positive rating actions in the next 
      12 to 18 months.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy, which would impact available loss coverage. Lower loss 
      coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks, depending on the 
      extent of the decline in coverage. In Fitch's initial review of the 
      transaction, the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to 1.5x 
      and 2.5x higher of Fitch's base case loss expectation. Initial key 
      rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the new 
      issue report published Oct. 8, 2014.
    

      To date, the transaction has exhibited strong performance with losses 
      within Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss coverage and 
      multiple levels. As such, continued strong performance for the 
      transaction would most likely result in continued stable ratings. 
      Conversely, a material deterioration in performance would have to occur 
      within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the 
      outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of CNH 
      2014-C can be found in 'CNH Equipment Trust 2014-C - Appendix'. These 
      R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed 
      in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement 
      Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 
      2015.
    

      Fitch has taken the following rating actions on CNH Equipment Trust 
      2014-C:
    

      --Class A-2 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B upgraded to 'AAsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook revised to Positive 
      from Stable.
