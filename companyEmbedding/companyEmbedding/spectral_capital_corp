Spectral Capital Corporation: Letter to Shareholders | Business Wire


























































      Spectral Capital Corporation: Letter to Shareholders
    



      Spectral Capital Corporation: Letter to Shareholders
    

      Update on portfolio companies: Monitr, Noot, Kontexto
    





May 06, 2014 08:42 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spectral Capital Corporation, (FWB:F3SN) (OTCBB:FCCN)
    

      Dear Shareholders,
    

      Over the course of this year significant progress has been made in the 
      development of Spectral's portfolio companies making Spectral well 
      positioned for take advantage of tech's market expansion. Spectral's 
      investment portfolio represents Mobile Search, Data Analysis / Big Data 
      and Mobile Applications, industry hot beds of growth and robust M&A 
      activities that are expected to continue through the foreseeable future. 
      The teams we have under the Spectral umbrella have delivered on the 
      goals we have set, on time and within budget, and to the highest 
      quality. We have high expectations for success to continue to prosper 
      and grow for each of our enterprises. Today, I would like to take this 
      opportunity to share with you some accomplishments year-to-date as well 
      as our targets for the remainder of 2014.
    

      Monitr, our newest acquisition and we believe our most ambitious project 
      yet, is a financial data services company. Currently in the product 
      development stage, Monitr's technology combines big data, machine 
      learning and predictive analytics. The service will provide finance 
      professionals, developers, researchers and investors with new tools and 
      data to improve their understanding of past, current and possible future 
      market conditions and behaviors. More information will be communicated 
      later in the second quarter and beta launch is expected in late third 
      quarter.
    

      Noot is a mobile search company that went from concept to market in less 
      than one year. The team successfully launched apps for Apple iOS and 
      Android devices, including tablets, gaining access to over 90% of mobile 
      users. The Noot app is a fast, easy to use news service that combines 
      search and learning technology to deliver a truly personalized 
      experience. Noot's search technology is highly differentiated, as it 
      extensively utilizes the mobile device it is installed on and reduces 
      the need for centralized processing and storage - providing enormous 
      economies of scale and minimal capital expense as the user base expands.
    

      Kontexto, a data analytics company, turned its first profit in 2013 and 
      expects to increase its revenues over the course of 2014. Their flagship 
      product Publishflow(R) continues to increase its market share and 
      revenue base. Kontexto also delivered custom product and analytic 
      services alongside partners in the global Healthcare and Education 
      marketplaces.
    

      We expect that our current and future planned initiatives will increase 
      Spectral's value and asset base and benefit our shareholders. We are 
      pleased with the developments so far and aim to continue to foster more 
      growth and development over the coming months. We are also reviewing new 
      candidates for future acquisitions and will be announcing any 
      developments should they occur.
    

      Warm regards,
    

      Jenifer Osterwalder
    

      President/CEO
    

      Spectral Capital Corporation

      Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E 
      of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) concerning future 
      events and the Company's growth and business strategy. Words such as 
      "expects," "will," "intends," "plans," "believes," "anticipates,"

      expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
      Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such 
      forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given 
      that such expectations will prove to have been correct. These statements 
      involve known and unknown risks and are based upon a number of 
      assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant 
      uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the control of 
      the Company. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed 
      or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause 
      actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, 
      changes in the Company's business; competitive factors in the market(s) 
      in which the Company operates; risks associated with operations outside 
      the United States; and other factors listed from time to time in the 
      Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The 
      Company expressly disclaims any obligations or undertaking to release 
      publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements 
      contained herein to reflect any change in the Company's expectations 
      with respect thereto or any change in events, conditions or 
      circumstances on which any statement is based.

Spectral Capital Corp.: An E-Mail Promoted Company Which Could Rapidly Drop 70% Or More - Spectral Capital Corp. (OTCMKTS:FCCN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Spectral Capital Corp.: An E-Mail Promoted Company Which Could Rapidly Drop 70% Or MoreNov.22.14 | About: Spectral Capital (FCCN) Investor Protection Association Short onlySummaryWe have received numerous e-mails touting FCCN from stock promoters who have been paid to promote it.The timing of the email messages promoting FCCN coincides with what seems to be an abnormal rise in the price and trading volume of the stock.There are shares of FCCN out there held by promoters or a third party, ready to be dumped into the market.According to the company's income statement, its current financials and future seem extremely bleak.We have not contacted the company, but there is no phone number listed on the FCCN website online contact form, which raises further questions about the legitimacy of the company.Note: This article is about a nano-cap stock. While all investments are risky, nano-cap stocks are among the most risky. Among nano-cap stocks, the most risky stocks are those which are subject to promotional campaigns (such as Spectral Capital Corp. (OTCQB:FCCN)). They are also among the most illiquid stocks, usually having a large spread between the bid and ask at any given moment. Quite often, it occurs that the illiquidity of these stocks does not allow a trader to rapidly close or open a position. FCCN is no exception to that. FCCN is a nano-cap stock which is traded on the OTC Markets and priced well below the $1 mark. The readers of this article should be highly aware of the aforementioned facts prior to undertaking any action based on the content of this article.
Introduction
Spectral Capital Corp. is a company trading at a price which has recently ran from a low of $0.182 to a high of $0.335 in just a few days. In this article, we will outline the facts which are, in our opinion, related to the sudden increase in the price of this usually thinly-traded, low volume stock.
The Promotion
The trading volume of FCCN set a record on November 19th, reaching an all-time high of more than one million shares. On that very day, the price of FCCN has experienced a sharp increase. Not surprisingly, these signs of unusual stock price and volume activity have occurred exactly a day after the day on which we received a number of promotional emails from various stock promoters, touting the stock (which happened on November 18th). Obviously, we do not consider the emails being sent out and the sudden rise in volume and price to be a coincidence.


The Reality: Zero Revenue, Negative Net Income, Huge Dreams?
As it often happens with aggressively promoted companies, a glimpse at the balance sheet is often enough to reveal a grim and bleak picture. It seems that Spectral Capital Corp. is of no exception to that rule.
In our opinion, it is clear that the market capitalization, let alone current price, of FCCN has nothing in common with the stock's true value. If we take a look at FCCN's income statement, we would see that the company's revenue has remained exactly zero during the entire year of 2014, while its net income has remained negative during that period of time:

It is based on the aforementioned data that we firmly believe that FCCN's current line of business involves having its shares promoted and sold at over-inflated prices, rather than delivering or attempting to deliver a true product to the market. But why, you ask?
The Reason
Why would any company need to have its stock ticker advertised? That is the most important question an investor should ask himself prior to buying a promoted stock. The answer for this hides, of course, in the small print. Let us have a look at some of the disclaimers found in the promotional emails touting FCCN which we've received:


In simple, plain English: someone - may it be the promoter sending out the email message or a third party which had paid the promoter in cash for sending the message - is holding shares of FCCN and plans to get rid of them ("dump" them) in the open market. Therefore, our conclusion is that the promotional email's sole purpose was to have unsuspecting investors buy the stock at artificially heightened prices, while the promoters (or third party) unload their shares upon them.
Conclusion
It is based on the aforementioned facts and analysis presented in this article that we hold the opinion that FCCN shares are essentially worthless. We believe that the recent increase in the price of the stock has been a direct result of email messages being sent out by stock promoters in massive quantities, touting investors to buy the stock. This practice is well known (see Pump and Dump) and is done exclusively for one reason only - so the insiders can unload ("dump") their shares (which they had previously acquired for almost free) in the free market onto unsuspecting investors, while taking advantage of the stocks' inflated price. In view of that, we would recommend any investor who had purchased shares of the company to liquidate his entire position immediately. Even a small weakness in price could mean that the dump is nearing.
Our Recommendation
"Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man" - Friedrich Nietzsche
For longs: If you are long the stock, get out immediately. It is with full confidence we believe that every upward movement in the stocks' price is merely temporary, as it will never repeat its previous highs. We believe FCCN has a price target of around $0.01, which it is likely to reach in the upcoming weeks (or months at most). If you have already accrued losses on the stock, sell now so as to avoid additional losses. Do not persuade yourself into thinking the stock price will come back to its previous highs. Do not have hope leaving you holding the bag as it has happened to far too many. We believe FCCN's stock price will drop 70% or more in the following weeks. Cut your losses by selling now.

"Look at market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy; profit from folly rather than participate in it" - Warren Buffett
For shorts: Bearing the aforementioned facts in mind, we believe sophisticated investors will quickly apprehend the idea that shorting FCCN may be a lucrative opportunity, as we are convinced that the potential downside for FCCN is substantial. If you are able to locate borrows, we would advise shorting FCCN, as its price may prove to be highly inflated.
