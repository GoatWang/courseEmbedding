Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 17, 2017) -
Abattis Bioceuticals Corp. (OTCQB: ATTBF) (CSE: ATT) (the 
"Company" or 
"Abattis") is pleased to announce that it has
obtained Depository Trust Company ("DTC") eligibility in the United
States ("US").
The DTC is a stock depository and facilitates electronic trading
in the US. When shares are DTC eligible, trades are completed
electronically in a more cost effective and timely method for
settlement. Shares that are DTC eligible often increase trading
volume. In addition, DTC eligibility addresses the issue that many
US firms have that prohibit trading in shares that are not DTC
eligible. As Abattis moves forward with its business plans, DTC
eligibility will extend its reach to a broader audience of
investors, setting the stage for exposure on an international
scale.
"We have been working toward DTC eligibility for the past few
months with the focus on being more accessible to US investors and
financiers. We are pleased to continue to better service our US
investor base, which represents a large portion of our shareholder
support," says Rene David, Chief Operating Officer of Abattis.
The Company has been working to grow its sales through its
subsidiary, Vergence Visionary Bioceuticals Corp., dba Vergence
Naturals™ and is ramping up its sales and client base in its
subsidiary, Northern Vine Canada Inc., dba Northern Vine Labs™.
Abattis is also in the late stages of its first formulation and
eagerly awaits the delivery of its first two machines from Suzhou
Raybot Material Tech Corp. ("Raybot"). In addition to this organic
growth the Company is also working on several potential
acquisitions to further fuel its growth.
"DTC eligibility will provide Abattis with increased visibility
and convenience for US investors. We anticipate that our
shareholders will benefit from increased liquidity, larger
shareholder base and increased exposure," said Abattis President
and CEO, Robert Abenante. "As we work diligently to create growth
in our company and strive to become a leading service provider in
the cannabis industry, we aim to reach as many people as
possible."

Abattis Bioceuticals Corp.: BioCell Labs Initiates Product Development

        No Comments


February 10, 2015 (Source: Marketwired) — Abattis Bioceuticals Corp. (the “Company” or “Abattis”) (OTCQX:ATTBF) (CSE:ATT), a specialty biotechnology company with capabilities through its wholly-owned subsidiaries of cultivating, licensing and marketing proprietary ingredients, bio-similar compounds, patented equipment and consulting services to medicinal markets in North America, would like to announce that through it’s wholly owned subsidiary, Biocell Labs, Inc., a Marketing agenda to deliver Hemp-based nutraceutical supplements to the licensed health care provider marketplace. Currently, the wholly owned subsidiary has 13 proprietary formulations for out-licensing to cosmetic, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical companies.
Brazos Minshew, president of BioCell Labs, Inc. explains “There are four major pathways for nutraceutical distribution. The top tier is always the professional marketplace, where nutraceutical sales representatives call on licensed healthcare providers and educate them on the medical application of herbal medicines. These products are always governed by Government regulatory agencies, such as Natural Health Products – Canada. The physician or other licensed provider then makes the determination as to whether or not the nutraceutical will benefit the patient.”
Minshew explains that other nutraceutical distribution channels include Direct Response advertising (including internet sales), Direct Sales associations and the Retail marketplace, including brick-and-mortar vitamin stores, pharmacies or dispensaries.
“Our nutraceutical products are really potent, powerful extracts of classic herbal medicines. For example, Actaea racemosa is known to reduce nerve pain and the pain associated with osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as anxiety. As such, these formulas may be appropriately applied to improve the health and wellbeing of people suffering from a host of physical and emotional imbalances” Minshew says.
This announcement follows an agreement reached with Empirical Labs of Ft. Collins, Colorado for the exclusive use of patented liposome technology. “Liposomes are related to transport molecules that dramatically improves nutrient absorption into the cells of humans and animals. This has the effect of making the herbal remedies even more powerful and effective” states Emek Blair, Ph.D.
Next steps for BioCell Labs, Inc. and Abattis BioCeuticals Corp. is to license these nutraceuticals through Health Canada’s nutraceutical application process, then to craft legally-compliant literature to be used in training the licensed healthcare providers, to partner with a distribution channel and train their sales team, to craft marketing literature and finally to produce the products themselves.

    }These products will be available to the public through licensed healthcare providers in Canada and the USA. Product launches are scheduled early in Q2, 2015, “In order to launch our products correctly, the company, rescheduled the launch date to make sure our partners are aligned, so that we can ensure a proper role out in a timely basis”
