 Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors Expands Independent Broker-Dealer Distribution Channel with Series of New Hires 



in Press Releases 
21 Mar 2016 

Highland Capital Management attracts experienced wholesalers with diverse product offerings for growing independent channel
DALLAS, March 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P., the retail affiliate of Dallas-based investment management firm Highland Capital Management, L.P., is strengthening its commitment to serving the independent broker-dealer (IBD) sales channel with a series of new hires, adding 14 IBD sales professionals in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 alone.
Highland’s IBD sales team represents a broad spectrum of products both from Highland Fund Advisors and from affiliates NexPoint Advisors, L.P., NexPoint Capital, Inc. and NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P. Products include non-traded business development companies (BDCs), REITs, mutual funds and ETFs. The firm also expects to roll out a series of interval funds later this year.
“The diverse product offerings we have across the Highland and NexPoint platforms are a significant draw for experienced wholesalers,” said Brad Ross, president of Highland Funds. “The opportunity to represent this broad range of products has been a key factor in attracting top talent and growing our IBD sales team.”
Among that top talent is PJ McDaniel, managing director and head of IBD sales, who joined Highland in October 2015 and has served as a catalyst for the firm’s growth in this area. His background includes more than a decade of experience in the independent channel, which most recently involved building a team of wholesalers at SC Distributors to represent a series of non-traded products.
“We’ve been gaining momentum in the IBD distribution channel that we expect to continue throughout the year,” said McDaniel, who has brought on 10 sales directors and three sales consultants since joining the firm himself. “We’ve already expanded from seven to 15 territories and have several product launches on the horizon that will certainly fuel our growth. And with new hires from the non-traded, liquid alternatives and variable annuity sectors, among others, we continue to build an impressive team with backgrounds as diverse as our product offerings.”
Highland has served the IBD channel since 2013; however, the firm began reinforcing its efforts in the channel last year in response to the expanding role of independents within the advisor network and evidence of that trend intensifying.
The expanded IBD channel presence complements the sizeable, existing presence that Highland has built in the traditional wirehouse channel since 2004.

Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P. Announces Favorable Claim for Highland Floating Rate Opportunities Fund | Business Wire
























































Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P. 
      Announces Favorable Claim for Highland Floating Rate Opportunities Fund






August 29, 2014 05:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P. announces that Highland 
      Floating Rate Opportunities Fund (HFRZX) (“HFRZX” or the “Fund”) expects 
      to benefit from an outstanding claim in favor of the Fund in an amount 
      up to $20.5 million, subject to the final calculation. We do not have an 
      anticipated date in which these amounts will be received by the Fund.
    

      The Fund aims to provide investors with alpha beyond the benchmark index 
      by balancing assets across three investment areas. These areas encompass 
      senior bank loans, CLOs and distressed or restructured debt. This 
      differentiated management style helps reduce the fund’s correlation not 
      only to the equity and fixed income markets but also to the broader bank 
      loan category.

Some funds maintain a fixed allocation proportion to specific asset classes while others actively manage the proportional composition of the portfolio in response to macro‐economic conditions and/or changes in investment markets. Click on the link below to learn more about Highland’s Asset Allocation fund.

EXCHANGE‐TRADED FUNDS – ETFs
Exchange-traded funds are securities that track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund.  An ETF trades like a stock on an exchange so its net asset value (NAV) is not calculated every day like a mutual fund. ETFs experience price changes throughout the day as they are bought and sold.  Highland’s exchange‐traded fund seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the Markit iBoxx Liquid Leveraged Loan Index (the “Underlying Index”).

Fund Overview
Investment Objective
The investment objective of the Highland Floating Rate Opportunities Fund is to provide a high level of current income, consistent with the preservation of capital.
Attractive Alternatives for Income-Oriented Investors

High income potential in all markets
Yields that reset when short-term interest rates move, which may mitigate price declines in a rising short-term interest rate environment
Low correlation to other asset classes
Access to one of the largest and most experienced senior loan managers
Most fixed rate securities experience price declines when interest rates rise. Floating Rate Senior loans are different.

They are short-duration, floating-rate securities. So, as interest rates rise, yields on bank loans increase, while their short duration helps keep prices relatively stable.

The performance data quoted here represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Highland Funds carefully before investing. A prospectus with this and other information about Highland's mutual funds can be found on the Literature tab above. You may also obtain a prospectus for our mutual funds by calling 877-665-1287. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
*The total annual operating expenses of the Fund are Class A 1.73%, Class C 2.23%, Class Z 1.38%. Class A Max Sales Charge: 3.50%. Class A Max Sales Charge: 3.50%. Class C Contingent Deferred Sales Charge (“CDSC”) is 1% within the first year from each purchase. Class C performance results shown include CDSC. Performance results reflect any contractual waivers and/or reimbursements of fund expenses by the Advisor. Absent this limitation, performance results would have been lower.
Non-Payment Risk. Senior Loans, like other corporate debt obligations, are subject to the risk of non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal. Non-payment would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the Senior Loan experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the NAV of the Fund.
Credit Risk. The Fund may invest all or substantially all of its assets in Senior Loans or other securities that are rated below investment grade and unrated Senior Loans deemed by Highland to be of comparable quality. Securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as “high yield securities” or “junk securities.” They are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuing company’s continuing ability to meet principal and interest payments. Investments in high yield Senior Loans and other securities may result in greater NAV fluctuation than if the Fund did not make such investments.
Senior Loans Risk. The risks associated with senior loans are similar to the risks of below investment grade securities in that they are considered speculative. In addition, as with any debt instrument, senior loans are also generally subject to the risk of price declines and to increases in prevailing interest rates. Senior loans are also subject to the risk that, as interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases, which may also increase the risk and rate of default. In addition, the interest rates of floating rate loans typically only adjust to changes in short-term interest rates; long term interest rates can vary dramatically from short term interest rates. Therefore, senior loans may not mitigate price declines in a rising long-term interest rate environment.
Risk of Restrictions on Resale. Senior Loans may not be readily marketable and may be subject to restrictions on resale. As a result, the ability of the Fund to dispose of its investments in a timely fashion and at an advantageous price may be restricted.
Ongoing Monitoring Risk. On behalf of the several Lenders, the Agent generally will be required to administer and manage the Senior Loans and, with respect to collateralized Senior Loans, to service or monitor the collateral.
Sector Concentration Risk. The fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in a single sector. As a result the Fund’s investment in fewer sectors may result in the Fund’s shares being more sensitive to the economic results and other risks specific to those sectors. An investment in the Fund could fluctuate in value more than the investment in a more diversified fund.

Fund Overview
Investment Objective
The Global Allocation Fund, managed by James Dondero, invests primarily in U.S. and foreign equity and debt securities that the portfolio manager considers to be undervalued by the market but have solid growth prospects. Undervalued securities are those securities that are undervalued relative to the market, their peers, their historical valuation or their growth rate.

Low Correlation to Domestic Equity Markets
The Fund seeks above-average risk-adjusted total returns by investing in U.S. and foreign equities and fixed income securities, along with select alternative investments in the pursuit of long-term capital growth and future income.

Rigorous top down allocation process
Collaborative management structure where highly experienced portfolio managers in six disciplines bring their best ideas to the fund
Global thematic investment style
Extensive analytical support
Relative value discipline
May compliment a portfolio of only U.S. securities as well as one of only stocks or fixed income

The performance data quoted here represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.
Note: Effective April 9, 2013, Highland Core America Equity Fund was renamed Highland Global Allocation Fund. At the same time, Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P. became the sole Adviser to the Fund and the Fund no longer utilizes a sub-adviser. In addition to these changes, the Fund’s investment strategies were revised and the Fund will no longer invest at least 80% of its assets in domestic equity securities. For more information, please view the Fund’s prospectus which can be found under the “Literature” tab above or by calling 877-665-1287.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Highland Funds carefully before investing. A prospectus with this and other information about Highland's mutual funds can be found on the Literature tab above. You may also obtain a prospectus for our mutual funds by calling 877-665-1287. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
1. The Advisor has contractually agreed to limit the total annual operating expenses of the Fund to 0.90% of average daily net assets of the Fund. The expense cap will continue through at least January 31, 2018.
*The maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 5.75%.
Securities Market Risk. The value of the securities may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities market generally. A general downturn in the securities market may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously, although equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities.
Value Investing Risk. The risk of investing in undervalued stocks that may not realize their perceived value for extended periods of time or may never realize their perceived value.  Value stocks may respond differently to market and other developments than other types of stocks.
Foreign Investment Risk. The risk that investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockages and political changes of diplomatic developments. The cost of investing in many foreign markets are higher than the U.S. and investments may be less liquid.
Currency Risk. The risk that the values of foreign investments may be affected by changes in the currency rates or exchange control regulations. If a foreign currency weakens against the U.S. dollar, the value of a foreign investment denominated in that currency would also decline in dollar terms.
Credit Risk. The risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty of a derivatives contract or repurchase agreement, is unable or unwilling (or is perceived to be unable or unwilling) to make a timely payment of principal and/or interest, or to otherwise honor its obligations.
Interest Rate Risk. The risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in interest rates. A fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration.
Derivatives Risk. The risk that an investment in derivatives may not correlate completely to the performance of underlying securities and may be volatile, and may result in a loss greater than the principal amount invested. Equity derivatives may also be subject to liquidity risk as well as the risk the derivative may be different than what would be produced through the use of another methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations.

Highland Capital Management Launches Three ETFs To Expand Suite Of Alternative Beta Products






Business Wire




Jun 1, 2015 9:08 AM EDT













 




























































  Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors L.P. ("Highland") announces the launch of three new exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") that leverage the industry-leading indices and research from HFR (Hedge Fund Research, Inc.). The three ETF products designed in collaboration with HFR will be the first of their kind to replicate aggregate hedge fund positions in an ETF and will trade on the New York Stock Exchange, with trading commencing today.  The three new ETFs represent the firm's continued expansion of its alternative beta product suite and mark the first of 17 new ETFs for the firm. The three initial ETFs are:   Highland HFR Global ETF (NYSE: HHFR)   Highland HFR Event Driven ETF (NYSE: DRVN)   Highland HFR Equity Hedge ETF (NYSE: HEDG)    "The launch of these three ETFs further demonstrates Highland's commitment to pursuing alternative beta solutions," said Ethan Powell, Chief Product Strategist for Highland. "We believe that our collaboration with HFR on these new products illustrates Highland's dedication to delivering tailored products to meet investor demands."  In conjunction with the recently launched Highland Alternative Investors platform, the launch of these funds underscores Highland's expanding efforts to offer differentiated strategies at a competitive price.  "With more than $320 million already invested in our first ETF, SNLN, we believe there is market appetite for alternative income and uncorrelated alternative beta products that satisfy investors' concerns over interest rate and equity volatility," explained Powell.  "ETFs are a cost-effective option for investors looking to benefit from exposure to alternative investment strategies," said Kenneth Heinz, President of HFR, the established global leader in the indexation, analysis and research of the global hedge fund industry. "We're excited to combine HFR's expertise in indexing and research with Highland's experience in creating and marketing investment strategies to offer these innovative new investment products."

Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors Expands Independent Broker-Dealer Distribution Channel with Series of New Hires

Highland attracts experienced wholesalers with diverse product offerings for growing independent channel




Mar 21, 2016, 8:00am EDT














DALLAS, March 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P., the retail affiliate of Dallas-based investment management firm Highland Capital Management, L.P., is strengthening its commitment to serving the independent broker-dealer (IBD) sales channel with a series of new hires, adding 14 IBD sales professionals in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 alone. 

Highland's IBD sales team represents a broad spectrum of products both from Highland Fund Advisors and from affiliates NexPoint Advisors, L.P., NexPoint Capital, Inc. and NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P. Products include non-traded business development companies (BDCs), REITs, mutual funds and ETFs. The firm also expects to roll out a series of interval funds later this year. 
"The diverse product offerings we have across the Highland and NexPoint platforms are a significant draw for experienced wholesalers," said Brad Ross, president of Highland Funds. "The opportunity to represent this broad range of products has been a key factor in attracting top talent and growing our IBD sales team." 
Among that top talent is PJ McDaniel, managing director and head of IBD sales, who joined Highland in October 2015 and has served as a catalyst for the firm's growth in this area. His background includes more than a decade of experience in the independent channel, which most recently involved building a team of wholesalers at SC Distributors to represent a series of non-traded products. 
"We've been gaining momentum in the IBD distribution channel that we expect to continue throughout the year," said McDaniel, who has brought on 10 sales directors and three sales consultants since joining the firm himself. "We've already expanded from seven to 15 territories and have several product launches on the horizon that will certainly fuel our growth. And with new hires from the non-traded, liquid alternatives and variable annuity sectors, among others, we continue to build an impressive team with backgrounds as diverse as our product offerings." 
Highland has served the IBD channel since 2013; however, the firm began reinforcing its efforts in the channel last year in response to the expanding role of independents within the advisor network and evidence of that trend intensifying. 
The expanded IBD channel presence complements the sizeable, existing presence that Highland has built in the traditional wirehouse channel since 2004. 
About Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P. Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P. is an SEC-registered investment adviser which, together with its affiliates, has approximately $18 billion of assets under management. Founded in 1993 by Jim Dondero and Mark Okada, Highland is one of the largest and most experienced global alternative asset managers.
