        Corporates | GMR investors approve issue of Rs 1,136-crore preference shares GMR Infrastructure on Thursday said its shareholders have approved issue of compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS) worth Rs 1,136.67 crore to a group of investors, including an arm of Singapore-based investment firm Temasek Holdings.  
        Press Trust of India | Last Updated: March 21, 2014 00:53 (IST)        EMAILCOMMENTS	GMR Infrastructure on Thursday said its shareholders have approved issue of compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS) worth Rs 1,136.67 crore to a group of investors, including an arm of Singapore-based investment firm Temasek Holdings.	The shareholders have also approved issue of securities up to Rs 2,500 crore or equivalent and increase in authorise share capital of the company to Rs 1,950 crore from existing Rs 750 crore, the company said in a filing to the BSE.	"This is to inform that shareholders of the company at the extra-ordinary general meeting, held on March 20, 2014, have approved the following: increase in authorise share capital, preferential allotment of cumpulsorily convertible preference shares and issue of securities up to Rs 2,500 crore or equivalent thereof," it said.	In its notice to the shareholders for the extraordinary general meeting, GMR has said that it proposes to allocate CCPS worth about Rs 788.82 crore to Dunearn Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Temasek.	Other investors, IDFC, GKFF Ventures, Premier Edu-Infra Solutions Pvt Ltd and Skyron Eco Ventures Pvt Ltd were proposed to get CCPS worth Rs 41.91 crore, Rs 54.48 crore, Rs 41.91 crore and Rs 209.55 crore, respectively.	The company has said that the proceeds of the preferential issue of the CCPS will be used for infusion of capital into its group companies and/or purchase of shares, including for consolidation of its shareholding in its group companies.	The CCPS is proposed to be converted into equity shares in two tranches after their maturity in 17 and 18 months respectively. Post-conversion, the investors would together get a 12.24 per cent stake in GMR infrastructure.	The allotment of CCPS is in lieu of the investments made by Temasek, IDFC and other investors in GMR's subsidiary GMR Energy.	Last month, the investors, led by Temasek and IDFC, had agreed to restructure their existing investment worth Rs 1,395 crore in GMR Energy Ltd and an announcement was made by the Bangalore-based firm on February 21.	Talking about increase in share capital, GMR has said in its notice to the shareholders that it is required to give effect to the preferential allotment of the CCPS and their conversion.	On issuing securities worth Rs 2,500 crore, the company has said that it is required to facilitate and meet the capital expenditure needs of the ongoing projects of the company, its subsidiaries or associates.	The company will decide the mode of issuing security at a later stage and would be decided by its Board.	Shares in GMR Infra, on Thursday, ended at Rs 21.60 apiece on the BSE, down 0.92 per cent from the previous close.For latest news on Business, like us on Facebook and follow us on  Twitter.Story first published on: March 21, 2014 00:03 (IST) RelatedTime To Focus On Continuing Journey, Says Snapdeal CEOFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Ranked As World's Fifth Richest PersonJio Differs With Industry Body COAI's Views On Interconnection Usage ChargesTrendingNo Rs 2,000 'Withdrawal', New 200 Note Coming: Junior Finance MinisterSupreme Court Asks SpiceJet To Pay Rs 579 Crore To Previous OwnerSnapdeal Sells Freecharge At 90% Discount To Axis BankShare this story on

DUNEARN INVESTMENTS (MAURITIUS) PTE LTD swift code / bic code     WHAT IS A SWIFT / BIC CODE?A Swift Code is the standard format for Business Identifier Codes (BIC) and it's a unique identificationcode for banks and financial institutions globally. These codes are used when transferring money between banks,in particular for international wire transfers or SEPA payments.SWIFT code, BIC code, SWIFT ID or SWIFT - BIC (ISO 9362) is a standard format of Business Identifier Codes approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It is a unique identification code for both financial and non-financial institutions. The acronym SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. When assigned to a non-financial institution, the code may also be known as a Business Entity Identifier or BEI. These codes are used when transferring money between banks, particularly for international wire transfers, and also for the exchange of other messages between banks. The codes can sometimes be found on account statements. The overlapping issue between ISO 9362 and ISO 13616 is discussed in the article International Bank Account Number (also called IBAN). The SWIFT network does not require a specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. In the process of the Single Euro Payments Area the European central banks have agreed on a common format based on IBAN and BIC including an XML-based transmission format for standardized transactions; the TARGET2 is a joint gross clearing system in the European Union that does not require the SWIFT network for transmission (see EBICS). The TARGET-directory lists all the BICs of the banks that are attached to the TARGET2-network being a subset of the SWIFT-directory of BICs.SWIFTCODES BY COUNTRYABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWYZDUNEARN INVESTMENTS (MAURITIUS) PTE LTD swift codesBrowse through all available bank swift codes used by DUNEARN INVESTMENTS (MAURITIUS) PTE LTDThe bic codes below belong to DUNEARN INVESTMENTS (MAURITIUS) PTE LTD bank and/or any of its branches  across all countries and cities in the world.Swift codes also known as BIC Codes is a unique bank identifier used to verify financial transactions such as a Bank Wire Transfer.The bank swift code provides information about the bank and branch where the money should be transferred.

What is SWIFT Code?
The SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) Code is the internationally recognized standard form for the Business Identifier Codes (BIC) used to identify a bank. Each bank has its unique code that distinguishes it from every other bank, a crucial step for the secure transferring of funds between banks. Swift code is used primarily for international bank wire transfers, SEPA payments and sometimes it is also used by banks for exchanging messages.
SWIFT Code Format
Each SWIFT Code is a series of 4 codes. The first is the 4 letter bank code which is typically an abbreviated version of the bank’s name. Next is the 2 letter country code followed by a 2 digit location code which indicates where the bank’s headquarters are. The location code can be two letters or two numbers, but the first two parts of the code are only made up of letters. The final part of the SWIFT Code is an optional 3 digit number that indicates the particular branch of the bank. This last part can be a combination of letters and numbers as well.
 The length of the swift code is either of 8 or 11 alphanumeric characters depending on type of financial institution.
In case of primary/head office swift code is of 8 characters only.
Example: 
Swift Code of Dunearn Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd, Head Office branch is DEIMMUMU


DEIM identifies the Financial Institution code
