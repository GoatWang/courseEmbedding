different classes, in consideration of the degree of 
subordination in the absorption of losses;
(c) the most subordinated class of Notes, 
called "junior", have no right to receive repayment 
of principal, payment of interest or other form of 
remuneration until the full repayment of the 
principal of the Notes of the other classes;
(d) one or more classes of Notes, called 
"mezzanine", can be issued, which, with regard to 
the payment of interest, are subordinated to the 
payment of interest due to the class of Notes called 
"senior" and shall may be paid in priority to the 
repayment of principal of the senior Notes;
(e) provision may be made for the entering 
into financial hedging agreements with market 
counterparties in order to reduce the risk arising 
from asymmetries between the interest rates 
charged on assets and liabilities;
(f) in order to manage the risk of any 
mismatch between the funds deriving from 
collections and recoveries made in relation to the 
portfolio of assigned receivables and the necessary 
funds to pay the interest on the senior Notes, 
provision may be made for the execution of a credit 
facility for an amount sufficient to keep the 
minimum level of financial flexibility consistent with 
the creditworthiness of the senior notes.
Art. 5 - Rating
1. For the purposes of issuing the state 
guarantee, senior Notes must have previously 
obtained a credit rating, assigned by an External 
Credit Assessment Institution ("ECAI") accepted by 
the European Central Bank as at 1 January 2016, of 
not lower than investment grade. If under 
applicable law the release of two assessments of 
creditworthiness is required, the second assessment 
on the same senior Note can be issued by an ECAI
registered pursuant to Regulation (EU) 1060/2009
regulation (EC) no. 1060/2009 of the European 
Parliament and the Council of 16 September 2009, 
and must also not be lower than investment grade.

2. The assessment of credit worthiness, in any 
case not lower than investment grade, may, 
alternatively, be private and solely addressed to the 
Ministry of Economy and Finance, to be 
understood as buyer and sole recipient for the 
purposes of Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
1060/2009 regulation (EC) no. 1060/2009 of the
European Parliament and the Council of 16 
September 2009. In this case, the rating agency, 
chosen from those accepted by the European 
Central Bank as at 1 January 2016, and proposed by 
the selling bank originator, is approved by the 
Ministry of Economy and Finance. The fee due to 
the rating agency shall be paid by the selling bank
originator or by the assignee company.
3. The assignee company undertakes not to 
request any revocation of the rating received from 
the ECAIs involved until the principal of the senior 
Notes has been repaid in full.
4. The servicer entity appointed for the 
collection of the non-performing assigned 
receivables (NPLs servicer) must be different from 
the selling bank originator and must not belong to 
the same banking group. The decision (if any) of the 
originator or of the holders of the Notes to change 
the NPLs servicer revoke such entity shall not cause 
a downgrading of the rating of the senior Note by 
the ECAI.The entity appointed for the collection of 
the non-performing assigned receivables must be 
different from the originator and must not belong 
to the same group. The decision of the originator or 
of the Noteholders to revoke such entity must not 
cause a downgrading of the rating of the senior 
Note by the ECAI.
Art. 6 - Characteristics of senior Notes and 
mezzanine Notes
1. The senior Notes and, if issued, the 
mezzanine Notes, shall have the following 
characteristics:
(a) a floating rate remuneration;
(b) the repayment of principal before the

from the recoveries and collections arising from the 
portfolio of assigned receivables, net of all costs 
arising from the activities of recovery and collection 
of assigned receivables;
(c) the payment of interest must be made 
quarterly, semi-annually or annually in arrears and 
depend on the outstanding nominal value of the 
note at the beginning of the relevant interest period.

remuneration of the mezzanine Notes, being 
deferred under certain conditions being deferred or 
subordinated to the full repayment of the principal
of the senior Notes or dependent on performance 
targets in the collection or recovery in relation to 
the portfolio of assigned receivables.
Art. 7 - Order of priority of payments
1. The amounts deriving from recoveries and
collections made in relation to the portfolio of 
assigned receivables, from the executed financial 
hedging agreements and from the drawdowns of the 
credit facility, net of the amounts withheld by the 
NPL servicer entity appointed for the collection of

to be dependent on performance targets relating to
the collection or recovery of assigned receivables or,
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, 
subordinated to the repayment in full of the
principal of the senior Notes.
Art. 8 - State guarantee
1. The state guarantee is against remuneration,
can be granted exclusively on the senior Notes and 
becomes effective only when the selling bank
originator has transferred for consideration at least 
50% plus 1 of the junior Notes and, in any case, an 
amount of junior Notes and, if issued, mezzanine 
Notes, which allows the de-recognition of the 
securitized receivables from the balance sheet of the 
selling bank originator and, on a consolidated level, 
of the selling banking group, pursuant to the 
relevant accounting principles in force in the year in 
which the transaction occurs.
2. The state guarantee referred to in paragraph 
1 is an unconditional, irrevocable and first demand 
guarantee for the benefit of the holder of the senior 
Notes. The guarantee covers the contractually 
scheduled payments, in relation to principal and 
interest, and is in favour of the holders of the senior 
Notes for their entire duration.
3. The State, public authorities and companies 
controlled, directly or indirectly, by public 
authorities cannot purchase junior or mezzanine 
Notes issued in the context of securitization
transactions in relation to which the State guarantee 
set out under article 3, paragraph 1, has been 
requested.
Art. 9 - State guarantee fee
1. For the purposes of determining the state 
guarantee fee, reference is made to three CDS 
Baskets defined as the basket of credit default swaps 
(CDS) relating to individual Italian issuers whose 
assessment of the creditworthiness, as released by 
S&P, Fitch Ratings or Moody's, as at the date of 
entry into force of this decree, is equal to:
(i) BBB/Baa2, BBB-/Baa3 or BB+/Ba1 for 
the first basket, used if the rating of the senior 
Notes is BBB-/Baa3/BBB-/BBB L;
(ii) BBB+/Baa1, BBB/Baa2, or BBB-/Baa3 
for the second basket, used if the rating of the 
senior Notes is BBB/Baa2/BBB/BBB;
(iii) BBB/Baa2, BBB+/Baa1 or A-/A3 for the 
third basket, used if the rating of the senior Notes is 
BBB+/Baa1/BBB+/BBB H.
2. In the event that the senior Notes have 
received more than one rating, for the purposes of 
the identification of the Basket, the lowest rating is 
taken into account. The composition of the CDS 
Baskets is indicated in Annex 1 to this decree. If the 
assessment of the creditworthiness of one of the 
issuers herein considered is amended so as to no 
longer fall in the ratings above set out under 
paragraph 1, the issuer will be excluded from the 
CDS Basket.
3. The guarantee is granted on payment of an 
annual fee determined by market conditions based 
on the following methodology, as detailed in the 
formula referred to in Annex 2 to this decree:
(a) the value of the price of each CDS included 
in the CDS Basket of reference is determined, and is 
defined as the average of the daily prices at mid-
market, or, in the absence of this, at as the average 
of the daily bid and ask prices, relating to the six 
months preceding the date on which the grant of 
the guarantee has been requested, calculated using 
data extrapolated from the Bloomberg platform, 
using the CMAL source (CMA London);
(b) the simple average of the individual CDS 
prices included in the CDS Basket of reference is 
determined, and is calculated as specified in 
paragraph a) above;
(c) the annual fee of the guarantee is calculated on 
the outstanding amount of the senior Notes at the 
beginning of the interest payment period and is paid 
with the same modality of the interest of the senior 
Notes, pursuant to art. 6, paragraph 1, letter c), and 
is equal to:
(i) for the first three years, the simple average 
of the prices of individual three-year CDS calculated 
as specified in paragraphs a) and b) above;
Page | 5
GACS: APPROVED THE CONVERSION LAW OF THE RELEVANT DECREE
(ii) for the next two years, the simple average 
of the prices of individual five-year CDS calculated 
as specified in paragraphs a) and b) above;
(iii) for the following years, the simple average 
of the prices of individual seven-year CDS 
calculated as specified in paragraphs a) and b) 
above;
(d) the annual fee of the guarantee must be 
increased by an additional amount equal to:
(i) 2.70 times the difference between the 
average referred to in subparagraph c), ii) and the 
average referred to in subparagraph c, i), for the 
fourth and fifth year, in the event that the senior 
Notes are not fully repaid by the end of the third 
year;
(ii) 8.98 times the difference between the 
average referred to in subparagraph c), iii) and the 
average referred to in subparagraph c, ii), for the 
sixth and seventh year, in the event that the senior 
Notes are not fully repaid by the end of the fifth 
year.
4. The Minister of Economy and Finance 
may, by decree, amend the calculation criteria, the 
measure of the commissions contained in this article 
and the source of data referred to in paragraph 3, 
letter a), in accordance with the decisions of the 
European Commission. Amendments shall not 
affect existing transactions.

holder within nine months following the maturity of 
the senior Notes, upon the failure to make any

mandatory terms set out in this article. In the event 
that the failure to pay lasts for sixty days from the 
expiry of the deadline for the fulfilment, the holders

holders of the senior Notes, recover the amount 
paid, the interest at the legal rate accrued from the 
payment date to the redemption date and the costs 
incurred for the recovery, also by way of the

is further financed with the annual fees of the 
granted guarantees which are paid for such purpose 
on the entry of the State balance sheet for the 
following reassignment to the Fund. Such amounts 
are paid on special accounting secured for the 
payment related to the enforcement (if any) of such 
guarantees, as well as for the additional costs in 
connection with the implementation of this 
Chapter, deriving from article 3, paragraph 3 and 
article 13, paragraph 1.

1. Introduction
The Italian Government has recently approved Italian Law Decree No. 18 of 14 February 2016 (the "Decree").
The Decree provides for, inter alia, a state guarantee scheme (the "Scheme") designed to assist Italian banks in securitizing and facilitating the removal of non-performing loans ("NPLs") from banks' balance sheets.
The Decree, published on the Official Gazette of 15 February 2016, is entered into force on 16 February 2016 and it needs to be converted into law within the following sixty days.
The conversion law may provide amendments to the provisions set out by the Decree.
2. Approval of the Scheme by the European Commission
In the past few months the Scheme has been deeply discussed and negotiated between the European Commission and the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance ("MEF").
In this respect, the MEF has published the following press releases:

on 27 January, announcing the forthcoming adoption of the guarantee mechanism; and
on 28 January, setting out the method to calculate the price of the guarantee.

On 10 February 2016 the European Commission has concluded that the state guarantee scheme chosen by the Italian authorities "is free of state aid within the meaning of EU state aid rules", to the extent that the following conditions are satisfied:

the risk of the State will be limited since the state guarantee only applies to senior tranches;
the risk distribution of the tranches and the set-up of the securitisation entities will be tested and confirmed by the market before the State assumed any risk;
the State's remuneration for the risk taken will be at market terms.

3. The Decree
The Decree provides for a detailed discipline of the State guarantee ("GACS").
In particular, Articles 3 to 13 of the Decree set forth the following main aspects of the GACS:

perimeter, beneficiaries and time limits;
structure of the securitisation (including rating, tranching, servicing and priority of payments); and
main features of the GACS (including fee, filing procedure, enforcement procedure and establishment of a specific fund for the financial resources allocated to the GACS).

We summarise below the key legal features of theGACS as provided in the Decree.
3.1. Perimeter, beneficiaries and time limits
Article 3 of the Decree provides that the MEF is authorised to grant a GACS if certain conditions set out in the Decree are satisfied.
In particular, the GACS may be granted:

if the guaranteed obligations arise from tranches issued in the context of securitisation transactions under Italian Law 130/1999;
if the underlying assets (including lease receivables) are classified as non-performing and have been transferred by banks having registered office in Italy;
for a period of 18 months from the date of entry into force of the Decree (i.e. 16 February 2016). The MEF may, with prior approval of the European Commission, extend such period up to a maximum of a further 18 months.

3.2 Appointment of an expert to monitor the compliance of the GACS
Pursuant to Article 3 of the Decree, the MEF shall appoint (within 3 months following the approval by the European Commission of the Scheme) an independent and qualified expert who shall monitor the compliance of the issue of the state guarantee with the provisions of the Decree and in the relevant EC decision.
3.3 The Securitisation
Securitisation has been identified by the Italian Government as the financial structure for the disposal by Italian banks of the NPLs and the removal of such NPLs from the banks' balance sheets.
Particularly, it is envisaged that an individually managed, private securitisation vehicle (a "SPV") shall buy NPLs from the relevant bank. The SPV shall issue asset backed securities ("ABS") and the relevant proceeds will be used to fund the purchase price of the NPLs, which will then constitute the underlying assets backing the ABS.
3.3.1 Key features of the Securitisation
Article 4 of the Decree sets out the main key features of the securitisation transactions in order to benefit of the GACS:

the assigned receivables shall be transferred to the SPV for a purchase price not higher than their net book value (i.e. gross book value net of depreciations – valore lordo al netto delle rettifiche) as resulting from the relevant bank's balance-sheets;
the ABS shall be issued by the SPV in (at least two) tranches;
the junior tranche of ABS shall be redeemed or repaid only if the other tranches have been redeemed in full;
the SPV may issue one or more tranches of mezzanine notes, which are subordinated to the payment of interests of the senior notes but are paid in priority to the repayment of principal of the senior notes;
the SPV may enter into financial hedging agreements with market counterparties in order to reduce interest rate risks; and
for the purpose of manage the risk of mismatch between the recoveries and the amount due as interests on the ABS, a credit facility can be provided for an amount sufficient to keep the minimum level of financial flexibility consistent with the creditworthiness of the senior tranche.

3.3.2 Investment Grade credit rating from at least one ECAI
The MEF will issue the GACS only after the senior tranches of the ABS have received a rating equal to or higher than investment grade from an External Credit Assessment Institution ("ECAI").
In case a second rating is required by the applicable legislation, the second rating on the senior tranche may be issued by an ECAI and the second rating shall be equal to or higher than investment grade.
Alternatively, the assessment of the credit worthiness (in any case equal to or higher than investment grade) may be private and solely addressed to the MEF. In this case, the rating agency shall be proposed by the relevant selling bank and approved by the MEF.
The fee due to the rating agency shall be borne by the selling bank or the SPV.
In their analysis, the ECAI shall evaluate the cash flows associated with the guaranteed securities, the credit quality of the underlying NPLs, the tranching and the operating capacity of the servicer appointed.
3.3.3 The NPLs Servicer
The entity appointed to service and manage the NPLs receivables (the "NPLs Servicer") shall be an external and independent servicer (different from the selling bank and not belonging to the same banking group). This should also allow to avoid the risk that the recovery activity of the NPLs will be negatively affected by any conflict of interest.
The decision (if any) of the Noteholders to substitute the NPLs Servicer shall not negatively affect the rating assigned to the senior notes.
3.3.4 Characteristics of the senior notes and the mezzanine notes
Article 6 of the Decree specifies that the senior notes and the mezzanine notes (if any), shall have the following characteristics:

a floating rate remuneration;
the repayment of principal before the maturity date is linked to the cash flows deriving from the amount recovered and the collections arising from the portfolio of assigned receivables, net of all costs concerning the activity of recovery and collection of the assigned receivables; and
the payment of interests is made in arrears quarterly, semi-annually or annually and it depends on the outstanding nominal value of the note at the beginning of the relevant interest period.

In addition, it may be provided that the remuneration of the mezzanine notes may be deferred under certain conditions or may depend on performance targets in the collection or recovery activities in respect of the portfolio of assigned receivables.
3.3.5 Order of priority of payments
Article 7 of the Decree specifies that the issuer available funds (net of the amounts withheld by the NPL Servicer for its management activity according to the terms agreed with the SPV) are used, in the payment of the following items, according to the following order of priority:

taxes (if any);
amounts due to services providers;
payment of the amounts due by way of interest and fees in connection with the activation of the credit facility referred to in paragraph 3.3.1 (Structure of the securitisation), paragraph (f), above;
payment of the amounts due in respect of the granting of the GACS on the senior notes;
payment of the amounts due to counterparties of financial hedging agreements;
payment of the amounts due by way of interest on the senior notes;
replenishment of the credit facility (if drawn);
payment of the amounts due by way of interest on the mezzanine notes (if issued);
repayment of the principal of the senior notes until full repayment of such notes;
repayment of the principal of the mezzanine notes until full repayment of such notes;
payment of the amounts due as principal and interest or other form of remuneration on junior notes.

3.4 The GACS
3.4.1 Main features of the GACS
The GACS shall cover exclusively the senior tranches (i.e. the lower-risk notes) and, in particular, the payments contractually provided in respect of interests and capital in favour of the senior noteholders.
The GACS becomes effective only when the relevant selling bank has transferred for consideration at least 50% plus 1 of the junior notes and, in any case, an amount of junior notes (and, if issued, mezzanine notes) which allows the de-recognition of the securitised receivables from the accounts of the bank.
The GACS is an unconditional, irrevocable and first demand guarantee for the benefit of the senior noteholders.
The main purposes of the GACS should be:

to increase the credit worthiness of the senior ABS, hence attracting a wide range of investors, increasing the investors' appetite for such securities,
to reduce the funding costs of the SPV, and
ultimately, to incentivise banks to workout NPLs, facilitating the sale of non-performing receivables for the banks and improve their liquidity.

In addition, it has been provided that the Italian State, the public authorities and the companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by public authorities cannot purchase the junior or the mezzanine notes.
3.4.2 Fee of the GACS
The cost of the GACS has been one of the key points discussed by the Italian Government with the EC Commission.
As consideration for the GACS, the MEF will be entitled to receive an annual fee. The cost of the GACS will reflect market practice for similar guarantees in order to ensure the aid-free nature of the Scheme.
In particular, the market price of a GACS will be calculated with respect to the prices of credit default swaps for Italian issuers having a risk level which corresponds to one of the securities to be granted (since there is no market for government guarantees).
Article 9 of the Decree identifies the relevant CDS baskets and the formula by which the annual price of a GACS is calculated.
The guarantee fee to be paid will increase over time, in case the senior tranche are not repaid in full within the third or the fifth year following the granting of the GACS.
3.4.3 Procedure for requesting the GACS
The GACS is granted by decree to be issued by the MEF, upon documented request by the relevant selling bank to be filed with the MEF.
3.4.4 Enforcement of the GACS
Upon failure by the SPV to make the relevant payment (in full or in part) of the amounts due as principal or interests under the senior notes, the GACS may be enforced by the relevant senior noteholder within 9 months following the maturity of the senior notes, in compliance with the mandatory terms set out in Article 11 of the Decree.
In the event that such failure to pay lasts for more than 60 days from the date for payment, the senior noteholders, with the agreement and also through the representative of the noteholders, shall send to the SPV a request for the payment of the amount due and not paid.
After 30 days and within 6 months from the date of receipt of such request, if the SPV has not made any of the relevant payments, the senior noteholders, with the agreement and also through the representative of the noteholders, may request the intervention of the GACS.
Within 30 days from the receipt of such relevant request from the senior noteholders, the MEF shall pay the relevant amount to the senior noteholders in compliance with the transaction documents, without any further interests or costs.
By making the relevant payment, the MEF is subrogated to the rights of the senior noteholders (subject to the contractual limitations set forth in the securitisation documents, that should be the relevant limited recourse and non-petition provisions) and is entitled to recover (i) the amount paid under the GACS, (ii) the interests - at the legal rate - accrued from the payment date to the redemption date and (iii) the costs incurred for the recovery, also by way of the registration procedure in the register ("ricorso alla procedura di iscrizione a ruolo").
3.4.5 Establishment of a specific fund
A specific fund has been established within the MEF in order to achieve the purposes of the GACS specified in the Decree. The budget of the fund is equal to Euro 100 million in respect of the year 2016.
The fund is further financed with the annual fees of the granted GACS. Such amounts are paid on special accounting secured for the payment related to the enforcement (if any) of such guarantees, as well as for any additional costs in connection with the implementation of the GACS.
