As with all of their cookware I  have purchased, it's a great pan, non stick everything slides as easily and clean up is a breeze. Having it Made in USA - Winner...

Love this pan, it does not stick and cleans easily. It works great on induction stove top. Love that it is Made in USA and I can trust the quality and safety of the product. I will be buying more pots and pans from American Kitchen.

Comes up to cooking temperature faster and simmers at a lower setting. Non-stick surface is excellent and clean up is a breeze. I was looking for quality and Made in the USA and have found it. I have all 3 sizes.

My other half loves it. He says its so much easier and keeps the grease from sometimes going through the grill and getting on the pavement or I mean the concrete. Its ease enough to clean, just put in sink put dawn on it with a pot scraper.

No more wire brushing the grill.  Just throw the mat in the sink with a little soap and water and rinse...done! Keeps the cooking even and flare ups eliminated.  Love them!

I bought 2 grill matts. I made the mistake of placing them on the grill when the fire was to hot and not ready to grill on. My wife cleaned them up and just in time for the meat to throw on the grill. The grill mats worked much better. Ribs, links and corn on the cob. Easy clean this time.

This is exactly what we needed for our front door.  We live in the country and it is very dark at night.  I used to hate fumbling for the keys and keyhole,  but didn't know how to install a light.  This solved our problems! Doesn't even cost a dime because it is solar.  It works like a charm too.

Installed over the entrance door to my feed shed.  It's been DARK there for YEARS - but NO MORE!  The low light lets you see if there are any undesirable critters BEFORE you get out of the car, then the high light provides enough light to see where you are walking and where to put the key to unlock.
