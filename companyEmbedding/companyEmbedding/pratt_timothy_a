Timothy A. Pratt – Boston Scientific Corp.

By:  Pat Murphy 
August 25, 2014



How is it that one of the nation’s top products liability attorneys would choose to go in-house when he candidly admits that trial work is in his DNA?
Boston Scientific Corp.’s Timothy A. Pratt says it was all about the challenge of taking on an unfamiliar role involving new responsibilities.
Pratt became the medical device maker’s general counsel in 2008 and was a natural fit for managing the products liability aspects of his new job. After all, he had spent the previous 30 years handling mass tort cases for chemical, pharmaceutical and medical device companies across the country as a trial lawyer at Shook, Hardy & Bacon in Kansas City, Missouri.
But Pratt says what lured him to leave a job he loved was the challenge of handling all the other various responsibilities of general counsel for a big corporation.
He recently spoke with New England In-House’s Pat Murphy, fresh on the heels of Boston Scientific notching a win in Massachusetts state court in a suit alleging injuries from the company’s vaginal-mesh device. The case was the first to go to trial of the more than 20,000 products liability claims involving the device.
*  *  *
Q. How significant was it for Boston Scientific to win the first vaginal-mesh trial?
A. We were pleased with the jury’s defense verdict finding no design or warnings defect for our pelvic repair product. The jury reached its verdict after considering all the evidence and science presented to them. It’s a good outcome, but we have other cases to defend, and we plan to defend them aggressively.
 
Q. How did you become Boston Scientific’s general counsel?
A. I was perfectly happy at Shook, Hardy & Bacon. I had a great practice. I had no interest in leaving and pursuing an in-house job. That was the farthest thing from my mind. When [former Boston Scientific general counsel] Paul Sandman retired, he reached out to me and asked if I would be interested in being considered for the general counsel job. I first said no. But Paul invited me to come out to Boston to talk to him and then-CEO Jim Tobin. I interviewed, talked to some board members, and went through the whole process, never really expecting to get a job offer. When they offered it to me, I said, “OK, now I have a decision to make. Do I take this chance, move to a new city, and jump to something I’d never done before?” My wife and I said, “Let’s do it.”
 
Q. What was the key factor in your decision to take the job?
A. The driving force was I liked the business piece of the job. I could handle the litigation, but there were a lot of other aspects of the legal department that involved business strategies as well as legal execution. Jim Tobin expected me to be one of the business leaders of the firm in addition to being the general counsel. I thought that would be interesting. I hadn’t done it before and didn’t know if I could do it, but I knew it would be challenging. That part of it intrigued me more than anything else.
 
Q. Do you miss trial work?
A. I get asked that question a lot because people knew me as a trial horse. I loved it. I loved getting before a jury. I loved the process of putting the case together for trial. Sure, I wouldn’t mind putting the spurs on and trying a case tomorrow. However, I don’t miss it very much because what I do here is every bit as challenging as trying a major case, so the adrenaline flow is now as much as it ever was.
 
Q. What do you particularly like about working in-house?
A. I like the variety of things that come to my desk on a regular basis. In my legal practice, I had lots of cases that involved the same kinds of products. There were challenges within those broad litigations, but not like what I have here. Now I’ve picked up other things like corporate communications, strategy and marketing. I like to identify and solve problems. You get that opportunity virtually every hour of every day in this job.
 
Q. For what matters and assistance do you turn to outside counsel?
A. Clearly, on litigation you’ve got to have the outside counsel in the right geography managing the litigation. We don’t in-source our patent prosecution. We hire law firms to do that. Beyond that, every segment [of the legal department occasionally will] resort to outside counsel. For example, when we get employment claims, we have law firms on flat-fee arrangements for those matters. We also have SEC counsel who are outside.
For acquisitions, we have some extremely capable internal deal lawyers, but you will always use outside counsel to help with the drafting, negotiation and due diligence.
 
Q. What do you look for in the outside counsel your company hires?
A. I recently wrote an article on the three rules for the 21st century lawyer, the things that people look for. The first thing that’s critically important for lawyers is to know your value and figure out how to price it independent of hourly rates. Alternate fee arrangements are still too tethered to hourly rates.
Secondly, it’s important for me to have strategic lawyers, people who understand my pressures, who have the best interests of the company broadly in mind. Too few lawyers out there understand what someone like me wants in a strategic legal partner.
The third thing is my mantra. I simply believe that lawyers need to develop better leadership skills. Being accountable, being calm in a crisis, having confidence, and having effective communication skills — those are the kinds of things that will impress people like me. Make me like you. Make me respect you.

Industrial Design Mission and Curriculum





Mission Statement
There are millions of people all over the world waiting for the enlightened and entrepreneurial participation of designers, waiting to hear the insights that come from our years of work and study—real interventions that can touch the lives of all citizens of the world via the language of design, showing what's possible in life. As such, the mission of the Industrial Design Department at Pratt is to educate students to be able take their place in the world and influence it positively, joining a group of intelligent, powerful, and insightful people who can move society in a more creative and responsible direction. We are united in the rigorous pursuit of creativity and translating ideas into form, in a studio environment that promotes individual and group learning. What distinguishes the ID program at Pratt is the adroit, artful thinking of students encouraged in studio classes; the special aesthetic sensibility in form-making that is key in the curriculum; a degree of technical rigor; and creativity “in context,” with regard to history, teamwork, user experience, and conceptual thinking about social and environmental issues so that graduates of the program can take on the diversity of the design profession and contribute innovative results.
Learning Outcomes

Upon graduation, students will be able to demonstrate a high level of competence in translating ideas into 2- and 3-D form, implementing their aesthetic sensibility, critical thinking, and use of digital/analog tools.
Students will have in-depth knowledge of the design process according to current professional practice, including research, ideation, refinement, prototyping and presentation, individually and in teams, using contemporary design thinking in the creation of superior products.
Students will achieve a working knowledge of materials and methods of manufacture that incorporate principles of sustainability, ethics, and the global consequences.
Graduates from the B.I.D. program will develop a humanistic approach to the needs of end-users from the point of view of interface, ergonomic, social, historical, and commercial perspectives.

In the last few years, the field of Industrial Design has gone through dramatic changes.
We have seen the revolution in digital technology, which allowed billions of people around the globe to connect, communicate, and share information.
We have witnessed a wave of mass creativity, which started to erase the old distinction between consumers, producers, and designers by allowing wider audiences to participate in the creative process.
We have observed the convergence of industrial design with scientific research—from biology and genetics to artificial intelligence and robotics­—allowing things from the realm of science fiction to take shape in real life.
We have at last begun to address problems of the “other 90%” of the world, trying to solve problems of poverty, hunger, energy, health, and other troubling issues of the disadvantaged world population by design.
We have come to realize our responsibility for the planet’s climate and limited resources, and for our handling of the environment, industry, and agriculture.
The Industrial Design program at Pratt is set to prepare students to become professional designers of the 21st century, capable of tackling these momentous changes.
Whether working with industry or acting as entrepreneurs, students will be able to create products, systems, and environments which help to innovate and improve everyday objects and situations.
To become professionals, students learn aesthetic values of visual abstraction, from line and color to development of complex three-dimensional form.  Students study to practice design as an iterative process that includes ideation, sketching, prototype making, and testing of their projects. Hands-on skills, learned in a model shop, are complemented with digital skills, practiced in computer labs. From their sophomore year on, students are taught the importance of critical thinking: the art of observation and discovery, and ability to uncover and formulate real-world problems in need of design solutions.
Faculty members in the Industrial Design department are professional educators and designers; many of them are principals of their own successful businesses and recipients of prestigious industry awards. Throughout their years of study, students are exposed to cultural richness and diversity of New York City, with its world-class museums, galleries, and art and design events. Brooklyn, in particular, has recently become a hot spot of young entrepreneurial craft and design culture, and students can learn a great deal from immersing themselves in the activities of the bustling contemporary design scene.
Four years at Pratt will set each student on a path toward a rewarding and culturally relevant career, which can be tailored to specific interests and abilities.  

The Program’s Structure (Bachelor of Industrial Design)
Pratt B.I.D. alumni are designers, artists, educators, entrepreneurs, researchers, and corporate leaders. This diversity comes from a program of study that allows freedom to explore. In the sophomore and junior years students take core courses, which provide grounding in drawing, color, 3-D form, model-making, and digital computer skills. At the same time they take design studios, which introduce them to critical thinking, problem solving, and environmental responsibility. A variety of studio options are open in the junior and senior years where students can take specialized studios that respond to their individual interests and skills, such as:
Product design
Furniture
Tabletop and Food design
Shoes and Athletic gear
Exhibition design
Interdisciplinary design
By the end of senior year students complete a capstone studio, which follows students’ choice of subject and delineates the direction of their future careers. The capstone studio project is presented at the annual Design Show, a public event attended by industry leaders and potential employers.
The department offers study-abroad exchanges with a number of leading European design schools, and a summer program in furniture making in Copenhagen through the Danish International School.
