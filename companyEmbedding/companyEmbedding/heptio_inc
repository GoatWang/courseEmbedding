George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

You can learn more about the Quick Start here.Training. We are building a training program. Learn not only about the fundamentals of the Kubernetes project, but how to best use it to transform your IT systems and approach.Consulting Services. Our solutions architects are available to help you plan your first production Kubernetes deployment, plan out the migration of your monolithic application to cloud native technologies, and integrate Kubernetes into your day-to-day operations.If you are interested in following our progress, learning more about our mission, please reach out through the Contact Us form and we will keep you posted as our distribution comes together, and get you early access to the technology.

Two founders of the Kubernetes project at Google, Craig McLuckie and Joe Beda today announced their new company, Heptio. The company has raised $8.5M in a series A investment round led by Accel, with participation from Madrona Venture Group. Heptio will bring Kubernetes to enterprises in order to accelerate software development, increase infrastructure efficiency and reduce the complexity of managing software at scale.

The open source Kubernetes project brings Google’s extensive experience managing containers for over 10 years to engineers and operations teams at large. It was started in 2014 by Craig and Joe, along with a small number of Seattle engineers. Today it is the most active project on Github with over 1000 contributors. Kubernetes has developed a following among developers as a practical, platform agnostic framework for application development and management of container packaged applications. Its popularity stems not only from the quality of the technology, but also the openness and transparency of its community. Gartner has recognized Kubernetes as the most widely deployed technology for container orchestration.
Beyond Google, Kubernetes has been adopted by large technology companies like Red Hat, IBM, VMWare and Canonical to manage clusters of containers on their customers infrastructure. The project is now housed in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, part of the Linux Foundation.
“We believe that Kubernetes is a seed technology that enables businesses to transform their approach to IT, significantly reducing infrastructure costs and simplifying operations,” said Craig McLuckie, CEO. “While the technology is incredibly powerful, we have seen developers struggle to get up and running quickly. Heptio’s early focus is on making Kubernetes more accessible to developers running apps on-premises or in the public cloud. In the future we plan to work closely with the open ecosystem to advance the platform, and deliver the features enterprises need to run Kubernetes at scale.”
“We’ve gotten to know Craig and Joe pretty well and their unique insights as the creators of Kubernetes,” said Ping Li, partner at Accel. “It means there isn’t a better team out there to help companies take full advantage of the capabilities of Kubernetes, one of the most cutting-edge open source technologies out there.”
Jim Zemlin, Executive Director for the Linux Foundation said, “The mission of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation is to support safe innovation in the container, orchestration and micro-services space. We are pleased to see entrepreneurs like Craig and Joe who were instrumental in the formation of CNCF, stepping forward to help enterprises adopt powerful new technologies like Kubernetes. We are heartened by their commitment to both open source and open community initiatives.”
Before creating Kubernetes, Craig and Joe worked together to create and deliver Google Compute Engine (Google’s infrastructure-as-a-service product). Joe, Heptio’s Chief Technology Officer and an active member of the Kubernetes community, subsequently left Google to join Accel as an entrepreneur-in-residence to explore various company ideas. Craig recently left Google, where he was also responsible for initiating and chairing the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
