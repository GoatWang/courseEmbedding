Executive-level positions with General Electric followed. In January 1998, he joined Ford Motor (China), Ltd. as president and COO and was elevated to his current position a year later. Cheng is a member of the Committee of 100, an organization of Chinese American leaders devoted to encouraging better U.S.-China relations. He served on the board of governors of American Chambers of Commerce in China and was vice chairman in 1996. He earned his MBA in 1999 through the RBS Beijing International Executive MBA program, having taken MBA classes at the school in the early '70s while working in New Jersey.

							Mei Wei Cheng to be new president and CEO of Siemens China and head for the Northeast Asia Region
						



							Richard Hausmann to head the Siemens Smart Grid Applications project
						





¬†

Beijing, April 27, 2010
Siemens AG is on track to make another two important personnel decisions. Mei Wei Cheng, 60, who most recently was chairman of the board at Ford Motor in China, will be new head of China and representative of the Northeast Asia Region. "We intend to further expand the added value in our most important growth markets and intensify our excellent contacts with Chinese customers. Mei Wei Cheng has decades of experience and a corresponding network of contacts to successfully move us forward in a highly competitive environment," said Wolfgang Dehen, Siemens Energy CEO and Member of the Siemens Managing Board responsible for the Asia Region.
The current president and CEO of Siemens operations in China and Northeast Asia Richard Hausmann, 49, will assume management of the forward-looking Siemens project that deals with all aspects of Smart Grid applications. The project involves developing new products, solutions and services for intelligent power grids, including, for example, how they will interact in the future with electrically powered vehicles. "Richard Hausmann was very successful in expanding business in China and more than doubled our revenue there in just five years. His experience in this highly dynamic market makes him the ideal candidate to develop new business models for Siemens in one of the most important future markets in the new energy age," said Dehen, to whom Richard Hausmann will directly report. 
¬†
Mei Wei Cheng served as Chairman and CEO of Ford Motor China from 1998 to 2008, during which he made great success at Ford by leading the company climbing rapidly into China' s top ten automakers. In addition to his extensive experience in the automotive industry, Cheng was a vice president and regional executive and president of GE Appliance, Asia in Hong Kong. Before that, he was a vice president of General Electric and chairman and CEO of GE China.
The Siemens Energy Sector is the world' s only manufacturer with comprehensive expertise along the entire chain of energy conversion, particularly regarding interfaces such as between power plants and grids. With the new Siemens Smart Grid Applications project, the company is now expanding its expertise to the "last mile" of the value added chain in the area of intelligent power networks. Taking a comprehensive global approach, the integrated technology company intends to leverage its experience, for example, in energy automation and its IT expertise to comprehensively advise its customers about setting the right course for the new age of energy. We expect that this will result in promising business opportunities for the Siemens Energy and Industry Sectors as well as the IT field," says Dehen. Siemens already generates annual revenue of roughly EUR 1 billion with Smart Grid technologies, and intends to capture about 20 percent market share by the year 2014 in a market accumulated worth EUR 30 billion.
¬†
Richard Hausmann took over as head of the Siemens Regional Organization in China in early 2005. In April 2008 he also became head of the Siemens Northeast Asia Region, which in addition to China includes Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, and Mongolia. His assignment is scheduled to expire end of June 2010. In this time period, revenue of Siemens China sales grew to EUR 5.2 billion in fiscal 2009, the highest in the recent three decades after Siemens resumed operation in China and therefore making China the second largest overseas market of Siemens.
"It has been a memorable experience in my life and career working especially with my Chinese colleagues for the past 5 years and being part of the dynamic growth of both our company and the country. Being one of the Siemens CEOs in our historical cooperation with China, I am proud to have made Siemens China stronger in a difficult environment and fit for future challenges. I am at the same time thankful for all the great support from our employees and our partners," said Dr. Hausmann. "Looking ahead, as the Smart Grid applications have great potentials both in China and around the world, I am honored to head this new project to further tap this important market."
Under his leadership, along with continued investment Siemens has built up a strong local presence with more than 90 operating companies and over 60 offices across the country, making the company one of the most localized multinationals in China and an innovation hub on Siemens'¬† global R&D network. With his strong endorsement, Siemens businesses in China were re-organized and closely integrated into the country' s economy by supplying the local partners with its world No. 1 environmental technologies and solutions, especially for major events in China such as the Olympic Games in Beijing and the World Expo Shanghai 2010.
Dr. Hausmann also actively contributed to China' s development and helped to shape the country' s business environment by forging strategic relationships with Chinese the government and local partners. As Chairman of the Executive Committee of Foreign Invested Companies, he successfully set up channels for policy consultations with the Chinese authorities. Dr. Hausmann was also Chairman of the Board of the German Chamber of Commerce in China until 2010, during which he developed the Chamber as a strong facilitator for German companies to do business in the country.
In his 5-year term, Siemens China was awarded a number of prestigious CSR awards by the Chinese government, media and the public in recognition of its outstanding commitment to the China' s society. In addition, he also serves as an advisor to the governors of Yunnan province and Shaanxi province, and member of the consultant committee of Wuhan Municipal Government. In three consecutive years from 2008, Dr. Hausmann was awarded the Great Wall Friendship Award of Beijing, the Golden Magnolia Award of Shanghai and the Yellow Crane Friendship Award of Wuhan for his contribution to the development of the three cities. "In all my five years in China this country grew strongly to my heart. My family and I will always cherish the great memories of China and I will certainly be a frequent visitor to China in the future", said Hausmann.
