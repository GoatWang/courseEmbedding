PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK​– April 7, 2015 – NSONE, a next-generation DNS and traffic management provider, today announced a $5.35M Series A financing led by Flybridge Capital Partners and Sigma Prime Ventures. The oversubscribed round includes participation from Founder Collective, Center Electric, and a number of infrastructure industry veterans. The Company will use the funds to continue to expand its expansive global delivery footprint, further improve network performance, accelerate product innovation, and enhance customer support.
As part of the funding, David Aronoff from Flybridge Capital Partners and Raju Rishi from Sigma Prime Ventures have joined the Company’s Board of Directors.
“The DNS market is one that has seen too little innovation over the last decade and is ripe for displacement,” said David Aronoff. “The NSONE team has created a cloud-first DNS traffic management platform that meets the evolving needs of companies through a performance and feature-rich architecture. With a deep understanding of the market, proven customer traction and a truly unique product offering, NSONE is well positioned to better manage Internet traffic for the most demanding applications.” 





“At Sigma, we invest in world-class teams building disruptive, game-changing solutions,” said Raju Rishi. “NSONE has assembled a veteran team with a deep and comprehensive understanding of DNS and Internet traffic management. They’ve spent years building a solution that fundamentally rethinks how DNS and Internet traffic should be managed by focusing on business rules and goals, and yet allows quick and seamless deployment. We’re excited to be working with them on growing this company.”

As engineers and developers, we know that modern stacks demand DNS with unmatched performance, complete automation, real-time visibility, and flexible tools to shift traffic across distributed infrastructures.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!
