NewLink Genetics Corporation presents Positive Phase 1b Data for NewLink Genetics’ IDO Pathway Inhibitor, Indoximod, in Combination with Chemotherapy for Patients with Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Jun 23 17
NewLink Genetics Corporation announced the presentation of data from the Phase 1b portion of a study of indoximod, an IDO pathway inhibitor, in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine for patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Abstract E-912, Indoximod in Combination with Idarubicin and Cytarabine for Upfront Treatment of Patients with Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). These data indicate indoximod does not appear to add significant toxicity to standard therapy for patients with newly diagnosed AML, and no regimen-limiting toxicities (RLT) have been observed to date. Initial data show that the morphological complete remission (CR) rate is as expected after one cycle of induction chemotherapy. Seven of seven patients who achieved CR were found to have no minimal residual disease (MRD-neg).


Genentech, Inc. Terminates Licensing Agreement with NewLink Genetics Corporation for NLG919
Jun 12 17
Genentech Inc. has terminated its exclusive worldwide license agreement with NewLink Genetics Corporation for the development of NLG919 (GDC-0919), NewLink Genetics' IDO pathway inhibitor. The termination of Genentech’s rights to GDC-0919 will become effective 180 days after NewLink Genetics receives formal notice from Genentech. Upon such termination, Genentech will grant to NewLink Genetics an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license, under certain Genentech intellectual property, to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize GDC-0919, and NewLink Genetics will be required to pay a low single-digit royalty to Genentech on any sales of GDC-0919, should the Company proceed to develop and commercialize that compound. Genentech is obligated to transfer the investigational new drug application for GDC-0919 to NewLink Genetics and to assign to NewLink Genetics all data arising from the studies that Genentech conducted on GDC-0919. NewLink Genetics has the right to purchase Genentech’s existing inventory of GDC-0919 at cost. At NewLink Genetics request, Genentech is obligated to supply NewLink Genetics with GDC-0919 for one year after termination and to facilitate NewLink Genetics efforts to obtain an alternative source of supply for GDC-0919. Genentech will be responsible for all costs of winding down the clinical trials for GDC-0919 that Genentech was conducting at the time of termination. Earlier, on October 14, 2014, Genentech terminated its exclusive worldwide license agreement with NewLink Genetics. Under the terms of licensing agreement, Genentech received an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license under certain of NewLink Genetics’s patents and know-how relating to IDO/TDO, and NewLink Genetics has agreed to work exclusively with Genentech with respect to IDO/TDO compounds for a specified number of years. Genentech has paid an upfront payment of USD 150 million to NewLink Genetics and also will pay excess of USD 1 billion in milestone payments based on achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. In addition, Genentech will pay escalating double-digit percentage royalties on Genentech’s sales of NLG919 and other products resulting from the agreement. The rates of such royalties will vary based on the stage of the compound at the signing of the agreement, regulatory exclusivity, intellectual property status, and other considerations.

AMES, Iowa, July  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NewLink Genetics Corporation (NASDAQ:NLNK) today announced that it has received a Notice of Allowance for U.S. patent application number 15/171,031 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) covering claims to the salts and prodrugs of indoximod (1-methyl-D-tryptophan). Indoximod is Newlink's orally bioavailable, small molecule targeting the IDO pathway with a distinct mechanism of action.  
"We are delighted to hear this positive news from the U.S. patent office," said Charles J. Link, Jr., M.D., Chief Executive Officer of NewLink Genetics. "Indoximod continues to make significant progress in the clinic with promising data across multiple indications. This decision by the U.S. patent office represents a key milestone in the alignment of indoximod's global patent strategy with our clinical development path."
Upon issuance, the new patent will provide NewLink with intellectual property protection covering the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions comprised of salts and prodrugs of indoximod.
"We believe indoximod's promising clinical activity and favorable safety profile, coupled with its differentiated mechanism of action, position indoximod as a key molecule to be considered in IO combinations," said Nicholas Vahanian, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of NewLink Genetics. "We are excited in our upcoming pivotal trial in metastatic melanoma and allowances of these patents align well with our strategy. Additionally, the preclinical data we presented in April at the AACR Annual Meeting illustrated how NLG802, which is our prodrug of indoximod and a new chemical entity, increased the plasma concentrations of indoximod."
This Notice of Allowance concludes the substantive examination of our patent application and will result in the issuance of a U.S. patent after administrative processes are completed. The U.S. patent scheduled to issue from this application will expire in 2036.
About Indoximod
Indoximod is an investigational, orally available small molecule targeting the IDO pathway. The IDO pathway is one of the key immuno-oncology targets involved in regulating the tumor microenvironment and immune escape.
NewLink Genetics is currently evaluating indoximod in multiple combination studies for patients with various types of cancer including melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer.
About NLG802
NLG802 is an investigational, orally available prodrug of indoximod, a small molecule targeting the IDO Pathway. The IDO Pathway is one of the key immuno-oncology targets involved in regulating the tumor microenvironment and immune escape.
NewLink Genetics will evaluate NLG802 in a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial in cancer patients to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of NLG802.
About NewLink Genetics Corporation
NewLink Genetics is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on discovering, developing and commercializing novel immuno-oncology product candidates to improve the lives of patients with cancer. NewLink Genetics' IDO pathway inhibitors are designed to harness multiple components of the immune system to combat cancer. Indoximod is being evaluated in combination with treatment regimens including anti-PD-1 agents, cancer vaccines, and chemotherapy across multiple indications such as melanoma, prostate cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and pancreatic cancer.

NewLink Genetics' stock plunges as Genentech plans to returns rights cancer treatment candidate
Shares of NewLink Genetics Corp.  plunged 31% in premarket trade Thursday, putting them on track to open at a more-than 5-year low, after the biopharmaceutical company said Genentech planned to return the the rights to NewLink's IDO inhibitor GDC-0919 (navoximod), an immuno-oncology product candidate. The rights were part of a license agreement from October 2014. NewLink said the research collaboration with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group  for the discovery of IDO/TDO inhibitors will continue. "We are obviously disappointed in this decision," said NewLink Chief Executive Charles Link. "We remain committed to advancing our IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod, which continues to generate exciting data in combination with anti-PD-1 agents, cancer vaccines, and chemotherapy in multiple cancer types including melanoma, prostate cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and pancreatic cancer." NewLink shares had tumbled in April after disappointing results of a trial in which indoximod was being tested in combination with Merck & Co.'s  Keytruda. The stock traded at $7.38 ahead of the open, the lowest price seen during regular trading hours since February 2012. The stock has plummeted 47% over the past three months, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has slipped 1.6% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

NewLink Genetics' stock plunges as Genentech plans to returns rights cancer treatment candidate
Shares of NewLink Genetics Corp.  plunged 31% in premarket trade Thursday, putting them on track to open at a more-than 5-year low, after the biopharmaceutical company said Genentech planned to return the the rights to NewLink's IDO inhibitor GDC-0919 (navoximod), an immuno-oncology product candidate. The rights were part of a license agreement from October 2014. NewLink said the research collaboration with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group  for the discovery of IDO/TDO inhibitors will continue. "We are obviously disappointed in this decision," said NewLink Chief Executive Charles Link. "We remain committed to advancing our IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod, which continues to generate exciting data in combination with anti-PD-1 agents, cancer vaccines, and chemotherapy in multiple cancer types including melanoma, prostate cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and pancreatic cancer." NewLink shares had tumbled in April after disappointing results of a trial in which indoximod was being tested in combination with Merck & Co.'s  Keytruda. The stock traded at $7.38 ahead of the open, the lowest price seen during regular trading hours since February 2012. The stock has plummeted 47% over the past three months, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has slipped 1.6% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

					Full Description



NewLink Genetics Corporation (NewLink), incorporated on June 4, 1999, is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing immunotherapeutic products for the treatment of cancer. The Company's portfolio includes biologic and small-molecule immunotherapy product candidates for a range of oncology indications. Its biologic product candidates are based on its HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy technology, which is designed to stimulate the human immune system to attack cancer cells. Its additional HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates in clinical development include tergenpumatucel-L and dorgenmeltucel-L for patients with advanced lung cancer and melanoma, respectively. Additionally, it has two small-molecule product candidates in clinical development: GDC-0919 and indoximod. These product candidates are indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway inhibitors and focus on breaking the immune system's tolerance to cancer.The Company's HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy platform consists of biologic product candidates designed to stimulate the patient's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates are composed of human cancer cell lines that are tumor specific, but not patient specific. These cells have been modified to express alpha-Gal, a carbohydrate for which humans have preexisting immunity. These alpha-Gal-modified cancer cells are designed to stimulate an immune response against cancer cells.Tergenpumatucel-L is being investigated in a Phase Ib/II clinical trial evaluating the combination of tergenpumantucel-L with indoximod and docetaxel for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Dorgenmeltucel-L is being investigated in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitors in a randomized Phase II clinical trial for patients with advanced melanoma.The Company's small-molecule IDO pathway inhibitor product candidates in clinical development include GDC-0919 (in partnership with Genentech, Inc.) and indoximod, which are designed to counteract immunosuppressive effects of the IDO pathway, a fundamental mechanism regulating immune response. The IDO pathway regulates immune response by suppressing thymus (T)-cell activation, which enables local tumor to avoid immune response. GDC-0919 is in Phase I development. GDC-0919 is being evaluated in a Phase Ib combination clinical trial of GDC-0919 and atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.Indoximod, the Company's IDO pathway inhibitor, is in multiple Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. These trials feature indoximod in combination with both standard of care cancer immunotherapy treatments for cancer, as well as standard of care chemotherapy treatments for cancer. Indoximod is also being evaluated in clinical trials for patients with melanoma, pancreatic cancer, malignant brain tumors, metastatic breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Its primary program is a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV), an advanced vaccine technology developed for the Ebola and Marburg viruses.The Company competes with AdaptImmune LLC, Aduro Biotech, Advaxis, Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Bristol Myers-Squibb Company, Celgene Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Immune Design Corp., Incyte Corporation, Merck & Co., Inc., Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding Ltd and Sanofi SA.

Description




NewLink Genetics Corporation is a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing immunotherapeutic products for the treatment of cancer. The Company's portfolio includes biologic and small-molecule immunotherapy product candidates for a range of oncology indications. Its biologic product candidates are based on its HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy technology, which is designed to stimulate the human immune system to attack cancer cells. Its additional HyperAcute Cellular Immunotherapy product candidates in clinical development include tergenpumatucel-L and dorgenmeltucel-L for patients with advanced lung cancer and melanoma, respectively. Additionally, it has two small-molecule product candidates in clinical development: GDC-0919 and indoximod. These product candidates are indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway inhibitors and focus on breaking the immune system's tolerance to cancer.

NewLink Genetics Corporation (NewLink) is a late-stage, biopharmaceutical company focused on
discovering, developing, and commercializing novel immunotherapeutic products
to improve cancer treatment options for patients and physicians. Our portfolio
includes both “off-the-shelf” biologic and small-molecule immunotherapy product
candidates intended to address large, unmet oncology indications, including
treatment of pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and
melanoma. We believe our technologies may also be useful in the field of
infectious disease.
Our biologic pipeline is based on NewLink’s HyperAcute® technology platform,
which is designed to harness multiple components of the innate immune system to
combat cancer, either alone or in combination with other treatments, without significant
incremental toxicity. In contrast to autologous therapies, HyperAcute product
candidates do not require patients to donate cellular material, which permits
an easier scale-up of the manufacturing process. To date, HyperAcute product
candidates have been administered to more than 350 cancer patients and have
demonstrated good tolerability and a favorable safety profile.
