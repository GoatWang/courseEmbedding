DEFINING ALTERNATIVES

WHY NOW
3 of 3













Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set

                Mutual funds and ETFs have evolved to offer alternative
investment opportunities to nearly every investor.
            









Alternatives Use Familiar Investments and Apply Differentiated Strategies





Alternative strategies generally use traditional investments, like stocks and bonds, and apply non-traditional investment approaches in an effort to provide differentiated returns. Alternative strategies can also access other asset classes, such as real estate or commodities.










Alternatives Are Now More Accessible





For many years, alternative investments were only available to institutions, like pensions and endowments, and certain individual investors. Today, nearly every investor can access the differentiated return characteristics of alternatives through mutual funds or ETFs, also known as liquid alternatives.

Views and opinions expressed are for informational purposes only and do not constitute a recommendation by GSAM to buy, sell, or hold any security. An investment in alternatives is not appropriate for all investors. Please see additional disclosures. Note that alternative investing is not suitable for all investors and liquid alternatives are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money.

Alternatives: Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set

 / 






















Broader Adoption of Alternatives Is Underway





Liquid alternatives industry assets and the number of available funds have grown tremendously as these strategies have become increasingly available in mutual fund format.










Source: Morningstar as of December 31, 2016. For illustrative purposes only. In an effort to distinguish funds by what they own, as well as by their prospectus objectives and styles, Morningstar developed the Morningstar Categories. While the prospectus objective identifies a fund's investment goals based on the wording in the fund prospectus, the Morningstar Category identifies funds based on their actual investment styles as measured by their underlying portfolio holdings (portfolio and other statistics over the past three years).







Taking an Alternate Path to Generate Returns

                Alternatives may help investors achieve a smoother investment experience over various market cycles, allowing for long-term outperformance.
            









Alternatives Have Often Outperformed Either Stocks or Bonds





A more flexible investment approach allows alternative strategies to access distinct drivers of return. As a result, they may behave more independently than traditional asset classes. Alternatives have historically provided differentiated returns and helped to stabilize investment portfolios over time.





Over the Past 27 Years, Alternatives Outperformed at Least One Element of an Investor’s Core Portfolio 67% of the Time.










Additional Returns









For Illustrative Purposes Only. Source: Bloomberg, GSAM. Underlying Indices: Core Equity – S&P 500 Index; Core Fixed Income – Barclays US Agg Bond Index; Alternatives – HFRIFOF Index. Please see additional disclosures. Time period shown is earliest common inception date (HFRI FoF inception 1/1/1990) through the most recent end of year. Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary.











Alternatives Have Provided Additional Stability to Investors





Over the past 25 years, stocks have appreciated in value by a factor of ten, though the ascent has been rocky at times. Bonds have had more modest but stable appreciation. By diversifying sources of return and helping to provide stability in market downturns, alternatives may encourage investors to stay the course over various market cycles.

The example provided does not reflect the deduction of investment advisory fees which would reduce an investor's return. Please be advised that since this example is calculated gross of fees the compounding effect of an investment manager's fees are not taken into consideration and the deduction of such fees would have a significant impact on the returns the greater the time period and as such the value of the $10,000, if calculated on a net basis, would be significantly lower than shown in this example.
Diversification does not protect an investor from market risk and does not ensure a profit.

                After years of strong returns for stocks and bonds, the future may not resemble the past.

Buy Bitcoin with your IRA • Bitcoin IRA







































    





Copyright © 2017 Bitcoin IRA. All Rights Reserved 




Buy Bitcoin using your IRA or 401k




Bitcoin is in a temporary dip and yet is still up over 200% in 2017 alone. Invest your IRA in Bitcoin before Bitcoin's next massive price rise.


This is an IRS approved program with no penalties to move your retirement funds.


Complete this form to get started and to receive your free Bitcoin Guide.

“Bitcoin: It’s a red-hot asset that’s now being used as a retirement investment.”




“The world’s hottest asset is the newest way to invest for retirement.”




“This is the first Bitcoin IRA approved by the IRS.”

How It Works | BitcoinIRA.com


























































 






















 






 















How Bitcoin IRA Works














Bitcoin IRA is a one-of-a-kind investment opportunity.
 We are a full-service company that ensures a safe transfer of your retirement account into an IRS-approved account for Bitcoin and Ethereum.







  

















Step 1
Complete Your IRA Application



We will send you an application to set up a new Bitcoin IRA account with our custodian to get started.















  











Step 2
Rollover Your IRA or 401k Funds



Once your account is set up, we request a transfer of your funds from your existing retirement account into your new Bitcoin IRA.





















  

















Step 3
Buy Your Bitcoins



After your funds arrive we’ll schedule a phone call with you to perform a live trade and buy your Bitcoins.















  











Step 4
Access Your Exclusive Bitgo™ “Cold Storage” Wallet



Your Bitcoins are stored securely in our exclusive digital wallet with Bitgo, the leader in multi-signature encryption technology. 





















  
















We Ensure The Highest Security
We created a multi-layer system to provide maximum security for your Bitcoin IRA.















Your Digital Wallet
Your Bitcoins are stored with BitGo, the leader in multi-signature encryption and digital security with over $1 Billion in transactions per month. Learn more about Bitgo.




Your Security Keys
Three unique keys are generated to ensure maximum security. These are kept with:
✓ Your digital wallet, BitGo
✓ Your Bitcoin IRA custodian, Kingdom Trust
✓ Your backup key provider, Keytern.al




ID + Voice Verification
Unlike cash Bitcoin transactions, we require additional layers of security including ID verification and voice confirmation when we perform your live trade. This ensures maximum security for your transfer and purchase.














  









 
Multiple keys protects your Bitcoin IRA funds against single machine compromise or single key losses.
A multi-signature wallet is one where multiple private keys are required to move the bitcoins instead of a single key. These private keys are spread across multiple machines, essentially eliminating the opportunity of theft from malware or hackers since they are unlikely to simultaneously compromise your laptop, desktop and smartphone.


















Getting started is easy. Let us help.




Take advantage of one of the fastest growing investments in 2017.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
