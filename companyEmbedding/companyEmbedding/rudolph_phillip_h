Phillip Rudolph III
A native of Youngstown Ohio, born June 12th, 1950; Phillip Rudolph III has been enthralled with art since the early age of eight. A graduate of Butler Institute of Fine Arts, in Youngstown, Ohio, and internationally recogized, Phillip is a member of the Executive Guild Artist Regisrty.
He has organized and participated in many art exhibits throughout the Northeast Corridor from New York to Washington D.C.. He was the first Black artist to exhibit his works onboard an Amtrak train through "Art on the Move",which he copy wrote. The exhibit traveled from Boston to New Port News, Virginia and back. Events such as "Colours" a Multicultural Art Exhibit, included the works of artists from various Diaspora who came together in honor of Black History Month. The works of renown artist of the Philadelphia area as well as artist employed by Amtrak were displayed in a three-day exhibit held at Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. An advocate for youth, Phillip has been instrumental in encouraging the artistic abilites of young people.
He has implemented various mentoring programs and special events dedicated to youth.
Retiring from Amtrak in June 2016, I am now able to devote my time and energy into creating new and wonderful pieces of art.
Portions of the proceeds from Phillips' works will go to the New York Cancer Society, bringing awareness to men and women pertaining to Bladder, Prostrate, Colon and Breast Cancer.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
