VIDEOS
The name Arcimoto means ‘Future I Drive’ and our flagship product, the SRK, looks like the future. These videos showcase the SRK and the progress of Arcimoto as a company.







  




  





We’re Going Public
Our mission, to catalyze the shift to a sustainable transportation system, is a mission in the public interest. For the first time, early adopters, brand believers and members of the general public – not just accredited investors – will be able to own equity in Arcimoto.


























  




  
















Arcimoto SRK Fun Utility Vehicle
We set out to create an insanely efficient, affordable, everyday electric vehicle. But It turns out that achieving a black belt in efficiency made the Arcimoto SRK a ninja in the fun department.






  





The Critics Rave!
We’ve had journalists from a bevy of little-known mom-and-pop publications such as Forbes, Bloomberg, and Wired get behind the handlebars. They all agree on at least one thing: the SRK is a blast to drive!

Arcimoto SRK Snow Day
A rare snow day in Eugene afforded us the opportunity to take the vehicle out in icy conditions. As expected, the dual motor front wheel drive and low center of gravity provided great traction.






  





Arcimoto SRK Suspension
Mechanical Designer Jim Jordan has been dialing in the suspension for the Signature Series. Here he is to tell you about it while Industrial Designer Collin Lafayette gets some testing in.






















  




  
















The Alpha Build
The only oil we burn around the shop (sparingly!) is the metaphorical midnight variety. The team put it in long and focused hours over the first couple weeks of November to get the first Alpha prototypes on the road. We did a time lapse of the build and launch, so if you couldn’t make it, you can get the 2-minute fast flash version here.






  





The Generation 8
Some of the first on-road footage of the Generation 8 Engineering Test Mule. We fine-tuned the mule’s electronic and mechanical systems as we assembled the first two Generation 8 Alpha Product Prototypes.






















  




  
















The Arcimoto Story
Arcimoto has been working for 8 years to redefine the basic pattern of urban mobility. This video tells the company story: why we exist, where we’ve been and the road ahead.






  





The Big Vision
In 2012 Arcimoto Founder Mark Frohnmayer placed the Arcimoto Story in the larger context of historical transportation evolution and the convergence of future technologies to fully articulate the path to a sustainable transportation system.





















  




  
















Translogic Shakedown
AOL/Autoblog’s Translogic visited Arcimoto recently to test out the new Generation 8 Alpha prototypes. Watch this video to see an overview of Arcimoto and the SRK, including some compelling test drive footage.






  





Arcimoto and the SRK
Eugene’s Register Guard got a sneak peek at the SRK project in advance of our launch. Founder and President Mark Frohnmayer answered questions about the Company and product and then took reporter Kelly Lyon for a spin in the Arcimoto Generation 8 Engineering Test Mule.





















  




  
















Driving Digital Trends
An odd mixture of utility, style, and good old-fashioned common sense, the Gen 8 model is unlike any car on the road today. The vehicle’s small size makes it easy to maneuver — it’s just short enough to park nose-in to the curb — and its base range of 70 miles is more than sufficient for the daily commute of most folks.






  





On The Verge
Arcimoto is a company that’s based in Eugene, Oregon, where they’ve been making such three-wheeled electric vehicles for years. Each iteration brings improvements: better battery life, better range, and lower weight. The company’s newest model, known simply as the SRK, exemplifies that progress.






















  




  
















ARS Technica Review
The SRK is an electric trike. It’s a two-seater in a tandem configuration with the driver up front steering via handlebars. Earlier prototypes used a steering wheel—something Arcimoto chose to change since it now classifies the SRK as a motorbike, which have much easier homologation regulations than cars.






  





Bloomberg Means Business
The future of electric vehicles doesn’t have to look like Tesla sedans and Faraday Future race cars; it can be something much simpler and city-friendly. At least that’s what the people behind Arcimoto are betting on, an electric love child of a commuter’s bicycle and a multi-ton car—just don’t call it a golf cart.





















  




  
















Kelley Blue Book’s Story
Arcimoto 3-wheeler Demo – CES 2016. KBB’s coverage of the Arcimoto 3-wheeler at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show. Kelley Blue Book is your source for new car reviews, auto show, etc.






  





Mashable Meets The SRK
When is an electric car not an electric car? When it’s a three-wheeled motorcycle. Mashable’s transportation reporter Nick Jaynes took the Arcimoto SRK electric motorcycle for a spin in Venice, California to see what the hype is all about.





















  




  
















Los Angeles Times-A-Changing
Arcimoto joins the field of electric vehicles with the SRK. The company says it will deliver 70 miles of driving per charge, or 130 miles with the optional larger battery. Pricing is $11,900, with delivery in early 2017.






  





PC World’s EV Reboot
Arcimoto is bringing a whiff of motorcycle-y fun to the low-end EV market, and I hope the company embraces that. While its SRK prototype is no hot rod, the tactile experience of its handlebar throttle (just like a motorcycle’s or scooter’s) still gives me a thrill.

HISTORY
Since 2007, we’ve designed and built eight generations of vehicle prototypes as part of an iterative vehicle development program aimed at finding a more sustainable, more affordable and radically more enjoyable way of getting around on daily trips. We recently completed building our first alpha product prototypes and are now touring them on the West Coast.






  








  






Our mission is simple and you can you see it by standing on any busy street corner and watching the cars go by. Over and over, 4,000 lbs. of vehicle steel rolls past, carrying just one person, maybe two. Ask those folks where they’re going and it could be a 5-mile trip to the store, or a 10-mile morning commute.
Tack on fuel and maintenance costs, and the expense of wasted resources and energy adds up quickly for the individual and multiplies across the whole of society. Why haul around thousands of extra pounds of steel and cubic yards of unneeded space for daily commutes, a trip to the grocery store, or on a movie date? It’s time to rightsize our footprint.







  




  












Generation 1: The Vision
Arcimoto’s first prototype, an open air model with a configurable rear section. Generation 1 is fun to drive and incredibly efficient with space and materials.
A lack of any protection from the elements and other objects limited the appeal and utility of this concept.
This was just the beginning of this amazing journey to build the Arcimoto SRK, “The Everyday Electric”.










  




  





Generation 2: The Footprint
This prototype generation established a stable and efficient footprint on the road.
The single occupant is balanced between the three wheels, and the vehicle is zippy and fun to drive yet still a significant improvement in environmental efficiency compared to the standard automotive form.
This second prototype also features a primitive enclosure frame and partial protection from the elements.

















  




  












Generation 3: The Pulse
With a reasonable footprint established, the development team began to define the essential characteristics of the first product. Two seats in tandem, a variety of enclosure options, established environmentally efficient footprint.
At the same time, the team began building the Pulse, Arcimoto’s 3rd generation of product development. Built on the third generation Arcimoto platform and constructed with custom bodywork and parts from a recycled Yaris, the Pulse was to highlight, using very familiar materials and methods, the unique Arcimoto platform and company story.  Arcimoto launched the Pulse September 23rd, 2009.






  


































  




  





Generation 4: The Platform
For the vast majority of drivers out there – statistically something like 76% of them, the Pulse concept actually fit with how they use cars now. Driving alone to the grocery store for a gallon of milk. Commuting to school, work or the gym. Going golfing on the weekend.
After the launch of the Pulse, Arcimoto began the engineering process to turn the concept into an actual market-ready product. Generation 4, code-named “Darkwing” established and validated a unique new electric vehicle platform. Prototype #4 sports a front wheel drive system, comfortable ergonomics for two passengers and a very low center of gravity.













  







































  




  













Generation 5: The First SRK
The team then took all the ideas from the first 4 generations and brought them together in a single product prototype called the SRK, launched in spring 2011.
Generation 5 was the first blueprint for a market capable vehicle topology, but still far from a production ready vehicle.
The market let us know that the Generation 5 was a couple of key steps closer to the electric vehicle they needed, which was affordable, all-electric and a blast to drive.







  







































  




  





Generation 6: The First Mule
After the launch of the first SRK, the development team began the process of optimizing every aspect of the vehicle architecture.
We built an improved, lower cost drive train, made significant reductions in vehicle mass and center of gravity position, and built our first lithium chemistry power pack design.
The team built the Generation 6 prototype mule to validate the enhancements in the design.













  


































  




  













Generation 7: The First Pilot
Generation 7 was the final arc of the platform development that began after the launch of the Pulse: what was just a concept vehicle had evolved into a production-intent design.
Arcimoto developed significant technology improvements in the battery packaging system and drive train at the same time the mechanical and industrial design of the platform saw continued refinement.
This is the vehicle design Arcimoto intended to deliver to its first customers.







  







































  




  






Generation 8: Full Circle
Late in the Generation 7 build process, we conceived a fundamental breakthrough to radically improve yet again the Arcimoto product offering: lighter weight, lower cost, better acceleration, longer range, better ergonomics.
Generation 8 occupies nearly the same footprint as our very first prototype at the same time it eclipses the capabilities of anything we’ve built before. We’re now going full throttle to prove Generation 8 on the road and move expeditiously towards the marketplace.

SRK[edit]
The company's first vehicle[2] is a tandem two-seat three wheeled electric motorcycle with an estimated range of 70 miles (110 km) or 130 miles (210 km), depending on battery pack purchased (12 or 20 kWh),[3] and a theoretical fuel economy of 230 MPGe at neighborhood driving speeds.[4] The SRK is freeway capable, with a maximum speed of 85 mph (137 km/h). The company announced the SRK April 23, 2011 and revealed their eighth generation prototype in November 2015. As of December 2015, the company was touring the west coast of the United States with product representative generation 8 prototypes, which added handlebar operation, dual-motor front-wheel drive and hand-operated regenerative braking.
Founding[edit]
The company's founder, Mark Frohnmayer, is the son of politician and former Dean and President of the University of Oregon, David B. Frohnmayer. Frohnmayer founded Arcimoto in November, 2007 after he sold his previous company, GarageGames.
Development History[edit]
Arcimoto has designed and built eight generations of three-wheeled electric vehicle prototypes.[5] Arcimoto revealed their fifth prototype, and the first SRK, on April 23, 2011. According to Frohnmayer, actor Nathan Fillion drove their vehicle and came out saying it was like driving a shark, which is where the name SRK came from.[6] This model added extra power (89 hp) and four body designs on a common chassis.[7] According to Frohnmayer, Generation 6 SRK, revealed in April 2012, was to be the pilot with 14 vehicles produced, 10 of which already had committed purchasers, then the pilot run had been increased to 40 units, sold for $41,000 each. Some time later, Generation 7 was expected to be the mass production model in late 2012[6] but became the first pilot.[8]
On September 23, 2009, Arcimoto debuted the Pulse, with an estimated $20,000 price, taking pre-orders for $500.[9] The Pulse is now considered a Generation 3 prototype by the company.[10]
As of April 2015, development was in the 8th generation refinement stage, with a 50-vehicle pilot of the 8th - and final - generation expected "as early as 2016".[11] More recently, the company's website, in late August, offered "Arcimoto will unveil Generation 8 this summer… We’re now building SRK Generation 8", while a Dow Jones Business News article said that the latest prototype due in October, has an estimated selling price of $11,900.[12]

SRK[edit]
The company's first vehicle[2] is a tandem two-seat three wheeled electric motorcycle with an estimated range of 70 miles (110 km) or 130 miles (210 km), depending on battery pack purchased (12 or 20 kWh),[3] and a theoretical fuel economy of 230 MPGe at neighborhood driving speeds.[4] The SRK is freeway capable, with a maximum speed of 85 mph (137 km/h). The company announced the SRK April 23, 2011 and revealed their eighth generation prototype in November 2015. As of December 2015, the company was touring the west coast of the United States with product representative generation 8 prototypes, which added handlebar operation, dual-motor front-wheel drive and hand-operated regenerative braking.
Founding[edit]
The company's founder, Mark Frohnmayer, is the son of politician and former Dean and President of the University of Oregon, David B. Frohnmayer. Frohnmayer founded Arcimoto in November, 2007 after he sold his previous company, GarageGames.
Development History[edit]
Arcimoto has designed and built eight generations of three-wheeled electric vehicle prototypes.[5] Arcimoto revealed their fifth prototype, and the first SRK, on April 23, 2011. According to Frohnmayer, actor Nathan Fillion drove their vehicle and came out saying it was like driving a shark, which is where the name SRK came from.[6] This model added extra power (89 hp) and four body designs on a common chassis.[7] According to Frohnmayer, Generation 6 SRK, revealed in April 2012, was to be the pilot with 14 vehicles produced, 10 of which already had committed purchasers, then the pilot run had been increased to 40 units, sold for $41,000 each. Some time later, Generation 7 was expected to be the mass production model in late 2012[6] but became the first pilot.[8]
On September 23, 2009, Arcimoto debuted the Pulse, with an estimated $20,000 price, taking pre-orders for $500.[9] The Pulse is now considered a Generation 3 prototype by the company.[10]
As of April 2015, development was in the 8th generation refinement stage, with a 50-vehicle pilot of the 8th - and final - generation expected "as early as 2016".[11] More recently, the company's website, in late August, offered "Arcimoto will unveil Generation 8 this summer… We’re now building SRK Generation 8", while a Dow Jones Business News article said that the latest prototype due in October, has an estimated selling price of $11,900.[12]

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

MEET THE ARCIMOTO SRK


The Arcimoto SRK is the world’s first low-cost everyday electric vehicle. It combines the environmental friendliness and stable ride experience of an electric car with the maneuverability and flat-out fun of a motorcycle. The result: the worldwide commute will never be the same.

Environmental sustainability is one of the greatest challenges we face in the 21st century, and transportation is by far its greatest frontier. Across the United States and around the world, there are millions of environmentally conscious professionals who are looking to reduce their environmental impact and live more affordable, sustainable lives.
Over its nine year history, Arcimoto has built a mature product design through eight successive generations of prototype iteration and the on-road and in-market testing of 10 fully-functional prototypes to date. Arcimoto is on the cusp of building pilot vehicles for final product testing, and is on track to deliver vehicles to customers in 2017. 











DRIVE THE FUTURE

The mission of Arcimoto is simple: catalyze sustainable mobility by giving environmentally conscious people everywhere a smarter, cleaner, greener way to get around. The quest for extreme efficiency led to an amazingly fun, low-cost vehicle with daily utility, saving customers money and reducing carbon.
The Arcimoto SRK checks all the boxes for an everyday vehicle:
Good, Clean Fun
At 230 miles per gallon equivalent, the SRK has almost 10X the energy-efficiency of a standard passenger vehicle, and ¼ the footprint.

Go the Distance
The base model range of 70 miles is plenty for most urban areas, but you’ll also be able to choose a 130 mile extended range option for those longer commutes. And the battery recharges in just a few hours.

Fashion Meets Function
The SRK easily fits 2 people plus gear -- plenty of space for the drive to work or an evening out.

Dressed Up or Dressed Down
Choose from a variety of enclosure options to suit your needs, whether it’s protection from the elements or to secure your cargo. Outfit the base model with half-door or full-door soft or hard panels, or combine an enclosure with removal of the back seat to create the Deliverator, the ultimate delivery fleet vehicle.

Rockstar Parking Comes Standard
The SRK is just short enough that it can park tail-into the curb, meaning that you can park three of them in a normal parallel parking space. Perfect for city driving.

Unparalleled Motorcycle Safety
The SRK’s stellar ride and maneuverability are augmented with a full roll cage, 3 + 2 harnesses for both riders and superior vehicle visibility over standard motorcycles.

Commuters aren’t the only ones who can benefit from the SRK’s s extraordinary efficiency and urban utility. It is an ideal fit for a wide range of business applications, including:

Ride sharing
Food delivery
Parcel delivery
City parking enforcement
Last mile transit
Autonomous touring

 











TRACTION & WHAT'S NEXT

Arcimoto is ready to deliver low-cost, sustainable, environmentally friendly transportation to cities everywhere.
We have designed and built eight electric vehicle prototype generations to validate key vehicle subsystems and basic product capabilities. Our Generation 8 SRK alpha vehicles are on the road and receiving rave reviews from everyone who drives one.

We've refined our sales funnel, exceeded our 2016 goal of 1,000 reservation deposits, brought the cost of customer acquisition below $25 dollars, generated more than 10,000 direct email sales leads and garnered 17,000+ social media followers.
Arcimoto is in the process of securing patents to protect a number of innovations underlying the SRK, including our proprietary battery system, FutureDrive electric drive technology and eighth-generation architecture.
Arcimoto has garnered interest from a wide range of established companies and institutions that are interested in using the SRK for fleet applications.
Arcimoto's potential to shift urban transportation has generated universally positive press. Forbes, Mashable, the Los Angeles Times, Digital Trends, Wall Street Journal and many others have written about Arcimoto and the SRK, boosting consumer confidence in our product vision.
    
What’s next for Arcimoto? We’re ready to put the finishing touches on development and start the process of putting SRKs on the road in cities across the United States.
