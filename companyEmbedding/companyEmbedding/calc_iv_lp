We loved this pocket slider.  It was perfect for our Benefits Fair table that focused on distracted driving - National safety councils focus for April.

Negative Review
Could be better...












Great but I won't reorder this because it's hard to hand these out without adverse results.  People thought I was telling them indirectly they needed to lose weight(whether they needed to or not) so after a while I just left them out.  It is interesting to see who picked them up and said they needed it.  Would be a good study for a sociologist.
