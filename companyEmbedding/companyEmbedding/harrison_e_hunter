E. Hunter willing to fork out more cash

CN willing to pay more on EJ&E dealCHICAGO - The Canadian National Railway is upping its offer to help soften the impact on communities from its proposed purchase of the EJ&E Railroad, the Sun-Times reports. CN said it's willing to contribute $60 million to help pay for everything from creating quiet zones to training local emergency personnel on how to deal with hazardous material spills. Previously, CN said it would pay only $40 million. CN officials said the new offer is unprecedented. "Clearly, CN is stepping up to the plate to mitigate significant environmental issues in this case," CN president E. Hunter Harrison said in a statement. The EJ&E tracks rim the Chicago area, cutting through Southland towns such as New Lenox, Frankfort, Matteson and Chicago Heights. CN wants to buy the tracks from U.S. Steel as a means to reroute trains from its five current lines into Chicago. Towns along the EJ&E tracks have balked, saying the many more freight trains on the line will essentially split their communities in two. New Lenox Mayor Tim Baldermann said CN's offer of an extra $20 million won't change his mind that the deal is bad for his town. "It is not going to cut it," Baldermann said. The U.S. Surface Transportation Board, the agency that governs railroads, has said a ruling on CN's request to approve the merger will be issued between Dec. 1 and Jan. 31. The proposed sale has picked up the endorsement of Chicago Metropolis 2020, an influential organization of regional business leaders. The group said better use of the EJ&E line could remove as many as 1,000 trucks per day from local roads and reduce shipping costs, resulting in lower prices for consumers.

CN chief says EJ&E deal could live past 2008 (The following report by Nathan VanderKlippe appeared on the National Post website on October 2.)OTTAWA  Canadian National Railway President and CEO Hunter Harrison hinted Wednesday that the controversial deal to buy Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway may not die at years end after all.Speaking to the Journal of Commerce Canada Maritime Conference, Mr. Harrison answered several questions about the $300-million bid to buy EJ&E. The small rail line through the Chicago suburbs has stoked a war with residents, who dont want to see more trains on the little-used line.In August CN said there is a substantial risk that EJ&E owner U.S. Steel Corp. would back out of the deal if it is not completed by years end. Mr. Harrison appeared to temper that comment yesterday.I dont think its certain that U.S. Steel has to be done by the end of the year, he said. They have not indicated to us that they would extend it. To my knowledge, they have not indicated they would not extend it. Theres a lot of pressure out there going on, and maybe after November 4 it will ease up.Mr. Harrison expressed frustration with the long battle to buy the railroad, which would save CN the day it currently takes to pull its trains through Chicagos congested rail network.There are unprecedented political pressures being exerted on this transaction, he said.Thursday, October 02, 2008

CSX: Is The E. Hunter Harrison Premium Already Accounted For? - CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»CSX: Is The E. Hunter Harrison Premium Already Accounted For?Jun. 5.17 | About: CSX Corporation (CSX) Carlton Getz Deep Value, growth at reasonable price, contrarian, long-term horizonSummaryWe evaluate CSX's performance ratios against prior Harrison railroads Canadian National and Canadian Pacific.
        CSX has significant room for improvement.
        However, the current valuation fully reflects operating improvements relative to the operating performance and valuations of legacy Harrison railroads.
        CSX (NYSE: CSX) has experienced a quick rise in its share price since the announcement that E. Hunter Harrison would be joining the company. The increase is largely based on expectations for improved financial performance through the implementation of "precision scheduled railroading" (NYSEARCA:PSR) pioneered by Harrison during his stents at the Illinois Center Railroad, Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI), and Canadian Pacific Railway (NYSE: CP). We decided to look into the various financial ratios of these companies to determine how they compare and develop a projection of CSX's potential results and corresponding valuation assuming implementation of PSR drove CSX's operating ratios to those currently experienced by the firms previously led by Harrison. We note that for this analysis we chose to compare the ratio performance of CSX with the performance of CP and CNI rather than Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) or Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) for the simple reason that it provides a direct comparison with firms previously led by Harrison and which have implemented under his guidance the PSR principles. Comparison Ratios We began by compiling the basic financial statement information for each railroad for the most recent annual period (2016) and calculating a selection of relevant business performance and valuation ratios. We incorporated a few adjustments to "normalize" certain items, such as eliminating the debt repurchase expense for CSX during the period and the impact of additional pension contributions on cash flows for CSX and CNI. The summary information is presented in the following chart: 


 Source: Annual Reports of CSX, CP, and CNI CSX clearly underperforms the firms previously led by Harrison, in some cases by large margins. CSX's operating ratio is significantly less than either company, as are income ratios with respect to revenue and return ratios with respect to assets, equity, and cash flow. Clearly, there is room for improvement in CSX's financial performance. In reviewing the initial ratio values as well as the scale of the companies, we determined that it would be most appropriate to develop a projected income statement for CSX based on the operating ratios of CNI. In addition to being more similar in scale in terms of revenues, assets, and equity, CNI also had the lowest operating ratio of the group and its use would result in the most optimistic comparison. We therefore set CSX's operating ratio for our initial projection equal to that for CNI and recalculated the income statement based on this ratio. In essence, this approach reduces the company's operating expenses in the model (and therefore increases operating income), but the effect is the same regardless of the exact combination of benefits, whether increased revenues or reduced expenses. In effect, for this projection, we don't need to estimate the exact revenue and expense impacts since the operating margin effectively takes all these factors above the line into account. Additionally, we assumed that CSX's debt structure was the same (i.e., interest expense was unchanged) and the same tax rate would be applicable. The resulting projections are as follows: 

 Source: Proprietary Projections We project that, if CSX had performed on par with CNI in 2016, the company would have earned $2.94 per share versus $1.93 (after eliminating the debt repurchase expense). This represents a significant performance gain. However, in terms of return on assets and equity, CSX would still have underperformed CNI largely due to the substantially higher taxes applicable in the United States (approximately 37% for CSX versus approximately 25% for CNI).
 Valuation Estimates We used these values to estimate the valuation per share of CSX assuming the full realization of the improvement in operating ratio based on the current valuations of CP and CNI using EBITDA multiples and price-to-earnings ratios. The valuation estimates based on these ratios are as follows: 

 The range of share values for CSX utilizing CNI's top tier operating margin and the current valuations for both CNI and CP was $43.72-$60.59 per share. In comparison to CSX's current share price of $54.54, CSX appears fully valued (of not slightly overvalued) in comparison to its key Harrison PSR peers using an assumption that the company can achieve maximum performance results. CSX's per share valuation would be higher than this range if we instead utilized current valuation ratios for peers Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific. However, we believe this would be inappropriate for three reasons: · We believe the valuations of NSC and to a lesser extent UNP also incorporate Harrison premiums of their own with the expectation that improvements at CSX will inevitably drive competing performance improvements at NSC and UNP, in which case using their multiples would essentially double count the Harrison premium. · We believe railroad valuations are already at relatively high levels, especially with price-to-earnings ratios pushing 20 and expectations of per share earnings growth ranging from 10%-15% per year over the next few years. · We believe CNI and CP are the most appropriate comparable companies since these are both companies that Harrison directly led, at which he implemented his specific form of PSR, and subsequent left (which will eventually happen at CSX). In addition, adjustments in the assumptions and ratios would impact the respective share prices. However, given that CNI's operating ratio is highly competitive, only significant assumption adjustments (which we believe are generally unlikely) would result in material changes in the valuation range.
 We therefore believe that CSX shares are currently fully valued or slightly overvalued and reflect substantially all of the potential for performance gains from the implementation of PSR. In addition, it is not certain that the full implementation of PSR at CSX would result in equivalent operating performance. CSX has not operated in a vacuum since the introduction of PSR, so the Harrison implementation of PSR may not result in operating improvement gains as significant as those experienced by CNI and CP. Indeed, CP's operating ratio only five years ago was significantly higher than the current operating ratio of CSX, suggesting the company started in a worse position and had much more initial opportunity for improvement. In addition, factors such as differing cargo mixes between the railroads and the relative profitability of various types of cargo will impact the ultimate outcome. Summary We believe that CSX is fully valued or slightly overvalued at the current price and already reflects substantially all of the potential improvements from the implementation of PSR. We recognize that the shares may continue to receive a boost from the initial stages of PSR implementation and the associated financial performance improvements, but as value investors, we find relatively little margin for error in the current valuation. We therefore recommend reducing current positions in favor of other investment opportunities.

HUNTER HARRISON Continues to be Villain of the Year


Home » Op-Ed » HUNTER HARRISON Continues to be Villain of the Year		
	




back



Notorious rail-man HUNTER HARRISON is making news nowadays as the self-proclaimed saviour of the great Canadian Pacific Railway.  The man that Wall Street loves may soon become the villain to many Canadians.  Few recall that 2012 started with Hunter Harrison's former employer - Harrison was the CEO of Canadian National Railway a few years back – yanking Harrison's juicy pension for various breaches of a non-disclosure commitments.  Hunter Harrison started the year by coming out of retirement and announcing to all that he was prepared to get into an alley fight with CN.  HUNTER HARRISON is FYOUTH’S Villain of 2012 because he is more than simply a mean and dangerous man that is hell-bent on cutting labour and pension expenses at Canadian Pacific.  Hunter personifies corporate evils.  A corporate elite more interested in his individualistic pursuit of power and fame than the business titan to lead a team or an organization to international dominance, Hunter Harrison has built a reputation on squashing workers’ rights, disregarding environmental obligations and changing the culture of an historic railway away from its concerns with safety and environmental protections to a myopic focus on profit-maximization.  Hunter Harrison became the main guy at Canadian National when CN bought Illinois Central to become one of the largest railway companies in the world.  The Canadian National Railway company was wholly owned by the government of Canada for the first 100 years or so of the company's existence.  In 1967, Canadian National employed about 125,000 people in Canada, and the company’s operating losses were paid by Canadian taxpayers. The privatization of Canadian National in 1995 was followed by increased foreign ownership and a name change to CN. The end result was that Americans owned over 80% of CN stock within a few years after privatization. When CN purchased Illinois Central, a major American railroad company based out of Chicago, E. Hunter Harrison, the president and CEO of Illinois Central, took over the reins of CN.In 2003, Hunter Harrison announced that he wanted to fire a bunch of employees to increase shareholder value of CN.  Hunter Harrison and his new management team axed the jobs of safety supervisors, environmental compliance officers and other tenured management personnel. CN's stock price rose after the mass firings so Hunter kept announcing more and more layoffs.  By 2004, the number of CN employees had declined to 18,500, even though the merged rail company had become one of the largest in the world and was moving more freight and handling more contaminants than ever before. Under The Hunter, CN abandoned unprofitable rail lines in northern and remote regions of Canada and ignored safety obligations, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries to workers. HUNTER SHRUGGED while CN left a legacy of environmental contamination throughout the Canadian wilderness ranging from contamination of pristine aboriginal lands in Alberta to the abandonment of a PCB facility in North Bay, Ontario. Hunter Harrison demonstrated a villainous disregard for environmental protection and safety obligations while he ran CN.The Hunter's most dastardly deeds occurred when rail workers went on strike to protest CN's blatant violations of its collective bargaining agreement. The Hunter was not concerned with whether the strike by the workers was legal or not, he simply wanted to destroy the union so he sent scab workers from the United States to fill in for the striking Canadian workers. With the bravado of a railway legend, Hunter held amazing sway over Canadian and U.S. politicians.  Hunter believed that the NAFTA provision prohibiting a multinational company from transferring workers from one country to another was another example of big government protecting the little people.  Governments sat back and did nothing when Hunter Harrison illegally introduced scab workers into the 2007 legal labor dispute between CN and its employees.  The 2007 strike ended but CN management continued to mistreat its employees.  The unionized workers exercised their right to strike again in 2009.  This time The Hunter charmed the politicos, and voila Canada's federal government passed back-to-work legislation.  Although special legislation forcing unionized employees back to work is extremely rare for a private company in Canada, the Harper government of the time defended its back-to-work legislation as a special gift to CN.  The above photo of Hunter Harrison was taken from a press conference where reporters questioned him about The Hunter's approach to worker's rights.Nice and subtle flick of the finger by The Hunter to the workers and reporters!  Well tables are now turned and FYOUTH is pleased to give a finger salute to Hunter Harrison. Hunter Harrison has the inside dope on CN and he wants to make money from the info.  Now Canadian Pacific – an arch-rival of CN for more than 100 years - wants to pay the Hunter big money to find out where all of the bodies are buried.  CN probably thought that they could stop The Hunter by slashing his valuable pensions, but this guy is a total sleaze.  The Hunter responded with a major stock market play that will dearly enrich his pocketbook at the expense of all those that misjudge the Hunter's character.  HUNTER HARRISON is now running the show at CP Rail and he has not changed one bit.  The mainstream media will not tell you that Hunter Harrison plans to destroy the spirit and the pocketbooks of CP workers, but FYOUTH is pleased to declare Hunter Harrison the VILLAIN OF 2012 !editor@fyouth.com

Harrison Has Medical Condition That Often Has Him Working From Home, Not CSX Headquarters
May 19, 2017

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that CSX CEO E. Hunter Harrison has a medical condition that often forces him to work at home.
E. Hunter Harrison
The newspaper gave few specific details about the condition and the 72-year-old executive said that he should not be judged by his medical record.
“I’m having a ball and I’m running on so much adrenaline that no one can stop me,” Harrison told the Journal. “Don’t judge me by my medical record, judge me by my performance.”
Harrison acknowledged that he carries a portable oxygen system, but his doctors cleared him for his position.
“There are times when I get a little shortness of breath so I take oxygen and it helps,”
Harrison said.” Sometimes I get a cough and the oxygen makes it go away.”
CSX Chief Financial Officer Frank Lonegro told an investor conference that Harrison is fully engaged in his job.
“We’re really running to play catch up with him,” Lonegro says. “He’s a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week kind of guy.”
Trains reported that CSX was well aware of Harrison’s medical condition when it hired him.
However, that was a point of contention at one point when CSX demanded that independent physicians review Harrison’s medical records, a request that Harrison refused.
CSX said it would not comment on Harrison’s health.
The Journal said that during his last two years at Canadian Pacific, Harrison frequently worked from home rather than in his CP office in Calgary.

2 More CSX Humps Set to Close
May 16, 2017

Add Selkirk and Cumberland to the list of humps that CSX plans to close.
An online report said the Cumberland hump will close on May 16. Five of the bowl tracks will be kept, but the other tracks will be out of service or used for storage.
The changes will mean that only Q372, Q398 and Q401 will originate in Cumberland. Terminating in Cumberland will be Q236, Q352 and Q400.
Other trains will make pickups or setoffs, including Q236, Q353, Q375, Q389 and Q416. Some trains will merely change crews in Cumberland.
The Times Union of Albany, New York, reported that members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen received a memo about the hump closing at Selkirk, New York.
The memo said that CSX management believes the yard costs too much to operate and some of its work will be shifted to other yards, including Syracuse, New York.
The news report did not indicate how many employees would lose their jobs but Mark Krajewski, chairman of the union local, called the move “heartbreaking.”
CSX has been closing humps at yards in the wake of E. Hunter Harrison taking over as the railroad’s CEO and implementing his precision scheduled railroad operating philosophy.
The railroad earlier said it would close humps in Atlanta; Louisville, Kentucky; and Toledo, Ohio. CSX officials have yet to confirm the closure of the Selkirk hump.
The Times-Union said Selkirk yard was the largest in the New York Central system.
Harrison views hump yards as inefficient and closed at least four of them during his time as CEO of Canadian Pacific.

CSX Makes Best Corporate Citizen List
May 5, 2017

CSX was named to the list of Best Corporate Citizens in 2017 by Corporate Responsibility Magazine.
The railroad ranked 55th and was the only rail company in the top 100. It is the fifth time CSX has made the list.
“CSX is committed to making a positive impact through our efficient, sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation of essential goods and products,” said CSX CEO E. Hunter Harrison in a statement. “Being a good corporate citizen is about making good decisions for our shareholders, our customers, our employees, and the communities where we operate, and we are proud of this recognition.”
The list has been compiled for 18 years using the Russell 1000 Index. Relative rankings were based on 260 data points of disclosure and performance measurements across seven categories: environment, climate change, employee relations, human rights, governance, finance, and philanthropy and community support.

Mantle Ridge Pushes CSX Stockholders to Vote ‘Yes’ On Additional Harrison Compensation
April 26, 2017

The campaigning has begun to win the votes of CSX shareholders as to whether new CEO E. Hunter Harrison should be reimbursed for the money he gave up when he retired early from Canadian Pacific.
Not surprisingly, the hedge fund Mantle Ridge is supporting giving Harrison the money. Mantle Ridge lured Harrison away from CP by promising to pay him what he would give up by leaving early. Now Mantle Ridge wants to be reimbursed for what it paid Harrison.
Mantle Ridge has launched a website, www.csxadvisoryvote2017.com to make its case.
“We believe that Mr. Harrison is the most effective and successful railroad leader of our times, having led the dramatic turnaround of three major railroads over the last 25 years,” Mantle Ridge founder and CEO Paul Hilal wrote in a letter to shareholders. “In those undertakings, he drove operating ratios to industry-leading levels while delivering total shareholder returns of 450 percent, 353 percent, and 319 percent, respectively.”
CSX stockholders will vote at the annual meeting on June 5 in a non-binding referendum on the reimbursement. Harrison has said he will resign if he doesn’t get the additional compensation.
The referendum seeks approval for CSX to pay Mantle Ridge $55 million and Harrison $29 million, which would pay his tax bill.
Hilal said the cost of the reimbursement amounts to less than 12 cents per share.
Papers filed with regulatory authorities last week indicate that Harrison gave up $89 million in salary and benefits to win release from his CP contract.
Many analysts expect the referendum to win approval because of the value that hiring Harrison has added to CSX stock.
The shares jumped in value by $12.91, an increase of 35 percent, after CP said it would allow Harrison to retire early.
The value of CSX stock rose against last week after the company announced its first quarter 2017 financial performance.
The CSX board of directors has not taken a position on the Harrison compensation referendum, but before hiring him the board had expressed concern about the size of the compensation package that he wanted.
The board did approve a statement to stockholders outlining the pros and cons of voting in favor of the compensation.
After acknowledging Harrison’s track record at Illinois Central, Canadian National and CP, the advisory noted that other side of the argument is that there is a risk that Harrison won’t be able to serve the full four years of his contract due to the potential for death, disability or other reasons.
It also said that Harrison may not be able to achieve results similar to those at IC, CN, and CP.
The board said it would take the referendum into account and “ . . . act promptly in the exercise of its fiduciary duties with respect to whether to commit to the reimbursement after the shareholders have voted.”

CSX Declares 11% Dividend for 1st Quarter
April 25, 2017

CSX last week declared an 11 percent increase in its quarterly dividend while also announcing that it will spend $1 billion to buy back shares of its stock.
The railroad expects to issue financial guidance as it applies the precision railroading model to its operations.
The quarterly dividend, which increased from 18 cents to 20 cents, is payable on June 15 to shareholders of record as of May 31.
“Although we are just in the beginning phase of making changes to our network, we are off to a great start,” said President and Chief Executive Officer E. Hunter Harrison in a news release. “These changes are critical to driving strong, sustainable service for our customers and superior value for our shareholders.”
During 2017, CSX said that it expects to achieve record gains in efficiency and a step-function improvement in its key financial measures this year given continued economic growth and stable coal markets.
It predicted that its operating ratio for the year will fall in the mid-60s and earnings-per-share will grow 25 percent off the 2016 reported base of $1.81.
CSX said that the stock buyback program should be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018.

Harrison is the New CSX President, Too
April 24, 2017

E. Hunter Harrison has added another title to his resume at CSX. He is now the president of the company as well as its chief executive officer.
Harrison replaced Fredrik Eliasson, who was named CSX president on Feb. 21 after serving as the railroads’s chief marketing officer.
Eliasson will now become executive vice president and chief sales and marketing officer for CSX.
The moves in the executive suite mean that CSX has had three presidents in less than four months.
The year began with Clarence Gooden as president. The original plan was for Gooden to step down at the end of May when then-CEO Michael Ward also would retire.
Harrison assumed the CEO post on March 6. The good news for Eliasson is that he will get to keep the pay increase that he received when he was named president.
“There were no compensation adjustments associated with these title changes,” CSX said in a regulatory filing.

CSX 1st Quarter Net Income up 2%
April 21, 2017

CSX said on Thursday that its first quarter 2017 net income rose 2 percent to $362 million, or 39 cents per share.
In a news release, CSX said that discounting a $173 million restructuring charge, the adjusted earnings were 51 cents per share.
Those numbers compare with net income of $356 million, or 37 cents per share in the first quarter of 2016.
During the first quarter of this year revenue was up 10 percent to $2.87 billion compared with $2.6 billion in 2016.
CSX attributed the revenue growth to volume growth across most markets, overall core pricing gains and increased fuel recovery.
The railroad believes that its second quarter outlook is favorable because of anticipated growth in most markets, including agriculture and food, export coal, fertilizers, forest products, intermodal and minerals.
The business outlook is neutral outlook for automotive, chemicals, metals and equipment. The domestic coal market has an unfavorable outlook for domestic coal.
CEO E. Hunter Harrison said during a conference call that CSX expects to have an operating ratio in 2017 in the mid-60s, earnings per share growth of around 25 percent off the 2016 reported base of $1.81, and free cash flow before dividends of around $1.5 billion.
The CSX board of directors have approved a $1 billion share repurchase program, which management expects to complete by the end of the first quarter of 2018.
CSX began buying back shares of its stock in April 2015 and has spent $2 billion on that to date.
As for capital spending, CSX now expects to invest $2.1 billion in 2017, including approximately $270 million for Positive Train Control.
More than half of the 2017 capital spending will be used to sustain core infrastructure with the balance allocated to projects supporting profitable growth, efficiency initiatives and service improvements.
CSX trimmed its capital budget for this year by $100 million. Some planned capital projects are being paused as management continues to study its terminal and operating plans.
As expected, CSX plans to continue creating longer passing sidings, particularly in the Chicago-Florida corridor where train lengths are limited by 6,500-foot sidings.
Under the Michael Ward administration, CSX had announced plans to extending or add 27 sidings in that corridor. Harrison expects to move some sidings to create a longer siding elsewhere.
“If we have sidings that are too short for the longer trains, we’re certainly not going to leave those sitting in the ground and not being utilized,” he said. “We’ll pick up one 6,500-foot siding and move it 15 miles down the railroad and put it with another 6,500. We’ve got a 13,000-foot siding.”
Since Harrison took over as CEO last month, CSX has laid off 765 employees – about 3 percent of its workforce – and further announcements are expected of continued cost cutting initiatives.
CSX chopped a record $420 million of expenses in 2016 and expects to top that this year.
Among the expected moves will be consolidating the railroad’s nine divisions. Also likely to be consolidated are the nine dispatching centers CSX now operates.
The streamlining of operations will result in 550 of the railroad’s 4,400 locomotives being removed from service and stored by the end of the summer. CSX has already mothballed another 550 locomotives.  About 25,000 freight cars will be stored.
CSX wants to impose a balance of operations over seven days a week and reduce the average terminal dwell time from 26 hours to somewhere in the high teens.
During the conference call, Harrison suggested that he does not expect any mergers or acquisitions to occur during the four-year life of his contract.

CSX May be Ready to Reopen ex-Clinchfield Line
April 13, 2017

With hump operations closing, CSX is seeking alternative routes to move traffic, which has caused it to look at the dormant former Clinchfield line between Russell, Kentucky, and Bostic, North Carolina.
Trains magazine reported this week that an empty tank car train ran north on the ex-Clinchfield, which the railroad’s previous management had closed last October.
At the time, CSX said it was concentrating on a triangle of routes linking New York and Chicago, Chicago and Florida, and Florida and New York.
It is not publicly known yet if new CSX CEO E. Hunter Harrison and his team will continue to follow the CSX of Tomorrow strategy implemented during the administration of Michael Ward.
Since Harrison became CEO last month, CSX has closed three humps in favor of flat switching at yards in Atlanta, Louisville, Kentucky; and Toledo.
Until it was idled, the Clinchfield had hosted about a dozen coal trains a day as well as a few manifest and intermodal trains.

CSX Sets Annual Meeting for June 5
April 5, 2017

Under normal circumstances, the CSX annual meeting, which has been set for June 5 in Richmond, Virginia, would mean little except to the company’s shareholders and those who take a keen interest in the activities of the railroad.
But among the issues to be decided at the meeting is whether CSX should reimburse hedge fund Mantle Ridge the $55 million that it paid CSX CEO E. Hunter Harrison to retire early from Canadian Pacific. In doing that, Harrison forfeited various bonuses from CP.
If the shareholders vote against paying Mantle Ridge, Harrison has said he will step down as CSX CEO.
Harrison is also demanding $29 million from CSX and wants it to pay for a tax bill that he has incurred.
Many observers expect CSX shareholders to approve the compensation demands because CSX stock has risen 30 percent in value since word got out that Mantle Ridge was seeking to install Harrison as CSX CEO.
The CSX board of directors has not taken a position on how shareholders should vote other than to note that there are arguments for and against giving Harrison the money he wants.

Harrison’s Compensation at CSX Outlined
March 9, 2017

Hunter Harrison and CSX agreed to a base salary of $2.2 million, the railroad said this week in a regulatory filing.
The compensation package also includes an annual target bonus opportunity of up to $2.8 million, with that amount as a guaranteed bonus this year.
Harrison will receive options on 9 million shares of CSX stock, which is valued at $448 million at its current price of $49.79 per share.
Half of those options will hinge on his continued employment and the other half are tied to his meeting a series of performance targets.
The agreement to hire Harrison as its CEO also came with a number of changes in the CSX board of directors.
Clarence Gooden is no longer vice chairman and board member Timothy O’Toole has resigned immediately.
CSX’ has amended its corporate bylaws to separate the roles of CEO and chairman of the board as well as to change the mandatory retirement age of 75. Harrison is 72.
Although it remains to be seen how Harrison’s management philosophy will play out at CSX, analysts expect that he will further thin the number of managers and employees at the company, close yards and shops, and sell off some rail routes.
These measures will be aimed at improving operations, reducing expenses and boosting profitability.
Some have noted that CSX is far different than were Canadian National and Canadian Pacific when he took over as CEO at those railroads.
The Canadian roads were linear systems whereas CSX has a more complex route network.
That will challenge Harrison to impose his precision scheduled railroading philosophy, which he developed as CEO of the Illinois Central Railroad in the 1990s.
One decision Harrison will need to make will be whether to continue the CSX of Tomorrow strategy, which emphasized intermodal and merchandise traffic while focusing on its major routes operating in a triangle operating from Chicago to New Jersey to Florida and then back to Chicago.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of).

Canadian Pacific Rival Warns Ex-Chief to Stay Away From Ackman


				By Ian Austen			
January 13, 2012 4:27 pm
January 13, 2012 4:27 pm




Kamil Krzaczynski/ReutersE. Hunter Harrison, the former chief executive of the Canadian National Railway.
6:15 p.m. | Updated 
OTTAWA — The Canadian National Railway publicly cautioned its former chief executive, E. Hunter Harrison, on Friday against participating in the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman’s plan to put him in charge of running the Canadian Pacific Railway, saying that would violate his employment contract.
Mr. Harrison is widely credited with turning Canadian National into one of North America’s most cost-efficient railways. But the directors of Canadian Pacific have rejected Mr. Ackman’s proposal to have him lead a similar transformation at that railroad, which lags behind Canadian National in efficiency.
Earlier this week, Mr. Ackman, whose firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, is the largest shareholder in Canadian Pacific, said he was planning a proxy battle to replace the company’s board in order to make Mr. Harrison the railroad’s chief executive.
Canadian National, however, does not appear interested in seeing Mr. Harrison improve the fortunes of its rival.
“As part of his employment contract with C.N., Mr. Harrison agreed, upon retirement as president and chief executive officer on Dec. 31, 2009, to be bound by a broad range of confidentiality and multiyear noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions,” Canadian National said in an e-mail statement. 
“C.N. has asked Mr. Harrison to respect his commitments to C.N. and to reconsider his expressed interest in a position at Canadian Pacific,” the Montreal-based railroad said. “C.N. has also put William A. Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P., on notice to cease any efforts to induce breaches of Mr. Harrison’s contractual obligations to C.N.”
Mr. Harrison’s blanket noncompete agreement with Canadian National expired at the end of 2011. But Canadian National said in an earlier statement that his retirement and pension arrangements separately prohibited him from competing against the company or trying to hire its employees until the end of 2014.

Mr. Ackman said Monday that Mr. Harrison was “excited by the opportunity” of running a railway again. Mr. Harrison expressed similar sentiments in an interview with The Globe and Mail of Toronto earlier this week.
The two men met on Friday, and Mr. Ackman said in an interview that Mr. Harrison was still interested in becoming the chief executive of Canadian Pacific, despite the warning from Canadian National.  
Mr. Ackman acknowledged that if he was successful in changing chief executives, Mr. Harrison would lose his Canadian National pension and require compensation from Canadian Pacific. But he characterized the cost of that arrangement as “not material” to Canadian Pacific.
He also said Friday that Canadian National’s warning was an endorsement of Mr. Harrison’s skills.  “This confirms to me that he’s the best man for this job,” Mr. Ackman said.

Ewing Hunter Harrison (born November 7, 1944[1]) is a railway executive who served as the CEO of Illinois Central Railroad (IC), Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), and now serves as CEO of CSX.
Biography[edit]
Born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1944, Harrison began his railroad career in 1964 while attending Memphis State University when he worked as a carman-oiler for the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway ("Frisco").[2] Harrison was later promoted to railroad operator with Frisco and, later, with Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) following that company's acquisition of Frisco in 1980. Harrison was consistently promoted at BN, eventually being appointed Vice-President - Transportation as well as Vice-President - Service Design.[3]
Harrison in 1989 left the BN and secured a job with the executive team at the Illinois Central Railroad (IC), first as Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer, culminating with his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1993 to 1998. Following the acquisition of IC by Canadian National Railway (CN) in 1998, Harrison was appointed Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer by CN. Upon the retirement of Paul Tellier, he was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of CN on January 1, 2003, serving in that position until his retirement on December 31, 2009.[citation needed]
During his time at CN, Harrison was named Railroader of the Year for 2002 by industry trade journal Railway Age as well as CEO of the Year for 2007 by the Globe and Mail's "Report on Business".[4] On April 29, 2009, CN announced the company's plan for succession in Harrison's position by appointing Claude Mongeau as his successor effective January 1, 2010. Following his service at CN, Harrison retired to his estate in Connecticut where he raises and trains horses for show jumping. Bound by a non-competition clause with CN, Harrison maintained a low profile serving as a director for the Belt Railway of Chicago as well as Dynegy Holdings LLC.[citation needed]
In fall 2011, Harrison was approached by the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management led by activist investor Bill Ackman, who was undertaking a proxy battle with the board of directors of Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). Ackman had offered at that time to appoint Harrison as President and Chief Executive Officer of CPR should his proxy battle in spring 2012 be successful, which would necessarily result in the termination of Fred Green as President and CEO. Ackman was ultimately successful in the proxy battle at the CPR's annual shareholder meeting on May 17, 2012.[5] On June 29, 2012, Harrison was appointed President and CEO of Canadian Pacific Railway.[6]
The Canadian National Railway Co. halted nearly $40-million in benefits to be paid to Harrison after launching a lawsuit alleging he may have breached, or intends to breach, several confidentiality agreements with the railway dating back to his retirement in 2009. In the suit, CN's board of directors said it had grounds to believe Harrison may have violated his commitments to CN as part of push by activist shareholder William Ackman and his New York-based hedge fund, Pershing Capital Management LLC, to see Harrison replace Fred Green as CEO of rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd.[7]
On January 18, 2017, Hunter Harrison abruptly resigned as CEO of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. Instead, he joined Paul Hilal in involving himself in the management of CSX Corp., a US competitor.[8][9] On March 7, 2017, Harrison was named CEO of CSX.[10]

E. Hunter Harrison - Wikipedia





















 






E. Hunter Harrison

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Ewing Hunter Harrison (born November 7, 1944[1]) is a railway executive who served as the CEO of Illinois Central Railroad (IC), Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), and now serves as CEO of CSX.
Biography[edit]
Born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1944, Harrison began his railroad career in 1964 while attending Memphis State University when he worked as a carman-oiler for the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway ("Frisco").[2] Harrison was later promoted to railroad operator with Frisco and, later, with Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) following that company's acquisition of Frisco in 1980. Harrison was consistently promoted at BN, eventually being appointed Vice-President - Transportation as well as Vice-President - Service Design.[3]
Harrison in 1989 left the BN and secured a job with the executive team at the Illinois Central Railroad (IC), first as Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer, culminating with his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1993 to 1998. Following the acquisition of IC by Canadian National Railway (CN) in 1998, Harrison was appointed Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer by CN. Upon the retirement of Paul Tellier, he was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of CN on January 1, 2003, serving in that position until his retirement on December 31, 2009.[citation needed]
During his time at CN, Harrison was named Railroader of the Year for 2002 by industry trade journal Railway Age as well as CEO of the Year for 2007 by the Globe and Mail's "Report on Business".[4] On April 29, 2009, CN announced the company's plan for succession in Harrison's position by appointing Claude Mongeau as his successor effective January 1, 2010. Following his service at CN, Harrison retired to his estate in Connecticut where he raises and trains horses for show jumping. Bound by a non-competition clause with CN, Harrison maintained a low profile serving as a director for the Belt Railway of Chicago as well as Dynegy Holdings LLC.[citation needed]
In fall 2011, Harrison was approached by the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management led by activist investor Bill Ackman, who was undertaking a proxy battle with the board of directors of Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). Ackman had offered at that time to appoint Harrison as President and Chief Executive Officer of CPR should his proxy battle in spring 2012 be successful, which would necessarily result in the termination of Fred Green as President and CEO. Ackman was ultimately successful in the proxy battle at the CPR's annual shareholder meeting on May 17, 2012.[5] On June 29, 2012, Harrison was appointed President and CEO of Canadian Pacific Railway.[6]
The Canadian National Railway Co. halted nearly $40-million in benefits to be paid to Harrison after launching a lawsuit alleging he may have breached, or intends to breach, several confidentiality agreements with the railway dating back to his retirement in 2009. In the suit, CN's board of directors said it had grounds to believe Harrison may have violated his commitments to CN as part of push by activist shareholder William Ackman and his New York-based hedge fund, Pershing Capital Management LLC, to see Harrison replace Fred Green as CEO of rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd.[7]
On January 18, 2017, Hunter Harrison abruptly resigned as CEO of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. Instead, he joined Paul Hilal in involving himself in the management of CSX Corp., a US competitor.[8][9] On March 7, 2017, Harrison was named CEO of CSX.[10]

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Ewing Hunter Harrison (born November 7, 1944[1]) is a railway executive who served as the CEO of Illinois Central Railroad (IC), Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), and now serves as CEO of CSX.
Biography[edit]
Born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1944, Harrison began his railroad career in 1964 while attending Memphis State University when he worked as a carman-oiler for the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway ("Frisco").[2] Harrison was later promoted to railroad operator with Frisco and, later, with Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) following that company's acquisition of Frisco in 1980. Harrison was consistently promoted at BN, eventually being appointed Vice-President - Transportation as well as Vice-President - Service Design.[3]
Harrison in 1989 left the BN and secured a job with the executive team at the Illinois Central Railroad (IC), first as Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer, culminating with his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1993 to 1998. Following the acquisition of IC by Canadian National Railway (CN) in 1998, Harrison was appointed Vice-President and Chief Operating Officer by CN. Upon the retirement of Paul Tellier, he was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of CN on January 1, 2003, serving in that position until his retirement on December 31, 2009.[citation needed]
During his time at CN, Harrison was named Railroader of the Year for 2002 by industry trade journal Railway Age as well as CEO of the Year for 2007 by the Globe and Mail's "Report on Business".[4] On April 29, 2009, CN announced the company's plan for succession in Harrison's position by appointing Claude Mongeau as his successor effective January 1, 2010. Following his service at CN, Harrison retired to his estate in Connecticut where he raises and trains horses for show jumping. Bound by a non-competition clause with CN, Harrison maintained a low profile serving as a director for the Belt Railway of Chicago as well as Dynegy Holdings LLC.[citation needed]
In fall 2011, Harrison was approached by the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management led by activist investor Bill Ackman, who was undertaking a proxy battle with the board of directors of Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). Ackman had offered at that time to appoint Harrison as President and Chief Executive Officer of CPR should his proxy battle in spring 2012 be successful, which would necessarily result in the termination of Fred Green as President and CEO. Ackman was ultimately successful in the proxy battle at the CPR's annual shareholder meeting on May 17, 2012.[5] On June 29, 2012, Harrison was appointed President and CEO of Canadian Pacific Railway.[6]
The Canadian National Railway Co. halted nearly $40-million in benefits to be paid to Harrison after launching a lawsuit alleging he may have breached, or intends to breach, several confidentiality agreements with the railway dating back to his retirement in 2009. In the suit, CN's board of directors said it had grounds to believe Harrison may have violated his commitments to CN as part of push by activist shareholder William Ackman and his New York-based hedge fund, Pershing Capital Management LLC, to see Harrison replace Fred Green as CEO of rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd.[7]
On January 18, 2017, Hunter Harrison abruptly resigned as CEO of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. Instead, he joined Paul Hilal in involving himself in the management of CSX Corp., a US competitor.[8][9] On March 7, 2017, Harrison was named CEO of CSX.[10]

Predictable, but I thought it notable enough that it deserved its own thread. My heart sank when I read this. It's a quote from a retired CP employee who attended a town hall meeting in Vancouver.
He opened it up to a Q and A near the end. I got up to speak at the microphone and asked him what his position was on the Heritage program citing the Christmas Train; RCP and the 2816. I mentioned how the UP has had a steam program for 50 years and the NS had one until Bob Claytor retired and passed away. Hunter cut in and said to me right away, "And Bob Claytor managed to turn over a steam engine while he was there". Hunter doesn't miss a thing. I should have known he would have known about that accident many years ago although I don't think it had anything to do with the steam engine he was driving. He then said "I hate steam engines". The audience chuckled when he said that. "They are expensive to run; the liability is too high and they serve no useful purpose" He never did touch on the RCP. He did say he will continue to run the Christmas train. He then said the company contributed over a million dollars to the relief fund in New York City after Hurricane Sandy and was quick to point out that the Norfolk Southern only donated $100,000 He seems to have an answer for everything.

I think the only thing saving 2816 is EHH has too many other things to worry about right now.
You may have seen the ad a few months ago in the TRAINS newsletter taking reservations for the one and only RCP trip next summer. After that, I guess we shall see what we see.

Few 2816 fans who would pay to be pulled by her are also paying customers toward CP's bottom line I would expect.  It's a nice-to-have, and EHH isn't about nice-to-have.  I am sorry about that because I would always be happiest to know that particular steamer is staying 'alive', but...you can't fault the man for being unpragmatic.

Mr. Harrison is the last in the line of post war railroad heads who's stance on steam locomotives and passenger trains is "they are evil." That both Claytor brothers felt differently is the reason they stand out in the pantheon of the men who loved trains. Sooner or later the 2816 will be stuffed-and-mounted vis-a-vis the 611 and 1218. Maybe someday they will come back but for now there are freight trains to run and railroads to modernize.

Harrison is a money man.  A no frills, bottom line, serious business man.  His idea, and others in and out of railroading, are not sentimental nor do they stand on past laurels and ceremony.   It they raise a hand it is to catch a buck or you don't raise a hand.  Black is black, white is white; there is nothing in between.  They are computers in a human body.  Does this make them wrong?  or right?  Depends if you are in it for the money or for the glory.   He is in railroading for the money and not the glory but he is into money for the glory.  Those of us who are sentimental or more relaxed about life and not  just money can't understand or accept this.  We stop to smell the roses and admire the bush it grows on, accepting the thorns as part of life.  Harrison and his ilk...and I'm not putting them down or demeaning them in any way....are focused only on the money as the sole product of labor and investment and not on the product produced.

Would someone please mind filling me in on Claytor derailing a steam locomotive?

...are focused only on the money as the sole product of labor and investment and not on the product produced.

Given today's business climate, where holding companies are interested on return on investment and only ROI, his stance isn't surprising.
 
Unfortunately, I don't see that changing any time soon.

Henry,
Railroading is a business, not a hobby. Everyone who is in it is there for the money. The glory is long gone.
You have no basis to say he is into the money for the glory. That is strictly a product of your imagination and ranks right up there on the top of the list of most nonsensical things you have said on this forum.
As a business man Harrison IS concerned about the product. Taking a day out of a transcontinental sechedule, as he did is one example. CPTRAINMAN has provided several others. 
Playing trains with steam locos interfears with producing the product in a long list of ways. The rational decision of a business man, especially one trying to turn around a big railroad, is no distractions.

Would someone please mind filling me in on Claytor derailing a steam locomotive?


Well I'm pretty sure what Mr. Harrison is referring to is the 1986 derailment in Suffolk, VA of a NS Employee Special behind N&W 611. However the 611 did not "roll over" as Harrison says but Bob Claytor was at the throttle that day. Out of the 23 cars the 611 was pulling 12 of them derailed when one of the passenger cars picked a switch. All the car were equipped with tight-lock couplers except for three of the older Southern heavy weight cars. Two of those Southern passenger cars jackknifed and that where the most severe injuries were. The accident  tied up the main line for a while and caused damage to excursion equipment as well as injuring quite a few NS employes and their families. 
After that accident the Type H coupler became standard for those running excursion equipment. Amtrak uses the type H on all of its equipment and requires any private equipment on their train to be fitted with Type H couplers along with the other Amtrak standards.
Interesting note the N&W 611 had been in a derailment in 1956 along the Tug River. In that case the locomotive did indeed roll over. The ICC reported that the engineer had entered the curve at to high of speed and the high center of gravity cause the locomotive to tip over. I believe the engineer and fireman died in that accident but I don't think any passengers died. I have a copy of the ICC report I printed from online years ago but I have long forgotten the link to the page.

I'm pretty sure it was #607.

I have an ecopy of the accident report.
Edit - the wiki entry for 611 does allude to a rollover due to speed into the Tug River.  First I've heard of it, but I stand corrected.

Harrison is a money man.  A no frills, bottom line, serious business man.  His idea, and others in and out of railroading, are not sentimental nor do they stand on past laurels and ceremony.   It they raise a hand it is to catch a buck or you don't raise a hand.  Black is black, white is white; there is nothing in between.  They are computers in a human body.  Does this make them wrong?  or right?  Depends if you are in it for the money or for the glory.   He is in railroading for the money and not the glory but he is into money for the glory.  Those of us who are sentimental or more relaxed about life and not  just money can't understand or accept this.  We stop to smell the roses and admire the bush it grows on, accepting the thorns as part of life.  Harrison and his ilk...and I'm not putting them down or demeaning them in any way....are focused only on the money as the sole product of labor and investment and not on the product produced.


 
Henry,
Railroading is a business, not a hobby. Everyone who is in it is there for the money. The glory is long gone.
You have no basis to say he is into the money for the glory. That is strictly a product of your imagination and ranks right up there on the top of the list of most nonsensical things you have said on this forum.
As a business man Harrison IS concerned about the product. Taking a day out of a transcontinental sechedule, as he did is one example. CPTRAINMAN has provided several others. 
Playing trains with steam locos interfears with producing the product in a long list of ways. The rational decision of a business man, especially one trying to turn around a big railroad, is no distractions.
Mac McCulloch


I am saying the same thing you are.  I am not condemning him in anyway.  I don't agree with him, especially on the steam issue, but I understand completely from where he comes.  And I disagree with your characterisation of my comment.  I know people who are into whatever business they are in strictly for the money and bottom line with no feeling, understanding, or care for the product....and often of the customers, either. As long as the bottom line is as black as possible they feel they have done their job.  In many businesses customers have been short changed,  quality and quantity of product compromised, local economies eliminated, and lives in ruin.  But the bottom line is great and the guy is called a genius.  Harrison appears to be border line on this.

EHH has a little work to do before CP can take a victory lap.  My guess is that at some point they will have E or F units ... recall that CN did so (and still does).
This is one serious CEO.  He set up quite a franchise at CN.  I thank him everytime I look at my stock portfolio.

EHH is how old?  Either he is super greedy, or he is in it for more than the money (glory? power?).






The opinions expressed here represent my own and not those of my employer or any other railroad, company, or person.
And why does the truth seem too hard to be true?

It's kinda funny...everyone's worried about the fate of 2816, and yet nobody has yet to ask "Will MILW 261 ever run on home rails with E. Hunter Harrison under power?"

He is doing a job.  The job he was hired to do. The way he gets it done.  Agree or disagree but it worked out well for the CN.  And despite what I have said, it appears to have worked out for railfans in the long run because CN is a viable operating railroad for photogs to photgraph and watchers to watch.

Before I get too worked up over this I'd like to see a firm policy statement from CP concerning the steam program, not  Internet inuendo.  I'm not one of those guys who says "I saw it on the Internet, it MUST be true!"
I don't care about EHH one way or the other.  I do realize he's not too popular with a lot of people right now, and to be fair I expect there's going to be a lot of "Anti-Hunter"  propaganda being disseminated, true or untrue.  
Let's just wait and see.

Any CEO's job is to improve the bottom line and the price of the stock.  But what is often omitted in evaluations (and this discussion) is for what period of time, for how long?.  Next quarter?  Next year?  Two  years?   A business is an ongoing concern and short-sighted actions can look great in the short term, but not necessarily five to ten years later.  And by then EHH will be back with his horses.

The CP managment are also getting rid of what they consider excess trackage, so there will be less places to operate a Steam Locomotive and passenger train without interfering with the rest of their business.  The space of operation is getting crowded.

The glory days didn't die with steam. Stand at trackside today and tell me what you see isn't at least as impressive as what was commonplace in the 50s. Steam was good in its day. Today's ES4400CWs are every bit as impressive as the Berkshires and Moguls  of a bygone era. The trains are bigger today... the systems are more complex. We are moving far more freight with far fewer people than was accomplished 50 or 70 years ago. EHH has it right, railroading is  above and foremost a business.  Running steam locomotives and excursions are an expense and get in the way of production. Perhaps the right answer is to have museums and fan groups come up with a rail line of their own that could be used for the express purpose of running steam locomotives and vintage rail equipment.  Maybe a short line could be revitalized and run with steam power.

He may simply like what he does. I don't think he's in it for the money... he's already got more than he'll ever need. Glory?  He was instrumental in turning CN around and got has much hate thrown his way as glory... Some people may be old but have too much get up and go yet to lay around waiting to die.

He's 67, right?  I'd go for a combo of "drove his wife crazy" and "needed a hobby".

CSX Names E. Hunter Harrison as Chief Executive Officer

Company Announces Agreement With Mantle Ridge to Reconstitute its Board
CSX Shareholders to Vote on Proposed Reimbursement in Respect of Foregone Compensation of E. Hunter Harrison at Upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareholders 

	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – March 6, 2017 – CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: CSX) today announced the Company has named E. Hunter Harrison, a proven railroad executive with a well-regarded track record of producing market-leading operating results, as chief executive officer, effective immediately. Mr. Harrison replaces Michael Ward, who announced his decision to retire as Chairman and CEO on February 21, 2017 and will become a consultant to CSX, effective immediately.
The Company also announced that it has reached an agreement with Mantle Ridge LP, an investment firm formed by Paul Hilal, to reconstitute the Company’s Board of Directors. Under the terms of the agreement, CSX has appointed five new directors to its Board of Directors, mutually agreed upon by CSX and Mantle Ridge and effective immediately – Mr. Harrison, Mr. Hilal, Dennis Reilley, Linda Riefler and John Zillmer.  In addition, three incumbent CSX directors intend to complete their service for the Board at or before the conclusion of the 2017 annual meeting. As a result, the size of the Board will be 13 members.  CSX’s current Presiding Director, Edward J. Kelly, III, will become Chairman of the Board and Mr. Hilal will become Vice Chairman.
Hunter Harrison, said, "I am proud to join the dedicated and talented railroaders at CSX. Together, we will implement Precision Scheduled Railroading – a model proven to improve safety, create better service for customers, produce a proud and winning culture for employees, and generate exceptional, lasting value for shareholders.”
Paul Hilal, said, “I thank every CSX director, including those leaving the Board, for their constructive and skillful engagement that enabled this terrific outcome for CSX. The Board is united behind a shared goal – creating value for shareholders and all stakeholders by implementing the Precision Scheduled Railroading model at CSX. Together, we have created the conditions for success. Now the real work begins.”
As part of his compensation, Mr. Harrison will receive an award of incentive options to purchase nine million shares of CSX stock at its current trading price, eight million of which will be granted as an inducement award under the Nasdaq listing rules.  The options will vest over four years with half of the options vesting based on service and half vesting based on the achievement of designated performance goals over the four year period.  
While CSX, Mr. Harrison and Mantle Ridge have agreed on the aforementioned conditions, the CSX Board continues to believe that it is appropriate to seek shareholder input with respect to certain proposals:

The requested payment of the $84 million of the amount of compensation and benefits forfeited by Mr. Harrison as a result of his separation from Canadian Pacific Railway Limited. To facilitate Mr. Harrison’s separation from CP on terms that would permit him to work at CSX, Mantle Ridge agreed to protect Mr. Harrison on an interim basis with respect to this $84 million. 
The requested assumption of a related tax indemnity.

Mr. Harrison has informed CSX that his acceptance of the CEO position was subject to CSX ultimately providing this replacement protection initially offered by Mantle Ridge upon his departure from CP.  Mr. Harrison has indicated that he will resign after the 2017 annual meeting if the reimbursement and tax indemnity are not provided by CSX, and return to Mantle Ridge to protect his reimbursements.
CSX will submit these matters to CSX shareholders for an advisory vote at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The proxy statement relating to the Annual Meeting will contain further details. Because these matters will now be considered at the Annual Meeting, the previously convened Special Meeting of Shareholders will not be held. The CSX Board does not intend to make a recommendation to shareholders on the matters being put forward for a vote, but does intend to act promptly following the meeting based on the outcome of the vote.
