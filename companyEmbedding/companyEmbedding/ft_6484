House Plan 6835: Hamilton
                











                You can almost hear the faint thrum of Spanish guitars echoing around this classic design. Its faade is purely California Mission style designed with stone siding, stucco accents and a tile roof. The thoroughly modern interior is nearly mansion-sized and designed for luxury living.

A maximum of four additional sets may be added to your five set package, at the time you place your order.  Between planning and building departments, lending institutions, and neighborhood architectural review boards, extra sets may be necessary to provide enough sets for bids and construction.





Full Reverse Sets
$100



Reverse sets are mirror images of the design.  With "Full Reverse" plans, though the layout is mirrored, all of the text and dimensions have been adjusted to read normally --- not mirror image.  Customers have a strong preference for "right reading" plans, as many services simply print their plans from the back side, leaving text difficult to read, and leading to costly construction errors.

            Hamilton Description - 6835
          

You can almost hear the faint thrum of Spanish guitars echoing around this classic design. Its faade is purely California Mission style designed with stone siding, stucco accents and a tile roof. The thoroughly modern interior is nearly mansion-sized and designed for luxury living. Some of the many elements youll love about this design include: four family bedrooms (two with private baths), a master suite with his and hers walk-in closets and dressing areas, two laundry areas, a home theater room, a vaulted playroom, and a unique tower room with attached deck. Choose formal or casual dining spacesthey flank the island kitchen, which also has a walk-in pantry and pizza oven. A butlers pantry and a wet bar add convenience to entertaining. Enjoy the outdoor spaces with three trellised porches at the rear of the plan. A three-car garage accesses the main part of the house via a handy mudroom. Built-ins abound. Note: This plan is not available in the Portland Tri-County area.

Attractive wooded parcel of a few oaks, pines  &  cabbage trees. Parcel is ideal for a rural home place where privacy prevails, neighbors are real neighbors, folks are country focused and the children or grandchildren can enjoy themselves as if they were on huge acreage. This parcel is practical for a small AG oriented owner who dabbles in horses, small animal husbandry or even a gentleman’s estate. Many do not realize this but you can operate your business from here if you abide by the County rules. Fronts on Gewant Blvd. Nice homes nearby in the overall neighborhood. One home per parcel here. Land is zoned AG (Agriculture) which retains the open character of the land. Uses are conservation, agriculture, low-density residential, recreation and other uses. AG is associated with noise/odors/dust  &  other uses generally incompatible with urban life. District provides for AG operations at very low densities for buyers who want to live in an AG environment. Raising of cattle/sheep/swine  &  poultry/dairy/processing of dairy products/breeding  &  training/boarding of animals associated with or kept in support of AG operations. Harvest/cultivate  &  process/sale of crops grown on premises, including nursery/aquaculture  &  family day care  &  citriculture.
