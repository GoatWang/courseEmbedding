FRESH INSIGHTS AND PARADIGM-CHANGING METHODOLOGY FOR THE TREATMENT  OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE"Niemann-Pick Type C" 



























 Caring Deeply. Changing Lives.We measure success by our impact on patients we serve.

 Neurotrope BioScience, (NASDAQ:NTRP), 
                             formed in 2012, is at the forefront of the biotech industry and is focused on developing new therapies with Bryostatin 1 for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and developmental disorders. 
             
                            
                            Our experience, capabilities, and passion for innovative and novel drug therapies have enabled us to build a development pipeline that includes various treatment approaches with Bryostatin 1 for serious and difficult-to-treat diseases such as Alzheimer’s dementia and the Orphan diseases, Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC). 
                   
                            


 Multi Modal Efficacy Bryostatin-1 activates Synaptic Growth Factors – BDNF, NGF, IGF, others.
It also activates all amyloid-β Degrading Enzymes (ECE, Neprilysin, IDE).
Bryostatin also activates α-secretase, which reduces formation of neurotoxic amyloid-β formed by γ-secretase and BACE.
ApoE3 induces PKCϵ; by activating PKCϵ, so there is an increase in BDNF expression.
Bryostatin blocks ApoE4's reduction of BDNF via HDAC inhibition.
Bryostatin normalizes GSK3-β, thereby inhibiting pathological Tau protein transformation into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).
                            


 Alzheimer’s disease Bryostatin was tested in a 148 moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease patient population across 26 sites in the U.S. First patients dosed January 2016 . Primary efficacy endpoint based on Severe Impairment Battery Scale (SIB). Entry criteria based on the MMSE score. Secondary efficacy endpoints – Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). Please see the full data set by reviewing our press release dated July 19, 2017.
                            


Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a devastating genetic disorder with a prevalence (existing cases) in the U.S. of about 135,000 persons. FXS shows a combination of the following signs in children and throughout life including developmental delays, intellectual and learning disabilities, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorders. In multiple FXS animal models it was shown that Bryostatin 1 improved memory and learning. Neurotrope is expanding on the BRNI preclinical data to show that Bryostatin 1 improves behavior in a collaboration with the FRAXA Research Foundation. Neurotrope BioScience plans to institute a Phase 2 clinical trial in FXS patients in 2018
                            

 Niemann Pick Type C is both a debilitating and lethal genetic disease occurring in all ethnic groups. Its prevalence is estimated to affect about 35,000 children per year. Neurotrope is working with world renowned experts at the Icahn School of Medicine, Mt. Sinai to develop its lead compound, bryostatin-1, as a potential treatment for the excessive accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the viscera and brain resulting in cell death and to neuologic symptoms, including difficulty in swallowing and speaking, loss of coordination, seizures, and progressive dementia. There is no FDA approved treatment for Niemann-Pick Type C.

Neurotrope stock drops 52% on midstage trial results for Alzheimer's drug
Neurotrope Inc.  shares plummeted 52.2% in heavy trade Monday morning after the company released mid-stage clinical trial results for an Alzheimer's disease drug that were criticized by investors. Though Neurotrope sought to portray Monday's phase 2 results as positive, claiming they showed a benefit for patients with moderate-to-severe Alzehimer's disease, investors questioned the company's presentation of the results, since one of the patient groups treated with Neurotrope's Bryostatin-1 did not meet the primary endpoint and the company focused on the results for a lower dose of the drug. Both a 20 µg dose and a 40 µg dose were tested in the clinical trial, but Neurotrope only reported results for the 20 µg group in its release early Monday. Company shares have dropped 18.9% to $9.09 over the last three months, compared with a 4.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

Neurotrope stock drops 52% on midstage trial results for Alzheimer's drug
Neurotrope Inc.  shares plummeted 52.2% in heavy trade Monday morning after the company released mid-stage clinical trial results for an Alzheimer's disease drug that were criticized by investors. Though Neurotrope sought to portray Monday's phase 2 results as positive, claiming they showed a benefit for patients with moderate-to-severe Alzehimer's disease, investors questioned the company's presentation of the results, since one of the patient groups treated with Neurotrope's Bryostatin-1 did not meet the primary endpoint and the company focused on the results for a lower dose of the drug. Both a 20 µg dose and a 40 µg dose were tested in the clinical trial, but Neurotrope only reported results for the 20 µg group in its release early Monday. Company shares have dropped 18.9% to $9.09 over the last three months, compared with a 4.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Neurotrope, Inc. Presents Clinical Results from Phase 2 Trial Demonstrating That Moderate-To-Severe Alzheimer's Disease Patients Treated with 20 µg Bryostatin-1
Jul 19 17
Neurotrope, Inc. presented clinical results from its recently completed Phase 2 trial demonstrating that moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease patients treated with 20 µg bryostatin-1 showed preliminary evidence of sustained improvement in cognition compared to placebo. The 13-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of bryostatin-1 in 147 moderate-to-severe AD patients across three treatment arms (20 µg, 40 µg, placebo). This is the first placebo-controlled, AD trial of a protein kinase C epsilon (PKC?) activator, which in preclinical studies induced the growth of new synapses and prevented neuronal death. This represents a new therapeutic strategy for AD that directly addresses the emerging consensus that synaptic loss has a major impact on cognitive deficits of AD. The improvements in the primary cognitive endpoint, the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), were observed in the study's 20 µg treatment arm as early as week five, and were maintained throughout the 13-week study (Table1). The scores for the secondary functional endpoint, the ADCS-ADL-SIV (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory Severe Impairment Version) for the 20 µg treatment arm showed improvement at week 13. Unlike the 20 µg dose, there was no therapeutic signal observed with the 40 µg dose. This contrast between the signal observed with the 20 µg dose versus the 40 µg dose was reinforced by the results of a Cohen's D analysis, part of an in-depth statistical evaluation of the study data that found a consistent signal of benefit in SIB and ADCS-ADL-SIV for the 20 µg dose at the end of the trial. Patients dosed with 20 µg had a dropout rate similar to placebo, while patients dosed at 40 µg experienced poorer safety and tolerability, and had a higher dropout rate. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly mild or moderate in severity. TEAEs, including serious adverse events, were more common in the 40 µg group, as compared to the 20 µg and placebo groups. These data reinforce the safety and tolerability of the 20 µg dose. The lack of signal at the higher 40 µg dose is not entirely unexpected based on the in vitro dose response features of bryostatin-induced PKC? activation. As seen with the 40 µg dose, the obligatory downregulation phase appears to override the initial activation phase, thereby mitigating the desired clinical effect.


Khang &Khang LLP Announces Securities Class Action Lawsuit Against Neurotrope, Inc
Jul 10 17
Khang &Khang LLP announced a securities class action lawsuit against Neurotrope, Inc. Investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Neurotrope shares from January 7, 2016 through April 28, 2017, inclusive, are encouraged to contact the Firm before the July 17, 2017 lead plaintiff motion deadline. According to the Complaint, throughout the Class Period, Neurotrope made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material adverse information about the efficacy of its lead product candidate, Bryostatin-1. On May 1, 2017, the Company announced "positive top-line results" for the focal Phase 2b trials of Bryostatin-1, mentioning "improvement in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease." The trial data refutes these statements, however, as the top-line data relating to the 20-microgram dose of Bryostatin-1 did not produce statistically significant results. Neurotrope also allegedly failed to disclose statements about the efficacy of the 40-microgram dose in connection with its primary and secondary endpoints. After release of this news, the stock price of Neurotrope fell materially, which harmed investors according to the Complaint.

The study was designed to assess the dosing, safety, and preliminary efficacy for 2 different doses of bryostatin versus placebo.
