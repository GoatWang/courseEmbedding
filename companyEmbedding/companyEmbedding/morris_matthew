Product Description‚ñº‚ñ≤
The Gospel of Matthew [PNTC] explores the meaning and relevance of Matthew in an eminently straightforward fashion. Leon Morris writes for readers who use commentaries to discover further what the Bible means. Throughout, author Leon Morris makes clear what he considers to be the meaning of the Greek text that Matthew has bequeathed to the church. A perceptive introduction precedes Morris's verse-by-verse exposition of Matthew, an exposition based on his own literal translation of the text.

Publisher's Description‚ñº‚ñ≤
In the Christian Church the Gospel of Matthew has been considered the most important portrait of Jesus' life and message. Containing Jesus' Sermon on the Mount and a uniquely rich collection of parables, among many other things, Matthew has made a major contribution to the church throughout the centuries, and it still has much to say to the church today. This superb commentary in the Pillar series explores the meaning and relevance of Matthew in an eminently straightforward fashion. Leon Morris writes for readers who use commentaries to discover further what the Bible means. Throughout, he makes clear what he considers to be the meaning of the Greek text that Matthew has bequeathed to the church. A perceptive introduction precedes Morris's warmhearted verse-by-verse exposition of Matthew, an exposition based on his own literal translation of the text. Now a standard reference work on the Gospel of Matthew, this mature, evangelically oriented commentary will continue to meet the needs of students, pastor, and general readers alike.


Author Bio‚ñº‚ñ≤
Leon Morris (19142006) retired as Principal ofRidley College in Melbourne, Australia, in 1979. He is theauthor of more than forty books, including The ApostolicPreaching of the Cross, the volumes on Matthew andRomans in The Pillar New Testament Commentary, and thevolumes on John and the Thessalonian epistles in the NewInternational Commentary on the New Testament.

            A solid, dependable, commentary with a wealth of insight. One can easily read Morris and glean significant details without getting bogged down in unduly technical or academic discussions. Morris ranks in the top 3 commentaries on Matthew, and compared to Carson and Blomberg I like Morris' work the best. If you just want a reference work, get Carson. If you want a reference work that you can sit back and enjoy reading, get Morris.

            I feel bad giving a Leon Morris book only 2 1/2 stars. His commentary on John is outstanding. However, this commentary on Matthew is not in the same category at all. I was very disappointed. As other reviewers said, Morris approaches the text reverently, however, it often reads like a connected set of word studies. The way he defines words in the text becomes very monotonous. This lacks the sparkle and warmth of his other commentaries. France's NIC would be a better choice, as would Carson's EBC.

            What a fantastic commentary by Dr. Morris. Technical but very readable. I love his translation of the Greek text, as it brings out the meaning of what Matthew was trying to get across. I thoroughly enjoyed it and my knowledge of the Gospel of Matthew has been greatly enhanced. 5 out of 5 was not high enough!

            I'm pleased to have it in my library.  On the positive side I am pleased to have the extensive footnotes he has included.  On the negative side, I don't think his writing style is very engaging.  It is a good, and thorough Evangelical commentary.
