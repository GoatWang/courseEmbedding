William Edward Barclay (14 June 1857 – 30 January 1917[1]) was the first manager of Everton and also the first manager of Liverpool, working with club secretary John McKenna.
His time at Everton was short managing them for their first 22 games. When the majority of the Everton set-up left Anfield in order to move to the purpose built Goodison Park Barclay was one of the people who stayed to form a new club which eventually became Liverpool F.C.
While he was in charge of the side that won the Second Division championship in 1893–94, Liverpool got relegated from the First Division the following season (with Liverpool losing a test match to Bury 1–0). However, in his last season as Liverpool manager, Barclay led the side to the Second Division championship in 1895–96.
Barclay also served two spells as Liverpool chairman and worked for the Football Association.

Item Description: Forgotten Books, United States, 2015. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****. Excerpt from Report of the Speeches: Delivered at a Meeting of Free Church Office-Bearers Who Disapproved of the Action of the Commission in the Case of Prof. W. Robertson Smith, Held in the Christian Institute, Glasgow, Friday, December 30, 1880 HtC. Sep )bb I j; Report Of Public Meeting. Last niglit (Dec.3(1) a i)ul)lir, meeting of lay officc-hcarcrs connected with the Free Church who disapprove of the action of the Commission in the case of Professor Robertson Smith was held in the Christian Institute. There was a large attendance of officebearers. The chair was occupied by Dr. W.G. Blackie; and beside him on the platform were the Rev. Mr. Scrymgeour, Sheriff Murray, Professor MKendrick, and Messrs. Jas. Campbell of Tulliechewan; Thos. Russell of Ascog; Peter Gardner, W.S., G.W. Clark, John MClure, Walter Duncan, J.Morison, R.Rule, Walter Macfarlane, A. A. Ferguson, J.Hart, J.L. Mitchell, J.Lawson, Boyd, Campbell-liouglas, Gilbert Eeith, N.Caw, S.Barclay, A.S. Taylor, Alex. AVatt, and G.M. Kerr, ike. The meeting having been opened with prayer by the Rev. Mr. Scrymgeour, The Chairman said in the first instance he had to read certain letters of apology which had been received from some gentlemen who were prevented being present. The first was from the Lord Dean of Guild, who said that while he was not learned enough to form an opinion on questions of Hebrew scholarship, he professed to have an opinion on the more important question of justice and fair dealing. He trusted that the next General Assembly might find the recent proceedings of the Commission to be unconstitutional, otherwise the general principle of Presbyterian Church government would fall under public condemnation. Letters had also been received from Mr. James Stevenson; from Mr. A.S. Baird; from Mr. Ness, Bellahouston Academy; from Mr. James Templeton; and from Dr. Anderson Kirkwood. The Chairman then said Fellow office-bearers, we are met tonight for a very grave and important purpose to call in question the legality and wisdom of the action of one of our Church Courts. We are met because we believe our liberties as office-bearers of the Free Church are endangered by the recent action of the Commission of the General Assembly in the case of Professor Robertson Smith; and at the same time to take such steps as may be competent to preserve our status and defend our rights. We are not to discuss the merits of Professor Robertson Smiths case; we leave them to be dealt with by the constitutional Church Courts. Consequently those who hold opposite views respecting the merits of that case may consistently unite together in carrying out the objects of this meeting.
