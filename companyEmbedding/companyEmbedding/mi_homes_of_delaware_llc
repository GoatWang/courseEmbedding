You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Menu    Talk to a Pro: 1-800-759-2248The Delaware Incorporation Pros  Home > FAQs > Why should I incorporate or form an LLC in Delaware?Why should I incorporate or form an LLC in Delaware?Delaware is an easy and reliable state in which to incorporate or form LLCs, plus the annual cost is low and the owners of the LLC as individuals are given the strongest legal protection available by any state. This is demonstrated by a US Chamber of Commerce study of state liability systems that has rated Delaware #1 in all eight studies it has conducted on all 50 states. A few examples of Delaware’s benefits include:Easy and ReliableDelaware law has been tested and provides predictability.Delaware regularly updates its laws to remain the leading state for incorporation.Delaware has a separate Court of Chancery that handles Corporation law cases quickly and competently.Lower CostsThe Delaware Corporation minimum annual franchise tax is $175 and the filing fee is $50.The Delaware LLC annual fee is $300, regardless of capitalization.Delaware does not tax intangible property such as leases or royalties (the “Delaware loophole”).ProtectionPiercing the corporate veil, or making individuals personally liable for claims against their business, is very unlikely in Delaware.Delaware explicitly makes the charging order the sole and exclusive remedy of creditors of LLC members, meaning that creditors of members can only receive distributions from the LLC, and not control foreclosure, or liquidation.

What is a Corporation, and what does Incorporating mean?A Corporation is a legal entity or legal “person” that exists completely separate from natural persons, and is typically composed of natural persons that hold stock in the corporation.Incorporating is the act of filing a new corporation.When incorporating, you have the ability to select the state of incorporation, which is the state where the initial paperwork is filed and the state that will govern the internal affairs of your business (relationship between decision makers and owners).Delaware General Corporation Law will protect your corporation only if you select to incorporate in the State of Delaware.Delaware has the most desirable legislature, statutes, case law and court system for corporate governance. Starting in Delaware is an easy choice that some business owners overlook in the haste to get started, but may regret later. Rarely is the state in which you reside as favorable as where the owners reside. After comparing all 50 states, business owners frequently decide to incorporate in Delaware.    Why Should I Incorporate in Delaware?Delaware has a reputation as the forerunner in corporate law in the United States. Industry leading companies, from credit cards (Discover, Bank of America) to technology (Google, Apple) to restaurants (McDonald’s, Chipotle) are incorporated in Delaware. So why should you join them and incorporate your business in Delaware?1. Delaware has the strongest Corporate Shield of any StateThe main reason to incorporate in Delaware is to protect personal assets from your business’s liability. This protection is referred to as the “corporate veil” or “shield”, and is especially strong in Delaware.2. Business-Friendly Government Services Many of the businesses that chose to organize in Delaware have done so because of the business-friendly government in Delaware. Delaware’s Court of Chancery is a specialized business court. With its established body of case law, the Delaware courts are experts at resolving business conflicts. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has ranked Delaware’s litigation system the best in the country for fairness every year.3. Ability to Operate a Delaware Corporation in every State or almost any CountryWith a Delaware corporation, you have the ability to conduct business in every state and almost every country. Delaware corporations do not need a bank account or business address in Delaware, they need only a Registered Agent to forward Delaware annual notices and legal notices.4. Predictability in Ownership and Management StructureDelaware’s predictable laws on ownership and management allow you to structure your business with confidence. You can even have the protection of a corporation for a one-person business. For example, one individual can be sole Director, President, Secretary, and Treasurer, as well as the sole shareholder.5. Directors and Officers are protected from lawsuitsBusiness officers and Directors have the ability to take risks and make routine business decisions without fear of having those decisions second guessed by stockholders. Even if losses result, as long as the decisions were not self-dealing, the officers and directors should be protected from personal liability.6. No Delaware income tax returns  for Corporations operating outside of DelawareDelaware corporations do not have to file Delaware tax returns if they do not conduct business in Delaware.7. Tax AdvantagesA corporation is taxed as a C-Corporation unless it elects to be taxed as an S-Corporation. If the stockholders are eligible and timely elect to be taxed as an S-Corporation with the IRS, it can save the stockholders thousands of dollars in self-employment taxes by splitting income 50/50 between self-employment income and an “S-Dividend”.8. Delaware offers speedy document approval and filings The Secretary of State’s office in Delaware maintains extended hours for filing and can approve documents in as little as one hour for additional fees.9. A Delaware Corporation can be used to manage almost anythingCorporations can range from a one personal consulting company to a multi-million dollar technology business. Corporations are not recommended for holding passive assets, like real estate.10. Delaware has the fairest courts and laws of any stateThe United States Chamber of Commerce has recognized Delaware’s business dispute and incorporation climate by ranking Delaware’s litigation system #1 over the past 9 years. The advantage of having so many business disputes resolved in Delaware is that previous conflicts have established an extensive body of case law.    How to Start a Delaware Corporation1. Choose a NameChoose a unique corporate name that is not registered with the Delaware Secretary of State. The name must include a corporate ending or abbreviation thereof (ex. “Inc.”, “Incorporated”, “Company”, “Co..”, “Corporation”, “Corp.”, “Association”, etc.) You can always file a name amendment in the future. For example, when we incorporated “Pinterest,” the original name was “Cold Brew Labs.”2. Find a Registered AgentEvery Delaware corporation is required to have a registered agent in Delaware. The registered agent will forward lawsuits and correspondence from the Delaware Secretary of State to you.You do not need to visit or have an office or any other connection to Delaware to incorporate a corporation in Delaware. Select Agents and Corporations, Inc. (IncNow) to act as your registered agent.3. Draft a Certificate of IncorporationThe Certificate of Incorporation officially brings the corporation into existence in the public record. IncNow will prepare a Certificate of Incorporation that includes:Name of the corporationName and address of the Registered Agent of the corporationStatement of the type of business that the corporation will engage inNumber of shares of authorized stock that the corporation will issuePar value of each shareName and signature of the incorporatorIndemnification clause for breaches of Duty of CareAllowance for Director Amended BylawsThe standard form from the Secretary of State leaves off recommended provisions, such as the director amended bylaws and relaxed director liability. These provisions must be included in the Certificate of Incorporation and cannot be enforced if included only in the bylaws or elsewhere.4. Annual Taxes and FeesSimilar to most states, Delaware corporations pay a “franchise tax”, or annual fee. This fee is based either on the shares authorized by the corporation on its Certificate of Incorporation, or any Amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation that change the number of shares of stock the corporation is allowed to issue.We recommend incorporating with 1500 shares of voting stock to minimize both filing and annual fees. If additional shares of restricted or non-voting stock are desired or required in the future, the authorized number of shares can be amended.5. Stockholder AgreementIf your corporation has more than one stockholder, it should have a Stockholder Agreement.Stockholder agreements are optional, but recommended.They set out the powers and rights of stockholders, as well as their relationship with the corporation and must be executed by all stockholders.A stockholder agreement can place restrictions on transferring stock.Delaware law specifically allows certain restrictions on the rights of stockholders to sell their shares.In closely held corporations with very few stockholders, these agreements are especially important because they will govern the relationship between the stockholders.Notice of the stockholder agreement must also be on the stock certificates to provide notice to possible assignees of the restrictions.Any corporation with more than one stockholder should have a Stockholder Agreement to minimize future problems of valuation, buyback, and unwanted third parties owning stock as transfers or assignees.6. Stockholder Agreement ServiceTo the surprise of many business owners, bylaws do not include provisions for rights of first refusal or buy-out provisions for stockholders. Corporation stockholders should consider a Stockholder Agreement — an important additional service to protect their stockholders’ expectations.We offer a standard Delaware Stockholder Agreement for $199.A Delaware attorney developed this Stockholder Agreement in the course of practice.It has been modified for our customers to provide extra rights and protection for stockholders to prevent outsiders from becoming unwanted stockholders in their company in the event of a sale of stock or death of a shareholder.This document gives you a running start to future planning for your Corporation.    C-Corporations vs. S-CorporationsThe “C” vs. “S” discussion should not impact your pre-incorporation decision. While corporations are C-Corporations by default when they are incorporated, it is very easy to change classifications between C-Corporations and S-Corporations.There is no distinction between the Certificate of Incorporation for a C-Corporation and that for an S-Corporation. Every Corporation filed with any of the 50 US States starts out simply as a general Corporation.    ConclusionDelaware’s pro-business climate, makes it the location of choice for anyone seeking to incorporate their business. Whether large or small, your business can reap the benefits of incorporating in Delaware.

We do not believe that is usually necessary because it costs $75 and it would be easier to just file the company to see if the name is available.

With years of experience, the incorporation specialists at IncNow (Agents and Corporations, Inc.) can assist you with any questions you may have about forming a limited liability company in Delaware. IncNow can help you understand topics such as the common provisions included in Operating Agreements and Certificates of Formation.As a Delaware Commercial Registered Agent, IncNow has a higher filing priority than agents outside of Delaware and self-filers, which means your documents are normally returned to you in 1-3 days, not weeks.    How do you form a Delaware LLC?Choose a Delaware LLC NameRegistering a Delaware LLC requires 2 things:Filing a Certificate of FormationDocumenting your Operating AgreementBefore filing the Certificate of Formation, you must first check the prospective business name with the Delaware Secretary of State for conflicts, which can be done online at Incnow.com.Additionally, Delaware law requires that all new LLCs have either “Limited Liability Company”, “LLC”, or “L.L.C.” in the company name. If, at a later date, you want to change your LLC name, you can do so through an Amendment to the Certificate of Formation.Delaware Registered Agent RequirementYou can form an LLC in Delaware without visiting, opening an office, or maintaining a bank account in Delaware; however, the Delaware LLC Act requires any company incorporated in Delaware to have a Delaware Registered Agent with an in-state street address. Agents and Corporations, Inc. (IncNow) will act as Registered Agent for companies incorporating in Delaware for a small annual fee.After formation, the Registered Agent receives State of Delaware notices and is required to be generally available during business hours to accept and forward court notices to you (service of process). The Registered Agent will be there for the life of your company, so it’s important to find one that is professional and reliable. Agents and Corporations (IncNow) has been a Delaware Registered Agent since 1974, and at the same office since 1982. IncNow is family operated by Delaware attorneys who specialize in corporate law.Delaware Certificate of Formation RequirementsOur office will sign as the authorized person (also known as an organizer) and file a Certificate of Formation with the Secretary of State’s Division of Corporations to form the Delaware LLC on public record. Your name and address are not listed on public filings unless requested by you. Other states refer to this document as Articles of Organization, but Delaware does not use that term.A Certificate of Formation must include:The name of the LLCThe name and address of the registered agentThe signature of an authorized individualOf special note, if the Delaware LLC is a Series LLC, which protects assets of parts of the LLC from the liabilities of other parts of the LLC, then this must be indicated on the Certificate of Formation (more information on the Series LLC may be found elsewhere on this site). Many optional provisions could also be included in the Certificate of Formation. Upon special request, we can include the names of members and/or managers on the Certificate of Formation.Delaware LLC Operating AgreementWith our complete package, we draft an Operating Agreement to set forth the ownership and management structure and procedures. Delaware requires that LLCs have an Operating Agreement that will govern it; however, Delaware does not require that the Operating Agreement be filed with the state, or even be in writing.It is recommended that you have a written, signed agreement. Even in a single-member Delaware LLC, the Operating Agreement is important because it provides a decision-making structure that will benefit the LLC when dealing with other entities, increase protection, and increase credibility for financial transactions. The Operating Agreement will include provisions such as liability, ownership, dissolution, and transfer of interest, among others.Many incorporation services use boilerplate agreements without provisions to prevent common problems. A well-crafted Delaware Operating Agreement should serve like a prenuptial agreement to avoid any partnership disputes between members should any member decide to go in a different direction.Signing the LLC Operating AgreementOnce the Delaware Operating Agreement has been drafted and approved, all members should execute it. Most Delaware LLCs, as a practical matter, will not draft and finalize the Operating Agreement until after formation. Many formal requirements of corporations, such as those related to voting and annual meetings, are not required by LLCs.  To this extent, many well-crafted Operating Agreements will avoid bureaucracy to streamline your business operations.While an Operating Agreement can be enforceable unsigned, it is more difficult to prove that an unsigned Operating Agreement was agreed upon by all members. In multi-member LLCs, it is especially important to have a signed Operating Agreement. Should you change the agreement or ownership structure, an amended and restated LLC Operating Agreement should be signed each time the agreement changes.    Top 10 Reasons to Form an LLC in Delaware1. Delaware LLCs offer the most protection for you and your business with two-way protectionBy forming a Delaware LLC, you safeguard your personal assets by building a shield between them and your business liabilities. This means that, if the business itself cannot pay a creditor, then this shield makes it difficult for creditors to penetrate into your personal assets, such as your house, car and other personal possessions.Delaware explicitly makes the “Charging Order” the sole and exclusive remedy for creditors of LLC members. This prevents creditors of your business partners from taking over the company. Creditors of a member can only get an economic interest in the LLC’s distributions to that member, not a control interest or a right to liquidate the LLC.2. Delaware’s laws provide the strongest shield of any stateDelaware governs the internal affairs of your company, including its liability shield. The corporate protection or “corporate shield” afforded by the Delaware LLC Act, which protects the personal assets of individual owners from creditors of their business, is thicker than any protection offered in any other state.3. Delaware LLCs can operate in almost any State or CountryYou can form a Delaware LLC no matter where your business activities take place or where you live in the United States. Outside the United States, there are very few countries and individuals restricted from using a Delaware LLC, and a Delaware LLC does not need to have a bank account or office in Delaware. A Registered Agent, such as IncNow, maintains a physical address in Delaware required to forward court and Delaware government notices to you.4. Delaware treats you like an adult and lets you manage your businessWhen entering into a Delaware LLC, it is flexible in ownership and management structure. One individual can serve as both the owner and manager. An LLC is governed by its Operating Agreement, allowing you to arrange your business affairs between owners as you see fit and have that arrangement enforced as written. Since the LLC is a contractual entity, it is important that the Delaware courts honor the contract between the parties as written. Furthermore, there is no required annual general meeting, and there is much less administrative paperwork in general, compared to a corporation.5. Managers are protected from lawsuitsThe LLC Agreement in Delaware can reduce or eliminate fiduciary duties. This allows business managers and controlling, managing members the flexibility to take risks that are not readily questioned by minority investors, provided such actions are not in bad faith. Even if the fiduciary duties are not waived or reduced, business managers have the freedom to make business decisions, even if losses result without manager liability, provided the decisions are not self-dealing. Even self-dealing is not entirely prohibited; instead, self-dealing needs to be “entirely fair” to the other members.6. No Delaware income tax if your operations are in other states (and other business tax loopholes)There is no Delaware tax return to file for LLCs that are formed in Delaware, provided they conduct no business in Delaware.As with LLCs in other states, profits are taxed personally at the member level, but not at the LLC level. An LLC is taxed as a sole proprietorship or partnership, unless it elects S-Corporation or C-Corporation tax status.Having an LLC that elects to be taxed as an S-Corporation can save thousands in self-employment taxes because your income can be split 50/50 between self-employment income and “S-Dividend” income. The S-Dividend can reduce your taxes by thousands. For example, splitting $200,000 of income would save the S-electing LLC member more than $4,000 in social security and Medicare taxes. Learn more about these advantages in our LLC tax tips section.7. Delaware’s speedy approvals and filingsThe Delaware Secretary of State’s office maintains extended hours for filing and can expedite filings to as fast as one hour.8. You can use a Delaware LLC to own and manage almost anythingThe business uses can range from one person sales or consulting businesses to multi-million dollar commercial properties. It may operate an active business or simply hold passive assets, like real estate or intellectual property.Most common uses include:To hold real property, such as personal or business real estateTo operate a service businessTo hold tangible personal property or intangible assets such as airplanes, automobiles, boats and patents9. Delaware’s business courts handle business disputes in weeks, not yearsDelaware has a separate court for the resolution of business disputes, the Court of Chancery. Its appointed judges are highly experienced in business cases, and effectively solve corporate disputes in a way that other states do not. There are no jury trials in the Court of Chancery, so Court’s expertise is brought to bear in the decision of every case before the Court.The Delaware court system can act very quickly. Sometimes, the whole process, from start to finish (discovery and motions to trial decisions), can be over in two months. Written decisions from the Court of Chancery are the standard, and are often 100 pages long. This well-reasoned process avoids arbitrary outcomes. Even appeals to the Delaware Supreme Court can be expedited. The Delaware judges do their homework and read all the pleadings carefully before hearings and trials.10. Delaware has the most pro-business laws of any US stateDelaware’s law is generally thought to be pro-business, and has a “goldilocks” balance of being stable and slowly evolving – to be cutting edge without upsetting existing businesses. Because of the maturity of Delaware’s law and the high volume of corporate cases handled by Delaware’s judicial system, there is predictability in outcomes.This means if there have been several similar cases to the one facing your LLC, there is less uncertainty about the judicial outcome, which can be key in deciding to settle a dispute or invest the time and capital to litigate. Even when judges change, it is not a favoritism or political system. Judges in Delaware make reasoned, non-political decisions.

Form a Delaware LLC or Corporation

Companies Served Since 1981

     











Harvard Business Services, Inc. has been Delaware's premiere business formation specialist since 1981. We are family-owned and operated, and our mission is to make the Delaware incorporation process quick, easy and efficient. Learn more about our services and why Delaware is the corporate capital of the world in the two videos below.





Why Incorporate in Delaware?

Over half of Fortune 500 companies have selected Delaware as the state in which to incorporate. We'll tell you why.

Why You Should Incorporate in Delaware





Why Use Harvard to Incorporate?

Thirty years of lightning-fast filings, unparalleled customer service and the lowest fees in the industry make Harvard Business Services, Inc. the smart choice.

How Harvard Business Services, Inc. Works





Message From the Chairman:

Welcome to DelawareInc.com. You've come to the right place to form your Delaware LLC or set up a Delaware corporation. We have helped more than 125,000 people form Delaware companies in our 30+ years in business, and we'll form more than 10,000 new companies this year. We consider it an honor to help you form your Delaware company, and we're here to help you be successful.
We specialize in excellent customer service. When you call, email or live chat with our offices, you will receive personal attention from a knowledgeable specialist happy to help you learn about the Delaware incorporation process and how you can incorporate in Delaware.
 
Once your company is formed, we'll be your Delaware Registered Agent for the life of your company. Our annual Registered Agent Fee is the lowest in the industry—only $50 per year, per company, and we do something no other Registered Agent does: we guarantee your Registered Agent Fee will remain fixed at $50 per year. We've held to that guarantee for more than 3 decades and we'll hold to it for the life of the company you form with us.
We'll remind you every year at Delaware Franchise Tax time, and even offer to take care of your tax filing for you for a small fee, guaranteeing on-time payment and ensuring your company remains in compliance and good standing with the state of Delaware.
If you're considering incorporating in Delaware, I suggest you take a look at the two videos above. You'll get a first-hand tour of our offices and meet some of the people at your service and ready to help you when you call us at 1-800-345-2677. You'll also learn the basics about why Delaware is known all over the world as the corporate capital of the United States, and how to register a company in Delaware.
Finally, I invite you to contact me personally if you have any comments about our service, questions about forming an LLC or corporation in Delaware or you'd like to share your opinions about our website, DelawareInc.com.
Here's to you, and to your success!
Sincerely,

Richard H. Bell
Chairman & CEO

Leading Central Ohio Homebuilder
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own new home to fit the way you live in one of our convenient new home communities.
15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with a 15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.

A Safe & Secure Home
We want you to feel safe in your new home!  That’s why every new home in Columbus comes with a Schlage Keypad Lock .  You can control the locks on your home directly from your phone.  This safety device allows you to see what time the door is locked and unlocked using specific user codes. *Not included in Smart Series homes.
Where We Build
We are building new homes in premier locations across Columbus and Central Ohio.  From the white fences of New Albany to the old world architecture of Dublin, our neighborhoods are a step above.  We offer new community and new home opportunities in: Blacklick,  Delaware, Gahanna, Galena, Grove City, Hilliard, Lewis Center, Licking Heights, Marysville, Olentangy, Pickerington, Powell, and Westerville.

Our Company
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Today, our commitment to our customers is evident in all of our new homes in Indianapolis. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own home to fit the way you live in one of our convenient new home communities.
Industry Leading 15-Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with an Industry Leading 15-Year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.

Quality Construction
At M/I Homes, quality construction has always been a part of our backbone. This means we go above the industry standards to ensure our homes are well built. We use 2”x6” lumber to create stronger, more stable exterior walls.  This also allows for R19, a thicker insulation than the standard (R13).  We also build our homes' walls with the ZIP System®, a one-of-a-kind structural system with a built-in, energy efficient barrier that keeps the elements out while keeping you comfortable and helping you save on your energy bills!
Where We Build
We are building new homes in premier locations across Indianapolis and Central Indiana. Whether it's neighboring the Carmel Arts District, Monon Trail, inches from Grand Park, or historic Cumberland Trail, we build where you want to live.  We offer new community and new home opportunities in leading school districts, Avon, Brownsburg, Carmel, Center Grove, Clark Pleasant, Franklin Township, Franklin, Hamilton Southeastern, Lawrence, Noblesville, Pike, Mt. Vernon, Washington, Westfield-Washington and Zionsville.

Leading New Homebuilder in Tampa
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Our new homes in Tampa are no exception.  M/I Homes in Tampa offers a wide variety of award winning floor plans to choose from whether you are a first-time home buyer or looking to move up to a new home. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own to fit your lifestyle in one of our beautiful communities and see for yourself why we are the new home leader.
Cleaner, Greener and More Cost Efficient Living
Every home we build is built to our stringent Whole Home guidelines. What does this mean to you? Not only do you get one of the most energy efficient homes on the market today, but we also care about the environment and use procedures to lessen the carbon footprint. Each home is tested and provided with a HERS score showing just how energy efficient your home is.
15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with an Industry-Leading 15 Year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.
Where We Build
We build new homes in premier locations across the Tampa Bay Area. You can find your perfect home in locations such as The Westchase area, Citrus Park, Odessa, Lutz, New Tampa, Lakeland, Land O'Lakes, and Riverview.

Leading Washington/Baltimore Area Homebuilder
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity, and above all, treating the customer right. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own new home to fit the way you live in one of our convenient new home communities in Maryland!
15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty*
We back our homes with an industry-leading, 15 Year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.
Cleaner, Greener and More Cost Efficient Living
Every home we build is Energy Star® Certified. And you’ll get more from there. Our Whole Home envelope means you save money and you live in a healthier environment. Our homes are inspected by an independent, RESNET certified rater so we can show you how much you’ll save compared to a home built to code or a resale home. 
Where We Build
We are building new homes in premier locations across Maryland. From executive style single family homes to upscale urban townhomes, our neighborhoods are a step above. We offer new communities and new home opportunities in Charles, Montgomery, Prince George’s, Anne Arundel and Howard counties.
*Not available on homes with condominium ownership.


























    The HERS Index Score for each community is the average HERS Index Score of all homes built in that community over the most recent 12 months.  The HERS Index Score is unique to every home based on a number of variables, therefore the HERS Index Score for your home may differ.  Please see your new home consultant for more information.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Menu    Talk to a Pro: 1-800-759-2248The Delaware Incorporation Pros  Home > FAQs > Why should I incorporate or form an LLC in Delaware?Why should I incorporate or form an LLC in Delaware?Delaware is an easy and reliable state in which to incorporate or form LLCs, plus the annual cost is low and the owners of the LLC as individuals are given the strongest legal protection available by any state. This is demonstrated by a US Chamber of Commerce study of state liability systems that has rated Delaware #1 in all eight studies it has conducted on all 50 states. A few examples of Delaware’s benefits include:Easy and ReliableDelaware law has been tested and provides predictability.Delaware regularly updates its laws to remain the leading state for incorporation.Delaware has a separate Court of Chancery that handles Corporation law cases quickly and competently.Lower CostsThe Delaware Corporation minimum annual franchise tax is $175 and the filing fee is $50.The Delaware LLC annual fee is $300, regardless of capitalization.Delaware does not tax intangible property such as leases or royalties (the “Delaware loophole”).ProtectionPiercing the corporate veil, or making individuals personally liable for claims against their business, is very unlikely in Delaware.Delaware explicitly makes the charging order the sole and exclusive remedy of creditors of LLC members, meaning that creditors of members can only receive distributions from the LLC, and not control foreclosure, or liquidation.

Menu    Talk to a Pro: 1-800-759-2248The Delaware Incorporation Pros  Home > FAQs > How can I find out if the name I want is already taken?How can I find out if the name I want is already taken?IncNow (Agents and Corporations, Inc.) provides two easy ways to discover the availability of an entity name.The first way is to submit an order to IncNow and we will check the name that business day.The second way is to call us at 1-800-759-2248 or email agents@incnow.com, where a representative can check the availability of a desired entity name at no charge.Checking the State of Delaware’s website for availability can be misleading because the business search tool shows former names that are no longer conflicts but does not display some names which may pose conflicts, for example when the corporate ending is different.You can use the “name reservation” tool at corp.delaware.gov to confirm availability. We do not believe that is usually necessary because it costs $75 and it would be easier to just file the company to see if the name is available.

Prepare stock certificates for one or more stockholdersOrdering our attorney-developed shareholder agreement will help keep the stock from being transferred to unwanted third parties. This is recommended for all corporations with more than one stockholder.    What is a Corporation, and what does Incorporating mean?A Corporation is a legal entity or legal “person” that exists completely separate from natural persons, and is typically composed of natural persons that hold stock in the corporation.Incorporating is the act of filing a new corporation.When incorporating, you have the ability to select the state of incorporation, which is the state where the initial paperwork is filed and the state that will govern the internal affairs of your business (relationship between decision makers and owners).Delaware General Corporation Law will protect your corporation only if you select to incorporate in the State of Delaware.Delaware has the most desirable legislature, statutes, case law and court system for corporate governance. Starting in Delaware is an easy choice that some business owners overlook in the haste to get started, but may regret later. Rarely is the state in which you reside as favorable as where the owners reside. After comparing all 50 states, business owners frequently decide to incorporate in Delaware.    Why Should I Incorporate in Delaware?Delaware has a reputation as the forerunner in corporate law in the United States. Industry leading companies, from credit cards (Discover, Bank of America) to technology (Google, Apple) to restaurants (McDonald’s, Chipotle) are incorporated in Delaware. So why should you join them and incorporate your business in Delaware?1. Delaware has the strongest Corporate Shield of any StateThe main reason to incorporate in Delaware is to protect personal assets from your business’s liability. This protection is referred to as the “corporate veil” or “shield”, and is especially strong in Delaware.2. Business-Friendly Government Services Many of the businesses that chose to organize in Delaware have done so because of the business-friendly government in Delaware. Delaware’s Court of Chancery is a specialized business court. With its established body of case law, the Delaware courts are experts at resolving business conflicts. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has ranked Delaware’s litigation system the best in the country for fairness every year.3. Ability to Operate a Delaware Corporation in every State or almost any CountryWith a Delaware corporation, you have the ability to conduct business in every state and almost every country. Delaware corporations do not need a bank account or business address in Delaware, they need only a Registered Agent to forward Delaware annual notices and legal notices.4. Predictability in Ownership and Management StructureDelaware’s predictable laws on ownership and management allow you to structure your business with confidence. You can even have the protection of a corporation for a one-person business. For example, one individual can be sole Director, President, Secretary, and Treasurer, as well as the sole shareholder.5. Directors and Officers are protected from lawsuitsBusiness officers and Directors have the ability to take risks and make routine business decisions without fear of having those decisions second guessed by stockholders. Even if losses result, as long as the decisions were not self-dealing, the officers and directors should be protected from personal liability.6. No Delaware income tax returns  for Corporations operating outside of DelawareDelaware corporations do not have to file Delaware tax returns if they do not conduct business in Delaware.7. Tax AdvantagesA corporation is taxed as a C-Corporation unless it elects to be taxed as an S-Corporation. If the stockholders are eligible and timely elect to be taxed as an S-Corporation with the IRS, it can save the stockholders thousands of dollars in self-employment taxes by splitting income 50/50 between self-employment income and an “S-Dividend”.8. Delaware offers speedy document approval and filings The Secretary of State’s office in Delaware maintains extended hours for filing and can approve documents in as little as one hour for additional fees.9. A Delaware Corporation can be used to manage almost anythingCorporations can range from a one personal consulting company to a multi-million dollar technology business. Corporations are not recommended for holding passive assets, like real estate.10. Delaware has the fairest courts and laws of any stateThe United States Chamber of Commerce has recognized Delaware’s business dispute and incorporation climate by ranking Delaware’s litigation system #1 over the past 9 years. The advantage of having so many business disputes resolved in Delaware is that previous conflicts have established an extensive body of case law.    How to Start a Delaware Corporation1. Choose a NameChoose a unique corporate name that is not registered with the Delaware Secretary of State. The name must include a corporate ending or abbreviation thereof (ex. “Inc.”, “Incorporated”, “Company”, “Co..”, “Corporation”, “Corp.”, “Association”, etc.) You can always file a name amendment in the future. For example, when we incorporated “Pinterest,” the original name was “Cold Brew Labs.”2. Find a Registered AgentEvery Delaware corporation is required to have a registered agent in Delaware. The registered agent will forward lawsuits and correspondence from the Delaware Secretary of State to you.You do not need to visit or have an office or any other connection to Delaware to incorporate a corporation in Delaware. Select Agents and Corporations, Inc. (IncNow) to act as your registered agent.3. Draft a Certificate of IncorporationThe Certificate of Incorporation officially brings the corporation into existence in the public record. IncNow will prepare a Certificate of Incorporation that includes:Name of the corporationName and address of the Registered Agent of the corporationStatement of the type of business that the corporation will engage inNumber of shares of authorized stock that the corporation will issuePar value of each shareName and signature of the incorporatorIndemnification clause for breaches of Duty of CareAllowance for Director Amended BylawsThe standard form from the Secretary of State leaves off recommended provisions, such as the director amended bylaws and relaxed director liability. These provisions must be included in the Certificate of Incorporation and cannot be enforced if included only in the bylaws or elsewhere.4. Annual Taxes and FeesSimilar to most states, Delaware corporations pay a “franchise tax”, or annual fee. This fee is based either on the shares authorized by the corporation on its Certificate of Incorporation, or any Amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation that change the number of shares of stock the corporation is allowed to issue.We recommend incorporating with 1500 shares of voting stock to minimize both filing and annual fees. If additional shares of restricted or non-voting stock are desired or required in the future, the authorized number of shares can be amended.5. Stockholder AgreementIf your corporation has more than one stockholder, it should have a Stockholder Agreement.Stockholder agreements are optional, but recommended.They set out the powers and rights of stockholders, as well as their relationship with the corporation and must be executed by all stockholders.A stockholder agreement can place restrictions on transferring stock.Delaware law specifically allows certain restrictions on the rights of stockholders to sell their shares.In closely held corporations with very few stockholders, these agreements are especially important because they will govern the relationship between the stockholders.Notice of the stockholder agreement must also be on the stock certificates to provide notice to possible assignees of the restrictions.Any corporation with more than one stockholder should have a Stockholder Agreement to minimize future problems of valuation, buyback, and unwanted third parties owning stock as transfers or assignees.6. Stockholder Agreement ServiceTo the surprise of many business owners, bylaws do not include provisions for rights of first refusal or buy-out provisions for stockholders. Corporation stockholders should consider a Stockholder Agreement — an important additional service to protect their stockholders’ expectations.We offer a standard Delaware Stockholder Agreement for $199.A Delaware attorney developed this Stockholder Agreement in the course of practice.It has been modified for our customers to provide extra rights and protection for stockholders to prevent outsiders from becoming unwanted stockholders in their company in the event of a sale of stock or death of a shareholder.This document gives you a running start to future planning for your Corporation.    C-Corporations vs. S-CorporationsThe “C” vs. “S” discussion should not impact your pre-incorporation decision. While corporations are C-Corporations by default when they are incorporated, it is very easy to change classifications between C-Corporations and S-Corporations.There is no distinction between the Certificate of Incorporation for a C-Corporation and that for an S-Corporation. Every Corporation filed with any of the 50 US States starts out simply as a general Corporation.    ConclusionDelaware’s pro-business climate, makes it the location of choice for anyone seeking to incorporate their business. Whether large or small, your business can reap the benefits of incorporating in Delaware.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        IncFile.com, LLC has received 4.7 out of 5 stars based on 13 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
