								Ambient Temp Is Not True Payload Temp!							




						Todd Berard					

Sensor based logistics for temperature-sensitive shipments can provide meaningful and actionable data, IF you are measuring the right stuff. Toss in the box GPS-based sensors purport to monitor payload temperature, but significant gradients can exist between the biologic payload temperature and the interior of the shipping container. In the tightly regulated 2-8°C environment, an excursion of a degree or two above or below this range might mean the difference between cells arriving alive and functional vs. dying or dead. Your patients deserve better!

Our Full Line of Biopreservation Products














Success in the regenerative medicine, biobanking, and drug discovery industries depends on the shelf life and viability of cells, tissues, and organs designated for research or clinical applications. We can help you be successful with best-in-class, cGMP-grade biopreservation media products that significantly extend stability and improve post-biopreservation viability and function of your biologic source material, intermediates, and final products.
















 








CryoStor®
Optimized Freeze Media for Cells and Tissues
CryoStor cryopreservation freeze media products have been designed to mitigate temperature-induced molecular cell stress responses during freezing and thawing.
CryoStor proprietary freeze media products are intended for cryopreservation of biologics at -70 to -196°C and are based on the novel HypoThermosol formula.
All CryoStor products are pre-formulated with USP grade DMSO, a permeant solute cryoprotective agent which helps mitigate damage from the formation of intracellular ice.
Across a broad spectrum of cell types, CryoStor products have proven much more effective in reducing post-preservation necrosis and apoptosis as compared to commercial and home-brew isotonic and extracellular formulations. This enables greatly improved post-thaw cell yield, viability, and recovery.
CryoStor products meet USP <71> Sterility and USP <85> Endotoxin testing standards, and are manufactured under cGMP.
CryoStor is offered in several packages and pre-formulated with DMSO in final concentrations of 2%, 5%, and 10%

HypoThermosol® FRS

Hypothermic Storage and Shipping Media
HypoThermosol biopreservation media is a novel, engineered, optimized hypothermic storage and shipping media product.

Serum-free, protein-free HypoThermosol is designed to provide maximum storage and shipping stability for biologics at 2-8°C.
This proprietary, optimized formulation mitigates temperature-induced molecular cell stress responses that occur during chilling and re-warming of biologics, intermediate products, and final cell products intended for research and clinical applications.
Similar to our companion freeze media CryoStor, HypoThermosol FRS includes components that scavenge free radicals, provide pH buffering, oncotic/osmotic support, energy substrates, and ionic concentrations that balance the intracellular state at low temperatures.
Across a broad spectrum of cell and tissue types, HypoThermosol product has proven much more effective in reducing post-preservation necrosis and apoptosis as compared to commercial and home-brew isotonic and extracellular formulations. This results in greatly extended shelf life and improved post-preservation viability.
HypoThermosol meets USP <71> Sterility and USP <85> Endotoxin testing standards, and is manufactured under cGMP.

BioLife Solutions, Inc. (BLFS.OB) Launches Two New Product Packaging Options For Bloodstor® And Cryostor® Freeze Media  











Tweet








11/17/2014 11:39:31 AM


BOTHELL, Wash., Nov. 17, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- BioLife Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLFS), a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of proprietary clinical grade hypothermic storage and cryopreservation freeze media and precision thermal shipping products for cells and tissues  ("BioLife" or the "Company"), today announced it has launched two new improved packaging options for its BloodStor and CryoStor cryopreservation freeze media products.   Current aseptic processing methods predominantly rely on repeated access and dispensing from media containers, via pipetting from the open mouth of the bottle, which carries an increased risk of contamination.  Emerging best practices supported by the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) and the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT) include optimization steps to build and maintain sterile, closed system processing operations to reduce the risk of bioburden introduction to the biologic payload in storage and freezing containers.Sterile, Single-Use SyringesBioLife's BloodStor 55-5, a generic 55% DMSO/5% Dextran cryopreservation freeze media formulation used in cord blood banking, is now available in sterile, single-use syringes with a fill volume of 8ml, supporting manual and automatic processing of cord blood units.  CryoStor, BioLife's proprietary cryopreservation freeze media product, widely utilized in regenerative medicine development projects and clinical trials, is now also available in single-use syringes with a 10ml fill volume.  Sterile, single-use syringes support improved aseptic processing by enabling a direct luer connection to the biologic freezing bag; supporting manual or automatic dispensing with the use of a syringe pump. Biocompatible materials include a proprietary cyclic olefin polymer syringe body, FluroTec® film coated plunger, and polymethylpentene tip cap.  Additional product information can be found here http://biolifesolutions.com/cgmp-biopreservation-media-products/polymeric-syringes/.Bulk Dispensing BagsSupporting high volume processing operations, BioLife has also launched one-liter bulk dispensing bag options for BloodStor and CryoStor.  In addition to reduced packaging, bulk bag containers include traditional spike and luer connectors and also a tail of weldable/dockable tubing, enabling sterile connections to the final freezing container outside a laminar flow hood.After extensive research and testing, BioLife selected the Thermo Scientific CX5-14 film for the bag product contact material. PharMed® BPT tubing from Saint-Gobain was also selected due its robustness and compatibility with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a primary cryoprotective agent (CPA) in the formulations of BloodStor and CryoStor. Additional product information can be found here: http://biolifesolutions.com/cgmp-biopreservation-media-products/process-friendly-one-liter-bags/.  Aby J. Mathew, PhD, Senior Vice President & Chief Technology Officer at BioLife Solutions, commented on the introduction of these new packaging options for BioLife products by stating, "Our active involvement with customers and industry organizations such as ISCT, AABB, and IBC Life Sciences enabled our team to respond to the need for new packaging alternatives that support improved aseptic processing of clinical cells and tissues. We strive to support the continuous evolvement of best practices in the development and commercialization of cell and tissue therapies."A 2013 visiongain Translational Regenerative Medicine market research report forecasts that the regenerative medicine market comprised of cell and gene therapies and tissue-engineered products will grow to more than $23 billion by 2024. BioLife estimates that the Company's biopreservation media products are now incorporated into the collection, storage, shipping, freezing, and/or patient administration processes of at least 130 customer clinical trials or novel cell-based regenerative medicine products and therapies.  About BioLife SolutionsBioLife Solutions develops, manufactures and markets hypothermic storage and cryopreservation solutions and precision thermal shipping products for cells, tissues, and organs. BioLife also performs contract aseptic media formulation, fill, and finish services. The Company's proprietary HypoThermosol® and CryoStor® platform of solutions are highly valued in the biobanking, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine markets. BioLife's biopreservation media products are serum-free and protein-free, fully defined, and are formulated to reduce preservation-induced cell damage and death.  BioLife's enabling technology provides commercial companies and clinical researchers significant improvement in shelf life and post-preservation viability and function of cells, tissues, and organs.  For more information please visit www.biolifesolutions.com, and follow BioLife on Twitter.This press release contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements concerning the company's anticipated business and operations, the potential utility of and market for its products and services, potential revenue growth and market expansion, new products, and third party projections regarding the future market for regenerative medicine and cold chain packaging and instrumentation services.

This optimized formulation mitigates temperature-induced molecular cell stress responses that occur during chilling and re-warming of biologics, intermediate products and final cell products intended for research and clinical applications. Serum-free, protein-free HypoThermosol FRS is designed to provide maximum storage and shipping stability for biologics at 2-8 degree Celsius.CryoStorCryoStor cryopreservation freeze media products mitigate temperature-induced molecular cell stress responses during freezing and thawing. CryoStor freeze media products are intended for cryopreservation of biologics at subzero temperatures (most often utilized within the range of -80 to -196 degree Celsius). All CryoStor products are pre-formulated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a permeating cryoprotective agent, which helps mitigate damage from the formation of intracellular ice. CryoStor is offered in several packages and pre-formulated with DMSO in final concentrations of approximately 2%, 5% and 10%.BloodStorBloodStor freeze media is a series of generic freeze media products used to cryopreserve stem and other cells isolated from umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood and bone marrow where the processing methods require addition of high concentration DMSO. BloodStor 55-5 is pre-formulated with 55% weight/volume (w/v) DMSO USP/EP, approximately 5% (w/v) Dextran-40 the United States Pharmacopia/ European Pharmacopoeia (USP/EP) and Water for Injection (WFI) quality water. BloodStor 100 contains approximately 100% (w/v) DMSO USP/EP. BloodStor 27 NaCl is pre-formulated with approximately 27% (w/v) DMSO in saline components and Water for Injection (WFI) quality water.Cell Thawing MediaCell Thawing Media provides Dextran and saline for washing cryopreserved cells and tissues to dilute or remove cryoprotectants. Cell thawing media is pre-formulated with approximately 10% Dextran 40 in over 0.9% NaCl and over 10% Dextran 40 in over 5% Dextrose.PrepaStorPrepaStor is a flush solution designed for use during the transitions from normothermic to mild hypothermic conditions to rinse culture media and native fluids from tissue and whole organ systems prior to suspension in a preservation solution. PrepaStor is also used to support the transition from hypothermic to normothermic temperatures following the preservation interval.biologistex cold-chain management serviceThe Company's biologistex cold-chain management service includes unlimited use of the evo Smart Shipper and the integrated track and trace cloud-based Web application, mybiologistex.com.

BioLife Solutions, Inc. (BLFS.OB) Products Now Used in More than 50 Clinical Trial-Stage Cellular Therapies  











Tweet








10/29/2012 9:57:47 AM


 BOTHELL, Wash., Oct. 29, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- BioLife Solutions, Inc. (OTCBB: BLFS), a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of proprietary clinical grade hypothermic storage and cryopreservation freeze media for cells and tissues, and contract aseptic media manufacturer, today announced the Company's novel biopreservation technology is being used in more than 50 clinical trial-stage cellular therapies, making it the leading choice in the emerging, high growth field of regenerative medicine. Management believes that the Company holds the number one supplier position among companies offering pre-formulated cell and tissue storage and freeze media used in clinical trial stage cellular therapies to treat the leading causes of death and disability such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, and joint/movement disorders.(Photo:  http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20121029/LA01346-INFO) (Logo:  http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090814/BIOLIFELOGO) BioLife Chief Executive Officer Mike Rice indicated that the Company's revenue from its growing regenerative medicine customer base, along with its selective targeting of contract manufacturing customers, should generate cash and profits in the interim until some regenerative medicine customers gain approval and adoption. At that point, profitable growth should accelerate in a step-wise fashion.Rice commented: "We've built a very strong franchise for HypoThermosol® and CryoStor® in developing commercial cell and tissue-based products and therapies.  It's very satisfying to see the biopreservation efficacy and best-in-class quality of our products recognized by more companies and hospital-based transplant centers using pre-formulated storage, shipping, and freeze media products. Since 2006, we've consistently converted these customers from using 'home-brew' formulations to our cGMP, protein-free, serum-free biopreservation media products."Based on customers cross-referencing BioLife's FDA Master Files for its HypoThermosol and CryoStor products for use in their regulatory filings, customer orders, and other customer communication, BioLife management believes the Company's potential annual revenue from the regenerative medicine market could reach $50 million over the next several years, should its customers be successful in obtaining regulatory approval for their cell-based products currently in clinical trials.A recent visiongain report "Translational Regenerative Medicine: Market Prospects 2012-2022" values the regenerative medicine market at $1.4 billion in 2012, and growing to $10 billion by 2020.  BioLife's addressable portion of the market is the demand for reagents used to store, ship and freeze source material and manufactured doses of cell-based products and therapies.Rice continued, "The challenges in commercializing cell-based products have been exposed since the first few approvals were granted.  Product shelf life and post-preservation viability are critical to good clinical outcomes and commercial success, and we're pleased to see the field recognize the reduction in overall manufacturing costs that can be enabled through the use of our products.  Bioprocessing and biopreservation are executed along a continuum, with cumulative positive and negative yield and cost impact, depending on the quality and performance of the tools and reagents used along the way.  HypoThermosol and CryoStor are recognized as critical reagents and we're looking forward to seeing our customers' products in the market and available to clinicians and patients in the years to come."BioLife Solutions is co-sponsoring the Stem Cells on the Mesa conference October 29  30, in La Jolla, CA.  The Company plans to file its 10-Q quarterly report for the third quarter of 2012 on November 13.About BioLife SolutionsBioLife Solutions develops, manufactures and markets patented hypothermic storage and cryopreservation solutions for cells and tissues.  The Company's proprietary HypoThermosol® and CryoStor® platform of solutions are marketed to academic and commercial organizations involved in cell therapy, tissue engineering, cord blood banking, drug discovery, and toxicology testing. BioLife's products are serum-free and protein-free, fully defined, and are formulated to reduce preservation-induced, delayed-onset cell damage and death.  BioLife's enabling technology provides academic and clinical researchers significant improvements in post-thaw cell, tissue, and organ viability and function.

Description



        		Application
				
				

        HypoThermosol is an optimized hypothermic (2-8°C) preservation media that enables improved and extended preservation of cells, tissues and organs. HypoThermosol-FRS is uniquely formulated to address the molecular-biological response of cells during the hypothermic preservation process.HypoThermosol-FRS includes key ions at concentrations that balance the intracellular state at hypothermic temperatures. Additional components include pH buffers, energy substrates, free radical scavengers, and osmotic/oncotic stabilizers.
        

        		Preparation Note
				
				

Usage and Preservation Protocol• Wipe down outside of container with 70% ethanol before opening.• Contents are sterile. If seal has been broken, do not use and contact BioLife Solutions.• HypoThermosol FRS is ready to use. Simply replace culture medium with chilled (<10°C) HypoThermosol FRS and maintain at 2-8°C.• At the end of the cold storage period, simply remove samples from the cold, decant the cold HypoThermosol FRS and replace with warm (20-37°C) culture medium of choice.HypoThermosol FRS is not designed as a cell culture medium and should not be used above 15°C or warmed to 37°C
