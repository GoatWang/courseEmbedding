ABOUT US
A Proud History
Premise Capital, LLC serves as investment advisor to the Premise Capital® Frontier Advantage™ Diversified Tactical ETF (symbol: TCTL). Premise Capital, established as an asset manager in 2012, has its roots in a customer-focused investment advisory firm established 70 years ago. Founded by Richard Reynolds in 1946, The Reynolds Group steadily grew a base of loyal clients that appreciated a service-oriented approach that put the investor first.

A Blend of Fresh Thinking
In 2009, The Reynolds Group and Jason Rolence joined together to collaborate with advisors on an investment solution that would take a fresh look at portfolio construction. Jason brought 15 years of experience in investment analysis, specifically in the development of proprietary quantitative trading systems, determining the effectiveness of investment algorithms, and advanced methods of portfolio construction and asset allocation. The team worked to develop an asset allocation process that represents an advancement of modern investment strategy.
The result is Frontier Based Tactical™, an investment strategy based on the blend of fresh thinking, the latest academic research, and more than 70 years of advisory experience.
Since 2012, Premise Capital has operated as independent registered investment advisor, managing money for institutions and financial advisors.  Premise is headquartered in Naperville, Illinois.











Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and additional information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses, which may be obtained by calling 866-TCTL-ETF (866-828-5383). Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The fund is new with limited operating history. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV), may trade at a discount or premium to NAV and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Investments in the fund include risks associated with small-and mid-cap securities, foreign and emerging market securities, fixed income and high yield securities, REIT securities, ETF investment risk, model risk and tracking error. Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about the risks of investing in the fund.
Premise Capital®, LLC is the adviser to the Premise Capital® Frontier Advantage™ Diversified Tactical ETF which is distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.
The Premise Capital® Frontier Advantage™ Diversified Tactical Index consists of an investible portfolio of ETFs ("Underlying ETFs") with exposure to major U.S.and non-U.S. asset classes. The weighting of each Underlying ETF is adjusted to (i) reduce exposure to individual asset classes determined to be in a downward trend (the "Trend Adjustment") and (ii) reduce overall exposure to equity asset classes from an aggressive posture of approximately 90% equities (10% fixed income and cash) toward a conservative posture of approximately 10% equities (90% fixed income and cash) as the aggregate size of equity asset classes determined to be in a downward trend grows (the "Risk Adjustment"). Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The efficient frontier is the set of optimal portfolios that offers the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.

Dynamic Balance
Frontier Based Tactical™ is a proprietary process developed by Premise Capital and is based on the unique combination of traditional strategic asset allocation with our dual tactical shift strategy. The result is a family of fully diversified portfolios carefully constructed with a goal of participating in upward trends, while limiting exposure to declining markets.

Proprietary Portfolio Strategy







We design a strategic allocation plan utilizing advanced concepts in portfolio theory.








Then we apply our algorithms with tactical shifts that over or underweight the exposure to each asset class, depending on current return expectations. This creates a new efficient frontier that reflects forward looking views for each asset class.








At the same time, we make a second level of tactical shifts along  that efficient frontier to adjust overall exposure to risk.

Combining the Best of Two Worlds
Our process creates a forward-looking, strategic, efficient frontier. We look to provide gains from upward trends, while limiting exposure to declining markets. The ability to combine both tactical management and Modern Portfolio Theory gives our Frontier Advantage™ Portfolios the best of both styles.

Our Frontier Based Tactical™ Strategy
We use our forward looking views on individual asset classes to create diversified portfolios that aim to provide an optimal balance of risk and return. 
Then we go a step further and adjust the position on the frontier to limit the portfolio's exposure to inadequately compensated risk. This is much more dynamic and nimble than "buy and hold" approaches and much more transparent and risk-controlled than core/satellite strategies.

Driven By Data
Our unique portfolio strategy uses the latest research in strategic portfolio creation and mathematical, rule-based tactical management. Our Frontier Advantage™ Portfolios are benchmarked to comprehensive, risk-tolerance-based indices, and invest in publicly traded, liquid vehicles, such as ETFs and mutual funds.

Additional Services
We also offer investment research and management services for investment firms and family offices seeking assistance in portfolio construction. These services can be tailored to each firm's unique objective, asset preferences and client needs. Our Frontier Advantage Portfolios are now available on exclusive 401(k) plans. Call us for a list of plans. Premise Capital can also be engaged as an ERISA § 3(38) investment manager removing a significant portion of the fiduciary responsibility from the plan sponsor related to the selection and monitoring of the investment options. Please contact our office to learn more.

Frequently Asked Questions
Below are the most commonly asked questions about the Premise Capital portfolios and investment strategies. If you have further questions, feel free to contact us directly at info@premisecapital.com.



What is the Premise Capital® investment strategy?
Our strategy is called Frontier Based Tactical™, a blend of traditional asset allocation with tactical management. We start with a diversified portfolio and use various quantitative techniques to over and underweight asset classes relative to each other. This is combined with risk on/risk off adjustments that attempt to move the portfolio within a predetermined range when risk is not being compensated in the markets. These dual screen tactical shifts control exposure to each class, and also control the overall risk being taken by the investor.


How is Premise Capital® different from traditional asset management firms?
Many traditional asset management and advisory firms often follow a buy-and-hold approach to investing and adjust the asset allocation infrequently, often based on time rather than need. They also tend to avoid deviating too far from long-term estimates based on current market conditions. This passive approach rides the market wave up and down and can lead to investment decisions driven by emotion, not data or math.
Our difference is that we use proprietary mathematical algorithms and asset allocation models that attempt to ride upward market trends in a relatively passive manner when it makes sense to do so. We use active tactical strategies when our models indicate that conditions are not favorable for taking risk. This approach blends the best attributes of both investment approaches.


How is Premise Capital® different from purely tactical strategies?
Most tactical strategies are not focused on maintaining a diversified asset allocation and as a result, invest in a way that pulls your asset allocation off the efficient frontier. Managers make "calls" that concentrate the portfolio into a small number of asset classes and can significantly increase the amount of risk to the investor. If a manager moves a portfolio into one or two classes, the manager may make the right call and not lose during a specific period, but this is not a good way to assess the true risk of the strategy. You and your advisor need to look at the risks of the potential portfolio that you could own, based on the decision making process of the manager. Current tactical style is very reliant on the next call being correct. That type of management is fine as a trading strategy, but should not be used as an overlay when constructing a portfolio.


Why does Premise Capital® use ETFs and mutual funds rather than individual stocks or bonds?
Our choice of ETFs and funds is based on our belief that it is more important to manage the exposure to the class than choose an active manager within the class. We are trying to get exposure to each class as efficiently as possible, and add value by adjusting the amount that is allocated to that class. ETF's are a great tool for that purpose, but not all classes are represented well with that vehicle, so there are times when mutual funds still provide the best option.


What prompted the founding of Premise Capital®?
Premise Capital was founded by its Senior Portfolio Manager Jason Rolence and a team of financial advisors frustrated by a marketplace which forced them to use buy and hold asset managers, unconstrained tactical managers or a disjointed combination of the two through the core/satellite industry model. With more than 70 years of combined experience, the founders strongly believed that there should be an option for investors and their advisors to package the best elements of each approach into a single, seamlessly managed portfolio.


How often does Premise Capital® make trades?
We make trades on an as-needed basis whenever our proprietary algorithms and asset allocation models identify trend changes. This approach means a trade could happen any day, but by no means do we trade every day. Historically, we have made far fewer trades than many other tactical asset management firms because we differentiate trends on the basis of their importance to investors, not traders. Investors who have used other tactical managers may even find us boring.


Are the Premise Capital® Frontier Advantage™ Portfolios daily liquid?
Yes, because we only use publicly traded vehicles, our portfolios are very liquid. Obviously it takes some time to make trades so it may be a day or two before an account is completely divested. The time period is usually dependent on the platform or method you are using to access our models.  We do encourage you to have a longer time horizon to invest in our portfolios, as benefits are seen over full market cycles.


Can an investor lose money in Premise Capital® Frontier Advantage™ Portfolios?
Yes, as with any investment, you can lose money. When we talk about downside protection, it is the attempt to create a structure that doesn't just remain static in down trends.


Can I open a personal account directly with Premise Capital®?
Unfortunately, no. We work through your financial advisor, who can determine the appropriate risk tolerance and portfolio for you as well as discuss fees and expenses. If you don't have an advisor, we have a network of advisors that can assist you with opening an account. If your advisor doesn't have access to Premise Capital, have them contact us.


Are the Premise Capital® Frontier Advantage™ Portfolios transparent and easy to track?
While portfolio trades and holdings aren't disseminated directly, if you are an investor, your advisor will have access to the holdings every day, and in most cases, will be aware of transactions as they occur. Our core portfolios use publicly traded ETFs and mutual funds that can be tracked on every major financial website using their ticker symbols.


Does Premise Capital® use any leverage in its Frontier Advantage Portfolios?
No, our core portfolios do not use any type of leverage. The ETF choices are made for class exposure, not for placing market bets. We do not use leveraged or short ETFs in our core portfolios.


Can I invest IRA or other types of qualified accounts as well as after-tax dollars?
Yes, both types of accounts are excellent options for our funds and we have specific portfolios designed for the tax attributes of each.
