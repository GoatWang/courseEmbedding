* The Misc. Expenses category includes, among other things, discretionary
  bonuses, and salaries for additional employees.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. This expected use of net
proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current
plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures
may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the status of
and results from operations. As a result, our management will retain broad
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We may
find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for
other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of net
proceeds from this offering. In order to implement our plan of operations for
the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $687,500 of funding from
this offering. We anticipate that after the initial twelve month period we many
need additional funding.

In the event we are not successful in selling all of the securities we would
utilize any available funds raised in the following order of priority:

- for general administrative expenses, including legal and accounting fees and
  administrative support expenses incurred in connection with our reporting
  obligations with the SEC;   

- for office lease expenses and office equipment;

- for sales and marketing; and

- for salaries for our Chief Executive Officer and the hiring of additional
  full-time employees.  

During the period from March 12, 2015 (inception) to December 31, 2015, Robert
Smith has advanced the Company a total of $8,624 to cover costs related to the
organization and development of the company. The advances are considered
temporary in nature and was formalized by a promissory note. There is no formal
written commitment for continued support by Mr. Smith.

The loan of $8,624. advanced to the Company by Mr. Smith is unsecured,
non-interest bearing, and will become due and payable upon demand from the
lender. Proceeds raised in this offering will be used to repay some or all of
this related party advance. As of December 31, 2016 the company has paid-off the
promissory note in full with the remaining balance $0.00.


There are numerous existing, widely commercially available methods to provide
power to rechargeable low-power fixed and mobile devices, including wall plug-in
recharging, inductive recharging, power-mat recharging, battery recharging 
stations and more. To our knowledge, almost all mobile consumer electronic 
devices equipped with a rechargeable battery come bundled with a method to 
recharge the device (for example, a power cord).

We believe that the main advantage of our AI AirCharge technology as compared to
traditional charging technologies will be the ability to charge multiple devices
anywhere within the charging area (expected to be up-to 30 feet) without the use
of a charging pad. We believe our technology is unique and flexible allowing us
to concisely target a fixed or mobile device, track that device if it moves or
is moving, and focus and transmit a stream of energy to the targeted device to
charge the device without having to remove the battery or plug in the device.

We are not currently aware of any company or researcher looking to develop an AI
AirCharge technology that utilizes innovative AI algorithms and deep learning
software to focus their directional antennas to target and deliver energy over
distance.

There is a variety of other wireless charging technologies on the market or 
under development today. These competitive technologies fall into the following
categories:

Magnetic Induction. Magnetic induction uses a magnetic coil to create resonance,
which can transmit energy over very short distances. Power is delivered as a
function of coil size (the larger the coil, the more power), and coils must be
directly paired (one receiver coil to one transmitter coil = directly coupled
pair) within a typical distance of less than one inch. Products utilizing
magnetic induction have been available for 10+ years in products such as
rechargeable electronic toothbrushes.

Magnetic Resonance. Magnetic resonance is similar to magnetic induction, as it
uses magnetic coils to transmit energy. This technology uses coils that range in
size depending on the power levels being transmitted. It has the ability to
transmit power at distances up to ~11 inches (30cm) which can be increased with
the use of resonance repeaters.

Conductive. Conductive charging uses conductive power transfer to eliminate
wires between the charger (often a charging mat) and the charging device. It
requires the use of a charging board as the power transmitter to deliver the
power, and a charging device, with a built-in receiver, to receive the power.
This technology requires direct metal contact between the charging board and the
receiver. Once the charging board recognizes the receiver, the charging begins.

AI AirCharge. This is at the core of our lifeline technology. AI AirCharge
utilizes innovative AI algorithms and deep learning software to focus our
directional antennas to target and deliver energy over distance. To our
knowledge, there is no other company attempting to utilize a directional AI
AirCharge similar to that being developed by us.

Laser. Laser charging technology uses very short wavelengths of light to create
a collimated beam that maintains its size over distance, using what is described
as distributed resonance to deliver power to an optical receiver.

Ultrasound. Ultrasound charging technology converts electric energy into 
acoustic energy in the form of ultrasound waves. It then reconverts those waves
through an “energy-harvesting” receiver.


Company Description
Voice Life is a development stage technology company that’s developing 
technology that can enable wire-free charging of electronic devices at a 
distance with complete mobility through innovative AI algorithms and deep 
learning software applications. We intend to license our technology to


 various
consumer electronics companies, including automobile manufacturers, component
manufacturers, OEMs, ODMs and branded consumer electronics firms. We believe
strategic relationships with key automobile manufacturers and consumer
electronics supply chain licensees will enable us to reap the benefits of our
technology much faster than by manufacturing, distributing or installing
products ourselves. 
---

The Company is currently focusing on the further development of its reference
design products including its: voice user interface algorithm; wireless power 
distribution system composed of two interconnected products; portable 
transmitter; and an accessory receiver case which receives power from the 
transmitter, creating wireless charging capabilities.

The Company will seek to showcase the products currently under development,
including its new wirelessly powered light bulbs, and music speakers in a
residential home called the “Smart Home of the Future Today.” The Showcase will
serve as a “Voice Controlled” Smart Home template for applying these wireless
charging technologies and reference design products to any home. Our company is
in the process of pursuing manufacturing and licensing arrangements for the 
products we are developing. The Company is also currently seeking to collaborate
with major residential homebuilders in Southern California to incorporate these
products in new residential buildings. The Company also plans to seek to expand
the products to consumer sites such as cafes, restaurants, and airports.
---

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 12, 2015.
Our principal office is located at 7071 Warner Avenue, Suite 406, Huntington
Beach, CA 92647. Our telephone number is (888) 502-2338.

	Voice Life, Inc.



	 



	Up to 5,000,000 Common Shares at $0.55 per
	Share



	 


	Voice Life, Inc., a Nevada
	corporation (“we”, “us”, or the “Company”) is offering for sale a maximum of 5,000,000 shares
	of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at the price of $0.55 per share.  There is no minimum number of shares that
	must be sold by us for the offering to close, and therefore we may receive no proceeds or very minimal proceeds from the offering.
	 The aggregate offering price of all securities sold under this prospectus may not exceed $2,750,000. The offering will commence
	on the effective date of this prospectus and will terminate as of the earlier date of the sale of the maximum shares offered hereunder
	or the passing of 365 days.


	We will sell the common
	shares ourselves and do not plan to use underwriters or pay any commissions. We will be selling our common shares using our best
	efforts and no one has agreed to buy any of our common shares. There is no minimum amount of common shares we must sell so no money
	raised from the sale of such common shares will go into escrow, trust or another similar arrangement. We will bear the all of the
	costs associated with this offering.


	There is our initial public offering. Our common
	stock is not listed for trading on any exchange or automated quotation system. We intend, upon the

	effectiveness
	of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, to engage a market maker to apply for quotation on the OTC Electronic
	Bulletin Board. There can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the Financial Industry
	Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which operates the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board; nor can there be any assurance that such an application
	for quotation will be approved.




	 




	We were
	incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 12, 2015. We are a developmental stage company, with limited operational history.
	We are actively engaged in the development of our wireless “smart home” technology. Readers are encouraged to reference
	the section entitled “Business Operations” found on page 30 herein for additional information regarding our business.




	 



	Our auditors have indicated in their opinion
	on our financial statements as of and for the period from inception to December 31, 2015 that there exists substantial doubt as
	to our ability to continue as a going concern. Moreover, we are an early stage venture with limited operating history.

	As such,
	this offering is highly speculative and the common stock being offered for sale involves a high degree of risk and should be considered
	only be persons who can afford the loss of their entire investment. Readers are encouraged to reference the section entitled “Risk
	Factors” found on page 11 herein for additional information regarding the risks associated with our company and common stock

	.



	 



	Please note that the Company is a “shell”
	company in accordance with Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. Accordingly, any securities sold in this offering
	can only be resold through registration under the Securities Act of 1933; Section 4(1), if available, for non-affiliates; or by
	meeting the following conditions of Rule 144(i): (a) the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased
	to be a shell company; (b) the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(D) of the
	Exchange Act of 1934; and the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed during
	the

	and at least one year has lapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the Commission reflecting
	its status as an entity that is not a shell company.

	A CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
	STATEMENTS



	This prospectus contains forward-looking statements
	which relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by
	terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”,
	“believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the
	negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements
	about our market opportunity, our strategies, competition, expected activities and expenditures as we pursue our business plan,
	and the adequacy of our available cash resources.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking
	statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.  Actual results
	may differ materially from the predictions discussed in these forward-looking statements.  The economic environment within
	which we operate could materially affect our actual results.  Additional factors that could materially affect these forward-looking
	statements and/or predictions include, among other things: the volatility of real estate prices, the possibility that our marketing
	efforts will not be successful in identifying customers in need of our products and services, the Company’s need for and
	ability to obtain additional financing, and, other factors over which we have little or no control.


	 


	While these forward-looking statements, and
	any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our
	business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions
	or other future performance suggested herein. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United
	States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.



	 





	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY INFORMATION



	 


	As used in this prospectus, references to the
	“Company,” “we,” “our”, “us” or “Company Name” refer to Company Name,
	Inc. unless the context otherwise indicated.


	 


	You should carefully read all information in
	the prospectus, including the financial statements and their explanatory notes, under the Financial Statements prior to making
	an investment decision.


	 





	The Company



	 


	 





	Organization:




	We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 12, 2015. Our principal office is located at 7071 Warner Avenue, Suite 406, Huntington Beach, CA 92647. Our telephone number is (888) 502-2338





	 





	Capitalization:




	Our articles of incorporation provide for the issuance of up to 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001. As of the date of this Prospectus there are 25,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.





	 





	Preferred Stock:




	Our amended articles of incorporation provide for the issuance of up to 10,00,000 shares of preferred stock. Such preferred stock, if issued, may be convertible into shares of our common stock and therefore be dilutive to our existing shareholders. The preferred stock currently issued, outstanding, and designated have no voting rights. Each preferred share is convertible into one (1) share of common stock immediately after the Registration Statement filed on Form S-1 is effective.  Accordingly, once converted, each share will vote

	pari passu

	with the other common stock shareholders.





	 





	Management:




	Our Chief Executive Officer,
	Chairman and Secretary is Robert Smith. Mr. Smith represents our lone employee. Mr. Smith devotes his full time to the operations
	of the business. We are in the process of recruiting a seasoned management team with public company and relevant industry
	experience to develop and execute the operating plan. In addition, we have identified and will be adding additional engineering
	resources, which we expect ultimately will build up the engineering capability of our internal team upon effectiveness. Finally,
	we have started the selection process for the independent members of our board of directors, which we intend to rely upon
	for valuable assistance in terms of industry credibility, corporate governance, and strategic direction.






	 







	7










	 






	 







	Controlling Shareholders:




	Our Chief Executive Officer,
	Chairman and Secretary, Robert Smith, is our majority shareholder. Mr. Smith owns 25,000,000 shares of our common stock, for
	which he paid $2500. As such, Mr. Smith is able to exert significant influence over the affairs of the Company at the present
	time.





	 





	Shell Company Status:




	We are a 

	“shell company”

	 within the meaning of Rule 405, promulgated pursuant to Securities Act, because we have nominal assets and nominal operations.  Accordingly, the securities sold in this offering can only be resold through registration under Section 5 the Securities Act of 1933, Section 4(1), if available, for non-affiliates or by meeting the conditions of Rule 144(i).  A holder of our securities may not rely on the safe harbor from being deemed statutory underwriter under Section 2(11) of the Securities Act, as provided by Rule 144, to resell his or her securities. Only after we (i) are not a shell company, and (ii) have filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that we may be required to file such reports and materials, other than Form 8-K reports); and have filed current 

	“Form 10 information”

	 with the SEC reflecting our status as an entity that is no longer a shell company for a period of not less than 12 months, can our securities be resold pursuant to Rule 144.  

	“Form 10 information”

	 is, generally speaking, the same type of information as we are required to disclose in this prospectus, but without an offering of securities.  These circumstances regarding how Rule 144 applies to shell companies may hinder your resale of your shares of the Company.





	 


	 





	Going Concern:




	Our independent auditor has expressed
	substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern given our lack of operating history and the fact to date
	have had no significant revenues. Potential investors should be aware that there are difficulties associated with being a new
	venture, and the high rate of failure associated with this fact. We have an accumulated deficit of $105,550 and have had no
	significant revenues as of December 31, 2016. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and upon future
	profitable operations from our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going
	concern.






	Independence:




	The Company has no present plans to be acquired or to merge with another company nor does the Company, or any of its shareholders, have any plans to enter into a change of control or similar transaction.






	 






	Our Business





	 






	Description of Operations:




	Voice Life is a development stage
	technology company that’s developing technology that can enable wire-free charging of electronic devices at a distance
	with complete mobility through innovative AI algorithms and deep learning software applications. We intend to license
	our technology to various consumer electronics companies, including automobile manufacturers, component manufacturers,
	OEMs, ODMs and branded consumer electronics firms. We believe strategic relationships with key automobile manufacturers
	and consumer electronics supply chain licensees will enable us to reap the benefits of our technology much faster than
	by manufacturing, distributing or installing products ourselves.


	 






	Historical Operations:	




	Since inception through December 31,
	2016, the Company has generated an accumulated deficient in the amount of $105,550. We have not generated any revenues
	to date.


	 











	8










	 






	 







	Current Operations:	




	The Company is currently focusing on the further
	development of its reference design products including its: voice user interface algorithm; wireless power distribution system
	composed of two interconnected products; portable transmitter; and an accessory receiver case which receives power from the transmitter,
	creating wireless charging capabilities.


	 






	Growth Strategy:




	The Company will seek to showcase the products currently under development, including its new wirelessly powered light bulbs, and music speakers in a residential home called the “Smart Home of the Future Today.” The Showcase will serve as a “Voice Controlled” Smart Home template for applying these wireless charging technologies and reference design products to any home. Our company is in the process of pursuing manufacturing and licensing arrangements for the products we are developing. The Company is also currently seeking to collaborate with major residential homebuilders in Southern California to incorporate these products in new residential buildings. The Company also plans to seek to expand the products to consumer sites such as cafes, restaurants, and airports.

	Implications
	of being an Emerging Growth Company




	 



	We are an
	emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:





	 


		1.	The last day of the fiscal year
	of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every
	5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of
	Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;


	 


		2.	The last day of the fiscal year
	of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant
	to an effective IPO registration statement;


	 


		3.	The date on which such issuer
	has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or


	 


		4.	The date on which such issuer
	is deemed to be a ‘large accelerated filer’, as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations,
	or any successor thereto.


	 


	As an emerging growth company we are exempt
	from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning
	the scope and adequacy of the internal control







	10










	 






	structure
	and procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures.
	Section 404(b) requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment and
	the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.


	 


	As an emerging growth company we are also
	exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive
	compensation and golden parachutes. These exemptions are also available to us as a Smaller Reporting Company.


	 


	We have elected to use the extended transition
	period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay
	the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until
	those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies
	that comply with public company effective dates.

	RISK FACTORS



	 


	In addition to the other information provided
	in this prospectus, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business before purchasing any of
	our common stock.  All material risks are discussed in this section.


	 




	Risks Related to Our Company





	 





	Our having generated no revenues from
	operations makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our
	future performance.




	 


	As of December 31, 2016, we have generated
	no revenues and incurred a generated an accumulated deficit of $105,550. As a consequence, it is difficult, if not impossible,
	to forecast our future results based upon our historical data.  Because of the related uncertainties, we may be hindered
	in our ability to anticipate and timely adapt to increases or decreases in revenues and expenses.  If we make poor budgetary
	decisions as a result of unreliable data, we may never become profitable or incur losses, which may result in a decline in our
	stock price. 


	 




	We may be unable to continue paying
	the costs of being a reporting public company.





	 




	The
	costs of being a public reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may be substantial and the Company


	may not be able to absorb the costs of being a public company which may cause us to cease being public
	in the future or require additional fundraising in order to remain in business. We estimate that in the future, costs for legal
	and accounting at $35,000 per year


	.




	 





	Our auditor has indicated in its
	report that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our lack of revenues and
	if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations.




	 


	Our auditor has indicated in its report
	that our lack of revenues raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements
	do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to generate significant revenue
	or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations.



	 





	Our Certificate of Incorporation
	and Bylaws limit the liability of, and provide indemnification for, our officers and directors.




	 


	Our Certificate
	of Incorporation, generally limits our officers’ and directors’ personal liability to the Company and its stockholders
	for breach of fiduciary duty as an officer or director except for breach of the duty of loyalty or acts or omissions not made in
	good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law. Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws,
	provide indemnification for our officers and directors to the fullest extent authorized by the Nevada Corporations Code against
	all expense, liability, and loss, including attorney's fees, judgments, fines excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid
	in settlement reasonably incurred or suffered by an officer or director in connection with any action, suit or proceeding, whether
	civil or criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "

	Proceeding

	") to which the officer or director
	is made a party or is threatened to be made a party, or in which the officer or director is involved by reason of the fact that
	he is or was an officer or director of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company whether the basis of the
	Proceeding is an alleged action in an official capacity as an officer or director, or in any other capacity while serving as an
	officer or director. Thus, the Company may be prevented from recovering damages for certain alleged errors or omissions by the
	officers and directors for liabilities incurred in connection with their good faith acts for the Company.  Such an indemnification
	payment might deplete the Company's assets. Stockholders who have questions regarding the fiduciary obligations of the officers
	and directors of the Company should consult with independent legal counsel. It is the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission
	that exculpation from and indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
	regulations thereunder is against public policy and therefore unenforceable.

	We are dependent
	on the sale of our securities to fund our operations

	.



	 


	We are dependent
	on the sale of our securities to fund our operations, and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for our operating
	costs.  Our officers and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the
	form of cash advances, loans and/or financial guarantees. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully sell our
	equity or debt securities.


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 




	The Company may not be able to attain
	profitability without additional funding, which may be unavailable.





	 



	The Company has limited capital resources and
	has not generated any revenue since inception. Unless the Company begins to generate sufficient revenues to finance operations
	as a going concern, the Company may experience liquidity and solvency problems. Such liquidity and solvency problems may force
	the Company to cease operations if additional financing is not available. No known alternative resources of funds are available
	in the event we do not generate sufficient funds from operations.


	 




	There is no minimum dollar amount that the Company must raise
	in this offering, thus investors purchasing our securities might own stock of a company that has insufficient funding to conduct
	planned operations.




	 


	In order to implement the Company’s plan
	of operations for the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $687,500 of funding from this offering. We anticipate that
	after the initial twelve month period we may need additional financing. If the Company is unable to successfully find customers
	we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. If we need additional cash and
	cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely.


	 




	Expenses required
	to operate as a public company will reduce funds available to develop our business and could negatively affect our stock price
	and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.




	 


	Operating as a public
	company is more expensive than operating as a private company, including additional funds required to obtain outside assistance
	from legal, accounting, investor relations, or other professionals that could be more costly than planned.  We may also be
	required to hire additional staff to comply with additional SEC reporting requirements.  We anticipate that the cost of SEC
	reporting will be approximately $30,000 annually.  Our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other provisions
	of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial
	condition.  If we fail to meet these requirements, we will be unable to secure a qualification for quotation of our securities
	on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, or, if we have secured a qualification, we may lose the qualification and our securities
	would no longer trade on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board.  Further, if we fail to meet these obligations and consequently
	fail to satisfy our SEC reporting obligations, investors will then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure
	available in quarterly, annual reports and other required SEC reports that would be otherwise publicly available leading to increased
	difficulty in selling their stock due to our becoming a non-reporting issuer.


	 




	Our lack of history makes evaluating
	our business difficult.




	 


	We have a limited operating history and
	we may not sustain profitability in the future.


	 


	To sustain profitability, we must:


	 




	 



	-




	develop our technologies to make them commercially viable;





	 




	 



	-




	compete with larger, more established competitors who offer similar, more advanced technologies and are more capitalized than the Company





	 







	14










	 






	 




	 



	-




	maintain and enhance our brand recognition; and





	 




	 



	-




	adapt to meet changes in our markets and competitive developments.





	 


	We may not be
	successful in accomplishing these objectives. Further, our lack of operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business
	and prospects. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered
	by companies in their early stages of development, particularly companies in highly competitive industries. The historical information
	in this report may not be indicative of our future financial condition and future performance.


	 




	Risks Related to Our Business





	 





	Because we have a limited history of operations we may not
	be able to successfully implement our business plan.




	 


	We have less than one year of operational history
	in our industry. Accordingly, our operations are subject to the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise,
	including access to capital, successful implementation of our business plan and limited revenue from operations. We cannot assure
	you that our intended activities or plan of operation will be successful or result in revenue or profit to us and any failure to
	implement our business plan may have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company.




	If we fail to effectively
	manage our growth, our business, brand and reputation, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.




	We may experience a rapid
	growth in operations, which may place significant demands on our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure.
	As we continue to grow, we must effectively identify, integrate, develop and motivate new employees, and maintain the beneficial
	aspects of our corporate culture. To attract top talent, we believe we will have to offer attractive compensation packages. The
	risks of over-hiring or over compensating and the challenges of integrating a rapidly growing employee base may impact profitability.


	Additionally, if we do
	not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our services could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, brand and
	reputation, results of operations and financial condition. If operational, technology and infrastructure improvements are not implemented
	successfully, our ability to manage our growth will be impaired and we may have to make significant additional expenditures to
	address these issues. To effectively manage our growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management
	controls and our reporting systems and procedures. This will require that we refine our information technology systems to maintain
	effective online services and enhance information and communication systems to ensure that our employees effectively communicate
	with each other and our growing base of customers. These system enhancements and improvements will require significant incremental
	and ongoing capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to implement these improvements
	and maintenance programs effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with the rules and regulations that
	are applicable to publicly reporting companies will be impaired and we may incur additional expenses.




	We depend heavily on key personnel,
	and turnover of key senior management could harm our business.




	Our future business and results
	of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Robert Smith.
	If we lose his services or if he fails to perform in his current position, or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled
	employees as needed, our business could suffer. Significant turnover in our senior management could significantly deplete our institutional
	knowledge held by our existing senior management team. We depend on the skills and abilities of these key employees in managing
	the product acquisition, marketing and sales aspects of our business, any part of which could be harmed by turnover in the future.







	15










	 








	Our management has limited
	experience in managing the day to day operations of a public company and, as a result, we may incur additional expenses associated
	with the management of our company.




	Our Chief Executive Officer and
	Chairman Robert Smith is responsible for the operations and reporting of our company. The requirements of operating as a small
	public company are new to our management. This may require us to obtain outside assistance from legal, accounting, investor relations,
	or other professionals that could be more costly than planned. We may also be required to hire additional staff to comply with
	additional SEC reporting requirements. We anticipate that the costs associated with SEC requirements associated with going and
	staying public are estimated to be approximately $35,000 in connection with this registration statement and thereafter $30,000
	annually. If we lack cash resources to cover these costs in the future, our failure to comply with reporting requirements and other
	provisions of securities laws could negatively affect our stock price and adversely affect our potential results of operations,
	cash flow and financial condition after we commence operations.




	Our future results and reputation
	may be affected by litigation or other liability claims.




	 


	We have not procured a general liability
	insurance policy for our business. To the extent that we suffer a loss of a type which would normally be covered by general liability,
	we would incur significant expenses in defending any action against us and in paying any claims that result from a settlement or
	judgment against us. Adverse publicity could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our business or our securities.


	 




	We expect to Need FCC approval for our
	technology, which may be difficult to achieve, and existing laws or regulations or future legislative or regulatory changes may
	affect our business.






	 




	Our remote charging technology involves the
	transmission of power using a combination Light Frequencies and radio frequency (“RF”) energy waves, which are subject
	to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), and may be subject to regulation by other federal,
	state, and local agencies. We intend to design our technology so that it will operate in the 2.4/5.8 GHz radio frequency ranges,
	which are the same range as Wi-Fi routers and several other wireless consumer electronics. We will be transmitting power using
	RF energy waves at ranges that we believe have never been used for consumer products before. Therefore, we believe that we may
	require an FCC Part 18 approval, and there is no guarantee it will be granted.

	Our

	It






	is




	difficult
	and




	costly




	to




	protect


	our

	and




	we




	may

	able




	to


	ensure


	its


	protection.





	 


	Our



	success




	depends


	significantly




	on


	our




	ability


	to




	obtain,


	maintain




	and
	protect the




	rights




	to




	the


	technologies




	used


	in




	our


	products.




	Patents


	provide




	uncertain


	protections,




	and


	we



	may



	be




	unable


	to




	protect


	our


	intellectual

	For

	we

	may



	be




	unsuccessful


	in




	defending




	any


	patents


	we obtain


	against


	third party




	challenges.



	 



	In


	addition




	to


	patents,




	we


	expect




	to

	rely



	on



	a



	combination




	of




	trade

	secrets,



	copyright




	and




	trademark

	laws,



	nondisclosure

	security


	measures




	to
	protect




	our




	intellectual




	property


	rights.




	These


	measures

	may



	not


	be




	adequate


	to




	safeguard


	the




	technology


	underlying




	our


	products.


	If our rights are not properly
	protected


	,




	third
	parties


	could




	use


	our



	technology,



	and




	our
	ability




	to




	compete




	in


	the




	market


	would




	be


	reduced.






	Because


	our




	industry
	is




	characterized




	by




	competing
	intellectual




	property,




	we



	may



	be




	sued

	for



	violating




	the




	intellectual


	property




	rights


	of




	others


	.


	As

	number




	of




	patents


	issued




	in


	this



	area

	the




	possibility




	of
	patent




	infringement




	claims




	against


	us




	increases.

	Some



	of


	our


	competitors



	may

	be




	able


	to


	sustain


	the


	costs




	of


	complex


	patent




	litigation

	more



	effectively


	than


	we


	can


	because




	they
	have


	substantially




	greater


	resources.




	In


	addition,




	any


	uncertainties




	resulting

	from

	the


	initiation




	and




	continuation

	Our

	exposes




	us




	to




	potential

	risks




	that




	are




	inherent

	We



	may

	(some




	of

	Expanding our service offerings or
	number of offices may not be profitable.




	 


	We may choose to develop products and services
	to offer. Developing new offerings involves inherent risks, including:


	 




	 



	-




	our inability to estimate demand for the new offerings;





	 




	 



	-




	competition from more established market participants;





	 




	 



	-




	a lack of market understanding.





	 







	18










	 






	In addition, expanding into new geographic
	areas and/or expanding current service offerings is challenging and may require integrating new employees into our culture as well
	as assessing the demand in the applicable market.


	 




	If our estimates related to expenditures
	and cash flow from operations are erroneous, and we are unable to sell additional equity securities, our business could fall short
	of expectations and you may lose your entire investment.




	 


	Our financial success is dependent in
	part upon the accuracy of our management's estimates of expenditures and cash flow from operations. If such estimates are erroneous
	or inaccurate, we may not be able to carry out our business plan, which could, in a worst-case scenario, result in the failure
	of our business and you losing your entire investment.


	 




	We are subject to complex federal, state,
	local and other laws and regulations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
	operations.




	 


	Our business is subject to various, and sometimes
	complex, laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain
	and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may
	incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance
	may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to
	our operations. These costs could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
	Moreover, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect
	on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	 




	Any change to government regulation/administrative
	practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our profitability.




	 


	The laws, regulations, policies or current
	administrative practices of any government body, organization or regulatory agency in the United States or any other jurisdiction,
	may be changed, applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our company to carry on our business.


	 


	The actions, policies or regulations, or changes
	thereto, of any government body or regulatory agency, or other special interest groups, may have a detrimental effect on us. Any
	or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and/or our profitably.

	Risks Related to Our Common Stock





	 





	Due to the lack of a current public market for our stock,
	investors may have difficulty in selling stock they purchase




	 


	Prior to this Offering, no public trading market
	existed for the Company’s securities. There can be no assurance that a public trading market for the Company’s common
	stock will develop or that a public trading market, if develop, will be sustained. As a shell company, the Company’s common
	stock sold pursuant to this prospectus will be subject to restrictions on resale, and will not be eligible for quotation on the
	Over the Counter Bulletin Board. We intend, upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a
	part, to engage a market maker to apply for quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. There can be no assurance that a market
	maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which operates the OTC
	Electronic Bulletin Board; nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved. Thus, it is
	anticipated that there will be little or no market for the Shares until the Company is eligible to have its common stock quoted
	on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board and as a result, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any shares purchased hereunder.
	Because there is none and may be no public market for the Company’s stock, the Company may not be able to secure future equity
	financing which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.


	 


	Furthermore, when and if the Company’s
	common stock is eligible for quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, there can also be no assurance as to the depth or
	liquidity of any market for the common stock or the prices at which holders may be able to sell the shares.


	 


	As a result, investors could find it more difficult
	to trade, or to obtain accurate quotations of the market value of, the stock as compared to securities that are traded on the NASDAQ
	trading market or on an exchange. Moreover, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of any Shares purchased hereunder.


	 




	Investors may have
	difficulty in reselling their shares due to the lack of market or state Blue Sky laws.




	Our common stock is currently
	not quoted on any market. No market may ever develop for our common stock, or if developed, may not be sustained in the future.


	The holders of our shares of common
	stock and persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there
	may be significant state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares. Accordingly, even if we are successful
	in having the Shares available for trading on the OTCBB, investors should consider any secondary market for the Company's securities
	to be a limited one. We intend to seek coverage and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication
	which permits a "manual exemption." This manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state







	20










	 






	without being registered
	if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state. However, it
	is not enough for the security to be listed in a recognized manual. The listing entry must contain (1) the names of issuers, officers,
	and directors, (2) an issuer's balance sheet, and (3) a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance
	sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations.  We may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this
	information.  Furthermore, the manual exemption is a non issuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions,
	making it unavailable for issuers selling newly issued securities. Most of the accepted manuals are those published in Standard
	and Poor's, Moody's Investor Service, Fitch's Investment Service, and Best's Insurance Reports, and many states expressly recognize
	these manuals. A smaller number of states declare that they “recognize securities manuals” but do not specify the recognized
	manuals. The following states do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption: Alabama,
	Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin.


	Accordingly, our shares should
	be considered totally illiquid, which inhibits investors’ ability to resell their shares.




	We will be subject
	to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.




	The SEC has adopted regulations
	which generally define so-called “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per
	share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions.  We anticipate that our common
	stock will become a “penny stock”, and we will become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the “Penny
	Stock Rule”. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons
	other than established customers. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination
	for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule
	may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities
	in the secondary market.


	For any transaction involving a
	penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared
	by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the
	broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required
	to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in
	penny stock.


	We do not anticipate that our common
	stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock
	Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person
	from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.




	Sales of our common stock
	under Rule 144 could reduce the price of our stock.




	There are zero (0) shares of
	our common stock held by non-affiliates and 25,000,000 shares held by affiliates that Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 defines
	as restricted securities.


	5,000,000 newly issued shares are
	being registered in this offering, however all of the remaining shares will still be subject to the resale restrictions of Rule
	144.  In general, persons holding restricted securities, including affiliates, must hold their shares for a period of
	at least six months, may not sell more than one percent of the total issued and outstanding shares in any 90-day period, and must
	resell the shares in an unsolicited brokerage transaction at the market price.  The availability for sale of substantial
	amounts of common stock under Rule 144 could reduce prevailing market prices for our securities.




	Because we do not have an
	audit or compensation committee, shareholders will have to rely on the entire board of directors, none of which are independent,
	to perform these functions.




	We do not have an audit or compensation
	committee comprised of independent directors.  Indeed, we do not have any audit or compensation committee.  These
	functions are performed by the board of directors as a whole.  No







	21










	 






	members of the board
	of directors are independent directors.  Thus, there is a potential conflict in that board members who are also part
	of management will participate in discussions concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management decisions.




	Because we are a 

	“shell company”

	 the
	holders of our restricted securities will not be able to sell their securities in reliance on Rule 144 and we cannot file registration
	statements under Section 5 of the Securities Act using a Form S-8, until we cease being a 

	“shell company”





	 


	We are a 

	“shell company”

	 as
	that term is defined by the applicable federal securities laws.  Specifically, because of the nature and amount of our assets
	and our very limited operations, pursuant to applicable federal rules, we are considered a 

	“shell company”

	.
	 Applicable provisions of Rule 144 specify that during that time that we are a 

	“shell company”

	 and
	for a period of one year thereafter, holders of our restricted securities can not sell those securities in reliance on Rule 144.
	This restriction may have potential adverse effects on future efforts to form additional capital through unregistered offerings.
	Another implication of us being a shell company is that we cannot file registration statements under Section 5 of the Securities
	Act using a Form S-8, a short form of registration to register securities issued to employees and consultants under an employee
	benefit plan. As result, one year after we cease being a shell company, assuming we are current in our reporting requirements with
	the Securities and Exchange Commission and have filed current 

	“Form 10 information”

	 with the SEC reflecting
	our status as an entity that is no longer a shell company for a period of not less than 12 months, holders of our restricted securities
	may then sell those securities in reliance on Rule 144 (provided, however, those holders satisfy all of the applicable requirements
	of that rule). For us to cease being a 

	“shell company”

	 we must have more than nominal operations and
	more that nominal assets or assets which do not consist solely of cash or cash equivalents. 

	Shares
	purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares if and when applicable restrictions
	against resale expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering.



	 




	Our Chief Executive Officer
	and Director owns a significant percentage of our outstanding voting securities which could reduce the ability of minority shareholders
	to effect certain corporate actions


	.


	Our Chief Executive Officer and
	Chairman Robert Smith owns a majority outstanding voting securities. As a result, currently, and after the offering, he will possess
	a significant influence and can elect a majority of our board of directors and authorize or prevent proposed significant corporate
	transactions. Their ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding
	a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer.




	There may not be funds available
	for net income because our Chief Executive Officer and Director maintains significant control and can determine his own salary
	and perquisites.




	Our Chief Executive Officer and
	Chairman Robert Smith owns a majority outstanding voting securities. As a result, there may not be funds available for net income
	because he maintains significant control and can determine his own salary and perquisites.




	We may, in the future, issue additional
	shares of common stock, which would reduce investors’ percent of ownership and may dilute our share value.




	 


	Our Articles of Incorporation authorize
	the issuance of 75,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of various series preferred stock.  As of the
	date of this prospectus the Company had 25,000,000 shares of common stock and 164,990 Preferred Series Shares outstanding.
	Accordingly, we may issue up to an additional 50,000,000 shares of common stock and 9,835,010 Preferred Series Shares. The future
	issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders.
	We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock for future services or
	acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might
	have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.


	 




	We are subject to compliance with securities law, which exposes
	us to potential liabilities, including potential rescission rights.




	 







	22










	 






	We may offer to sell our common stock to investors
	pursuant to certain exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as those of various state
	securities laws. The basis for relying on such exemptions is factual; that is, the applicability of such exemptions depends upon
	our conduct and that of those persons contacting prospective investors and making the offering. We may not seek any legal opinion
	to the effect that any such offering would be exempt from registration under any federal or state law. Instead, we may elect to
	relay upon the operative facts as the basis for such exemption, including information provided by investor themselves.


	 


	If any such offering did not qualify for such
	exemption, an investor would have the right to rescind its purchase of the securities if it so desired. It is possible that if
	an investor should seek rescission, such investor would succeed. A similar situation prevails under state law in those states where
	the securities may be offered without registration in reliance on the partial preemption from the registration or qualification
	provisions of such state statutes under the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996. If investors were successful in
	seeking rescission, we would face severe financial demands that could adversely affect our business and operations. Additionally,
	if we did not in fact qualify for the exemptions upon which it has relied, we may become subject to significant fines and penalties
	imposed by the SEC and state securities agencies.



	 





	Anti-takeover effects of certain provisions
	of Nevada state law hinder a potential takeover of the Company.




	 


	Though not now, we may be or in the future
	we may become subject to Nevada’s control share law. A corporation is subject to Nevada’s control share law if it has
	more than 200 stockholders, at least 100 of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Nevada, and it does business in Nevada
	or through an affiliated corporation. The law focuses on the acquisition of a “controlling interest” which means the
	ownership of outstanding voting shares sufficient, but for the control share law, to enable the acquiring person to exercise the
	following proportions of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors: (i) one-fifth or more but less than
	one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more. The ability to exercise such voting power
	may be direct or indirect, as well as individual or in association with others.


	 


	The effect of the control share law is that
	the acquiring person, and those acting in association with it, obtains only such voting rights in the control shares as are conferred
	by a resolution of the stockholders of the corporation, approved at a special or annual meeting of stockholders. The control share
	law contemplates that voting rights will be considered only once by the other stockholders. Thus, there is no authority to strip
	voting rights from the control shares of an acquiring person once those rights have been approved. If the stockholders do not grant
	voting rights to the control shares acquired by an acquiring person, those shares do not become permanent non-voting shares. The
	acquiring person is free to sell its shares to others. If the buyers of those shares themselves do not acquire a controlling interest,
	their shares do not become governed by the control share law.


	If control shares are accorded full voting
	rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of the voting power, any stockholder of record,
	other than an acquiring person, who has not voted in favor of approval of voting rights is entitled to demand fair value for such
	stockholder’s shares.


	 


	Nevada’s control share law may have the
	effect of discouraging takeovers of the corporation.


	 


	In addition to the control share law, Nevada
	has a business combination law which prohibits certain business combinations between Nevada corporations and “interested
	stockholders” for three years after the “interested stockholder” first becomes an “interested stockholder,”
	unless the corporation’s board of directors approves the combination in advance. For purposes of Nevada law, an “interested
	stockholder” is any person who is (i) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting
	power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, or (ii) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time
	within the three previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of ten percent or more of the voting power of
	the then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term “business combination” is sufficiently broad
	to cover virtually any kind of transaction that would allow a potential acquiror to use the corporation’s assets to finance
	the acquisition or otherwise to benefit its own interests rather than the interests of the corporation and its other stockholders.


	 


	The effect of Nevada’s business combination
	law is to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of the Company from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval
	of our board of directors.

	There is no current established trading market for our securities
	and if a trading market does not develop, purchasers of our securities may have difficulty selling their shares.




	 


	There is currently no established public trading
	market for our securities and an active trading market in our securities may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained.  While
	we intend to seek a quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board, there can be no assurance that any such trading market will
	develop, and purchasers of the shares may have difficulty selling their common stock should they desire to do so. No market makers
	have committed to becoming market makers for our common stock and none may do so.


	 




	Because we do not intend to pay any cash
	dividends on our common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.




	 


	We intend to retain any future earnings to
	finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the
	foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they
	sell them. There is no assurance that stockholders will be able to sell shares when desired.



	 





	Opt-in right for emerging growth company




	 


	We have elected to use the extended transition
	period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay
	the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until
	those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies
	that comply with public company effective dates.


	 




	Implications of Being an Emerging Growth
	Company.




	 


	As a company with less than $1.0 billion in
	revenue during its last fiscal year, we qualify as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long
	as a company is deemed to be an emerging growth company, it may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory
	requirements that are generally unavailable to other public companies.  These provisions include:


	 




	 



	-




	A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management's Discussion and Analysis included in an initial public offering registration statement;





	 




	 



	-




	an exemption to provide less than five years of selected financial data in an initial public offering registration statement;





	 




	 



	-




	an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company's internal controls over financial reporting;





	 




	 



	-




	an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;





	 




	 



	-




	an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; an





	 




	 



	-




	reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company's executive compensation arrangements





	 


	 


	 


	An emerging growth company is also exempt from
	Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley which requires that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report
	on the assessment on the effectiveness of the







	24










	 






	internal control structure and
	procedures for financial reporting. Similarly, as a Smaller Reporting Company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act and our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal
	control over financial reporting until such time as we cease being a Smaller Reporting Company.


	 


	As an emerging growth company, we are exempt
	from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation
	and golden parachutes.


	 


	Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an
	emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act
	for complying with new or revised accounting standards.  In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption
	of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.  We have elected to take
	advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.  Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to
	those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.


	 


	We would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest
	of:


	 




	 



	-




	the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of this offering,





	 




	 



	-




	the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1 billion or more,





	 




	 



	-




	the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities, or





	 




	 



	-




	as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.





	 




	You may have limited access to information
	regarding our business because our obligations to file periodic reports with the SEC could be automatically suspended under certain
	circumstances.  




	 


	As of effectiveness of our registration statement
	of which this prospectus is a part, we will be required to file periodic reports with the SEC which will be immediately available
	to the public for inspection and copying (see “Where You Can Find More Information” elsewhere in this prospectus).
	 Except during the year that our registration statement becomes effective, these reporting obligations may (in our discretion)
	be automatically suspended under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act if we have less than 300 shareholders and do not file a registration
	statement on Form 8A (which we have no current plans to file).  If this occurs after the year in which our registration statement
	becomes effective, we will no longer be obligated to file periodic reports with the SEC and your access to our business information
	would then be even more restricted.  After this registration statement on Form S-1 becomes effective, we will be required
	to deliver periodic reports to security holders.  However, we will not be required to furnish proxy statements to security
	holders and our directors, officers and principal beneficial owners will not be required to report their beneficial ownership of
	securities to the SEC pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  Previously, a company with more than 500 shareholders of
	record and $10 million in assets had to register under the Exchange Act.  However, the JOBS Act raises the minimum shareholder
	threshold from 500 to either 2,000 persons or 500 persons who are not "accredited investors" (or 2,000 persons in the
	case of banks and bank holding companies).  The JOBS Act excludes securities received by employees pursuant to employee stock
	incentive plans for purposes of calculating the shareholder threshold.  This means that access to information regarding our
	business and operations will be limited.



	 





	The offering
	price of the common shares being registered has been arbitrarily determined by us and bears no relationship to any criteria of
	value; as such, investors should not consider the offering price or value to be an indication of the value of the shares being
	registered.




	 


	Currently, there is
	no public market for our common stock.  The offering price for the common shares being registered in this registration statement
	has been arbitrarily determined by us and is not based on assets, operations,







	25










	 






	book
	or other established criteria of value.  Thus, investors should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the market
	price or value of our common shares.


	 




	Upon effectiveness
	of this registration statement, we will be subject to the 15(d) reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
	which does not require a company to file all the same reports and information as fully reporting companies.





	 



	Upon effectiveness
	of this registration statement, we will be subject to the 15(d) reporting requirements according to the Securities Exchange Act
	of 1934. As a Section 15(d) filer, we will be required to file quarterly and annual reports during the fiscal year in which our
	registration statement is declared effective; however, such duty to file reports shall be suspended as to any fiscal year, other
	than the fiscal year within which such registration statement became effective, if, at the beginning of such fiscal year the securities
	of each class are held of record by less than 300 persons.  In addition, as a filer subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange
	Act, we are not required to prepare proxy or information statements; our common stock will not be subject to the protection of
	the going private regulations; we will be subject to only limited portions of the tender offer rules; our officers, directors,
	and more than ten (10%) percent shareholders are not required to file beneficial ownership reports about their holdings in our
	company; that these persons will not be subject to the short-swing profit recovery provisions of the Exchange Act; and
	that more than five percent (5%) holders of classes of our equity securities will not be required to report information about their
	ownership positions in the securities. As such, shareholders will not have access to certain material information which would otherwise
	be required if it was a fully reporting company pursuant to an Exchange Act registration


	 


	 




	If we are not
	required to continue filing reports under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the future, for example because
	we have less than three hundred shareholders of record at the end of the first fiscal year in which this registration statement
	is declared effective, and we do not file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A, our common shares (if listed or quoted) would no
	longer be eligible for quotation, which could reduce the value of your investment.




	 



	As
	a result of this offering as required under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we will file periodic reports
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission as required under Section 15(d).  However, if in the future we are not required
	to continue filing reports under Section 15(d), for example because we have less than three hundred shareholders of record at the
	end of the first fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective, and we do not file a Registration Statement
	on Form 8-A upon the occurrence of such an event, our common stock can no longer be quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board,
	which could reduce the value of your investment.  Of course, there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet the requirements
	to be able to cease filing reports under Section 15(d), in which case we will continue filing those reports in the years after
	the fiscal year in which this registration statement is declared effective.  Filing a registration statement on Form 8-A will
	require us to continue to file quarterly and annual reports with the SEC and will also subject us to the proxy rules of the SEC.
	 In addition, our officers, directors and 10% stockholders will be required to submit reports to the SEC on their stock ownership
	and stock trading activity.

	The above figures represent only estimated
	costs. This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business
	conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
	status of and results from operations. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net
	proceeds from this offering. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes,
	and we will have broad discretion in the application of net proceeds from this offering. In order to implement our plan of operations
	for the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $687,500 of funding from this offering. We anticipate that after the
	initial twelve month period we many need additional funding.


	 


	In the event we are
	not successful in selling all of the securities we would utilize any available funds raised in the following order of priority:


	 




	 



	-




	for general administrative expenses, including legal and accounting fees and administrative support expenses incurred in connection with our reporting obligations with the SEC;










	27










	 






	 




	 



	-




	for office lease expenses and office equipment;





	 




	 



	-




	for sales and marketing; and





	 




	 



	-




	for salaries for our Chief Executive Officer
	and the hiring of additional full-time employees.


	 


	 





	During the period
	from March 12, 2015 (inception) to December 31, 2015, Robert Smith has advanced the Company a total of $8,624 to cover costs related
	to the organization and development of the company. The advances are considered temporary in nature and was formalized by a promissory
	note. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by Mr. Smith.


	The loan of $8,624. advanced to the Company by Mr. Smith
	is unsecured, non-interest bearing, and will become due and payable upon demand from the lender. Proceeds raised in this
	offering will be used to repay some or all of this related party advance. As of December 31, 2016 the company has paid-off the
	promissory note in full with the remaining balance $0.00. 


	 



	DETERMINATION OF
	THE OFFERING PRICE




	 



	Our management has
	determined the offering price for the common shares being sold in this offering. The price of the shares we are offering was arbitrarily
	determined. The offering price bears no relationship whatsoever to our assets, earnings, book value or other criteria of value.
	The factors considered were:


	 




	 



	-




	Our status as a developmental stage, “startup” company;





	 




	 



	-




	Costs associated with the continued development of our technologies into a commercialized status;





	 




	 



	-




	Our forecasted future prospects; and





	 




	 



	-




	Our current capital structure.





	 


	Therefore, the public
	offering price of the shares does not necessarily bear any relationship to established valuation criteria and may not be indicative
	of prices that may prevail at any time or from time to time in the public market for the common stock. You cannot be sure that
	a public market for any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price at or higher
	than the offering price in this offering. Such offering price does not have any relationship to any established criteria of value,
	such as book value or earnings per share. Because we have no significant operating history, the price of our common stock is not
	based on past earnings, nor is the price of our common stock indicative of the current market value of the assets owned by us.
	No valuation or appraisal has been prepared for our business and potential business expansion. Our common stock is presently not
	traded on any market or securities exchange and we have not applied for listing or quotation on any public market. You cannot be
	sure that a public market for any of our securities will develop and continue or that the securities will ever trade at a price
	at or higher than the offering price in this offering.




	 






	DILUTION




	 



	If you purchase any of the shares offered
	by this prospectus, your ownership interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering
	price per share and the post-offering net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering. Dilution
	results from the fact that the initial public offering price per share is substantially in excess of the book value per share
	attributable to the existing stockholder for the presently outstanding stock. As of December 31, 2016, our net tangible book
	value was $19,440 or $0.00 per share of common stock. Net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible
	assets







	28










	 






	(excluding deferred
	offering costs) less total liabilities, divided by 25,000,000, the number of shares of common stock outstanding at December 31,
	2016.


	 


	The following table sets forth as of
	December 31, 2016, the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing
	stockholder and by new investors in this offering if new investors purchase 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the offering, after
	deduction of offering expenses, assuming a purchase price in this offering of $.55 per share of common stock.

	Assuming the Issuer sells the entire
	offering of 5,000,000 shares, after giving effect to the sale of common shares in this offering, and after deducting
	underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our post-offering net tangible book
	value as of December 31, 2016 would be $2,744,440, or $.09 per share. This amount represents an immediate increase in the
	post-offering net tangible book value of $.09 per share to our existing stockholder and an immediate dilution in the
	post-offering net tangible book value of approximately $.46 per share to new investors purchasing common shares in this
	offering. We determine dilution by subtracting the as adjusted net tangible book value per share after the offering from the
	amount of cash that a new investor paid for a share of common stock.

	SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS




	 



	There are no Selling Security Holders for this offering.




	 






	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION




	 



	This prospectus relates to the sale 5,000,000 million common shares.


	 


	We do not plan to use underwriters or pay any
	commissions. We will be selling our common shares using our best efforts and no one has agreed to buy any of our common shares.
	This prospectus permits our CEO to sell the common shares directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable
	to them for any common shares he may sell. There is no plan or arrangement to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the
	common shares with a broker or dealer. Our CEO will sell the common shares, and intends to offer them to friends, family members
	and business acquaintances. There is no minimum amount of common shares we must sell so no money raised from the sale of our common
	shares will go into escrow, trust or another similar arrangement.


	 


	The common shares are being offered by Mr.
	Robert Smith, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Director, will be relying on the safe harbor in Rule 3a4-1 of the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to sell the common shares. No sales commission will be paid for common shares sold by Mr. Smith.
	Mr. Smith is not subject to a statutory disqualification and is not associated persons of a broker or dealer.


	 


	Additionally, Mr. Smith primarily performs
	substantial duties on behalf of the registrant otherwise than in connection with transactions in securities. Mr. Smith has not
	been a broker or dealer or an associated person of a broker or dealer within the preceding 12 months and they have not participated
	in selling an offering of securities for any issuer more than once every 12 months other than in reliance on paragraph (a)4(i)
	or (a)4(iii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


	 


	The offering will commence on the effective
	date of this prospectus and will terminate on or before the earliest event of the sale of the maximum offering, the termination
	of the offering by Company management or the passage of one (1) year.


	 


	There are no finders.


	 


	 


	Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission, our common stock will come within the definition of a “penny stock” because the price of our common stock
	is below $5.00 per share. As a result, our common stock will be subject to the "penny stock" rules and regulations. Broker-dealers
	who sell penny stocks to certain types of investors are required to comply with the Commission’s regulations concerning the
	transfer of penny stock. These regulations require broker-dealers to:


	 


	- Make a suitability determination prior to
	selling penny stock to the purchaser;


	- Receive the purchaser’s written consent
	to the transaction; and


	- Provide certain written disclosures to the
	purchaser.


	 


	These requirements may restrict the ability
	of broker/dealers to sell our common stock, and may affect the ability to resell our common stock.


	 




	OTC Bulletin Board Considerations




	 


	To be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, a market
	maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for our common stock. We anticipate that after this registration
	statement is declared effective, market makers will enter “piggyback” quotes and our securities will thereafter trade
	on the OTC Bulletin Board.


	 


	The OTC Bulletin Board is separate and distinct
	from the NASDAQ stock market. NASDAQ has no business relationship with issuers of securities quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board.
	The SEC’s order handling rules, which apply to NASDAQ-listed securities, do not apply to securities quoted on the OTC Bulletin
	Board.







	30










	 






	 


	 


	 


	Although the NASDAQ stock market has rigorous
	listing standards to ensure the high quality of its issuers, and can delist issuers for not meeting those standards, the OTC Bulletin
	Board has no listing standards. Rather, it is the market maker who chooses to quote a security on the system, files the application,
	and is obligated to comply with keeping information about the issuer in its files. FINRA cannot deny an application by a market
	maker to quote the stock of a company. The only requirement for inclusion in the bulletin board is that the issuer be current in
	its reporting requirements with the SEC.


	 


	Although we anticipate listing on the OTC Bulletin
	board will increase liquidity for our stock, investors may have greater difficulty in getting orders filled because it is anticipated
	that if our stock trades on a public market, it initially will trade on the OTC Bulletin Board rather than on NASDAQ. Investors’
	orders may be filled at a price much different than expected when an order is placed. Trading activity in general is not conducted
	as efficiently and effectively as with NASDAQ-listed securities.


	 


	Investors must contact a broker-dealer to trade
	OTC Bulletin Board securities. Investors do not have direct access to the bulletin board service. For bulletin board securities,
	there only has to be one market maker.


	 


	Bulletin board transactions are conducted almost
	entirely manually. Because there are no automated systems for negotiating trades on the bulletin board, they are conducted via
	telephone. In times of heavy market volume, the limitations of this process may result in a significant increase in the time it
	takes to execute investor orders. Therefore, when investors place market orders - an order to buy or sell a specific number of
	shares at the current market price - it is possible for the price of a stock to go up or down significantly during the lapse of
	time between placing a market order and getting execution.


	 


	Because bulletin board stocks are usually not
	followed by analysts, there may be lower trading volume than for NASDAQ-listed securities.


	 


	There is no guarantee that our stock will ever
	be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board.


	 




	Blue Sky Law Considerations




	 


	The holders of our shares of common stock and
	persons who desire to purchase them in any trading market that might develop in the future should be aware that there may be significant
	state law restrictions upon the ability of investors to resell our shares. Accordingly, even if we are successful in having the
	Shares available for trading on the OTCBB, investors should consider any secondary market for the Company's securities to be a
	limited one. There is no guarantee that our stock will ever be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board.  We intend to seek coverage
	and publication of information regarding the company in an accepted publication, which permits a "manual exemption”.
	This manual exemption permits a security to be distributed in a particular state without being registered if the company issuing
	the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by the state. However, it is not enough for the
	security to be listed in a recognized manual. The listing entry must contain (1) the names of issuers, officers, and directors,
	(2) an issuer's balance sheet, and (3) a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for
	the most recent fiscal year of operations. We may not be able to secure a listing containing all of this information. Furthermore,
	the manual exemption is a non issuer exemption restricted to secondary trading transactions, making it unavailable for issuers
	selling newly issued securities. Most of the accepted manuals are those published in Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Service,
	Fitch's Investment Service, and Best's Insurance Reports, and many states expressly recognize these manuals. A smaller number of
	states declare that they “recognize securities manuals” but do not specify the recognized manuals. The following states
	do not have any provisions and therefore do not expressly recognize the manual exemption: Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky,
	Louisiana, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin.


	 


	We currently do not intend to and may not be
	able to qualify securities for resale in other states, which require shares to be qualified before they can be resold by our shareholders.

	DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES



	 


	The following description
	as a summary of the material terms of the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Articles of Incorporation
	and Bylaws have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.



	 





	Common Stock





	We are authorized to issue 75,000,000 shares of common stock with $0.0001 par value per share. As of the date of this registration
	statement, there were 25,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, all held by our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
	Robert Smith.


	 


	Each share of common stock entitles the holder
	to one vote, either in person or by proxy, at meetings of shareholders. The holders are not permitted to vote their shares cumulatively.
	Accordingly, the shareholders of our common stock who hold, in the aggregate, more than fifty percent of the total voting rights
	can elect all of our directors and, in such event, the holders of the remaining minority shares will not be able to elect any of
	such directors. The vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon
	is sufficient to authorize, affirm, ratify or consent to such act or action, except as otherwise provided by law.


	 


	Holders of common stock are entitled to receive
	ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available. We have not paid any
	dividends since our inception, and we presently anticipate that all earnings, if any, will be retained for development of our business.
	Any future disposition of







	32










	 






	dividends will be at the discretion
	of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, operating and financial condition, capital
	requirements, and other factors.


	 


	Holders of our common stock have no preemptive
	rights or other subscription rights, conversion rights, redemption or sinking fund provisions. Upon our liquidation, dissolution
	or windup, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution
	to shareholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities. There are not any provisions in our Articles of Incorporation
	or our Bylaws that would prevent or delay change in our control.


	 


	Upon completion of the offering, Cathedral
	Stock Transfer will act as the registrant's transfer agent.


	 


	 




	Preferred Stock




	Our articles of incorporation
	provide for the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our articles of incorporation authorize and empower our
	board of directors, without shareholder approval and in the manner provided by law, to fix and determine in a resolution the classes,
	series and number of each class or series of preferred stock. Such preferred stock, if issued, may be convertible into shares of
	our common stock and therefore be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Moreover, any preferred series stock issued will carry
	a liquidation and dividend preference over the holders of our common stock and therefore will impair the rights of our common stock
	holders.


	On August 4, 2015, our
	board of directors created three new classes of preferred stock: Series B Convertible Preferred Shares, Series C Convertible Preferred
	Shares, and Series D Convertible Preferred Shares. Our board of directors fixed the number of shares in each class as provided
	in the table below:


	On June 15, 2016, our
	board of directors created one additional class of preferred series stock: Series A Convertible Preferred Shares. Our board of
	directors fixed the number of shares in each class as provided in the table below:







	Class:








	Number:








	Series A Convertible Preferred




	8.500,000






	Series B Convertible Preferred




	1,000,000






	Series C Convertible Preferred




	250,000






	Series D Convertible Preferred




	250,000





	 


	Except as otherwise required under the General Corporation Law of
	the State of Nevada, the preferred stock here fixed and determined have no voting rights. Each preferred share is convertible into
	one (1) share of common stock immediately after the Registration Statement filed on Form S-1 is effective. Accordingly, once converted,
	each share will vote

	pari passu

	with the other common stock shareholders.



	 


	 






	Dividend Policy




	 


	We have never paid
	or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the
	foreseeable future. We intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our
	business. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon a
	number of factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions, restrictions
	imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.



	 






	Share Eligible
	for Future Sale




	 


	Prior to this offering,
	there was no public market for our common stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common
	stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on







	33










	 






	the
	market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect
	the market prices of our common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities.


	 


	We have outstanding
	an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of our common stock. Of these shares, only the 5,000,000 to be registered in this offering will
	be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless those shares are purchased by
	our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.


	 


	The remaining
	25,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding after this offering will be restricted as a result of securities laws. Restricted
	securities may be sold in the public market only if they have been registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration
	under Rule 144 under the Securities Act.


	 



	 





	Implication
	of the Applicability of Rule 144




	 


	Rule 144, promulgated
	under the Securities Act of 1933 allows for the public resale of restricted and control securities if a number of conditions are
	met. Meeting the conditions includes holding the shares for a certain period of time, having adequate current information, looking
	into a trading volume formula, and filing a notice of the proposed sale with the SEC.


	 


	In general, a person
	who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities
	provided that (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the 90 days
	preceding, a sale, (ii) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements and have filed all required reports
	for a least 90 days before the sale, and (iii) we are not and have never been a shell company (a company having no or nominal operations
	and either (1) no or nominal assets, (2) assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents, or (3) assets consisting of any
	amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets). As we are a shell company, Rule 144 wwill be unavailable until one
	year following the date we cease to be a shell company and file Form 10 information with the SEC ceasing to be a shell company,
	provided that we are then subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and have filed all reports
	and other materials required to be filed by section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the preceding 12 months (or for such
	shorter period that we were required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports.


	 


	Persons who have beneficially
	owned restricted shares of our common stock for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or any time during
	the 90 days preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within
	any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of either of the following:


	 




	 



	-




	1% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding; or





	 




	 



	-




	The average weekly trading volume of our common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale.





	 


	At the expiration
	of the one-year holding period, a person who was not one of our affiliates at any time during the three months preceding a sale
	would be entitled to sell an unlimited number of shares of our common stock without restriction. A person who was one of our affiliates
	at any time during the three months preceding a sale would remain subject to the volume restrictions described above.


	 


	Sales under the Rule
	144 by our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are also subject to certain manner of sale provisions
	and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us.


	 


	 




	Penny Stock
	Considerations




	 


	Our shares will be
	"penny stocks", as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mean equity securities with
	a price of less than $5.00. Thus, our shares will be subject to rules that impose sales practice







	34










	 






	and
	disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock. Under the penny stock regulations,
	a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer must make a special suitability determination
	regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the sale, unless the broker-dealer
	is otherwise exempt.


	 


	In addition, under
	the penny stock regulations, the broker-dealer is required to:


	 




	 



	-




	Deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt;





	 




	 



	-




	Disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities;





	 




	 



	-




	Send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer's account, the account's value, and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and





	 




	 



	-




	Make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction, prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer's account.





	 


	Because of these regulations,
	broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our Common Stock, which may affect the ability of
	selling shareholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market, and have the effect of reducing the level of
	trading activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of
	our securities, if our securities become publicly traded. In addition, the liquidity for our securities may be decreased, with
	a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities. Our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules
	and our shareholders will, in all likelihood, find it difficult to sell their securities.



	 






	INTEREST OF NAMED
	EXPERTS




	 


	The financial statements
	for the period from inception to December 31, 2015 included in this prospectus have been audited by AJSH & CO. LLP, who
	is a certified public accountant, to the extent and for the periods set forth in our report and are incorporated herein in reliance
	upon such report given upon the authority of said firm as experts in auditing and accounting. There have not been any changes in
	or disagreements with this firm on accounting and financial disclosure or any other matter.


	 


	The legality of the
	shares offered under this registration statement is being passed upon by Adam S. Tracy, Esq., Securities Compliance Group, Ltd.,
	2100 Manchester Road, Suite 615, Wheaton, IL 60187 (888) 978-9901. Mr. Tracy does not own any shares of the company.



	 



	 







	DESCRIPTION OF
	BUSINESS OPERATIONS





	 



	The Company was
	incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 12, 2015. We are developing technology that can enable wire-free charging
	of multiple electronic devices at a distance with freedom of movement. Since inception, we have generated an accumulated deficient
	in the amount of ($70,462).


	 




	Current Operations





	 



	The Company is a development stage technology
	company focused on developing technology and reference design products and have developed is a beta system consisting of a base
	station transmitter, a smart phone receiver case, receiver test boards and management software. These reference design products
	once completed will enable smart







	35










	 






	home
	connected devices to be powered wirelessly and controlled thru voice by providing convenient, adaptive wireless power charging
	capabilities to low power fixed and mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, toys, videogame controllers, watches, remote
	controls, smoke alarms, window covering deployment and retraction motors, installed sensors and night and emergency lighting fixtures
	that use or are capable of using a rechargeable battery. Our goal is to create a wireless powered Smart Home, with products being
	both wirelessly powered, and charged, and are activated through voice control systems. The Company will seek to target both consumer
	and commercial enterprise markets that use such rechargeable fixed and mobile devices.



	 




	 



	The two reference design products of the company
	are a portable transmitter, about the size of a deck of cards, which creates a “4-D” optical window to one or many
	receivers, connected to electronic devices, such as a smart phone, which then receives its power from the “4-D” optical
	window. The transmitter locates the receiver in a 4-D optical space. The transmitter then generates an invisible wavelength, the
	“optical window” around the receiver. The receiver chip gathers power from the 4-D optical window and is able to charge
	recharge battery devices or power up to 10-watt devices that otherwise need battery connection from a power outlet. We are developing
	voice user interface algorithm for the management and control of our products.


	 


	Other than the current receiver, and transmitter,
	Voice Life Inc. is in the process of designing three additional reference design prototypes. All five-reference designs prototypes
	will be showcased in the Smart Home. The additional products include LED “transceiver light bulb, music speaker wireless
	powered receiver, and OLED display wireless power receiver. However, we believe that the technology upon which these reference
	design prototypes is based can potentially be utilized in a variety of other devices as well, including tablets, remote controls,
	rechargeable lights, and any other device with similar recharging capabilities that would otherwise require batteries or electrical
	outlets.


	 


	Although we have no formal agreements in place, we intend to source
	raw materials and other supplies from the established high capacity manufacture Shenzhen XinLiyang Co., Ltd., 3rd Building, Longhui
	Industrial Zone, Fuqiao 3rd Zone, Qiaotou Village, Fuyong Town, Baoan District, Shenzhen City, China.


	 




	Sales Strategy




	 


	Through the past decade the principals
	of the Company have developed a relationship with Ingram Micro and Alibaba Group. Ingram Micro is the one of the few global broad
	based IT distributors, with 119 distribution centers serving over 200,000 resellers. Alibaba Group operates the leading online
	and mobile marketplace in retail and wholesale trade as well as cloud computing and other services. Voice Life plans to use its
	existing relationships with Ingram and Alibaba Group to expand its product sales and raise awareness for its products. Principal
	Officer Robert Smith has a working relationship with Ingram Micro because his previous work experience included working as an
	employee for Ingram Micro and he was responsible for building out their web operations. Mr Smith has maintained this relationship
	within the current executive management team at Ingram Micro. Mr. Smith also has a working relationship with Shenzhen Xinliyang
	Technology Co. who has a working relationship with Alibaba and is a 3rd year gold Supplier. Xinliyang Technology Co as a result
	of its Gold Supplier premium membership is able to provided us with comprehensive ways to promote our products, maximizing our
	product exposure and increasing return-on-investment.


	 


	The Company is currently in discussions with
	major residential homebuilders in Southern California with respect to incorporating the “Voice Controlled” template
	in their homes. The Company anticipates the Voice Controlled template to become options in any new home and existing home.


	 


	Voice Life has signed several standard agreements
	with Amazon.com, including an app distribution and services agreement, a mobile ad network publisher’s agreement, and a program
	materials license agreement. The Company intends to utilize Amazon.com to distribute its products and reach their wide audience.
	Our relationship with Amazon is that of a standard apps development and services developer. We have not negotiated any specialized,
	unique or exclusive contracts with Amazon.


	 

	 





	Growth Strategy





	 








	36










	 






	The Company’s plan for the future includes
	developing products using voice user interface algorithm. Wireless power distribution system composed of two interconnected products:
	a portable transmitter, and an accessory receiver case, which receives power from the transmitter, creating wireless charging capabilities.
	The Company will showcase these products along with its new wirelessly powered light bulbs, and music speakers in a residential
	smart home. The Showcase will serve as a “Voice Controlled” Smart Home template for applying these wireless charging
	technologies and products to any home. Our company is in the process of pursuing manufacturing and licensing because there are
	several markets in which our technology can be used.


	 


	 


	Other than the current receiver, and transmitter,
	Voice Life Inc. is in the process of designing three additional products. All five products will be showcased in the smart home.
	The additional products include LED “transceiver light bulb, music speaker wireless powered receiver, and OLED display wireless
	power receiver. However we believe that our technology can potentially be utilized in a variety of other devices as well, including
	tablets, remote controls, rechargeable lights, and any other device with similar recharging capabilities that would otherwise require
	batteries or electrical outlets.


	 







	Target Markets.






	 




	We believe that our technology will be
	compelling to many end markets, each of which may have several potential customers. In an effort to focus our activities, we have
	selected certain initial target markets based on the potential value we would be able to create in these markets. As we continue
	to develop our technology, we may find that it creates more value in other markets; if that is the case, we intend to shift our
	focus to those other markets




	 




	We identify our initial target markets
	within these two hardware categories transmitters and receivers.




	 






	Transmitter Target Markets:






	We believe our AI AirCharge transmitter
	technology will be developed and released to the consumer in three basic categories:




	 








	•




	Stand-alone
	transmitters that are either sold independently or bundled as part of a AI AirCharge
	with a lifeline enabled receiver device










	•




	Transmitters
	that are integrated into third party devices like automobiles, televisions, , computer
	monitor bezels, sound bars, LED light bulb, etc










	•




	Transmitters
	that are integrated with Wi-Fi routers to form a single device that provides both connectivity
	and wire-free power






	 





	Stand-Alone Transmitters

	:
	Our current plans call for stand-alone transmitters to be released in three separate and distinct categories:




	 




	Near Field Transmitters:





	 





	Because of the distinct advantages compared
	to other existing forms of contact-based wireless charging including ease of manufacturing and relative ease of regulatory approval,
	we expect that products using our Near Field transmitter technology will be the first enabled products on the market. Our Near
	Field transmitters are ideally suited for wearables, IoT devices and other small electronics, which require a small form factor
	receiver and a low-cost charging solution. These small, inexpensive transmitters will likely be USB-powered, and will have a range
	of up to five millimeters. These solutions will initially be one-to-one (one transmitter to one receiver) with follow-on versions
	being one transmitter to multiple receivers.




	 




	Mid Field Portable Transmitters/Receiver





	 





	We expect that our Portable Mid Field
	transmitters will be geared to the notebook, iPad and automotive markets and will likely have is very scalable vary from contact-based
	charging up to 2-3 feet. We also intend for the Mid Field transmitters to have tracking ability to support mobile applications
	and multiple receiving devices. Likely implementations of midsized transmitters will include small portable transmitters/receiver
	designed to send low power at distances for accessories and wearables. The same technology may also likely be integrated into
	third party devices like automobiles, LED light bulb, computer monitor bezels, nightstand consumer electronics, accessories such
	as low voltage portable battery chargers and integrated automotive applications. The size and number of transmitters determine
	the power and distance delivered.




	 




	Far Field Transmitters

	:






	 





	Far Field power transmitters are full-featured
	transmitters with the power to charge multiple devices at distances of up to 15 feet or anywhere within a 30-foot diameter circle.
	We also expect that Far Field transmitters will have the ability to “connect” with other Far Field transmitters allowing
	the user to create a large charging envelope encompassing many different rooms or large spaces while seamlessly providing charging
	to mobile devices that are moving through the coverage space. Far Field transmitters may also play a significant role in the powering
	of IoT devices that are fixed such as security cameras and sensors. These may also be charged from an AI AirCharge enabled Wi-Fi
	router or LED light bulb, which adds RF-based charging-at-a-distance functionality.




	 





	Transmitters Integrated into Third
	Party Devices:






	 





	The “building block” core
	architecture developed for the AI AirCharge technology is ideally suited to a broad spectrum of third party devices like automobile,
	televisions and LED light bulb. The flexibility of the architecture in terms of size, power, distance, and cost affords Voice
	Life licensees the opportunity to match our technology with specific requirements and limitations typically found with complex
	integrations. For example, the AI AirCharge technology could be integrated into autonomous automobiles, LED light Bulb that are
	typically found in every home or office providing charging capabilities to mobile devices anywhere in the room. Further, the capabilities
	of the transmitter technology could enable licensees to develop venue-specific consumer electronics products like integrated televisions
	that are paired with integrated LED light bulb to provide mobile charging across a large room such as an airport lounge.




	 





	Wi-Fi Routers






	 





	We see the combination of the AI AirCharge
	wire-free power router and the Wi-Fi router as a natural integration point and a synergistic application of both technologies.
	The AI AirCharge wire-free power router shares a number of technical characteristics with Wi-Fi routers in that both devices operate
	in the airwaves in the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical (“ISM”) bands, both devices owe their success
	to the utility and convenience they bring to the consumer, both devices rely on antenna structures to send power and data, and
	both devices “AI Connected” or provide hand off capabilities which allow for large “enabled” sites similar
	to a mesh network. We also believe that our AI AirCharge technology may enhance the data signal and distance of a Wi-Fi router,
	which we believe will provide an even stronger value proposition to wireless data router manufacturers.




	 




	The Wi-Fi router market has two segments:
	commercial and residential. The key differentiator between these segments is that commercial routers tend to have much more robust
	security features, including virtual private networks and advanced content filtering. We believe that our technology is applicable
	to both the commercial and residential Wi-Fi router markets based on the building block capabilities mentioned earlier that will
	provide a AI AirCharge transmission that will enable the technology to effectively serve and support both markets.




	 




	In addition, the Wi-Fi router market has
	other key players. These include consumer electronics supply chain firms, including original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”),
	original design manufacturers (“ODMs”), component manufacturers and branded consumer electronics firms. We believe
	that each of these categories of players can help to integrate our technology into a commercially available Wi-Fi router.




	 




	An ODM designs products either collaboratively
	with their customers or on their own and manufactures them for sale to companies under the end customer’s brand. Additionally,
	an ODM may engage multiple companies with similar designs that are then marketed under several customers’ brands. An OEM
	manufactures products for sale under another firm’s brand.




	 






	Receiver Target Markets







	 





	We believe there is a wide variety of
	a potential use for our receiver technology that utilizes our transmitters:








	•




	Smartphones










	•




	Hearing
	aids










	•




	IOT
	devices










	•




	Wearables










	•




	Tablets










	•




	Mice










	•




	Gaming
	consoles and controllers










	•




	Keyboards










	•




	e-book
	readers










	•




	Remote
	controls










	•




	Sensors
	(such as thermostats)










	•




	Toys










	•




	Rechargeable
	batteries










	•




	Rechargeable
	lights










	•




	Automotive
	accessories










	•




	Personal
	care products (such as toothbrushes or shavers)










	•




	Retail
	inventory management (such as RFID tags)










	•




	Hand-held
	industrial devices (such as scanners or keypads)










	•




	Medical
	devices






	 




	This list is meant for illustrative purposes
	only; we cannot guarantee that we will address any of these markets, and we may decide to address a market that is not on the
	above list. We intend to continuously evaluate our target markets and choose new markets based on factors including (but not limited
	to) time-to-market, market size and growth, and the strength of our value proposition for a specific application.











	Our Competition





	 



	There are numerous existing, widely commercially available methods
	to provide power to rechargeable low-power fixed and mobile devices, including wall plug-in recharging, inductive recharging,
	power-mat recharging, battery recharging stations and more. To our knowledge, almost all mobile consumer electronic devices equipped
	with a rechargeable battery come bundled with a method to recharge the device (for example, a power cord).


	 


	We believe that the main advantage of our AI AirCharge technology
	as compared to traditional charging technologies will be the ability to charge multiple devices anywhere within the charging area
	(expected to be up-to 30 feet) without the use of a charging pad. We believe our technology is unique and flexible allowing us
	to concisely target a fixed or mobile device, track that device if it moves or is moving, and focus and transmit a stream of energy
	to the targeted device to charge the device without having to remove the battery or plug in the device.


	 


	We are not currently aware of any company or researcher looking
	to develop an AI AirCharge technology that utilizes innovative AI algorithms and deep learning software to focus their directional
	antennas to target and deliver energy over distance.


	 


	There is a variety of other wireless charging technologies on
	the market or under development today. These competitive technologies fall into the following categories:


	 



	Magnetic Induction.

	Magnetic induction uses a
	magnetic coil to create resonance, which can transmit energy over very short distances. Power is delivered as a function of coil
	size (the larger the coil, the more power), and coils must be directly paired (one receiver coil to one transmitter coil = directly
	coupled pair) within a typical distance of less than one inch. Products utilizing magnetic induction have been available for 10+
	years in products such as rechargeable electronic toothbrushes.


	 



	Magnetic Resonance.

	Magnetic resonance is similar
	to magnetic induction, as it uses magnetic coils to transmit energy. This technology uses coils that range in size depending on
	the power levels being transmitted. It has the ability to transmit power at distances up to ~11 inches (30cm) which can be increased
	with the use of resonance repeaters.


	 



	Conductive.

	Conductive charging uses conductive
	power transfer to eliminate wires between the charger (often a charging mat) and the charging device. It requires the use of a
	charging board as the power transmitter to deliver the power, and a charging device, with a built-in receiver, to receive the
	power. This technology requires direct metal contact between the charging board and the receiver. Once the charging board recognizes
	the receiver, the charging begins.


	 



	AI AirCharge.

	This is at the core of our lifeline
	technology. AI AirCharge utilizes innovative AI algorithms and deep learning software to focus our directional antennas to target
	and deliver energy over distance. To our knowledge, there is no other company attempting to utilize a directional AI AirCharge
	similar to that being developed by us.


	 



	Laser.

	Laser charging technology uses very short
	wavelengths of light to create a collimated beam that maintains its size over distance, using what is described as distributed
	resonance to deliver power to an optical receiver.


	 



	Ultrasound.

	Ultrasound charging technology converts
	electric energy into acoustic energy in the form of ultrasound waves. It then reconverts those waves through an “energy-harvesting”
	receiver.


	 








	Intellectual Property




	 




	We are pursuing an aggressive intellectual property strategy
	and are developing new patents. At present, we have no patents issued or pending and we do not have any trademarks, licenses,
	franchises, concessions, and royalty agreements, labor contracts or other proprietary interests. We will seek to have
	our technologies submitted for patent protection in the United States should the requisite funds become available. We have identified
	more than 9 specific inventions we believe to be novel and patentable. There can be no guarantee, however, that our products will
	be approved for patent protection.


	 


	We expect to rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, non-disclosure
	agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our intellectual property rights. These measures may not be adequate to
	safeguard the technology underlying our products.




	 




	Research and Development




	 


	The Company’s
	CEO and sole director has spent $252,000 of his personal funds in non-recurring engineering expenses on the research and development
	of a prototype for the company’s wireless power distribution product. Our CEO has developed the prototype himself. The development
	work occurred between January 15, 2013 and March 2015, and is an ongoing work in progress. Voice Life Inc. acquired ownership
	of the product from the developer Robert Smith pursuant to the Technology Assignment and Transfer Agreement (

	see

	Exhibit
	10.8 hereto).







	37










	 







	The prototype
	we have developed is a beta system consisting of a base station transmitter, a smart phone receiver case, receiver test boards
	and management software and we are developing technology that can enable wireless charging or powering of electronic devices at
	distance.




	The Beta System has validated the technology in
	our labs utilizing commercially available parts and components, which have not been optimized and may be too large, to be incorporated
	into commercially marketed products. We are developing multiple generations of transmitter and receiver application specific integrated
	circuits (“ASICs”) that we believe will optimize our technology by reducing size and cost, while increasing performance
	to a level that we believe will allow for them to be integrated into low-power devices (defined as devices requiring less than
	10 watts), thereby eliminating the need for a charging cord or pad to maintain a charge.



	 


	In order to demonstrate the capability of our
	technology to potential partners, we are currently developing complete products for potential licensees who will modify and remanufacture
	the products to fit their own needs. These products are known as “reference designs” of our integrated solution. The
	company’s strategy is to attempt to license these reference designs to key potential partners, which we believe will allow
	them to speed up incorporation of technology into their product lines, create awareness and demand, and bring our power solution
	to market faster. Our initial reference designs currently under development are being designed for use with smart phones.


	 


	As of SDecember 31, 2016, the
	Company has four products that are in various stages of development. One product “receiver case” is in production
	but has not yet recorded any revenues while the remaining three products are in various stages of development.




	 


	 




	Governmental Regulation




	 


	We require Federal Communication Commission
	approval for our technology, which may be difficult to achieve, and existing laws or regulations or future legislative or regulatory
	changes may affect our business. Our remote charging technology involves the transmission of power using a combination Light Frequencies
	and radio frequency (“RF”) energy waves, which are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”)
	We intend to design our technology so that it will operate in the 2.4/5.8 GHz radio frequency ranges, which are the same range
	as Wi-Fi routers and several other wireless consumer electronics. Therefore, we must meet Part 15 requirements and approval and
	may require FCC Part 18 approval.



	 



	As ofDecember 31, 2016, the Company
	has four products that are in various stages of development. One product “receiver case” is in production but has
	not yet recorded any revenues while the remaining three products are in various stages of development.


	 



	FCC Permits:



	 


	In the United States, the Federal Communications
	Commission (FCC) is responsible for the regulation of all RF devices. The FCC requires any device that radiates RF energy to be
	tested for compliance with FCC rules. Part 15 is the section of the code that deals with devices that emit RF energy and are to
	be operated without an individual license.


	 


	Certain bands within the RF spectrum are available
	for “unlicensed” operation. The term “unlicensed” is often misunderstood. The manufacturer of a product
	designed for “unlicensed” operation is not exempt from testing and/or certification. Indeed, both the transmitter and
	receiver must be tested by a qualified testing laboratory. However, once the necessary approvals are received, the end user can
	then operate the product without further obligation or licensing. Wireless charging devices can be approved under Part 15 or Part
	18 or both rule parts.


	 


	While devices operating upon unlicensed bands
	do not require FCC licensing, they are not unregulated and must meet the Federal Code of Regulation (CFR) FCC Part 15, which is
	a common testing standard for most electronic equipment. FCC Part 15 covers the regulations under which an intentional, unintentional,
	or incidental radiator that can be operated without an individual license. FCC Part 15 covers as well the technical specifications,
	administrative requirements and other conditions relating to the marketing of FCC Part 15 devices. Our waveform operates in the
	2.4/5.8 GHz radio frequency range, which is the same range as Wi-Fi routers and several other wireless consumer electronics. For
	those types of products, the FCC grants Part 15 approval if, among other things,







	38










	 






	the specific
	absorption rate (

	“SAR”

	) is below certain thresholds. Based on our preliminary calculations, the SAR at our receiver
	should be well below that of a typical cellular signal, so we believe we will be able to gain FCC Part 15 approval for our prototypes
	currently in development.


	 


	Once our product is in its finished form, exactly
	as it will be produced, testing will be conducted by a properly approved laboratory. In most cases, it is not necessary to be present
	for testing and the laboratory will prepare the filing paperwork. We are not currently aware of any requirement that we believe
	will result in a failure of our product to obtain an FCC Part 15 compliance certificate.


	In addition, because
	our technology involves the transmission of power greater than the power threshold limits of Part 15, we also expect to need to
	obtain FCC Part 18 approval. FCC Part 18 is the section of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations that provides the Federal
	Communications Commission (FCC) with authority to regulate industrial, scientific, and medical equipment (ISM) that emits electromagnetic
	energy on frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum. Upon request by a representative of the Commission the manufacturer,
	owner, or operator of any ISM equipment shall make the equipment available for inspection and promptly furnish the Commission with
	such information as may be required to indicate that the equipment complies with FCC Part 18 Process. Compliance with FCC Part
	18 requires the product to be designed with sufficient shielding and filtering to provide adequate suppression of emissions on
	frequencies outside of the allowed frequency bands.


	It is our expectation,
	based on similar products and designs developed by our manufacturer, that we will use our manufacturer’s expertise in the
	FCC approval process and will work closely with them to conduct and complete these certification tests. It is our expectation,
	based on similar products and designs by other companies that our manufacturer, Shenzhen Xinliyang Technology Co., Ltd, will conduct
	and complete these certification tests as part of the Company’s standard course of business and planning process and from
	start to finish should be completed in approximately 6 months. Following the completion of the certification testing we expect,
	again based on the experience of our manufacturer, it to take an additional 2 months to have the product approved by the FCC. Shenzhen
	Xinliyang Technology Co., Ltd was established in 1998. It is an “all-in-one high-tech enterprise” that specializes
	in R&D, innovation design, engineering realization, manufacturing and knight service. It has a 10000 square meters production
	facility in Shenzhen City and 500 employees, .including 50 engineers. It is an ISO9001-2000 approved factory with 6 production
	lines. Monthly capacity is about 100,000 PCS.


	Moreover, the laws, regulations, policies or
	current administrative practices of any government body, organization or regulatory agency in the United States or any other jurisdiction,
	may be changed, applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our company to carry on our business.
	The actions, policies or regulations, or changes thereto, of any government body or regulatory agency, or other special interest
	groups, may have a detrimental effect on us. Any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our ability to operate
	and/or our profitably.

	Potential Conflicts of Interest





	Since we do not have an audit or compensation committee comprised of independent directors, the functions that would have been
	performed by such committees are performed by our directors. Thus, there is a potential conflict of interest in that our directors
	and officers have the authority to determine issues concerning management compensation and audit issues that may affect management
	decisions. We are not aware of any other conflicts of interest with any of our executives or directors.


	 




	Director Independence





	Our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director and considered whether any director has a material
	relationship with us that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities. As
	a result of this review, our board of directors determined that our directors do not meet the independence requirements, according
	to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC.


	 




	Corporate Governance




	 


	There have been no
	changes in any state law or other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. In addition
	to having no nominating committee for that purpose, we currently have no specific audit committee and no audit committee financial
	expert. Based on the fact that our current business affairs are simple, any such committees are excessive and beyond the scope
	of our business and needs.


	 




	Family Relationships




	 


	None.


	 




	Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings




	 


	No officer, director, or persons nominated
	for such positions, promoter or significant employee has been involved in the last ten years in any of the following:


	 


	•	Any bankruptcy petition filed
	by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy
	or within two years prior to that time,


	 


	•	Any conviction in a criminal
	proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses),


	 







	41










	 






	•	Being subject to any order,
	judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily
	enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities,


	 


	•	Being found by a court of competent
	jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state
	securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated.


	 


	•	Having any government agency,
	administrative agency, or administrative court impose an administrative finding, order, decree, or sanction against them as a result
	of their involvement in any type of business, securities, or banking activity.


	 


	•	Being the subject of a pending
	administrative proceeding related to their involvement in any type of business, securities, or banking activity.


	 


	•	Having any administrative proceeding
	been threatened against you related to their involvement in any type of business, securities, or banking activity.



	 


	 


	 





	SECURITY OWNERSHIP
	OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT



	 


	The following tables
	set forth the ownership, as of the date of this prospectus, of our common stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial
	owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, our directors, and our executive officers and directors as a group. To the
	best of our knowledge, the persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares, except as otherwise
	noted. There are not any pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control.


	 


	The information presented
	below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of the Securities
	and Exchange Commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, a person is deemed
	to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security
	or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed to own beneficially any security as to which
	such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within 60 days through the conversion or exercise
	of any convertible security, warrant, option or other right. More than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the
	same securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number
	of shares beneficially owned by such person, which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire
	voting or investment power within 60 days, by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares
	as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days. Consequently, the denominator used
	for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner. Except as otherwise indicated below and under applicable
	community property laws, we believe that the beneficial owners of our common stock listed below have sole voting and investment
	power with respect to the shares shown. The business address of the shareholders is 7071 Warner Avenue Suite 460 Huntington Beach,
	CA 92647.

	EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION




	 



	Our
	compensation philosophy is to offer our executive officers compensation and benefits that are competitive and meet our goals of
	attracting, retaining and motivating highly skilled management, which is necessary to achieve our financial and strategic objectives
	and create long-term value for our stockholders. We believe the levels of compensation we provide should be competitive, reasonable
	and appropriate for our business needs and circumstances. The principal elements of our executive compensation program have to
	date included base salary. We believe successful long term Company performance is more critical to enhancing stockholder value
	than short term results.

	arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant as
	provided in the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such
	indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim for indemnification
	against such liabilities, other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer
	or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by such
	director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless
	in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
	the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed
	by the final adjudication of such.



	 





	MANAGEMENT’S
	DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION




	AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 


	The following discussion
	of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related
	notes, and other financial information included in this Form S-1.


	 


	Our Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking
	statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local
	general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and
	integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure
	to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations
	and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability
	to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other
	risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	 







	45










	 






	Although the forward-looking
	statements in this Registration Statement reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based
	on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks
	and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking
	statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports
	as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results
	of operations and prospects.


	 




	Overview





	 







	Voice Life Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on March 12, 2015.
	We are located in Huntington Beach, California. The Company is a development stage technology company that’s developing
	technology that can enable wire-free charging of electronic devices at a distance with complete mobility through innovative AI
	algorithms and deep learning software applications.


	 


	We intend to license our technology to various consumer electronics
	companies, including component manufacturers, OEMs, ODMs and branded consumer electronics firms. We believe strategic relationships
	with key consumer electronics supply chain licensees will enable us to reap the benefits of our technology much faster than by
	manufacturing, distributing or installing products ourselves. While we do not now have license revenue, our strategy depends on
	the development of successful commercial products and effectively licensing our technology into the consumer, enterprise and commercial
	markets. We will need to understand procurement and buying cycles to be successful in licensing our technology into those markets


	 


	In our operating history, we have developed a beta system consisting
	of a base station transmitter, a smart phone receiver case, receiver test boards and management software. In addition, we have
	designed and submitted for manufacturing an application specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) to optimize our transmitter
	technology. Furthermore, we have designed, but not yet submitted for manufacturing, an ASIC to optimize our receiver technology.
	In connection with the receiver technology, we have designed multiple smart phone charging cases, which are still under development.
	Complementing our hardware designs, we have developed a AI software application that we believe allows for management, control,
	statistics and prioritization of the charging for the remote devices via a smartphone, tablet or PC.


	  


	The wireless charging solution we are developing employs use
	of AI and Deep Learning on a GPU-accelerated platform. Our AI Lab consists Azure N-Series that includes 1 GPU-Accelerated Server
	12 GPUs • 18,432 cores. Azure NC-based instances are powered by NVIDIA Tesla® K80 GPUs and provide the compute power
	required to accelerate the most demanding high-performance computing (HPC) 


	 


	 


	 


	We are pursuing an aggressive intellectual property strategy
	and are developing new patents. At present, we have no patents issued or no pending patents and we do not have any trademarks,
	licenses, franchises, concessions, and royalty agreements, labor contracts or other proprietary interests. We will seek
	to have our technologies submitted for patent protection in the United States should the requisite funds become available. We
	have identified more than 9 specific inventions we believe to be novel and patentable. There can be no guarantee, however, that
	our products will be approved for patent protection.


	 


	We expect to rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, non-disclosure
	agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our intellectual property rights. These measures may not be adequate to
	safeguard the technology underlying our products


	 


	We in the process of recruiting a seasoned management team with
	public company and relevant industry experience to develop and execute our operating plan. In addition, we have identified and
	will be adding additional engineering resources, which we expect ultimately will build up the engineering capability of our internal
	team upon being effective. Finally, we have started the selection process for the independent members of our board of directors,
	which we intend to rely upon for valuable assistance in terms of industry credibility, corporate governance, and strategic direction.


	 


	Since March 12, 2015 (Inception) through December 31, 2015 we
	have generated no revenue in the amount against total expenses of $25,556 for a net loss in the amount of $25,556. From January
	1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 we have generated no revenue against total expenses of $79,994 for a net loss in the amount
	of $79,994. We have generated an accumulated deficit in the amount of $105,550 for the period March 12, 2015 (Inception) through
	period ending December 31, 2016.


	 


	Our expenses during the past 19 months are primarily attributed
	to organizing the company and this offering as well as researching and developing its product reference design prototypes. The
	increase in loss from operations resulted primarily from ASIC development, other research and development and consultant fees,
	as well as the legal and accounting costs incurred in connection with compliance with our SEC reporting obligations



	 



	To date, our operations have been funded through the sale of
	our preferred series stock, which is convertible upon effectiveness to common shares.



	 



	The amounts that we actually spend for any specific purpose
	may vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the pace of progress of our development
	and licensing efforts, unexpected difficulties arising in the process of protecting our intellectual property, market conditions,
	and changes in or revisions to our marketing strategies. In addition, we may use a portion of any net proceeds to acquire complementary
	products, technologies or businesses; however we do not have plans for any acquisitions at this time. We will have significant
	discretion in the use of any net proceeds. Investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application
	of the proceeds of any sale of our common stock.






	 




	Plan of Operations





	 



	We plan to continue to focus on the development
	of remote charging technology, with our current goal being to further develop and license this technology to consumer electronics
	supply chain firms or manufacturers and developers of other devices that would benefit from remote charging. We intend to pursue
	licensing because we believe there are several market verticals to which the remote charging technology can apply, and we believe
	that this is the most capital-efficient manner in which we can address many of them at once. As we develop new applications for
	the technology, we expect to target new strategic relationships in different market sectors.


	 




	We originally expected that our remote charging technology will
	be ready for production and made commercially available to potential licensees during the third quarter of 2016. The reasons for the
	delay include some changes and modifications to the reference designs and to a more advanced AI Enable Silicon Chip
	which has required further testing, and change in the manufacturing final design. We now expect that our remote charging
	technology will be ready for production and made commercially available to potential licensees during the third or fourth quarter
	of 2017.


	 


	Since we are a development stage company, we have not yet finalized
	some aspects of our strategy. For example, we may decide to sell our wireless charging products ourselves, in addition to licensing
	the design of these products. That decision would depend if we could get a capital partner and we believe selling the products
	ourselves we could meet the market demand of potential customers.




	 


	We expect to use the net proceeds received
	from this offering to continue our remote charging technology development, develop product reference designs, complete certification
	testing, protect our intellectual property, pursue licensing partners and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.


	 


	 


	 


	 


	 


	We are highly dependent
	on the success of this offering to execute upon this proposed plan of operations. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds through
	this offering or obtain alternate financing in lieu of funds raised through this offering, we may never complete development and
	become profitable. In order to become profitable we may still need to secure additional debt or equity funding above and beyond
	what we are seeking to raise through this offering. To such end, we hope to be able to raise additional funds from an offering
	of our stock in the future. However, this offering may not occur, or if it occurs, it may not raise the required funding. We do
	not have any plans or specific agreements for new sources of funding at present.


	 




	Results
	of Operations




	 






	Revenues. To date
	we have not generated any revenues.


	 




	Operating
	Expenses and Loss from Operations

	. Operating expenses include general administrative expenses, legal fees, and research
	and development expenses. Loss from operations for the period March 12, 2015 thru December 31, 2015, for the period January, 1,
	2016 through December 31, 2016, and for the period March 12, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2016 is $25,556, $79,994 and
	$105,550, respectively. As of the period ending December 31, 2015 our cash balance was $23,993 with $8,624 in liabilities. As
	of the period ending December 31, 2016 our cash balance is $19,440 with $0.00 in liabilities. General and administrative expenses
	include costs for general and corporate functions, including facility fees, travel, telecommunications, insurance, professional
	fees, consulting fees and other overhead. Our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any
	period of time without further revenue or proceed

	from this offering. We have utilized funds from Robert Smith,
	our Chief Executive Officer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing
	fees, and professional fees. Mr. Smith, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan
	funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $820,000
	of funding from our Preferred Series offering. After the initial twelve month period we may need additional financing. We do not
	currently have any arrangements for additional financing.

	For the period March 12, 2015 (inception) thru December
	31, 2015




	Operating Expenses
	and Loss from Operations

	. During the period from March 12, 2015 (inception) to December 31, 2015, we generated no revenues
	and incurred expenses of $25,556 Our operating expenses consist of the costs incurred in organizing the company and this offering
	as well as developing its reference designs product prototypes. This constitutes an aggregate loss of $25,556.


	 



	For the period January 1, 2016 thru December 31, 2016




	Operating Expenses and Loss from Operations

	. During
	the period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, we generated no revenues and incurred expenses of $79,994



	 





	Net
	Loss.

	 As a result of the above, net loss for the 12 months ending December 31, 2016 was $79,794 compared to $25,556
	nine months ending 2015. The increase in loss from operations resulted primarily from ASIC development, other research and development
	and consultant fees, as well as the legal and accounting costs incurred in connection with compliance with our SEC reporting obligations.




	 




	For the period March 12, 2015 (inception) thru December 31,
	2016





	Operating
	Expenses and Loss from Operations

	. During the period from March 12, 2015 (inception) to December 31, 2016, we generated
	no revenues and incurred expenses of $105,550 ..




	 




	Net Loss.

	 As a result of the above, net loss
	for the 19 months ended December 31, 2016 was $105,550. Our operating expenses consist of the costs incurred in organizing the
	company and this offering as well as the development of our reference design product prototype The increase in loss from operations
	resulted primarily from ASIC development, other research and development and consultant fees, as well as the legal and accounting
	costs incurred in connection with compliance with our SEC reporting obligations


	To
	meet our need for cash we are raising money from sale of Convertible Preferred Series Shares. The maximum aggregate amount of
	this offering will be required to fully implement our business plan. If we are unable to successfully implement our business plan
	we may need to find alternative funding sources. We have commenced a private placement offering of the sale of Convertible Preferred
	Series Shares as of August 4, 2015. The period from March 12, 2015 through December 31, 2015 the Registrant has received proceeds
	of $41,500 from six investors. The period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 the Registrant has received proceeds
	of $83,490 from twenty three distinct investors. Thus from March 12, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2016 the Registrant
	has received proceeds of $122,490 from twenty nine distinct investors. The Registrant expects the sale of the Preferred Series
	Shares to convert to common shares upon SEC effectiveness. If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have
	to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely.




	 




	Purchase and
	Sale of Equipment





	 



	We presently have
	no equipment.


	 




	Income &
	Operation Taxes




	 


	We are subject to
	income taxes in the U.S.


	 




	Net Loss




	 




	From the period
	from March 12, 2015 through December 31, 2015 we incurred net losses of $25,556. From the period from January 1, 2016 to December
	31, 2016 we incurred net losses of $79,994. During the period from March 12, 2015 (inception) to December 31, 2016, we generated
	no revenues and incurred net loses of $105,550. These losses are mainly due to the costs involved in the organization of the company
	and costs incurred in research and development of its reference designs product prototypes.




	 




	Controls and
	Procedures




	 


	We are not currently
	required to maintain an effective system of internal controls. We will be required to comply with the internal control requirements
	of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not completed
	an assessment, nor have our auditors tested our systems of internal controls.


	 


	Because it will take
	time, management involvement and perhaps outside resources to determine what internal control improvements are necessary for us
	to meet regulatory requirements and market expectations for our operations, we may incur significant expense in meeting our public
	reporting responsibilities, particularly in the areas of designing, enhancing, or remediating internal and disclosure controls.
	Doing so effectively may also take longer than we expect, thus increasing our exposure to financial fraud or erroneous financing
	reporting.


	 


	Once our management’s
	report on internal controls is complete, we will retain our independent auditors to audit and render an opinion on such report
	when required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The independent auditors may identify additional issues concerning our
	operations while performing their audit of internal control over financial reporting.

	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations




	 


	As of December
	31, 2016 we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations.


	 




	Development
	Stage and Capital Resources




	 


	 


	 


	Since its inception,
	the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting management
	and staff and raising capital. Accordingly, the Company is considered to be in the development stage. The Company has generated
	minimal revenues from operations and therefore lacks meaningful capital reserves.


	 


	We are attempting
	to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operation. To proceed with our operations within 12 months, we need a minimum of $687,500.
	We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 months financial requirement. If we
	are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will
	attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operation.


	 


	While we have minimal
	revenues as of this date, no substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and
	implemented our full plan of operations. We must raise cash to implement our strategy to grow and expand per our business plan.
	The minimum amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required
	to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being
	a reporting public company will be approximately $30,000.


	 


	We are highly dependent
	upon the success of this offering, as described herein. Therefore, the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital
	from other resources such as taking loans, which would likely not even be possible for the Company. However, if such financing
	were available, because we are a development stage company with no operations to date, we would likely have to pay additional costs
	associated with high-risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management
	would evaluate the terms of such debt financing. If the Company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its
	equity or debt securities, or secure a loan, the Company would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors
	would lose all of their investment.


	 


	Additionally, the
	Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company.
	The Company’s management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with
	various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance
	time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement the business plan and may impede the speed
	of its operations.

	REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
	PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	 




	 







	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
	Firm


	 


	 


	Board of Directors and Stockholders Voice
	Life, Inc.


	 


	We have audited the accompanying
	balance sheets of Voice Life, Inc (“the Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and the related statements of operations,
	stockholder's equity, and cash flows for the period March 12, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2016. These financial statements
	are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
	based on our audit.


	 


	We conducted our audit
	in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
	we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal controls over financial reporting.
	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
	appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
	basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
	significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
	our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the
	financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Voice Life, Inc. as
	of December 31, 2016, and the result of its operations and its cash flow from the period March 12, 2015 (inception) through December
	31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.


	 



	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
	in Note 9, the Company has only eighteen months operating history and has incurred losses since inception of $105,550 and has
	a working capital surplus of $19,440. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
	concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also discussed in Note 9. The financial statements do not include any
	adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	VOICE LIFE INC.




	(A Development Stage Company) Notes to Financial
	Statements




	 





	Note 1-Business Organization, History, and Nature of Operations




	 



	Voice Life Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in
	Nevada on March 12, 2015 (inception). The company is a development stage technology company focused on developing technology and
	products that enable smart home connected devices to be powered wirelessly and controlled through voice by providing convenient,
	adaptive wireless power charging capabilities to low power using fixed and mobile devices such as mobile phones, wearable’s
	watches, tablets, smoke alarms, and OLED Displays. The Company is targeting both consumer and commercial enterprise markets that
	uses chargeable fixed and mobile devices.


	 


	As of December 31, 2016, the Company has four products that are
	in various stages of development. One product is in production but has not yet recorded any revenues while the remaining three
	products are in various stages of development. Since inception, the Company’s primary activities have consisted of developing
	its business plan, raising capital, recruiting and hiring its executive team and developing its technology. To date, these activities
	have been funded mainly through founder’s own personal investment and additional funds. The company will rely initially upon
	the private placement and/or Title III CF sale of its Preferred Series shares that are convertible to common shares upon effectiveness
	and/or upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering of Common Stock.


	 


	The Company is considered to be in the development stage, and as
	such, the Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	topic 915, “Development Stage Entities”. The Company is subject to all of the risks associated with development stage
	companies.


	 


	 



	Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies




	 





	Basis of Presentation






	 




	The accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars
	and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America(“USGAAP”),
	and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).


	 




	Revenue Recognition






	 




	Revenue is derived from sales of products to distributors and consumers.
	Revenue will be recognized when earned, as reasonably determinable in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting
	Standards Policy (“ASP”) 605-10, 605-15, 605-20 and 605-40. “Revenue Recognition.”


	 


	The following are the conditions that must be met in order to recognize
	revenue in accordance with ASP:


	(i) the buyer’s price is fixed or determinable as of the date
	of sale (presumably via executed final sales contract); (ii) the buyer has paid or is obligated to pay the seller based on nothing
	except the delivery of the product (i.e. cannot be contingent on any other future events); (iii) the buyer’s obligation to
	pay the seller changes only if the product is returned to the seller (e.g. theft, damage, or loss of product does not negotiate
	buyers obligation); (iv) the buyer acquiring the product must have economic substance outside of the product provided by the seller
	(that is, the buyer cannot be a simple re-seller established by the seller for the purpose of what would amount to inflating recognized
	sales); (v) the sellers obligation to the buyer significantly ends at delivery (the seller cannot be obligated to direct buyers
	to the seller, substantially advertise/distribute for the seller, etc).


	 




	Organization and Offering Cost




	Total Breakdown of Expenses: For the Period Mar 12, 2015 (Inception)
	through Dec 31, 2016


	Other General and Admin Expenses $67,843


	Legal Fees $22,542


	Research and Development Expenses $15,165




	 







	55










	 






	 





	Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued





	 






	Loss per Share




	 


	The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with
	ASC Topic 260-10, "Earnings per Share." Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing income (loss) available
	to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed
	similar to basic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common
	shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were
	dilutive.


	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 


	For purpose of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers
	cash and cash equivalents to include all stable, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less.


	 




	Organization and Offering Cost




	 


	The Company has a policy to expense organization and offering cost
	as incurred. To date for period March 12, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2016 the Company has incurred organization and
	offering cost of $ 105,550, which are forming the part of financial statements under Other General Administrative Charges, Legal
	Fees and Research and Development Expenses.


	 




	Concentration of Credit Risk




	The Company primarily transacts its business with one financial
	institution. The amount on deposit in that one institution may from time to time exceed the federally insured limit.


	 




	Use of Estimates




	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates

	.




	 





	Business segments






	 




	ASC 280, “Segment Reporting” requires use of the “management
	approach” model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company’s management organizes
	segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company is determined that it has one
	operating segment as of December 31, 2016.




	 






	Income Taxes




	The Company accounts for its income taxes under the provisions of
	ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” The method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740 is an asset and liability method.
	The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences
	of temporary differences between tax bases and financial reporting bases of other assets and liabilities


	.






	 






	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	The Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements
	to determine their applicability to the Company. Where it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the Company’s
	financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequence of the change to its financial statements and
	assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company’s financials properly reflect the change. The
	Company currently does not have any recent accounting pronouncements that they are studying and feel may be applicable.




	 




	Research and Product Development











	56










	 






	 




	Research and product development expenses are charged to operations
	as incurred. For internally developed patents, all costs incurred to the point when a patent application is to be filed are expended
	as incurred as research and development expense. Patent application costs, generally legal costs, are expensed as research and
	development costs until such time as the future economic benefits of such patents become more certain.


	 


	Since March 12, 2015 (Inception) thru December 31, 2016 the company

	Note 3. Income Taxes




	 



	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually
	for differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts
	in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable
	income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
	Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets
	and liabilities.


	 


	 


	The effective tax rate on the net loss before
	income taxes differs from the U.S. statutory rate as follows:

	and 740-10-30, formerly FIN 48, and “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”. The Company had no material unrecognized
	income tax assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2016.


	 


	The Company’s policy regarding income tax interest and penalties
	is to expense those items as general and administrative expense but to identify them for tax purposes. During the period March
	12, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2016, there were no income tax, or related interest and penalty items in the income statement,
	or liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and Nevada state jurisdiction.
	We are not currently involved in any income tax examinations.

	Note 4. Related Party Transactions





	The Company entered into an employment agreement with Robert Smith,
	the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer and chairman of the board of directors, effective March 12, 2015. The employment
	agreement has no specific term and constitutes at will employment. Mr. Smith current annual base salary is $72,000 although his
	annual base salary will increase to $150,000 immediately following the initial public offering, and he is eligible for up to five
	annual cash bonuses of unto $30,000 each (one each with respect to our fiscal quarters and one with respect to our fiscal year)
	based upon achievement of performance based objectives established by our board of directors. In the second quarter of 2015, our
	Board of Directors discussed and approved a request by our CEO to reduce his base salary to $0 per year, effective March 12, 2015
	through December 31, 2015.


	 


	In the fourth quarter of 2016, our Board of Directors discussed
	and approved a request by our CEO to defer his base salary of $72,000 from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016.


	 


	 




	Stock Options:




	 


	Pursuant to Mr. Smith’s employment agreement, he was granted
	a ten-year option to purchase 2,500,000 shares of common stock on March 12, 2015. Mr. Smith’s employment agreement also
	provides that upon the consummation of our initial public offering he will receive an additional option award, so that together with
	Mr. Smith’s options award the two option awards combined represent six percent (6%) of the Company’s outstanding
	shares on a fully-diluted basis. Mr. Smith did not exercise any of the stock options during the year of 2015.


	 


	On January 4, 2016 The undersigned, being all of the members of
	the Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”) of Voice Life, Inc.., a Nevada corporation (the "Corporation"),

	WHEREAS, Option holder has decided to voluntarily consent
	to this Agreement and the cancellation of the Option subject to the terms described Stock Option Cancellation Agreement  


	 


	See Exhibit 10.10 Stock Option Cancellation Agreement


	 


	On March 12, 2015 the Company issued 5,000,000 of its authorized
	common stock to Robert Smith for $500. For which he paid $100 and $400 were receivables from him, subsequently the company incurred
	many startup costs for $8,624, which were paid by Robert Smith from his personal account. So, the company has a net payable to
	Robert Smith $8,624 as on December 31, 2015.


	 


	On September 6, 2016, the Company issued an additional 20,000,000
	shares of its common stock at a price of approximately $.0001 per share to Robert Smith, the Company’s founder and President/CEO
	and its Chief Technology Officer for aggregate proceeds of $2,000


	 


	During the period from March 12, 2015 (inception) to December 31,
	2015, Robert Smith has advanced the Company a total of $8,624 to cover costs related to the organization and development of the
	company. The advances are considered temporary in nature and this has been formalized by a promissory note. There is no formal
	written commitment for continued support by Mr. Smith.


	 


	The loan of $8,624 advanced to the Company by Mr. Smith is unsecured,
	non-interest bearing, and will become due and payable upon demand from the lender. Proceeds raised in this offering will be used
	to repay some or all of this related party advance. As of December 31, 2016 the company has paid $8,624 and the company has paid-off
	the in full loan with the remaining balance $0.00

	$575 was received from shareholder Robert Smith ($400.00 for the
	common stock and Robert Smith paid $175 for credit card transaction fee or the purchase of Preferred Series Stock and was deducted
	from the related party advanced loan.

	The Company entered into an employment agreement with Robert Smith,
	the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer and chairman of the board of directors, effective March 12, 2015. The employment
	agreement has no specific term and constitutes at will employment. Mr. Smith current annual base salary is $72,000 although his

	approved a request by our CEO to reduce Mr. Smith’s base salary in 2015 from $72,000 to $0 effective dates from March 12,
	2015 through December 31, 2015. The reason being to conserve cash and better align the interest of management and out stockholders,
	we emphasize long-term performance-based equity compensation over base annual salaries.


	 


	In the fourth quarter of 2016, our Board of Directors discussed
	and approved a request by our CEO to defer his base salary of $72,000 from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016.


	 



	 




	Note 7 – Net Income Per Share




	 



	Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available
	to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
	per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding
	during the period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of the conversion
	of the Company’s convertible notes and warrants (using the if-converted method). The computation of basic loss per share
	for the period ended December 31, 2016. As a result, the computations of net loss per share for each period presented is the same
	for both basic and fully diluted. The following table sets forth the information used to compute basic and diluted net income per
	share attributable to Voice Life Inc. for the period March 12, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2016:

	Pursuant to Mr. Smith’s employment agreement, he was
	granted a ten-year option to purchase 2,500,000 shares of common stock on March 12, 2015. Mr. Smith’s employment agreement
	also provides that upon the consummation of our initial public offering he will receive an additional option award, so that

	On January 4, 2016 The undersigned, being all of the members

	acting in accordance with Section 78.315 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, hereby consent to the adoption of the following resolutions:

	Preferred Stock



	 


	In July 2015, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation
	to authorize 10,000,000 shares of preferred series stock of which 1,000,000 were designated Preferred B Series at a cost of .5000
	per share, 250,000 designated as Preferred C Series at a cost of .5250 per share, 250,000 was designated Preferred D Series at
	a cost of .5350 per share. In June of 2016, 8.500,000 were designated as Preferred A Series at a cost of .15. As of December 31,
	2016 Preferred Series Shares issued were 450,015 with 9,549,985 outstanding.


	 


	Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Company’s Amended
	and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Restated Certificate”) or as required under the General Corporation
	Law of the State of Nevada, the “Preferred Series” shall have no voting rights


	 


	Each share of “Preferred Series” will automatically
	convert into Common Stock upon effectiveness and/or upon the closing of a firmly underwritten public offering of Common Stock.



	 



	These transactions are not registered under the Securities Act in reliance on an exemption from registration
	set forth in Section 4(2) thereof and Regulation D promulgated thereunder as a transaction by the Registrant not involving















	60










	 









	 







	any public offering, in which the Company cannot use general solicitation
	or advertising; the Company must limit its sale to “non-accredited investors” and may not sell to non-sophisticated
	investors; and the Company has provided these investors with the necessary disclosures.


	 



	Note 8–

	Non-Employee Equity Compensation Plan






	 




	The Company did not recognize any Non-Employee stock-based compensation.


	 


	Related to this plan the FASB has issued ASU
	No. 2014-12, Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments when the terms of an Award
	Provide that a Performance Target could be achieved after the requisite service period. This ASU requires that a performance target
	that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. As
	such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant date fair value of the award. This update further
	clarifies that compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will
	be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already
	been rendered. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods. The
	Company sometime in the future will elect to adopt this ASU effective and its adoption is not expected to have a material effect.


	 


	Under this plan the Company will compute the
	fair value of any options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Option forfeitures are estimated at the time of
	valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period. This estimate will be adjusted periodically based on the extent to
	which actual option forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate, when it is material. The expected
	term used for options issued to non-employees is the contractual life and the expected term used for options issued to employees
	is the estimated period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The Company utilizes the “simplified”
	method to develop an estimate of the expected term of “plain vanilla” employee option grants.


	 



	 




	Note 9. –Going Concern and Management Plans




	 



	The Company opened up its bank account on April 24, 2015. As of
	December 31, 2016, the Company’s cash on hand was $19,440 The Company has not generated revenues since its inception and
	has incurred net losses of $105,550 for the period March 12, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016,
	the Company plans on meeting its current liquidity requirements principally through the private placement of Preferred Series Shares.


	 


	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital surplus
	of 19,440 and a stockholders surplus of $19,440.


	 


	The Company expects that the cash raised from its Preferred Series
	offering and with convertible Preferred Series Stock will fund its operations only until December 2017. The Company intends to
	raise additional capital through its initial public offering (“IPO”), and will fund its operations only until September
	2018 though there is no assurance that it will be able to do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, the Company
	may have to curtail its research and development efforts, delay repayments of its Convertible Notes, delay payments to vendors,
	and/or initiate cost reductions, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition
	and results of operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
	The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue
	as a going concern.


	 



	Note 10–Subsequent Events



	The Company evaluates events that have occurred after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2016, through
	the date, which the financial statements were available to be issued.

	As
	part of our commercialization efforts, in January 2017, the company executed a partnership with NVidia. We are using NVidia assit
	in development of our reference design products subsequent event does not required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.

	ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND
	OFFICERS

	.


	 


	The Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws
	of our Company provide that our Company will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by the Nevada Revised Statutes, each person
	who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of our Company, or who serves or served any other enterprise or organization
	at the request of our Company. Pursuant to Nevada law, this includes elimination of liability for monetary damages for breach of
	the directors’ fiduciary duty of care to our Company and its stockholders. These provisions do not eliminate the directors’
	duty of care and, in appropriate circumstances, equitable remedies such as injunctive or other forms of non-monetary relief will
	remain available under Nevada law. In addition, each director will continue to be subject to liability for breach of the director’s
	duty of loyalty to our Company, for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct, for knowing violations
	of law, for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit, and for payment of dividends or approval
	of stock repurchases or redemptions that are unlawful under Nevada law. The provision also does not affect a director’s responsibilities
	under any other laws, such as the federal securities laws or state or federal environmental laws.


	 


	We have entered into an agreement with Mr.
	Smith that requires us to indemnify him against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably
	incurred (including expenses of a derivative action) in connection with any proceeding, whether actual or threatened, to which
	he may be made a party by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of our Company or any of our affiliated enterprises.







	62










	 






	 


	We do not maintain any policy of directors’
	and officers’ liability insurance that insures its directors and officers against the cost of defense, settlement or payment
	of a judgment under any circumstances.

	Item 17. UNDERTAKINGS



	 


	The undersigned Registrant
	hereby undertakes:


	 


	(a)(1) To file, during
	any period in which offers or sales of securities are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement to:


	 


	(i) 	Include any
	prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;


	 


	(ii) 	To reflect
	in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective
	amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the
	registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar
	value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated
	maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (§230.424(b)
	of this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate
	offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement.


	 


	(iii) 	To include
	any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any
	material change to such information in the registration statement;


	 


	(2) That, for the
	purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be
	a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall
	be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.


	 


	(3) To remove from
	registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination
	of the offering.


	 


	(4) That, for the
	purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:


	 


	(i) 	If the registrant
	is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering,
	other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed
	to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however,
	that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document
	incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration
	statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that
	was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately
	prior to such date of first use.


	 


	(5)
	That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial
	distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned
	registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method







	65










	 






	used
	to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following
	communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities
	to such purchaser:


	 


	(i) 	Any preliminary
	prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;


	 


	(ii) 	Any free
	writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the
	undersigned registrant;


	 


	(iii) 	The portion
	of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant
	or our securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and


	 


	(iv) 	Any other
	communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.


	 


	Insofar as indemnification
	for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”) may be permitted to our directors, officer and
	controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification
	is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that
	a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors,
	officer, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors,
	officer, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel
	the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification
	is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	Assurances







	 




	7.1


	 



	Assistance.

	Assignor
	will take all action and execute all documents as Assignee may reasonably request to effectuate the transfer of the Assigned
	Property and the vesting of complete and exclusive ownership of the Assigned Property in Assignee. In addition, Assignor
	will, at the request and sole cost and expense of Assignee, but


	without

	additional
	compensation, promptly sign, execute, make, and do all such deeds, documents, acts, and things as Assignee may reasonably

	to apply for, obtain, register, maintain and vest in the name of Assignee alone (unless Assignee
	otherwise directs) Intellectual Property Rights protection relating to any or all of the Assigned Property in any country throughout
	the world, and when so obtained or vested, to renew and restore the


	same;

	(c)


	  


	to assist Assignee with the defense and enforcement of its rights in any registrations issuing
	from such applications and in all Intellectual Property Rights protection in the Intellectual


	Property.



	 



	7.2


	 



	Power of Attorney.

	If at any time Assignee is unable, for any reason, to secure Assignor’s
	signature on any letters patent, copyright, or trademark assignments or applications for registrations, or other documents or filings
	pertaining to any or all of the Assigned Property, whether because of Assignor’s unwillingness, or for any other reason whatsoever,
