Richard Sheppard Arnold (March 26, 1936 – September 23, 2004) was a judge of the U.S. District Court and then the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Two presidents, Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton, considered naming Arnold to the United States Supreme Court. Polly Price, a former Arnold law clerk and an Emory University law professor who has written a biography of Arnold, said that the judge will be remembered like the great jurist Learned Hand: "perhaps the best judge never to serve on the Supreme Court." In May 2002, the U.S. Courthouse in Little Rock was renamed in Judge Arnold's honor.
President Jimmy Carter nominated Arnold, a fellow Democrat, to the District Court of both the Eastern and Western districts of Arkansas on August 14, 1978. Barely a year later, on December 19, 1979, Carter named Arnold to a new position on the appeals court headquartered in St. Louis—a seat to which he previously had very publicly considered nominating law school professor Joan Krauskopf but eventually opted not to proceed with because of Krauskopf's "not qualified" rating from the American Bar Association.[1] Arnold was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 20, 1980.[2]
The U.S. Senate confirmed Arnold to the Eighth Circuit on February 20, 1980. Arnold maintained his chambers in Little Rock. He served as Chief Judge of the Eighth Circuit from 1992 to 1998. He assumed senior status on April 1, 2001, which allowed him to lighten his workload and to concentrate in detail on fewer cases. During his last twelve years on the court, he served with his younger brother, Judge Morris S. "Buzz" Arnold, a Republican appointed by President George Herbert Walker Bush.

Early years, family, education[edit]
Arnold was born in Texarkana, Arkansas, the son of Richard Lewis Arnold, a specialist in public utilities law. All the men on both sides of his family were lawyers. His grandfather, William H. Arnold, Sr., practiced law in Texarkana and was a circuit judge and an Arkansas Bar Association president. Arnold's uncle, William H. Arnold, Jr. (died 1977), was a Rhodes Scholar and the leading expert on oil and gas in Arkansas.
Arnold's maternal grandfather was Democratic U.S. Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas, who served from 1913 until his death in office. Morris Sheppard was also the grandfather of former U.S. Senator Connie Mack, III, a Florida Republican banker. Arnold said that he "never really considered being anything else but a lawyer."
Arnold completed the Classical Studies program at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire in 1953. He then attended Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he majored in Latin and Greek, was president of the Yale Debating Association, a member of the Elizabethan Club, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He graduated summa cum laude first in his class in 1957. He received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1960, again graduating first in his class, just ahead of another prominent jurist, Antonin Scalia.
Arnold married the former Gale Hussman of Camden in 1958, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1975. Gale's father was the Arkansas publisher and mass media mogul Walter E. Hussman, Sr., the granddaughter of another publisher, Clyde E. Palmer, and the sister of a third, Walter E. Hussman, Jr., of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Arnold had two daughters by Gale: Janet Sheppard Arnold Hart of San Carlos, California, and Lydia Palmer Arnold of Syracuse, New York. Both daughters went on to become lawyers. Ms. Arnold formerly was an adjunct professor at Syracuse University College of Law. His daughters each had two children: Evan Antonio Hart and Saxon McGrath Hart, both of San Carlos, California, and Lucile Mae Turnipseed and Grace Arnold Turnipseed, both of Syracuse, New York. Arnold's daughters and grandchildren all survived him. In 1979, he married the former Kay Kelley, who also survived him.
Arnold was also general counsel for his first father-in-law's Palmer Media Group, which in 1973 became WEHCO Media, Inc., the corporate owner of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. He provided advice on libel law, contracts for new presses, and cable television franchise renewals.
Lawyer in Washington and Texarkana[edit]
Arnold clerked for Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, from 1960-1961. He once told a friend that while he admired Brennan, he disagreed with many of Brennan's interpretations of the United States Constitution. Arnold joined the law practice of Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C., from 1961 to 1964. He also taught part-time at the University of Virginia Law School. He then became a partner in his family-owned Arnold & Arnold firm in Texarkana, Arkansas, from 1964 to 1973. He was a delegate to the seventh Arkansas Constitutional Convention from 1969 to 1970.
Political campaigns[edit]
Twice he ran unsuccessfully in the critical Democratic primary for the United States House of Representatives. He lost in 1966 to David Pryor of Camden for the Fourth Congressional District seat vacated by then newly appointed U.S. District Judge Oren Harris. Pryor then won the House seat in the general election against the Republican A. Lynn Lowe, a Texarkana farmer also born in 1936. In 1968, Arnold was a delegate to the tumultuous Democratic National Convention, which met in Chicago to assemble the Humphrey-Muskie ticket, the first Democratic team to lose the electoral votes of Arkansas since Reconstruction, having been defeated by George Wallace's then American Independent Party. Arnold was beaten again in the 1972 congressional primary by then Attorney General Ray Thornton, of Sheridan in Grant County.
In 1973, Arnold became legislative secretary to Governor Dale Bumpers in Little Rock. In 1975, he became legislative assistant to newly elected U.S. Senator Bumpers in Washington. He remained on Bumpers's staff until 1978.
Consideration for the Supreme Court[edit]
Arnold was considered "a principled liberal and an old-fashioned Southern gentleman." He befriended a young Bill Clinton, who later as President, according to Clinton's autobiography "My Life", would have named Arnold to the Supreme Court in 1994 had the jurist not been diagnosed with lymphoma. Jeffrey Toobin also wrote in "The Nine" (at p. 79) of "Clinton ... weeping when he" told Arnold "he wasn't going to appoint him" because of Arnold's health.
Justice Robert L. Brown of the Arkansas Supreme Court, another long-time friend, said that he knew no one "who is held in higher esteem. As we all know, he should've been appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. I'm sorry that did not happen. He was the man for the job."
Arnold had first been suggested for the seat in 1970 when former opponent Pryor, who later described himself as a "very, very close friend" of Arnold's, wrote a letter to President Nixon, who was looking for a Southerner to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. Nixon went with the failed Harrold Carswell nomination instead.
Arnold's judicial temperament[edit]
Attorney Mark Arnold (not related to Judge Arnold) of the Husch Blackwell Sanders firm in St. Louis called him "the best judge I ever saw -- brilliant mind and yet as pragmatic and as down to earth a man as you would ever find. And yet, as good a judge as he was, he was an even better person -- modest, unassuming, a man of principle and conviction, yet always open-minded and willing to listen." One of Arnold's former law clerks described him as "a brilliant attorney with a self-effacing kindness and affability unlike any I have ever seen."
Arnold was a member of a plethora of professional and civic associations. He won many honors, including the Environmental Law Institute Award in 1996, the Edward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award in 1999, and the Lewis F. Powell, Jr., Award, named for the former U.S. Supreme Court justice from Virginia who was appointed by President Nixon in 1971 to replace Justice Hugo L. Black.
The Eighth Circuit hears appeals from federal cases in Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota. In his court tenure, Arnold penned approximately seven hundred written opinions.
In "A Tribute to Chief Judge Richard S. Arnold" in the Minnesota Law Review (Vol. 78, No. 1, 1993), Justice Brennan and Judge Patricia M. Wald were among the jurists who hailed Arnold's judicial record of accomplishment.
Key legal cases[edit]
Arnold participated in several noteworthy cases.
He was integral to the three-judge panel that upheld a lower court ruling which released the Little Rock School District from more than forty years of federal court supervision of its desegregation efforts. Arnold wrote the 22-page opinion.
In one of his most widely known cases, Arnold ruled that the Jaycees, or the Junior Chamber of Commerce, could exclude women as members. He was overturned by the Supreme Court.
Other significant decisions included a strongly worded 1985 opinion in a school desegregation case in which he and other judges on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals at St. Louis held that consolidation was not the answer to de facto segregation in Pulaski County public schools.
Another of Arnold's prominent rulings was a landmark 1989 decision that he authored for a three-judge panel requiring the Arkansas Board of Apportionment to create super-majority districts to ensure that voters in the Mississippi Delta would elect some African American state legislators. In 1990, when Bill Clinton won his last term as governor, Arkansas voters set precedent by electing blacks to one position in the Arkansas State Senate and ten of the one hundred seats in the Arkansas House of Representatives.
Arnold was considered neither liberal nor conservative on the bench, with his decisionmaking stemming from the facts of the case. However, he was a member of the American Civil Liberties Union. He worked in one case to secure religious liberties for a Black Muslim in prison. Judge Morris Arnold said that his older brother had a "sense of balance and fairness. He never had an apparent ideological ax to grind."
Arnold was not a fan of unpublished opinions. He wrote in Anastasoff v. United States that unpublished opinions were still precedent that had to be relied on by other judges.
Arnold's legacy[edit]
Arnold, who was known for his trademark bow ties, died from an infection which developed during treatment for lymphoma at the Rochester Methodist Hospital in Rochester, Minnesota. Though he had been ill prior to his death, he had remained active on the bench.
Morris Arnold said that what stood out about his brother was the "consistently high-quality work he has done. He was second to none in the country. I mean that literally."
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas described Arnold as "a brilliant, brilliant man. . . a model of humility and self-deprecation." Another justice, Antonin Scalia, said that Arnold's "carefully reasoned and beautifully written opinions were models of the art of judging. He has been a friend of mine since the days when he finished ahead of me (and first in the class) at Harvard Law School."
Services for Judge Arnold were held in the Trinity Episcopal Cathedral on West 17th Street in Little Rock. There was a standing-room-only throng in the sanctuary, which seats five hundred.

Richard Sheppard Arnold (March 26, 1936 – September 23, 2004) was a judge of the U.S. District Court and then the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Two presidents, Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton, considered naming Arnold to the United States Supreme Court. Polly Price, a former Arnold law clerk and an Emory University law professor who has written a biography of Arnold, said that the judge will be remembered like the great jurist Learned Hand: "perhaps the best judge never to serve on the Supreme Court." In May 2002, the U.S. Courthouse in Little Rock was renamed in Judge Arnold's honor.
President Jimmy Carter nominated Arnold, a fellow Democrat, to the District Court of both the Eastern and Western districts of Arkansas on August 14, 1978. Barely a year later, on December 19, 1979, Carter named Arnold to a new position on the appeals court headquartered in St. Louis—a seat to which he previously had very publicly considered nominating law school professor Joan Krauskopf but eventually opted not to proceed with because of Krauskopf's "not qualified" rating from the American Bar Association.[1] Arnold was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 20, 1980.[2]
The U.S. Senate confirmed Arnold to the Eighth Circuit on February 20, 1980. Arnold maintained his chambers in Little Rock. He served as Chief Judge of the Eighth Circuit from 1992 to 1998. He assumed senior status on April 1, 2001, which allowed him to lighten his workload and to concentrate in detail on fewer cases. During his last twelve years on the court, he served with his younger brother, Judge Morris S. "Buzz" Arnold, a Republican appointed by President George Herbert Walker Bush.

Early years, family, education[edit]
Arnold was born in Texarkana, Arkansas, the son of Richard Lewis Arnold, a specialist in public utilities law. All the men on both sides of his family were lawyers. His grandfather, William H. Arnold, Sr., practiced law in Texarkana and was a circuit judge and an Arkansas Bar Association president. Arnold's uncle, William H. Arnold, Jr. (died 1977), was a Rhodes Scholar and the leading expert on oil and gas in Arkansas.
Arnold's maternal grandfather was Democratic U.S. Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas, who served from 1913 until his death in office. Morris Sheppard was also the grandfather of former U.S. Senator Connie Mack, III, a Florida Republican banker. Arnold said that he "never really considered being anything else but a lawyer."
Arnold completed the Classical Studies program at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire in 1953. He then attended Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he majored in Latin and Greek, was president of the Yale Debating Association, a member of the Elizabethan Club, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He graduated summa cum laude first in his class in 1957. He received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1960, again graduating first in his class, just ahead of another prominent jurist, Antonin Scalia.
Arnold married the former Gale Hussman of Camden in 1958, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1975. Gale's father was the Arkansas publisher and mass media mogul Walter E. Hussman, Sr., the granddaughter of another publisher, Clyde E. Palmer, and the sister of a third, Walter E. Hussman, Jr., of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Arnold had two daughters by Gale: Janet Sheppard Arnold Hart of San Carlos, California, and Lydia Palmer Arnold of Syracuse, New York. Both daughters went on to become lawyers. Ms. Arnold formerly was an adjunct professor at Syracuse University College of Law. His daughters each had two children: Evan Antonio Hart and Saxon McGrath Hart, both of San Carlos, California, and Lucile Mae Turnipseed and Grace Arnold Turnipseed, both of Syracuse, New York. Arnold's daughters and grandchildren all survived him. In 1979, he married the former Kay Kelley, who also survived him.
Arnold was also general counsel for his first father-in-law's Palmer Media Group, which in 1973 became WEHCO Media, Inc., the corporate owner of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. He provided advice on libel law, contracts for new presses, and cable television franchise renewals.
Lawyer in Washington and Texarkana[edit]
Arnold clerked for Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, from 1960-1961. He once told a friend that while he admired Brennan, he disagreed with many of Brennan's interpretations of the United States Constitution. Arnold joined the law practice of Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C., from 1961 to 1964. He also taught part-time at the University of Virginia Law School. He then became a partner in his family-owned Arnold & Arnold firm in Texarkana, Arkansas, from 1964 to 1973. He was a delegate to the seventh Arkansas Constitutional Convention from 1969 to 1970.
Political campaigns[edit]
Twice he ran unsuccessfully in the critical Democratic primary for the United States House of Representatives. He lost in 1966 to David Pryor of Camden for the Fourth Congressional District seat vacated by then newly appointed U.S. District Judge Oren Harris. Pryor then won the House seat in the general election against the Republican A. Lynn Lowe, a Texarkana farmer also born in 1936. In 1968, Arnold was a delegate to the tumultuous Democratic National Convention, which met in Chicago to assemble the Humphrey-Muskie ticket, the first Democratic team to lose the electoral votes of Arkansas since Reconstruction, having been defeated by George Wallace's then American Independent Party. Arnold was beaten again in the 1972 congressional primary by then Attorney General Ray Thornton, of Sheridan in Grant County.
In 1973, Arnold became legislative secretary to Governor Dale Bumpers in Little Rock. In 1975, he became legislative assistant to newly elected U.S. Senator Bumpers in Washington. He remained on Bumpers's staff until 1978.
Consideration for the Supreme Court[edit]
Arnold was considered "a principled liberal and an old-fashioned Southern gentleman." He befriended a young Bill Clinton, who later as President, according to Clinton's autobiography "My Life", would have named Arnold to the Supreme Court in 1994 had the jurist not been diagnosed with lymphoma. Jeffrey Toobin also wrote in "The Nine" (at p. 79) of "Clinton ... weeping when he" told Arnold "he wasn't going to appoint him" because of Arnold's health.
Justice Robert L. Brown of the Arkansas Supreme Court, another long-time friend, said that he knew no one "who is held in higher esteem. As we all know, he should've been appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. I'm sorry that did not happen. He was the man for the job."
Arnold had first been suggested for the seat in 1970 when former opponent Pryor, who later described himself as a "very, very close friend" of Arnold's, wrote a letter to President Nixon, who was looking for a Southerner to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. Nixon went with the failed Harrold Carswell nomination instead.
Arnold's judicial temperament[edit]
Attorney Mark Arnold (not related to Judge Arnold) of the Husch Blackwell Sanders firm in St. Louis called him "the best judge I ever saw -- brilliant mind and yet as pragmatic and as down to earth a man as you would ever find. And yet, as good a judge as he was, he was an even better person -- modest, unassuming, a man of principle and conviction, yet always open-minded and willing to listen." One of Arnold's former law clerks described him as "a brilliant attorney with a self-effacing kindness and affability unlike any I have ever seen."
Arnold was a member of a plethora of professional and civic associations. He won many honors, including the Environmental Law Institute Award in 1996, the Edward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award in 1999, and the Lewis F. Powell, Jr., Award, named for the former U.S. Supreme Court justice from Virginia who was appointed by President Nixon in 1971 to replace Justice Hugo L. Black.
The Eighth Circuit hears appeals from federal cases in Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota. In his court tenure, Arnold penned approximately seven hundred written opinions.
In "A Tribute to Chief Judge Richard S. Arnold" in the Minnesota Law Review (Vol. 78, No. 1, 1993), Justice Brennan and Judge Patricia M. Wald were among the jurists who hailed Arnold's judicial record of accomplishment.
Key legal cases[edit]
Arnold participated in several noteworthy cases.
He was integral to the three-judge panel that upheld a lower court ruling which released the Little Rock School District from more than forty years of federal court supervision of its desegregation efforts. Arnold wrote the 22-page opinion.
In one of his most widely known cases, Arnold ruled that the Jaycees, or the Junior Chamber of Commerce, could exclude women as members. He was overturned by the Supreme Court.
Other significant decisions included a strongly worded 1985 opinion in a school desegregation case in which he and other judges on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals at St. Louis held that consolidation was not the answer to de facto segregation in Pulaski County public schools.
Another of Arnold's prominent rulings was a landmark 1989 decision that he authored for a three-judge panel requiring the Arkansas Board of Apportionment to create super-majority districts to ensure that voters in the Mississippi Delta would elect some African American state legislators. In 1990, when Bill Clinton won his last term as governor, Arkansas voters set precedent by electing blacks to one position in the Arkansas State Senate and ten of the one hundred seats in the Arkansas House of Representatives.
Arnold was considered neither liberal nor conservative on the bench, with his decisionmaking stemming from the facts of the case. However, he was a member of the American Civil Liberties Union. He worked in one case to secure religious liberties for a Black Muslim in prison. Judge Morris Arnold said that his older brother had a "sense of balance and fairness. He never had an apparent ideological ax to grind."
Arnold was not a fan of unpublished opinions. He wrote in Anastasoff v. United States that unpublished opinions were still precedent that had to be relied on by other judges.
Arnold's legacy[edit]
Arnold, who was known for his trademark bow ties, died from an infection which developed during treatment for lymphoma at the Rochester Methodist Hospital in Rochester, Minnesota. Though he had been ill prior to his death, he had remained active on the bench.
Morris Arnold said that what stood out about his brother was the "consistently high-quality work he has done. He was second to none in the country. I mean that literally."
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas described Arnold as "a brilliant, brilliant man. . . a model of humility and self-deprecation." Another justice, Antonin Scalia, said that Arnold's "carefully reasoned and beautifully written opinions were models of the art of judging. He has been a friend of mine since the days when he finished ahead of me (and first in the class) at Harvard Law School."
Services for Judge Arnold were held in the Trinity Episcopal Cathedral on West 17th Street in Little Rock. There was a standing-room-only throng in the sanctuary, which seats five hundred.

Nashville at law: Eddy Arnold paternity claim raised again
authors  E. Thomas Wood






Aided by new lawyers and a new strategy, the California man who claims to be love child of the late country crooner Eddy Arnold is once again asking a Nashville court for a share of Arnold's estate.Christopher Tanner says Arnold fathered him while in a relationship with his mother in 1960, when she was working as a secretary at a record company. After Arnold passed away in May 2008, Tanner sued to have his body disinterred for DNA testing. Davidson County Probate Judge Randy Kennedy denied that request in January 2009.Tanner's new petition, filed last month in Probate Court and available at this link, names Arnold's grandson and estate executor, Shannon Pollard, as well as daughter Jo Ann Arnold Pollard and son Richard E. Arnold Jr.When he sought the exhumation of Arnold's body, Tanner told the court the determination of his parentage could "only be carried out through genetic testing of the remains" of Arnold. Now, however, he argues that DNA testing of Arnold's son and daughter can prove his paternity claim.The petition seeks to have Arnold's will and associated trust documents declared invalid. It claims that at the time Arnold signed them, in 2006 at the age of 88, his "physical and mental condition had deteriorated" to the point that "he did not know who his children were." It also asserts that the will is "the product of undue influence" by Arnold's Nashville family members.If the will is voided and Tanner is able to establish paternity, he would be entitled to a share of the estate under Tennessee law.While Tanner's prior case was underway, Kennedy granted a request from the family to seal all pleadings and exhibits filed with the court, on the grounds that Arnold deserved "to have his name untainted” by Tanner's assertion if it turned out to be untrue.At the time the file was sealed, attorneys for Arnold's family were trying to compel Tanner to provide copies of his birth certificate and military service records, requests they said he was resisting. The family asserted that these documents would show whether Arnold or someone else had been listed as Tanner's father in official records.Tanner's mother, Arlene Tanner-Glynn, has said publicly since the early 1990s that Arnold was the father of her child. She says he never denied being the father and that she unsuccessfully asked him to submit to paternity testing. Arnold's heirs say he told family members the parentage claim was not accurate.Bringing Tanner's claim to court are Weldon Patterson of the Knoxville office of Spicer Rudstrom, with co-counsel Zachary Gottesman and Joshua Goode of Cincinnati. Murfreesboro attorneys J.D. Kious and Brock East represented him in his earlier effort."The family vehemently denies each and every allegation" of the new petition, said Marlene Eskind Moses of Nashville's Moses & Townsend firm, representing the Arnold estate. "The prior lawsuit was unsuccessful," she said, "and this current one is totally without merit as well." Other legal news of late: United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals Tawana Wilson v. Boyce Wilkins. Opinion filed Jan. 19. A three-judge appellate panel upholds a lower-court finding that former Metro Police Officer Wilkins is not automatically immune from being sued over his conduct toward a woman who leapt out of the front seat of his squad car, fearing he would rape her. The incident took place on December 28, 2006. Police came to the Old Matthews Road home of Wilson and her husband while they were having a domestic dispute, and Wilkins offered Wilson a ride to the Criminal  Justice Center so she could swear out a warrant. The officer drove past two cross-streets that would have led downtown and then turned onto Brick Church Pike, headed due north, away from downtown. During the drive, the opinion states, he "rubbed and caressed Wilson's hand three times, looked at her seductively, told her she was beautiful, and said he wanted to date her." When the car slowed, Wilson jumped out and ran toward the EconoLodge motel on Brick Church, screaming at the top of her lungs. She says she damaged her vocal chords in the process and claims the touching by Wilkins constituted assault. Wilkins, who had been on the force since 1997, was "decommissioned" after the incident and ultimately resigned while "not in good standing with disciplinary action pending," according to Metro Police spokesman Don Aaron. The litigation now returns to District Court for further proceedings. Plaintiff's attorney: August Carl Winter of Brentwood. Defendant's attorney: John M. L. Brown of Nashville. United States District Court United States of America v. 600 44-pound poly mesh bags of rice et al., in re Won Feng Trading Inc. Consent decree entered Jan. 26. A Nashville Asian-foods restaurant supplier agrees to strict monitoring by the Food and Drug Administration after federal agents raided its Eugenia Ave. warehouse on Jan. 6 and impounded a large amount of vermin-infested goods. Inspectors had found what they termed "an active and widespread rodent infestation in the building, including live and dead rodents, rodent hair, rodent nesting material, evidence of rodent-gnawed food, and rodent urine," as well as other forms of contamination. The order requires Won Feng to put up a $426,000 bond to guarantee it will carry out the destruction or reconditioning of food and cooking equipment at the warehouse. If it fails to bring the facility into compliance within 60 days, it could be forced to forfeit the cash. The company also must pay back the government for the man-hours investigators put into monitoring its compliance, at rates ranging from $88 to $105 an hour. "We'd like to be able to have something positive come out of this," said Mark Reagan of Robinson, Reagan & Young in Nashville, counsel to Won Feng. "We have been working very closely with the U.S. Attorney's office to address the situation. Won Feng has made both internal and external policy changes, including replacing some of its third-party vendors." House of Bryant Publications LLC v. A&E Television Networks. Dismissal order filed Jan. 21. The end is near in a dispute over A&E's unauthorized usage of University of Tennessee sports anthem "Rocky Top" in a true-crime documentary. Judge Aleta Trauger's order says the parties have reached a settlement and must file papers to close the case within 20 days. Neither side responded to queries last week seeking details. In October, Trauger turned aside A&E's argument that the case should be dismissed because its incorporation of a 12-second snippet from the song constituted "fair use," as defined in copyright law. The parties later entered mediation.Plaintiff's attorney: Richard S. Busch, King & Ballow, Nashville. Defendant's attorney: Robb S. Harvey of Waller, Lansden, Dortch & Davis in Nashville.

                The history of Israel is a much-debated topic in Old Testament studies. On one side are minimalists who find little of historical value in the Hebrew Bible. On the other side are those who assume the biblical text is a precise historical record. Many serious students of the Bible find themselves between these two positions and would benefit from a careful exploration of issues in Israelite history.

 This substantive history of Israel textbook values the Bible's historical contribution without overlooking critical issues and challenges. Featuring the latest scholarship, the book introduces students to the current state of research on issues relevant to the study of ancient Israel. The editors and contributors, all top biblical scholars and historians, discuss historical evidence in a readable manner, using both canonical and chronological lenses to explore Israelite history.

 Illustrative items, such as maps and images, visually support the book's content. Tables and sidebars are also included.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
