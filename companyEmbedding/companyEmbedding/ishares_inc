1 Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed their active mutual fund peers by 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157) and 79.9% (1330/1515) over the 1, 3 and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Review the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds for more information.2 BlackRock, as of 6/30/17. Based on 826 ETFs and $1.53 trillion in assets under management globally.






 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Investment comparisons are for illustrative purposes only. To better understand the similarities and differences between investments, including investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, it is important to read the products' prospectuses.






The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

START









Build a strong core portfolio
Answer 5 quick questions to start.













Question 1
What do you consider your investment style to be?

Conservative
Moderate
Aggressive





Consider risk versus return


Your comfort with risk can depend on your previous investment experience, performance goals, time horizon, and net worth. In general, the higher return you want, the greater risk you'll have to take.

Question 1 of 5





Question 2
If the market sees a big downward swing how would you react?

Do nothing
Invest more



Sell some investments
Sell everything


Pause and reflect


Your risk tolerance is key to deciding on your overall portfolio mix. So even when you know that markets constantly move up and down, you should carefully consider these peaks and valleys - and how much of your total investment you're really willing to risk on a possible long-term downturn.

If the market sees a big upward swing how would you react?

Do nothing
Invest more



Sell some investments
Sell everything


Think of the future


Keeping in mind the constant movement of markets, now consider what you would do in an up market. You should take into consideration not just current gains, but also your long-term financial goals.

Question 4 of 5





Question 5
How much would your initial investment be?







Why does the amount matter?


As your portfolio increases in size you can incorporate a larger number of funds to further diversify your portfolio and access more targeted exposures.




Laying the foundation


No matter how much you have to invest, a well-diversified core can help reduce your overall risk long-term. You can use iShares Core Funds as the essential building blocks of your portfolio and add on other kinds of investments to customize for your specific goals.

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares ETF and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.






Investment in a fund of funds is subject to the risks and expenses of the underlying funds.






Diversification and asset allocation may not protect against market risk or loss of principal.






Buying and selling shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions.

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.


          Research is provided for informational purposes only, does not constitute advice or guidance, nor is it an endorsement or recommendation for any particular security or trading strategy. Research is provided by independent companies not affiliated with Fidelity. Please determine which security, product, or service is right for you based on your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Be sure to review your decisions periodically to make sure they are still consistent with your goals.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.






Performance shown may reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the investment advisor to the fund for some or all of the periods shown. Performance would have been lower without such waivers. Certain funds may have contractual or voluntary fee waivers that result in a Net Expense Ratio. Click on the fund names above for more information.

Video: What is smart beta?











View transcript


Smart beta is one of the fastest growing categories in the industry today; you can hardly open a newspaper without reading a headline about it. But what is smart beta?
Well… let’s ask google.
What is smart beta? There’s 71 million search results but the #1 result is from the Financial Times and it says, “Smart beta is a rather elusive concept in modern finance”.
Is smart beta really elusive?
Well, it is to some, and that’s why we’re here today, to try to talk about the basics of smart beta and dispel some of the confusion. Smart beta seeks to enhance returns, improve diversification, and reduce risk for investors. It’s really a combination of what we think of as active and passive investing.
It’s active in that it aims to outperform a cap weighted index after taking into consideration risk, return and cost. But it’s passive in that implementation is transparent and based on pre-set rules. Ideally those rules are objective enough that you can write them down and give them to somebody else to implement. It often comes in the form of an ETF or an index fund, and smart beta strategies capture many of the themes that have historically been present in traditional active strategies, but usually at a much lower fee.
How does smart beta do that?
Well, to answer that question we have to understand “factors”.
Factors are investment characteristics that help explain the risk and return behavior of a security. For example, stocks in the same industry tend to move together. Or bonds with a similar maturity would tend to move together. You might think of it as the DNA of a stock or a bond. So just like your DNA might govern your stubborn streak or the color of your eyes a stocks DNA its factors help explain a lot about its behavior. Now some, but not all factors have historically had a positive and persistent return over the long term and those are the ones we are most interested in. Smart beta ideas are also well understood by the marketplace.
Let’s look at value.
And I’m going to ask google. (Sara googles value) So the definition of value from the Webster’s dictionary is something that can be bought at a low or a fair price and put in an investment context what that means is that less expensive securities have historically outperformed their more expensive peers. So over the long-term, investors are rewarded for holding those lower profile potentially riskier names.
So Smart Beta strategies try to target those ideas that are value creating, well understood, persistent and diversifying over time.
Now, many of these concepts are not new ideas like value or quality have long puttered the stock selection framework for active managers. But what is new, is the idea that we can capture them with consistency and inexpensively in a passively oriented portfolio.
And that is a pretty powerful idea. So there you have it. Smart Beta. It’s a smart way of thinking about investing beyond traditional active and passive.

1 Published research showing the historical outperformance of these factors includes:– Value: J. Lakonishok, A. Shleifer, R. Vishny, “Contrarian Investment, Extrapolation, and Risk.” Journal of Finance, 1994.– Momentum: N. Jegadeesh and S. Titman, “Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers: Implications for Stock Market Efficiency.” Journal of Finance, 1993.– Quality: R. Sloan, “Do Stock Prices Fully Reflect Information in Accruals and Cash Flows About Future Earnings.” Accounting Review, 1996.– Low volatility: R. Clarke, H. Silva and S. Thorley, ”Minimum-Variance Portfolios in the U. S. Equity Market,” Journal of Portfolio Management, 2006.2 iShares Index Funds seek to track the investment results of their underlying benchmark, less fees and expenses. Tracking error is a measure of how closely a Fund follows the index to which it is benchmarked. Over a three year period, as of 6/30/2016, 71% of global iShares Funds were within 25 bps and 88% were within 50 bps of their benchmarks, based on the Net Asset Value of the Funds. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.






 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.






The iShares Minimum Volatility ETFs may experience more than minimum volatility as there is no guarantee that the underlying index's strategy of seeking to lower volatility will be successful.






There can be no assurance that performance will be enhanced or risk will be reduced for funds that seek to provide exposure to certain quantitative investment characteristics ("factors"). Exposure to such investment factors may detract from performance in some market environments, perhaps for extended periods. In such circumstances, a fund may seek to maintain exposure to the targeted investment factors and not adjust to target different factors, which could result in losses.

12m Trailing Yield
The yield an investor would have received if they had held the fund over the last twelve months assuming the most recent NAV.

Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


The Fund is actively managed and does not seek to replicate the performance of a specified index. The Fund may have a higher portfolio turnover than funds that seek to replicate the performance of an index.


Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.


Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher-rated securities.


The Fund's use of derivatives may reduce the Fund's returns and/or increase volatility and subject the Fund to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. The Fund could suffer losses related to its derivative positions because of a possible lack of liquidity in the secondary market and as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. There can be no assurance that the Fund's hedging transactions will be effective.


Performance shown reflects fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the investment advisor to the fund for some or all of the periods shown. Performance would have been lower without such waivers.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Understanding Investments in the Mortgage Market: TBAs and Cash Collateral: TBA (To Be Announced) contracts are standardized contracts for future delivery, in which the exact mortgage pools to be delivered are not specified until a few days prior to settlement. These forward contracts typically represent the most liquid portion of the mortgage market. They are derived from new mortgage pools with specific delivery dates and coupons but without specific pool numbers and number of pools. These forward contracts are fully collateralized. The collateral may be invested in short term instruments. The extent of a portfolio's investment in such short term instruments would be proportionate to its investment in TBAs.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

The iShares Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF is actively managed, broad USD bond fund that seeks to achieve equal portfolio interest rate risk and credit risk. The fund takes short positions in Treasury futures at times.
  
INC FactSet Analytics Insight
All fixed income investors face two risk and return factors: Interest rate risk and credit risk. In an attempt to balance these two risks and provide better risk-adjusted returns, INC uses a model to build a portfolio that carries roughly the same duration risk and credit spread exposure. In theory, by having equal exposure to both factors, INC should perform fairly well in most interest rate and credit spread scenarios except when both rates rise and spreads widen. The fund is largely driven by quantitative models and rules, but is technically active since it does not track an index. Despite its unique exposure and duration hedged overlays, INC comes at a reasonable cost. Stay tuned for further analysis in June 2015.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
