Electronic Disclosures and Agreement
Electronic Delivery of Residential Mortgage Loan Application Disclosures
Definitions
"We," "our," "us," or "the Bank" means Bankwell Bank (hereinafter "Bank").

"You" and "your" refers to the loan applicant(s) or borrower(s) authorized by the Bank to receive electronic disclosures or notices under this Agreement.


"Residential Mortgage Loan Application Disclosures" means disclosures or notices that we send to you in electronic form pursuant to this Agreement, including disclosures required to be sent when applying for the loan, as well as disclosures or notices after the application has been submitted to us.


By applying to the Bank for a residential mortgage loan application online, you will confirm that you understand, accept, and have received this Agreement and all its terms and conditions and acknowledge and have demonstrated that you can access this Agreement and other disclosures on our Website.  You also agree to permit us to provide disclosures and notices relative to your residential mortgage loan application or account(s) at the Bank, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to you in electronic form, instead of providing such notices and disclosures in printed form.


Your consent and agreement shall relate to all forms of disclosures and notices, to the extent permitted by applicable law, required under applicable law and shall remain valid until such time as you exercise your right to revoke this consent.  You elect and authorize us, in our discretion, to electronically deliver application disclosures and other loan disclosures and notices that we are required to provide to you under applicable Federal and State laws and regulations, as amended from time to time.


Other Federal and State laws and regulations may be enacted or amended in the future to provide for electronic delivery of such disclosures and notices.  Your election also authorizes us, in our discretion, to provide electronic delivery of such disclosures and notices pursuant to these laws after they become effective.

Terms and Conditions of Your Electronic Disclosures and Agreement

By entering into this Agreement, you accept, on your behalf and on behalf of all joint applicants or borrowers all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.  Please read this Agreement carefully.


This Agreement is subject to applicable Federal laws and the laws of the State of Connecticut.  If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable according to its terms, all remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.  The headings in this Agreement are for convenience or reference only and will not govern the interpretation of the provisions of this Agreement.  Any waiver (express or implied) by either party of any default or breach of this Agreement must be in writing and shall not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach.  You may not assign this Agreement.  This Agreement is binding upon your heirs and the Bank’s successors and assigns.  Certain of the obligations of the parties pursuant to this Agreement that by their nature would continue beyond the termination, cancellation, or expiration of this Agreement shall survive termination, cancellation, or expiration of this Agreement.

Consent to Electronic Delivery of Disclosures

You have the right to receive certain disclosures at the time of application in a form that you may keep.  By entering into this Agreement, you understand that the Bank will provide you with certain disclosures only in electronic form on the Online Mortgage Application Website.  You may access the Website to obtain, review, print, and otherwise copy or download those disclosures.  You agree that any communication provided to you pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and any future disclosures required by law, may be made electronically via e-mail notice with instructions and Website links, or via an email with attached disclosures.  We will send all notices, attachments, and/or documents via email to the last known email address provided by you.


You understand that if you decide in the future that you would like to receive printed disclosures in the mail instead of receiving or obtaining disclosures or notices electronically, you agree to notify the Bank in person, via telephone, or via U. S. Mail.  Our telephone number and postal mail address are:  203-972-3838; Bankwell Bank, Attention:  Residential Mortgage Department, 208 Elm Street, New Canaan, CT 06840.

Notice of Change of Information

You agree to notify us promptly in writing (by letter sent via U. S. Mail) or by calling us at 203-972-3838 of any change in your email address.  If you have not notified us in writing or by telephone of any change of your email address, you agree that your failure to provide us with a valid email address is the lack of ordinary care on your part.  If we become aware that you are not receiving email, we will send all notices, attachments, or documents to you via U. S. Mail to your last address known to us.

Hardware and Software Requirements

We recommend Internet Explorer 8 or higher, but can support any browser with 128-bit encryption capabilities (i.e., Firefox 3.x).  To access, download, and print electronic disclosures or notices that we provide to you, you need to have a personal computer with Internet and email access.  You must also have Adobe Acrobat Reader 8.0 or higher.  To download a free copy of Adobe Acrobat Reader, please go to http://www.adobe.com.

Demonstrable Consent

You are required to successfully open this Agreement and the other disclosures or notices that we provide to you electronically.  If you cannot successfully open the documents, please contact us at 203-972-3838.  Otherwise, by continuing to apply for the residential mortgage loan online, you are confirming that you have been able to open the applicable disclosures or notices.

Withdrawing Your Consent

You may withdraw your consent to receive electronic disclosures or notices by notifying us at the telephone number or address listed in the "Consent to Electronic Delivery of Disclosures" section above.  After you withdraw your consent, we will mail any required disclosures or notices to the address last known to us for your loan account.  Your withdrawal of consent will apply to all disclosures and notices to which your consent applied.  You agree that we have a reasonable amount of time to implement your withdrawal of consent to receive such electronic disclosures or notices and to begin sending printed documents to you.

Obtaining a Printed Disclosure or Notice

If you need to obtain a printed copy of disclosures or notices that have not been mailed to you because you have agreed to receive electronic versions instead, please call the Bank at 203-972-3838.  The Bank will not charge a fee for this service.

Consent
By applying with us for the residential mortgage application online, you agree:

You have the software, hardware, and equipment that satisfy the above requirements;
To receive or obtain information about your loan, including disclosures and notices, electronically;

Quick Ratio




 


            Measures immediate liquidity or the cash available to cover immediate liabilities. A safe margin would be at least 1 (100%).
        




Financial Leverage




 


            Defined as total assets divided by total shareholders' equity. The higher the ratio, the more debt a company uses in its capital structure.
        




Profitability Ratios

ROE




 


            Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of profitability that calculates how many dollars of profit a company generates with each dollar of shareholders equity.
            ROE is sometimes called "return on net worth."

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
