            Standex Names Thomas J. Hansen as New Independent Director
        
 
                Mar 26, 2013
        

SALEM, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar. 26, 2013-- Standex International Corporation (NYSE:SXI) today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed 
Thomas J. Hansen  as a new member of the Board, effective March 20, 2013. Mr. Hansen’s appointment will increase the number of directors from eight to nine. Mr. Hansen will stand for election by the shareholders to a full three-year term as a director at the Company’s next Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which will occur following the end of the Company’s current fiscal year. Until his retirement in March 2012, Hansen was the vice chairman of Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW), where he had been responsible for the company’s Worldwide Automotive Components and Fasteners business, its Construction Products and Fluids & Polymers businesses, as well as its Industrial Metal and Plastics businesses. “The automotive and industrial manufacturing insight that Tom has gained during his long and distinguished career at ITW will be of immense value to Standex as the Company executes on its focused diversity strategy in the years ahead,” said 
Edward Trainor , Chairman of the Board. “Tom’s qualifications – particularly his experience with highly engineered product manufacturing – made him an ideal candidate to serve as an independent director, and we welcome him to the Standex board.” “Tom’s broad end-market knowledge is particularly well-aligned with our current business portfolio and with the sectors that Standex is targeting for new opportunities for long-term growth,” said Standex President and Chief Executive Officer 
Roger Fix . “In addition, we expect Standex to benefit from Tom’s extensive experience in closing and integrating strategic acquisitions. We are delighted that he has agreed to join us, and we look forward to the perspective he will bring to the board in the years ahead.” 1 Hansen joined ITW in 1980 as sales and marketing manager of the Shakeproof Industrial Products business, which manufactures fasteners for general industrial markets, and was named general manager of the business in 1983. He was promoted to vice president and general manager of ITW’s North American Industrial Metal Fastener and Buckle Divisions in 1986. He was named president of ITW’s North American Industrial and Automotive fastener businesses in 1990 and appointed president of its Worldwide Metal Fastener and Components businesses in 1993. Prior to his election as vice chairman in 2006, Hansen served as executive vice president with responsibility for ITW’s Worldwide Metal and Plastic Fastener and Components businesses, Fluids & Polymers and Construction businesses, as well as its Industrial Metals and Plastic segment. Hansen received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Marketing from Northern Illinois University and a Master of Arts Degree in Business Administration from Governors State University. Before joining ITW, he was employed at Singer Controls, now a division of Invensys, in a variety of assignments including regional sales manager and plant manager, and at GE as a zone sales manager. He currently serves as a member of the board of directors of Terexand Mueller Water Products.

Helly Hansen Names N.A. Senior Marketing Manager

Posted by Thomas J. Ryan | Apr 3, 2013 | Outdoor, Update | 0  | 









Helly Hansen named Graham Gephart to the newly created senior marketing manager position for Helly Hansen North America. In his new role, Gephart will oversee regional strategy, advertising, retail marketing, public relations, social media, and marketing collaborations with more than 40 North American resort and guiding operations.
Gepharts new position is one of multiple North American marketing, merchandising and product positions recently established under the ownership of the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan. The OTPP acquired the majority of the 136-year-old Oslo, Norway-based active lifestyle brand in 2012.
Helly Hansen is experiencing record growth in the U.S. and Canada, said Erik Burbank vice president of global marketing for Helly Hansen. Were investing in top talent and expanding our team to ensure our brand and business continue to grow across our winter, outdoor, water sports, and work wear categories. 
Graham is a key addition to our team. He has an impressive track record in the industry and brings a high level of knowledge and creativity that will benefit our brand, retailers, and partners.
Gephart, who is an avid backcountry skier, alpinist and outdoor enthusiast, previously served as global brand manager. At K2 Outdoor Group, he oversaw marketing and brand efforts for Atlas Snow-Shoe Company, Tubbs Snowshoes, PowdeRidge Snowshoes and Madshus Nordic equipment. Previously, he was the managing editor of Couloir. He holds a bachelors degree from Harvard University. 
Helly Hansen is an incredible brand with a rich heritage and a loyal following, said Gephart. Im proud to join and lead an exceptionally creative team in the U.S. and Canada. I look forward to expanding on our unique programs to foster even greater excitement and brand loyalty in the North American market.

Many people actually become incapacitated and are unable to truly live their lives. This is why I was concerned when I hurt my lower back while working with a patient because I know this type of injury had the potential to become chronic. This is when I was introduced to Dr. Weisberg of Midtown Total Health chiropractic in New York. Not only was I able to resolve my back pain, but I also found a solution for my asthma which was hindering me for years. If you are in New York and are looking for chiropractors, you should consider Midtown Total Health, I highly recommend them&quot; ~BonnieBalanced Health MedicalCaroline G. ratedTesto Boost X The more charming with practice, as its profound power gets to be obvious. For instance, this way is anything but difficult to find in the most essential practice: When we wake up we stroll through our home and start making breakfast. We eat. We clean the dishes. Cleaning the dishes is the right activity, the fitting move to make in the wake of having breakfast. While this is a little and basic circumstance, it .http://www.usadrugguide.com/testo-boost-x-reviews/Better Health Chiropractic PCDmitri P. ratedI was having lower back pain and my primary physician referred me to Dr. Eingorn. The idea of chiropractic care made me nervous and I was reluctant to see a new doctor. During my first meeting with Dr. Eingorn he explained to me that my back trouble was related to scoliosis. This was new information. After the treatments my symptoms were gone. My state of mind and overall health have improved since I started seeing Dr. Eingorn. I am so deeply grateful to him.Rowe Chiropractic OfficesAnne K. ratedI highly recommend Dr. Rowe.   After a few months of treatment I no  longer had instabiity in my lower back.  I had previously been to  a few other chiropractors without getting relief.  I have continued to work with Dr. Rowe in order to optimize my spinal alignment and I look and feel so much better!  The office is attractive and the staff very welcoming.  Dr Dennis Vella DCrhfactor99 ratedThanks Dr VI was having back pain becuase i am always driving. I went to Dr V and he saw a few things that needed to be done to help. A few weeks after going to Dr. V he had me on a weight loss program and back strenghtening program. I have to say to date i have lost 30 lbs in 3 months and my back has been feeling so much better.Thanks Dr. VRowe, DavidAnne K. ratedDr. Rowe is an exceptional chiropractor.  He is on a mission to restore his patient's spine to optimal functioning.  After being treated by a few chiropractors, without success, Dr. Rowe was able to correct my debilitating back problem.  I look and feel dramatically better.  I highly recommend this doctor.Frank J. Valente, DC, PCsportsdoc54 ratedMy Marathon Training Improved!"I was training for a marathon and was having foot, knee, and back pain for about 3 weeks.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Thomas Hansen has the following 1 specialty and 1 board certification.                     Family Medicine
    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.
