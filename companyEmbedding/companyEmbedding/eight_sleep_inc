Eight Launches Smart Mattress to Help You Get Better Sleep
Nov 22 16
Eight announced the launch of a smart mattress, designed to replace traditional mattresses with an alternative that helps customers get better sleep through higher comfort and technology. The Eight Smart Mattress is designed with four layers of responsive and high density foam, plus a technology layer that tracks sleep, warms each side of the bed individually, and connects to other smart home devices. It is available for purchase online starting at $950. Eight's team designed the smart mattress by studying over 1.8 million hours of sleep data that have been tracked through the company's first product — the Eight Sleep Tracker— which by the end of the year will be tracking more than 12,000 people across 67 countries. The Eight Smart Mattress includes features that improve the sleep experience, like automatic temperature control for each side of the bed, and connectivity with other smart home devices like thermostats, lights and coffee machines. The mattress contains multiple sensors to track sleep times, deep and light sleep, breathing rate, and measure toss and turns, bed temperature, and room temperature. Over time, the Eight Smart Mattress uses machine learning to build patterns on sleep behaviors, and displays suggestions for sleep improvement in its mobile app. It can also share this data with health tracking apps like Apple's Health and Google's Fit.

EVERYONE LOVES EIGHT









"What a difference a good mattress makes! I sleep much deeper (over 25% of my sleep is now REM sleep), the aches and pains in the hips are completely gone, so is my shoulder pain (I can only sleep on the side)."
- H. Logan, Eight Customer












"When you lay on the mattress it has a very consistent feel throughout and you don't get the sense that you are hitting a particular layer. This is how a well designed mattress should feel."










"The sinkage and hug mesh well with the levels of support and pressure relief. The mattress creates a nice combination feel between responsiveness and memory foam hug."
































In the News













"Mr. Franceschetti, an Italian-born lawyer, attacked sleep from a different angle: by making mattresses smart."









"After sleeping on it every night for the past couple of months, I feel both better rested and more aware of the rest I am getting. That makes it an Editors' Choice."









"Its promise of in-depth sleep analysis sets it apart in an increasingly crowded field."









"It's not simply some newfangled way of counting digital sheep. It’s sort of like having an invisible butler."

MORE THAN A BED, AN EXPERIENCE


What makes Eight smarter is our unique approach to not only measuring, but improving your sleep. And we built the Eight experience to go beyond the bedroom and across your life and home.





















"This was the only mattress with technology. It is so cool to have the same comfort of other mattresses (I tried other brands) and sleep tracking and warming."
- Richard J., Eight Customer






















01


Discover how you sleep


Wake up to a Sleep Report every morning. See nightly data and discover trends to improve your sleep.


What Eight tracks:





Time asleep
Bedtime
Wake up time
Toss and turns
Sleep breaks




Heart rate
Respiratory rate
Light and deep sleep
Bed temperature
Room temperature
 


















Share data with your favorite health apps


Sync your sleep data with other health tracker apps such as Apple Health Kit and Google Fit to better monitor your sleep and overall health.













02


Use the Eight alarm to wake up refreshed


The smart alarm wakes you in your lightest sleep cycle, when you’re naturally the most awake. The sensors in the cover detect the changes in your body movement, breathing, and heart rate, to know the best time to wake you up.
The alarm rings on your phone, with sounds designed to sooth you into an awake state.




















03


Keep cozy with warming


Your bedroom should be kept at 68 degrees for optimal sleep, but your bed should be warm enough to help you relax. Eight takes care of this for both you and your partner so you can select different temperatures and sleep better together.






LEARN MORE









































04


Optimize your home for sleep


Create the perfect bedroom environment with automated triggers by connecting eight to other devices via IFTTT. From brewing your coffee, to turning off your lights every night, Eight is the butler you never knew you needed.

EVERYONE LOVES EIGHT









"What a difference a good mattress makes! I sleep much deeper (over 25% of my sleep is now REM sleep), the aches and pains in the hips are completely gone, so is my shoulder pain (I can only sleep on the side)."
- H. Logan, Eight Customer












"When you lay on the mattress it has a very consistent feel throughout and you don't get the sense that you are hitting a particular layer. This is how a well designed mattress should feel."










"The sinkage and hug mesh well with the levels of support and pressure relief. The mattress creates a nice combination feel between responsiveness and memory foam hug."
































In the News













"Mr. Franceschetti, an Italian-born lawyer, attacked sleep from a different angle: by making mattresses smart."









"After sleeping on it every night for the past couple of months, I feel both better rested and more aware of the rest I am getting. That makes it an Editors' Choice."









"Its promise of in-depth sleep analysis sets it apart in an increasingly crowded field."









"It's not simply some newfangled way of counting digital sheep. It’s sort of like having an invisible butler."















Try IT for 100 nights


Try the Eight mattress, and if you don't love it we'll refund your purchase.
