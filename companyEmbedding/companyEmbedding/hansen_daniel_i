The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

                        Daniel J. Hansen                    

Daniel J. Hansen is one of Manhattan’s top trial lawyers. With over 20 years of experience earned in the trenches of the New York State Court System, he has long been a fierce advocate with an unrelenting dedication that has resulted in multi-million dollar verdicts and settlements for his clients.
Daniel is a graduate of the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst and Hofstra Law School, where he was the Notes & Comments Editor of the Hofstra Labor Law Journal.  Daniel began his career in 1992 where he was a lawyer at one of the country’s preeminent litigation firms, representing the City of New York, local governments, large insurance companies, and some of the largest corporations in the United States. From 1994 to 1997, Daniel was a trial lawyer at another prominent New York City litigation firm, heading the plaintiff’s trial practice. 
After several years gaining invaluable insight as to how the world’s largest institutions defend cases, Daniel then chose to apply his formidable trial skills to represent individuals in cases involving serious personal injuries, civil rights and constitutional violations, employment and wage and commission claims, catastrophic medical malpractice matters, consumer rights and deceptive business practices, and complex product liability cases. 
Daniel has earned his enviable reputation by handling several notable cases: a month-long police brutality trial (defended by no fewer than three law firms) that ended with a record-setting $19.6 million verdict for Daniel’s client…a suit on behalf of a pedestrian struck by a bus, fracturing his legs, that resulted in a $5 million settlement during trial…the matter of a construction worker injured by a fall from an unsecured ladder that brought a $3.85 million trial verdict. Daniel took on one of the world’s largest insurance companies, forcing a $2.4 million settlement, and when he was retained as special trial counsel to represent a mother and child in a birth injury case, Daniel obtained a settlement that will pay the family nearly $10 million.
Other lawyers in need of trial counsel often seek Daniel to handle their most difficult and important cases. Recognizing his record of delivering multi-million dollar results, other lawyers also often ask Daniel to represent them and their family members. Daniel currently represents close to a thousand victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, including construction workers, electricians, laborers, ironworkers, painters, operating engineers, commercial cleaners, restaurant workers, Con Ed workers, Verizon workers, area lawyers, physicians, NYS Office of the Medical Examiner doctors and nurses, NYPD officers, FDNY members, EMTs and other ambulance workers, Red Cross volunteers, National Guardsmen, FBI special agents, and countless other heroes from all over the United States. Daniel has devoted years’ of efforts advocating for the victims of the 9/11 attacks, including contacting members of Congress to provide assistance to his clients, and has provided written testimony in connection with federal hearings in support of all 9/11 victims.
Daniel has taught and lectured other lawyers, written articles for publication, and made frequent television and radio appearances to advocate for the 9/11 heroes, including on CNN, Fox News, and CBS. Daniel is proud of his service of engaging in grassroots community outreach, and he regularly supports other victims’ advocates and advocacy groups.
