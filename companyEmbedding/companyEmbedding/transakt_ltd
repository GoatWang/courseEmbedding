		Our management team does endeavor to seek opportunities to develop the leading BIO tech business in China. Except the hydroponic systems which rely on artificially
Controlled ambient conditions as temperature, humidity, nutrition and lighting to grow vegetables and herbs, we also engage in extending the product mix that will include microbial fertilizers and organic animal feed additive.
	

		On the other hand, cordyceps cultivation is another direction of our company. We
engaged a team of approximately 10 experts of BIO tech engineer to develop an extended products mix that will launch in China in the next few years.

This unique product is targeted toward SOHO and private home users with functions including intercom, call waiting, call transfer and 3-way conference calling. Set up is simple as plugging the PSTN telephone and internet lines into a central box; no additional wiring around the office or house is required. Taiwan Halee has also introduced an innovative repeater to enhance the communication distance of the handsets to meet different customers' requirements in a variety of environments.  Taiwan Halee's 2-line cordless phone system has been approved for use with Malaysian Telecom through its local agent. A trial order has been placed and management expects good results in the future.

"We have confidence that the multi-line cordless phone system will be widely accepted over the next few years," says James Wu, Chairman of TKT.
