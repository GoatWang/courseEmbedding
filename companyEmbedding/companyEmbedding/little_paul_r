Product Description▼▲
It is so very important for Christians to know what they believe in this day and age. In an time where truth is a victim, Paul E. Little states that there is only one way to God, and that is through Jesus Christ. Little presents Christian beliefs in a very approachable manner that can be enjoyed by Christians and non-Christians alike. Little has an unapologetic way of presenting the truth of the Gospel that Christians must live by.Paul E. Little and his wife, Marie, worked for twenty-five years with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. Until his death in 1975, Little was also associate professor of evangelism at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, IL. He was the author of several books and articles, including How to Give Your Faith Away.

Publisher's Description▼▲
What does Christianity have to do with anything? What does the Christian faith teach about God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit? What do I need to know about angels, Satan and demons? What place should the Bible or a church have in my life? By exploring these and other core questions, bestselling author Paul E. Little leads you into a greater appreciation of a God who has done great things to bring you into a relationship with him through Jesus Christ. He presents ten bottom-line, non-negotiable truths of Christianity using humorous, anecdotal illustrations gathered from years of experience helping believers share their faith with not-yet Christians. Expanded and updated throughout by Paul's wife Marie, this contemporary edition is packed with illuminating answers to questions and misconceptions about the Christian faith, with study questions for each chapter.


Author Bio▼▲
Paul E. Little and his wife, Marie, worked for twenty-five years with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. Until his death in 1975, Little was also associate professor of evangelism at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois. He was the author of several books and articles, including 


Editorial Reviews▼▲
"This updated classic stands ready to serve a whole new generation. Read it and let Paul help you understand the timeless biblical truths that will prevent you from being 'blown here and there by every wind of teaching.' "
"There are just a few timeless treasures in Christian literature. Know What You Believe is one of them. I am confident that the expanded and updated version of this book will be as important to this generation as it was in the days when I was a student."
"I have deeply admired [Paul Little] as a man of God with extraordinary insights into the work of God and boundless enthusiasm for communicating the Word of God."

            This book helped me in a time in my life that I needed to know more about what I believe.  Not heavy on big doctrine words, written so I can understand it.  A common sense way of explaining what we believe.  I only gave 4 stars to "meets expectations" because a part of me says the real answer to know what we believe is by faith.  It is that simple.

            Paul Little's book still makes us think about the Christian values we take for granted and how we can explain to others what we believe about our faith.

            I am taking a class based on this book and it is a great help to me in my studies. Very good book to have and read so that you will truly know what you believe as there are so many false teaching these days. God bless.

Description

    Andrews and Trafton know from experience that kindergartners can do great math -- especially if they are engaged and challenged from the start. This collection of stories from Angela's classroom highlights the problem-solving potential of very young students. Arranged by month of the school year, each of these ten stories is an inspiration for a classroom lesson. Together the stories provide a comprehensive picture of what can be accomplished with little kids.Several major themes recur throughout the stories: -- the distinction between academic and intellectual goals-- the real meaning of a "community of learners"-- perseverance-- accountability.With every story, Andrews provides not only a narrative, but also a thoughtful appraisal of her own decisions, dilemmas, and choices in the teaching of math. At the end of each story, Trafton focuses on the math involved and the mathematical reasoning of the children.

The Amazon.com Textbooks Store




	
Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Wouldn’t you rather buy cheap college textbooks and have more money to buy that great pair of skinny jeans, eat out more often instead of heating up a frozen pizza, or just have a little more spending money? When you come to Amazon.com, you can save money by buying cheap new and used textbooks and by renting textbooks for college. You can also trade your used textbooks for an Amazon Gift Card, whether you bought your books from us or not. By being a smart shopper and saving money on textbooks at Amazon.com, you’ll have more cash for the things in life that can’t be learned from a textbook.

The Amazon Textbooks Store allows you to shop online and buy all your textbooks without ever leaving the comfort of your couch. We offer a variety of new, used, rental, and eTextbooks. Don’t worry about selection, we’ve got your textbook needs covered for any subject from biology, chemistry, and nursing to accounting, arts, and engineering. Once you’re finished with your textbooks you can trade them in at Amazon.com and get up to 80% of their value in an Amazon Gift Card.   

Shop the Amazon Textbooks Store and save up to 90% on textbook rentals, up to 90% on used textbooks, and up to 50% on new textbooks. You can also enjoy Free Two-Day Shipping on millions of items, including cheap college textbooks, when you join Prime Student. Get your textbooks delivered to your door and save both time and money by shopping at Amazon.com. So go ahead and treat yourself to that designer purse or new video game, you can since you’ve saved so much on your textbooks.
