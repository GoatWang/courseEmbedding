Mr. Pieczynski's prior service as an executive officer and director of LTC, his recent position as Chief Executive Officer of a public financial company, his years of experience in financial and executive positions with health care companies, and his expertise in accounting, financial reporting and controls led the Board to conclude that he should be nominated to serve as director.
