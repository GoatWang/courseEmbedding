STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

               THIS STOCK PURCHASE  AGREEMENT (the  "AGREEMENT") is made as of
the 12th day of August,  2007, by and among General Atlantic Partners 84, L.P., 
a Delaware limited partnership,  GAP Coinvestments III, LLC, a Delaware limited 
liability  company,  GAP  Coinvestments  IV, LLC, a Delaware limited  liability 
company,  GapStar, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company,  GAPCO GmbH & Co. 
KG, a German limited  partnership,  and GAP Coinvestments CDA, L.P., a Delaware 
limited partnership (collectively, the "PURCHASERS") on the one hand, and Alsen 
Investments Ltd., a British Virgin Islands business company (the "SELLER").     

THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:            

       1.      PURCHASE  AND  SALE  OF  SHARES.   Subject  to  the  terms  and
conditions of this Agreement,  each of the Purchasers hereby agrees to purchase 
from the  Seller,  and the  Seller  hereby  agrees  to sell to the  Purchasers, 
936,140  shares  (collectively,  the "SHARES") of the common  stock,  par value 
$0.001 per share ("COMMON  STOCK"),  of MercadoLibre  Inc. (the "COMPANY") with 
each  Purchaser  purchasing  that number of Shares from the Seller as set forth 
opposite each such  Purchaser's  name on SCHEDULE A, in exchange for a purchase 
price per share of $18.00 (the "PURCHASE PRICE").                               

               1.1     CLOSING. The purchase and sale of the Shares shall take
place at the offices of Greenberg Traurig,  401 East Las Olas Boulevard,  Suite 
2000, Ft. Lauderdale,  FL 33301 at 10:00 A.M. New York time,  concurrently with 
the closing of the  Company's  initial  public  offering  of Common  Stock (the 
"IPO") as  contemplated  by the  Company's  Registration  Statement on Form S-1 
(Registration  Number  333-142880)  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Commission (the  "COMMISSION")  on May 11, 2007 (as amended through the date of 
Closing (as hereinafter  defined),  the "REGISTRATION  STATEMENT"),  or at such 
other  time and place as the Seller  and the  Purchasers  agree upon in writing 
(which time and place are designated as the "CLOSING"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that 
in no event  shall the  Closing be later than the closing of the IPO unless the 
Seller is unable to comply with its  obligations set forth in Section 1.1(a) of 
this Agreement,  after using commercially reasonable efforts, in which case (i) 
the Closing shall occur as promptly as practicable after the closing of the IPO 
and (ii) any such  failure  or  inability  by the  Seller  to  comply  with its 
obligations  under  Section  1.1(a)  shall not be deemed to be a breach of this 
Agreement by Seller. At the Closing:                                            

                       (a)     The Seller shall take all  necessary  action to
cause the Company to deliver to each Purchaser a stock  certificate  registered 
in the name of such Purchaser representing the number of Shares being purchased 
by each Purchaser hereunder; and                                                

                       (b)     The  Purchasers  shall  pay to the  Seller  the
aggregate  Purchase Price set forth on SCHEDULE A (with each  Purchaser  paying 
the Purchase Price set forth opposite such  Purchaser's  name) by wire transfer 
of immediately available funds to the wire instructions of the Seller delivered 
by the Seller to the Purchasers in writing prior to the Closing.                

       2.      REPRESENTATIONS  AND  WARRANTIES  OF THE  SELLERS.  The  Seller
hereby  represents and warrants to the  Purchasers  that as of the date of this 
Agreement and as of the Closing:

               2.1     OWNERSHIP OF STOCK. Except as set forth in that certain
Second Amended and Restated  Stockholders'  Agreement dated as of September 24,
2001 by and among the Company and the stockholders  named therein,  which shall 
terminate  upon the closing of the  Company's  IPO,  the Seller owns all right, 
title  and  interest  (legal  and  beneficial)  in and to all of the  shares of 
capital stock of the Company  listed on SCHEDULE A hereto free and clear of all 
liens, including without limitation any lien, pledge, claim, security interest, 
encumbrance,  mortgage,  assessment,  charge,  restriction or limitation of any 
kind,  whether  arising by  agreement,  operation  of law or  otherwise).  Upon 
delivery and payment for the Shares sold by the Seller,  the  Purchasers  shall 
acquire valid and unencumbered title to such Shares. The Seller is not indebted 
to the  Company  and no amount is recorded on the books of the Company as being 
payable to the Company from the Seller.  No person has any  agreement,  option, 
understanding or commitment (oral or in writing) with the Seller,  or any right 
or privilege  capable of becoming an agreement,  option or commitment,  for the 
purchase or acquisition from the Seller of any of the Shares.                   

               2.2     NO CONTRAVENTION.  The consummation of the transactions
herein  contemplated  will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation 
of any of the terms or  provisions  of, or  constitute  a  default  under,  any 
indenture,  mortgage,  deed of trust,  loan  agreement  or other  agreement  or 
instrument to which the Seller is a party or by which the Seller is bound or to 
which any of the property or assets of the Seller is subject.                   

               2.3     AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABILITY. The Seller has the power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and this Agreement has been executed 
and delivered by the Seller and constitutes a legally binding obligation of the 
Seller,  enforceable  in  accordance  with its terms  except  (i) as limited by 
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium, and other laws 
of general  application  affecting  enforcement of creditors' rights generally, 
(ii) as limited by laws relating to the  availability of specific  performance, 
injunctive relief, or other equitable remedies and (iii) as rights to indemnity 
may be limited  under federal or state  securities  law or principals of public 
policy thereunder.                                                              

               2.4     CONSENTS. No consent,  approval, order or authorization
of, or registration,  qualification,  designation,  declaration or filing with, 
any foreign,  state or local governmental  authority or other party on the part 
of the Seller is required in connection with the execution of this Agreement or 
the transactions  contemplated hereby,  except those that may be required under 
applicable state or federal securities laws.                                    

               2.5     RECEIPT OF INFORMATION.  The Seller hereby acknowledges
that it has not relied on the Purchasers in making its  divestment  decision to 
sell the Shares.                                                                

               2.6     PRIVATE  OFFERING.   No  registration  of  the  Shares,
pursuant to the  provisions  of the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended  (the 
"SECURITIES  ACT") or any state securities or "blue sky" laws, will be required 
by the offer,  sale or issuance of the Shares.  The Seller  agrees that neither 
it,  nor anyone  acting on its  behalf,  shall  offer to sell the Shares or any 
other securities of the Company so as to require the registration of the Shares 
pursuant to the  provisions of the  Securities  Act or any state  securities or 
"blue sky" laws.                                                                

       3.      REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASERS.  Each of the
Purchasers, jointly and severally, hereby represents and warrants to the Seller 
that as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing:

               3.1     NO CONTRAVENTION.  The consummation of the transactions
herein  contemplated  will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation 
of any of the terms or  provisions  of, or  constitute  a  default  under,  any 
indenture,  mortgage,  deed of trust,  loan  agreement  or other  agreement  or 
instrument to which any Purchaser is a party or by which any Purchaser is bound 
or to which any of the property or assets of any Purchaser is subject.          

               3.2     AUTHORIZATION;  ENFORCEABILITY.  Each Purchaser has the
power and authority to enter into this  Agreement,  and this Agreement has been 
executed and  delivered by each  Purchaser and  constitutes  a legally  binding 
obligation of each  Purchaser,  enforceable in accordance with its terms except 
(i)  as  limited  by   applicable   bankruptcy,   insolvency,   reorganization, 
moratorium,  and other laws of general  application  affecting  enforcement  of 
creditors'  rights  generally,   (ii)  as  limited  by  laws  relating  to  the 
availability of specific  performance,  injunctive  relief,  or other equitable 
remedies and (iii) as rights to indemnity may be limited under federal or state 
securities law or principals of public policy thereunder.                       

               3.3     CONSENTS. No consent,  approval, order or authorization
of, or registration,  qualification,  designation,  declaration or filing with, 
any foreign,  state or local governmental  authority or other party on the part 
of such  Purchaser  is  required  in  connection  with  the  execution  of this 
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby, except 
those that may be required under applicable state or federal securities laws.   

               3.4     PURCHASE  ENTIRELY FOR OWN ACCOUNT.  This  Agreement is
made with such Purchaser in reliance upon the Purchaser's representation to the 
Seller,  which by the  Purchaser's  execution of this  Agreement such Purchaser 
hereby  confirms,  that the  Shares to be  received  by the  Purchaser  will be 
acquired for investment for the  Purchaser's  own account,  not as a nominee or 
agent,  and not with a view to the  distribution of any part thereof,  and that 
the Purchaser has no present  intention of selling,  granting any participation 
in, or otherwise  distributing  the same.  By executing  this  Agreement,  such 
Purchaser  further  represents  that the Purchaser  does not have any contract, 
undertaking,  agreement  or  arrangement  with any person to sell,  transfer or 
grant participations to such person or to any third person, with respect to any 
of the Shares.                                                                  

               3.5     INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE. Such Purchaser is an investor in
securities of companies in the development  stage and  acknowledges  that it is 
able to fend for itself,  can bear the economic risk of this investment and can 
bear  the  complete  loss  of  such  investment,  and has  such  knowledge  and 
experience  in financial or business  matters that it is capable of  evaluating 
the merits and risks of the investment in the Shares to be purchased hereunder. 

               3.6     ACCREDITED  INVESTOR.  Such Purchaser is an "accredited
investor"  within the meaning of the SEC Rule 501 of  Regulation D  promulgated 
under the Securities Act.                                                       

               3.7     RESTRICTED SECURITIES.  Such Purchaser understands that
(i) the Shares are "restricted securities" (as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) of the 
Securities Act), (ii) the Shares are not registered on the date hereof and will 
not be  registered at the time of their sale under the  Securities  Act for the 
reason  that the sale  provided  for in this  Agreement  is exempt  pursuant to 
Section 4(1) of the  Securities Act and that the reliance of the Seller and the 
Purchasers on such exemption is predicated on the  Purchasers'  representations 
set forth  herein  and  (iii) any  subsequent  transfer  of the  Shares by such 
Purchaser is subject to certain  restrictions  and  conditions (as set forth in 
the legends contained on the certificates evidencing the Shares) including      

3 

P-->EX-994th Page of 12TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 4th
compliance with the Securities Act. Such Purchaser  agrees to the imprinting of 
a legend  on  certificates  representing  all of its  Shares  to the  following 
effect:                                                                         

               THE SECURITIES  REPRESENTED BY THIS  CERTIFICATE  HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED  UNDER THE  SECURITIES  ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"),  OR THE 
SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY FOREIGN  JURISDICTION. 
THE  SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD,  TRANSFERRED  OR OTHERWISE  DISPOSED OF IN THE

7.8     SELLER INDEMNIFICATION.                 

                       (a)     Seller  assumes  liability  for and  agrees  to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Purchaser and its officers, directors, 
shareholders,  partners,  managers,  members,  employees, agents and affiliates 
(collectively,  "PURCHASER  INDEMNIFIED  PERSONS")  from and against all actual 
direct or indirect losses, claims, damages,  liabilities,  obligations,  fines, 
penalties, judgments, settlements, costs, expenses and disbursements (including 
reasonable  attorney's fees and expenses to the extent that reasonably detailed 
documentation   evidencing   such  fees  is  provided   in  a  timely   manner) 
(collectively,  "LOSSES") (i) arising solely out of or related to any breach or 
inaccuracy  of any of its  representations  or  warranties  contained  in  this 
Agreement;  or (ii) any  non-fulfillment  or breach of any of its  covenants or 
agreements  contained in this Agreement;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that such Losses 
shall not include any special,  punitive,  incidental or consequential damages, 
or any damages in respect of loss profits or diminution in value.               

                       (b)     The Seller agrees to reimburse  each  Purchaser
Indemnified  Person  promptly  for all  Losses  as they  are  incurred  by such 
Purchaser  Indemnified  Person to the extent that such Loss must be indemnified 
by the Seller pursuant to Section 7.8(a).                                       

                       (c)     All  claims  made  by a  Purchaser  Indemnified
Person hereunder (a "PURCHASER  CLAIM") shall be made promptly (but in no event 
later than 7 days after the action  involving such  Purchaser  Claim occurs) in

the final amount of the Purchaser Claim).  Absent any objection notified by the 
Seller to the  Purchaser  Indemnified  Person  within  twenty  (20) days of the 
receipt by it of a Purchaser Claim Notice,  the related  indemnification  shall 
become due. If, on the other hand, the Seller  provides notice of its objection

or  warranties  contained in this  Agreement;  or (ii) any  non-fulfillment  or 
breach of any of their  covenants or  agreements  contained in this  Agreement; 
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that such Losses shall not include any special,  punitive,

                       (b)     Each Purchaser  agrees to reimburse each Seller
Indemnified  Person promptly for all Losses as they are incurred by such Seller 
Indemnified  Person to the  extent  that such Loss must be  indemnified  by the 
Purchasers  pursuant to Section  7.9(a).  The  obligations of each Purchaser to 
each  Seller  Indemnified  Person  under this  section  shall be  separate  and 
distinct obligations from each other Purchaser.                                 

                       (c)     All claims made by a Seller  Indemnified Person

7 days after the action  involving  such Seller  Claim  occurs) in writing in a 
notice (a "SELLER CLAIM NOTICE") sent to the applicable Purchaser,  stating the

Purchaser  to the Seller  Indemnified  Person  within  twenty  (20) days of the 
receipt by them of a Seller Claim  Notice,  the related  indemnification  shall

objection to the Seller Claim  Notice  within such twenty (20) day period,  and 
the dispute cannot be settled  amicably,  the Seller Claim shall be resolved by 
litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.                   

7.10    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.                

                       (a)     Notwithstanding  any of the terms or provisions
of this Agreement, the Seller's total liability for any Losses pursuant to this 
Agreement shall not in any event exceed, in the aggregate, the Purchase Price.
