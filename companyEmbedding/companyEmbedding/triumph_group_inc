History[edit]
1980s[edit]
Triumph Group was formerly one of the companies in Alco Standard Corporation, a loose conglomerate of diversified companies that operated across a large number of unrelated fields, including office supplies.[5] By the latter half of the decade, officers of Alco Standard Corporation were concentrating on office supplies, paper products and food services, their three core competencies. The former was the fastest growing market for the company.
In 1986, Alco was considering selling Triumph Group and its distribution businesses, the former of which competed in the aerospace industry and earned just under 3% of Alco Standard's revenue.
1990s[edit]
In addition to its aerospace factions, Triumph also had a stake in the U.S. steel industry. Because customers were becoming more demanding with respect to product quality, Alco Standard formed a new organization named Alco Diversified Services out of the 11 companies that comprised the Triumph Group, the two paper companies and their aerospace subsidiary. Richard Ill, who led Triumph Group for several years, was promoted to president of Alco Diversified Services.
In 1991, Alco sold their food division. In 1992, the corporation made an announcement that it was trying to sell Alco Diversified Services and purchase 49.9% percent of IMM Office Systems Holding. In 1993, Triumph Group took over Alco Diversified Services in a leveraged buyout. Triumph conducted aviation repair and overhaul, industrial machining, paper converting and steel converting. The companies employed 1450 people at 22 US locations, with aviation accounting for just over 25% of total sales.
In 1995, due to Department of Defense cutbacks, Triumph sold Otto Konigslow Manufacturing Company (which manufactured aerospace components) to two of its supervisors.
In the middle of the 1990s, commercial aviation sales went from $200 million to $300 million in three years, with forecasts indicating that sales would reach $500 million before the end of the decade. The aviation businesses provided 67% of the company's revenue. With never-before-seen demand for airline travel around 1996, Boeing produced close to 500 aircraft per annum. To meet this unprecedented production rate, Boeing outsourced a greater number of components and services.
In 1996, the corporation had 1500 workers and yearly earnings of $300 million. Six divisions worked in aviation while the other seven worked in specialty materials. The company went public at that time, which provided over $50 million in revenue.
The company focused on purchasing aviation companies in an attempt to increase profits by 20% per annum, and extend their product lines. Such acquisitions included Air Lab (1995), Teleflex Controls (1996), Hydro-Mill Company (1997), DV Industries (1998), DG Industries (1998), Chase Aerospace Limited (1998) and Hartford Tool and Die (1998).
The company also sold businesses that were not part of their aviation-focused strategy, such as Quality Park Products (1996) and Air Lab (1997).
In 1998, when Ill subsequently announced his preoccupations about cutbacks in aircraft production at Boeing Company, he also stated that there may be more work forthcoming on the new Boeing 737. This was an excellent fit for Triumph Air Repair, as much of their work consisted of servicing the Boeing 727 and 737 aircraft. It was at this time that Boeing Company purchased McDonnell Douglas, the first company to manufacture the KC-10 aircraft, which was the aerial refueling version of the Boeing DC-10. Soon to follow would be Triumph Air Repair's largest contract ever, a twelve-month deal to service auxiliary power units and line replaceable units for the United States Air Force KC-10 tankers. Boeing had several options to renew, increasing the potential of this arrangement ninefold.
In 1998, Triumph acquired four additional companies, bringing its grand total of subsidiaries to eighteen and its employee count to over two thousand in early 1999. It was at this time that Triumph purchased Ralee Engineering, a manufacturer of gigantic aircraft components and assemblies. This gave the conglomerate the ability to produce almost all of the parts used in commercial aircraft.
In 1999, Triumph infused six more companies into its colossal lineup of subsidiaries. The company produced flight control surfaces, control systems, and metal parts while providing MRO for almost every aircraft system except cabins, communications devices, landing gear, engines and the most comprehensive maintenance checks.[6]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the Boeing Company's failing Spokane, Washington facility was acquired, which is now known as Triumph Composite Systems. The conglomerate now stood at 41 companies.[7] In the same quarter of that year, the company restructured by discontinuing its Metals Group and combining its five aviation segments into three. The Control Systems and Structures Groups were combined into Triumph Aerospace Systems Group. The Gas Turbine Services and Operational Components Groups were unified, becoming Triumph Components Group. Triumph Aftermarket Services Group added Advanced Materials Technologies and Aerospace Technologies to its portfolio.[8]
Shortly thereafter, Triumph acquired the Parker Hannifin Corporation United Aircraft Products Division and Rolls-Royce Gear Systems. The company then reorganized into two groups, Triumph Aftermarket Services and Triumph Aerospace Systems. It also combined several of its Arizona subsidiaries into Triumph Engineered Solutions, which was decommissioned at the end of 2004.[9]
In 2009, Triumph Group purchased Mexmil Company, Kongsberg Automotive, Merritt Tool Company and Saygrove Defense & Aerospace Group.[10]
2010s[edit]
In June 2010, Triumph Group acquired Vought Aircraft Industries, a leading producer of aerostructures from the Carlyle Group. This acquisition close to doubled the company workforce, and created a 'Tier One Capable' supplier.[11][12]
In January 2014 the company sold its division Lee Aerospace back to the its original founder, Jim Lee. Triumph had owned Lee Aerospace for 14 years.[13]
In December 2015, Triumph Group Inc. announced that Daniel J. Crowley would be named president and chief executive officer effective 4 January 2016. Crowley succeeds Richard C. Ill, CEO from 1993-2012. Ill left retirement to step in after Jeffry D. Frisby resigned.[14]

History[edit]
1980s[edit]
Triumph Group was formerly one of the companies in Alco Standard Corporation, a loose conglomerate of diversified companies that operated across a large number of unrelated fields, including office supplies.[5] By the latter half of the decade, officers of Alco Standard Corporation were concentrating on office supplies, paper products and food services, their three core competencies. The former was the fastest growing market for the company.
In 1986, Alco was considering selling Triumph Group and its distribution businesses, the former of which competed in the aerospace industry and earned just under 3% of Alco Standard's revenue.
1990s[edit]
In addition to its aerospace factions, Triumph also had a stake in the U.S. steel industry. Because customers were becoming more demanding with respect to product quality, Alco Standard formed a new organization named Alco Diversified Services out of the 11 companies that comprised the Triumph Group, the two paper companies and their aerospace subsidiary. Richard Ill, who led Triumph Group for several years, was promoted to president of Alco Diversified Services.
In 1991, Alco sold their food division. In 1992, the corporation made an announcement that it was trying to sell Alco Diversified Services and purchase 49.9% percent of IMM Office Systems Holding. In 1993, Triumph Group took over Alco Diversified Services in a leveraged buyout. Triumph conducted aviation repair and overhaul, industrial machining, paper converting and steel converting. The companies employed 1450 people at 22 US locations, with aviation accounting for just over 25% of total sales.
In 1995, due to Department of Defense cutbacks, Triumph sold Otto Konigslow Manufacturing Company (which manufactured aerospace components) to two of its supervisors.
In the middle of the 1990s, commercial aviation sales went from $200 million to $300 million in three years, with forecasts indicating that sales would reach $500 million before the end of the decade. The aviation businesses provided 67% of the company's revenue. With never-before-seen demand for airline travel around 1996, Boeing produced close to 500 aircraft per annum. To meet this unprecedented production rate, Boeing outsourced a greater number of components and services.
In 1996, the corporation had 1500 workers and yearly earnings of $300 million. Six divisions worked in aviation while the other seven worked in specialty materials. The company went public at that time, which provided over $50 million in revenue.
The company focused on purchasing aviation companies in an attempt to increase profits by 20% per annum, and extend their product lines. Such acquisitions included Air Lab (1995), Teleflex Controls (1996), Hydro-Mill Company (1997), DV Industries (1998), DG Industries (1998), Chase Aerospace Limited (1998) and Hartford Tool and Die (1998).
The company also sold businesses that were not part of their aviation-focused strategy, such as Quality Park Products (1996) and Air Lab (1997).
In 1998, when Ill subsequently announced his preoccupations about cutbacks in aircraft production at Boeing Company, he also stated that there may be more work forthcoming on the new Boeing 737. This was an excellent fit for Triumph Air Repair, as much of their work consisted of servicing the Boeing 727 and 737 aircraft. It was at this time that Boeing Company purchased McDonnell Douglas, the first company to manufacture the KC-10 aircraft, which was the aerial refueling version of the Boeing DC-10. Soon to follow would be Triumph Air Repair's largest contract ever, a twelve-month deal to service auxiliary power units and line replaceable units for the United States Air Force KC-10 tankers. Boeing had several options to renew, increasing the potential of this arrangement ninefold.
In 1998, Triumph acquired four additional companies, bringing its grand total of subsidiaries to eighteen and its employee count to over two thousand in early 1999. It was at this time that Triumph purchased Ralee Engineering, a manufacturer of gigantic aircraft components and assemblies. This gave the conglomerate the ability to produce almost all of the parts used in commercial aircraft.
In 1999, Triumph infused six more companies into its colossal lineup of subsidiaries. The company produced flight control surfaces, control systems, and metal parts while providing MRO for almost every aircraft system except cabins, communications devices, landing gear, engines and the most comprehensive maintenance checks.[6]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the Boeing Company's failing Spokane, Washington facility was acquired, which is now known as Triumph Composite Systems. The conglomerate now stood at 41 companies.[7] In the same quarter of that year, the company restructured by discontinuing its Metals Group and combining its five aviation segments into three. The Control Systems and Structures Groups were combined into Triumph Aerospace Systems Group. The Gas Turbine Services and Operational Components Groups were unified, becoming Triumph Components Group. Triumph Aftermarket Services Group added Advanced Materials Technologies and Aerospace Technologies to its portfolio.[8]
Shortly thereafter, Triumph acquired the Parker Hannifin Corporation United Aircraft Products Division and Rolls-Royce Gear Systems. The company then reorganized into two groups, Triumph Aftermarket Services and Triumph Aerospace Systems. It also combined several of its Arizona subsidiaries into Triumph Engineered Solutions, which was decommissioned at the end of 2004.[9]
In 2009, Triumph Group purchased Mexmil Company, Kongsberg Automotive, Merritt Tool Company and Saygrove Defense & Aerospace Group.[10]
2010s[edit]
In June 2010, Triumph Group acquired Vought Aircraft Industries, a leading producer of aerostructures from the Carlyle Group. This acquisition close to doubled the company workforce, and created a 'Tier One Capable' supplier.[11][12]
In January 2014 the company sold its division Lee Aerospace back to the its original founder, Jim Lee. Triumph had owned Lee Aerospace for 14 years.[13]
In December 2015, Triumph Group Inc. announced that Daniel J. Crowley would be named president and chief executive officer effective 4 January 2016. Crowley succeeds Richard C. Ill, CEO from 1993-2012. Ill left retirement to step in after Jeffry D. Frisby resigned.[14]

History[edit]
1980s[edit]
Triumph Group was formerly one of the companies in Alco Standard Corporation, a loose conglomerate of diversified companies that operated across a large number of unrelated fields, including office supplies.[5] By the latter half of the decade, officers of Alco Standard Corporation were concentrating on office supplies, paper products and food services, their three core competencies. The former was the fastest growing market for the company.
In 1986, Alco was considering selling Triumph Group and its distribution businesses, the former of which competed in the aerospace industry and earned just under 3% of Alco Standard's revenue.
1990s[edit]
In addition to its aerospace factions, Triumph also had a stake in the U.S. steel industry. Because customers were becoming more demanding with respect to product quality, Alco Standard formed a new organization named Alco Diversified Services out of the 11 companies that comprised the Triumph Group, the two paper companies and their aerospace subsidiary. Richard Ill, who led Triumph Group for several years, was promoted to president of Alco Diversified Services.
In 1991, Alco sold their food division. In 1992, the corporation made an announcement that it was trying to sell Alco Diversified Services and purchase 49.9% percent of IMM Office Systems Holding. In 1993, Triumph Group took over Alco Diversified Services in a leveraged buyout. Triumph conducted aviation repair and overhaul, industrial machining, paper converting and steel converting. The companies employed 1450 people at 22 US locations, with aviation accounting for just over 25% of total sales.
In 1995, due to Department of Defense cutbacks, Triumph sold Otto Konigslow Manufacturing Company (which manufactured aerospace components) to two of its supervisors.
In the middle of the 1990s, commercial aviation sales went from $200 million to $300 million in three years, with forecasts indicating that sales would reach $500 million before the end of the decade. The aviation businesses provided 67% of the company's revenue. With never-before-seen demand for airline travel around 1996, Boeing produced close to 500 aircraft per annum. To meet this unprecedented production rate, Boeing outsourced a greater number of components and services.
In 1996, the corporation had 1500 workers and yearly earnings of $300 million. Six divisions worked in aviation while the other seven worked in specialty materials. The company went public at that time, which provided over $50 million in revenue.
The company focused on purchasing aviation companies in an attempt to increase profits by 20% per annum, and extend their product lines. Such acquisitions included Air Lab (1995), Teleflex Controls (1996), Hydro-Mill Company (1997), DV Industries (1998), DG Industries (1998), Chase Aerospace Limited (1998) and Hartford Tool and Die (1998).
The company also sold businesses that were not part of their aviation-focused strategy, such as Quality Park Products (1996) and Air Lab (1997).
In 1998, when Ill subsequently announced his preoccupations about cutbacks in aircraft production at Boeing Company, he also stated that there may be more work forthcoming on the new Boeing 737. This was an excellent fit for Triumph Air Repair, as much of their work consisted of servicing the Boeing 727 and 737 aircraft. It was at this time that Boeing Company purchased McDonnell Douglas, the first company to manufacture the KC-10 aircraft, which was the aerial refueling version of the Boeing DC-10. Soon to follow would be Triumph Air Repair's largest contract ever, a twelve-month deal to service auxiliary power units and line replaceable units for the United States Air Force KC-10 tankers. Boeing had several options to renew, increasing the potential of this arrangement ninefold.
In 1998, Triumph acquired four additional companies, bringing its grand total of subsidiaries to eighteen and its employee count to over two thousand in early 1999. It was at this time that Triumph purchased Ralee Engineering, a manufacturer of gigantic aircraft components and assemblies. This gave the conglomerate the ability to produce almost all of the parts used in commercial aircraft.
In 1999, Triumph infused six more companies into its colossal lineup of subsidiaries. The company produced flight control surfaces, control systems, and metal parts while providing MRO for almost every aircraft system except cabins, communications devices, landing gear, engines and the most comprehensive maintenance checks.[6]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the Boeing Company's failing Spokane, Washington facility was acquired, which is now known as Triumph Composite Systems. The conglomerate now stood at 41 companies.[7] In the same quarter of that year, the company restructured by discontinuing its Metals Group and combining its five aviation segments into three. The Control Systems and Structures Groups were combined into Triumph Aerospace Systems Group. The Gas Turbine Services and Operational Components Groups were unified, becoming Triumph Components Group. Triumph Aftermarket Services Group added Advanced Materials Technologies and Aerospace Technologies to its portfolio.[8]
Shortly thereafter, Triumph acquired the Parker Hannifin Corporation United Aircraft Products Division and Rolls-Royce Gear Systems. The company then reorganized into two groups, Triumph Aftermarket Services and Triumph Aerospace Systems. It also combined several of its Arizona subsidiaries into Triumph Engineered Solutions, which was decommissioned at the end of 2004.[9]
In 2009, Triumph Group purchased Mexmil Company, Kongsberg Automotive, Merritt Tool Company and Saygrove Defense & Aerospace Group.[10]
2010s[edit]
In June 2010, Triumph Group acquired Vought Aircraft Industries, a leading producer of aerostructures from the Carlyle Group. This acquisition close to doubled the company workforce, and created a 'Tier One Capable' supplier.[11][12]
In January 2014 the company sold its division Lee Aerospace back to the its original founder, Jim Lee. Triumph had owned Lee Aerospace for 14 years.[13]
In December 2015, Triumph Group Inc. announced that Daniel J. Crowley would be named president and chief executive officer effective 4 January 2016. Crowley succeeds Richard C. Ill, CEO from 1993-2012. Ill left retirement to step in after Jeffry D. Frisby resigned.[14]

Our operations touch virtually all major players and all current and future aviation platforms. Triumph serves a broad, worldwide spectrum of the industry, including Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of commercial, regional, business and military aircraft and aircraft components, as well as commercial and regional airlines and air cargo carriers.
Triumph participates at all levels of the aerospace supply chain – from single components to complex aerostructures and their contents. Our singular ability to integrate a broad range of products and capabilities under the Triumph banner is a key competitive advantage that will become a major source of growth.





                        Culture / Mission
                    











Triumph’s Mission                    


Triumph’s Mission
Triumph’s mission is to be the premier aerospace and defense company recognized by customers as their supplier of choice for the aerospace structures, components and assemblies we provide.
To achieve our goals, we protect the integrity of the individual Triumph companies while offering each company the advantages of being part of a larger entity. This operating philosophy provides flexibility to capitalize on the changing market environment and deliver superior customer satisfaction. 
Triumph’s Values
All companies share the Triumph name and a common dedication to the core values of Integrity, Innovation, Quality and Service, Flawless Execution, and Commitment. In fiscal 2011, we implemented “Striving for Excellence,” a company-wide program to communicate and reinforce these values among all employees. These values serve as guiding principles as we fulfill our commitment to our customers, employees, investors, suppliers and the communities in which we operate.
Triumph’s Strategy
Our business strategy has remained constant since Triumph’s founding. Because our strategy is clear and consistent, our managers have the confidence required to make independent decisions in line with our shared priorities. Our strategy has five key elements:

Continually add products and services 
Expand operating capacity 
Acquire aggressively 
Market our complete portfolio of capabilities 
Expand our international presence 

Think Big, Act Small
We manage Triumph according to a unique decentralized management philosophy that places a great deal of discretion and accountability with our individual companies while maintaining a small corporate staff. While Triumph management establishes the overall direction for the entire organization, each individual company has broad latitude and discretion to apply our strategies in ways that make sense for their own customers and markets. Because our operating companies are extremely nimble and responsive to changing market conditions, Triumph as a whole is also highly adaptive and flexible. At Triumph, rigorous expense control is a way of life, and each company is accountable for its own profitability.
One Name.  Many Solutions.
Triumph acts as a large corporation by presenting a common face and a single point of contact to our customers. We promote the group’s complete range of expertise and capabilities under the banner: “One name. Many solutions.” Since 2006, all our companies have shared the Triumph name and a common commitment to work together to serve our customers.
The Triumph Team
As part of Triumph, our companies are able to attract and retain the very best people available. While Triumph offers employees excellent compensation and benefits, the most important advantages of working here are not measured in dollars and cents but in terms of personal accountability and empowerment. Not only are employees empowered to take initiative, they are expected to take initiative to meet the needs of our customers.

History[edit]
1980s[edit]
Triumph Group was formerly one of the companies in Alco Standard Corporation, a loose conglomerate of diversified companies that operated across a large number of unrelated fields, including office supplies.[5] By the latter half of the decade, officers of Alco Standard Corporation were concentrating on office supplies, paper products and food services, their three core competencies. The former was the fastest growing market for the company.
In 1986, Alco was considering selling Triumph Group and its distribution businesses, the former of which competed in the aerospace industry and earned just under 3% of Alco Standard's revenue.
1990s[edit]
In addition to its aerospace factions, Triumph also had a stake in the U.S. steel industry. Because customers were becoming more demanding with respect to product quality, Alco Standard formed a new organization named Alco Diversified Services out of the 11 companies that comprised the Triumph Group, the two paper companies and their aerospace subsidiary. Richard Ill, who led Triumph Group for several years, was promoted to president of Alco Diversified Services.
In 1991, Alco sold their food division. In 1992, the corporation made an announcement that it was trying to sell Alco Diversified Services and purchase 49.9% percent of IMM Office Systems Holding. In 1993, Triumph Group took over Alco Diversified Services in a leveraged buyout. Triumph conducted aviation repair and overhaul, industrial machining, paper converting and steel converting. The companies employed 1450 people at 22 US locations, with aviation accounting for just over 25% of total sales.
In 1995, due to Department of Defense cutbacks, Triumph sold Otto Konigslow Manufacturing Company (which manufactured aerospace components) to two of its supervisors.
In the middle of the 1990s, commercial aviation sales went from $200 million to $300 million in three years, with forecasts indicating that sales would reach $500 million before the end of the decade. The aviation businesses provided 67% of the company's revenue. With never-before-seen demand for airline travel around 1996, Boeing produced close to 500 aircraft per annum. To meet this unprecedented production rate, Boeing outsourced a greater number of components and services.
In 1996, the corporation had 1500 workers and yearly earnings of $300 million. Six divisions worked in aviation while the other seven worked in specialty materials. The company went public at that time, which provided over $50 million in revenue.
The company focused on purchasing aviation companies in an attempt to increase profits by 20% per annum, and extend their product lines. Such acquisitions included Air Lab (1995), Teleflex Controls (1996), Hydro-Mill Company (1997), DV Industries (1998), DG Industries (1998), Chase Aerospace Limited (1998) and Hartford Tool and Die (1998).
The company also sold businesses that were not part of their aviation-focused strategy, such as Quality Park Products (1996) and Air Lab (1997).
In 1998, when Ill subsequently announced his preoccupations about cutbacks in aircraft production at Boeing Company, he also stated that there may be more work forthcoming on the new Boeing 737. This was an excellent fit for Triumph Air Repair, as much of their work consisted of servicing the Boeing 727 and 737 aircraft. It was at this time that Boeing Company purchased McDonnell Douglas, the first company to manufacture the KC-10 aircraft, which was the aerial refueling version of the Boeing DC-10. Soon to follow would be Triumph Air Repair's largest contract ever, a twelve-month deal to service auxiliary power units and line replaceable units for the United States Air Force KC-10 tankers. Boeing had several options to renew, increasing the potential of this arrangement ninefold.
In 1998, Triumph acquired four additional companies, bringing its grand total of subsidiaries to eighteen and its employee count to over two thousand in early 1999. It was at this time that Triumph purchased Ralee Engineering, a manufacturer of gigantic aircraft components and assemblies. This gave the conglomerate the ability to produce almost all of the parts used in commercial aircraft.
In 1999, Triumph infused six more companies into its colossal lineup of subsidiaries. The company produced flight control surfaces, control systems, and metal parts while providing MRO for almost every aircraft system except cabins, communications devices, landing gear, engines and the most comprehensive maintenance checks.[6]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the Boeing Company's failing Spokane, Washington facility was acquired, which is now known as Triumph Composite Systems. The conglomerate now stood at 41 companies.[7] In the same quarter of that year, the company restructured by discontinuing its Metals Group and combining its five aviation segments into three. The Control Systems and Structures Groups were combined into Triumph Aerospace Systems Group. The Gas Turbine Services and Operational Components Groups were unified, becoming Triumph Components Group. Triumph Aftermarket Services Group added Advanced Materials Technologies and Aerospace Technologies to its portfolio.[8]
Shortly thereafter, Triumph acquired the Parker Hannifin Corporation United Aircraft Products Division and Rolls-Royce Gear Systems. The company then reorganized into two groups, Triumph Aftermarket Services and Triumph Aerospace Systems. It also combined several of its Arizona subsidiaries into Triumph Engineered Solutions, which was decommissioned at the end of 2004.[9]
In 2009, Triumph Group purchased Mexmil Company, Kongsberg Automotive, Merritt Tool Company and Saygrove Defense & Aerospace Group.[10]
2010s[edit]
In June 2010, Triumph Group acquired Vought Aircraft Industries, a leading producer of aerostructures from the Carlyle Group. This acquisition close to doubled the company workforce, and created a 'Tier One Capable' supplier.[11][12]
In January 2014 the company sold its division Lee Aerospace back to the its original founder, Jim Lee. Triumph had owned Lee Aerospace for 14 years.[13]
In December 2015, Triumph Group Inc. announced that Daniel J. Crowley would be named president and chief executive officer effective 4 January 2016. Crowley succeeds Richard C. Ill, CEO from 1993-2012. Ill left retirement to step in after Jeffry D. Frisby resigned.[14]

History[edit]
1980s[edit]
Triumph Group was formerly one of the companies in Alco Standard Corporation, a loose conglomerate of diversified companies that operated across a large number of unrelated fields, including office supplies.[5] By the latter half of the decade, officers of Alco Standard Corporation were concentrating on office supplies, paper products and food services, their three core competencies. The former was the fastest growing market for the company.
In 1986, Alco was considering selling Triumph Group and its distribution businesses, the former of which competed in the aerospace industry and earned just under 3% of Alco Standard's revenue.
1990s[edit]
In addition to its aerospace factions, Triumph also had a stake in the U.S. steel industry. Because customers were becoming more demanding with respect to product quality, Alco Standard formed a new organization named Alco Diversified Services out of the 11 companies that comprised the Triumph Group, the two paper companies and their aerospace subsidiary. Richard Ill, who led Triumph Group for several years, was promoted to president of Alco Diversified Services.
In 1991, Alco sold their food division. In 1992, the corporation made an announcement that it was trying to sell Alco Diversified Services and purchase 49.9% percent of IMM Office Systems Holding. In 1993, Triumph Group took over Alco Diversified Services in a leveraged buyout. Triumph conducted aviation repair and overhaul, industrial machining, paper converting and steel converting. The companies employed 1450 people at 22 US locations, with aviation accounting for just over 25% of total sales.
In 1995, due to Department of Defense cutbacks, Triumph sold Otto Konigslow Manufacturing Company (which manufactured aerospace components) to two of its supervisors.
In the middle of the 1990s, commercial aviation sales went from $200 million to $300 million in three years, with forecasts indicating that sales would reach $500 million before the end of the decade. The aviation businesses provided 67% of the company's revenue. With never-before-seen demand for airline travel around 1996, Boeing produced close to 500 aircraft per annum. To meet this unprecedented production rate, Boeing outsourced a greater number of components and services.
In 1996, the corporation had 1500 workers and yearly earnings of $300 million. Six divisions worked in aviation while the other seven worked in specialty materials. The company went public at that time, which provided over $50 million in revenue.
The company focused on purchasing aviation companies in an attempt to increase profits by 20% per annum, and extend their product lines. Such acquisitions included Air Lab (1995), Teleflex Controls (1996), Hydro-Mill Company (1997), DV Industries (1998), DG Industries (1998), Chase Aerospace Limited (1998) and Hartford Tool and Die (1998).
The company also sold businesses that were not part of their aviation-focused strategy, such as Quality Park Products (1996) and Air Lab (1997).
In 1998, when Ill subsequently announced his preoccupations about cutbacks in aircraft production at Boeing Company, he also stated that there may be more work forthcoming on the new Boeing 737. This was an excellent fit for Triumph Air Repair, as much of their work consisted of servicing the Boeing 727 and 737 aircraft. It was at this time that Boeing Company purchased McDonnell Douglas, the first company to manufacture the KC-10 aircraft, which was the aerial refueling version of the Boeing DC-10. Soon to follow would be Triumph Air Repair's largest contract ever, a twelve-month deal to service auxiliary power units and line replaceable units for the United States Air Force KC-10 tankers. Boeing had several options to renew, increasing the potential of this arrangement ninefold.
In 1998, Triumph acquired four additional companies, bringing its grand total of subsidiaries to eighteen and its employee count to over two thousand in early 1999. It was at this time that Triumph purchased Ralee Engineering, a manufacturer of gigantic aircraft components and assemblies. This gave the conglomerate the ability to produce almost all of the parts used in commercial aircraft.
In 1999, Triumph infused six more companies into its colossal lineup of subsidiaries. The company produced flight control surfaces, control systems, and metal parts while providing MRO for almost every aircraft system except cabins, communications devices, landing gear, engines and the most comprehensive maintenance checks.[6]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the Boeing Company's failing Spokane, Washington facility was acquired, which is now known as Triumph Composite Systems. The conglomerate now stood at 41 companies.[7] In the same quarter of that year, the company restructured by discontinuing its Metals Group and combining its five aviation segments into three. The Control Systems and Structures Groups were combined into Triumph Aerospace Systems Group. The Gas Turbine Services and Operational Components Groups were unified, becoming Triumph Components Group. Triumph Aftermarket Services Group added Advanced Materials Technologies and Aerospace Technologies to its portfolio.[8]
Shortly thereafter, Triumph acquired the Parker Hannifin Corporation United Aircraft Products Division and Rolls-Royce Gear Systems. The company then reorganized into two groups, Triumph Aftermarket Services and Triumph Aerospace Systems. It also combined several of its Arizona subsidiaries into Triumph Engineered Solutions, which was decommissioned at the end of 2004.[9]
In 2009, Triumph Group purchased Mexmil Company, Kongsberg Automotive, Merritt Tool Company and Saygrove Defense & Aerospace Group.[10]
2010s[edit]
In June 2010, Triumph Group acquired Vought Aircraft Industries, a leading producer of aerostructures from the Carlyle Group. This acquisition close to doubled the company workforce, and created a 'Tier One Capable' supplier.[11][12]
In January 2014 the company sold its division Lee Aerospace back to the its original founder, Jim Lee. Triumph had owned Lee Aerospace for 14 years.[13]
In December 2015, Triumph Group Inc. announced that Daniel J. Crowley would be named president and chief executive officer effective 4 January 2016. Crowley succeeds Richard C. Ill, CEO from 1993-2012. Ill left retirement to step in after Jeffry D. Frisby resigned.[14]

History[edit]
1980s[edit]
Triumph Group was formerly one of the companies in Alco Standard Corporation, a loose conglomerate of diversified companies that operated across a large number of unrelated fields, including office supplies.[5] By the latter half of the decade, officers of Alco Standard Corporation were concentrating on office supplies, paper products and food services, their three core competencies. The former was the fastest growing market for the company.
In 1986, Alco was considering selling Triumph Group and its distribution businesses, the former of which competed in the aerospace industry and earned just under 3% of Alco Standard's revenue.
1990s[edit]
In addition to its aerospace factions, Triumph also had a stake in the U.S. steel industry. Because customers were becoming more demanding with respect to product quality, Alco Standard formed a new organization named Alco Diversified Services out of the 11 companies that comprised the Triumph Group, the two paper companies and their aerospace subsidiary. Richard Ill, who led Triumph Group for several years, was promoted to president of Alco Diversified Services.
In 1991, Alco sold their food division. In 1992, the corporation made an announcement that it was trying to sell Alco Diversified Services and purchase 49.9% percent of IMM Office Systems Holding. In 1993, Triumph Group took over Alco Diversified Services in a leveraged buyout. Triumph conducted aviation repair and overhaul, industrial machining, paper converting and steel converting. The companies employed 1450 people at 22 US locations, with aviation accounting for just over 25% of total sales.
In 1995, due to Department of Defense cutbacks, Triumph sold Otto Konigslow Manufacturing Company (which manufactured aerospace components) to two of its supervisors.
In the middle of the 1990s, commercial aviation sales went from $200 million to $300 million in three years, with forecasts indicating that sales would reach $500 million before the end of the decade. The aviation businesses provided 67% of the company's revenue. With never-before-seen demand for airline travel around 1996, Boeing produced close to 500 aircraft per annum. To meet this unprecedented production rate, Boeing outsourced a greater number of components and services.
In 1996, the corporation had 1500 workers and yearly earnings of $300 million. Six divisions worked in aviation while the other seven worked in specialty materials. The company went public at that time, which provided over $50 million in revenue.
The company focused on purchasing aviation companies in an attempt to increase profits by 20% per annum, and extend their product lines. Such acquisitions included Air Lab (1995), Teleflex Controls (1996), Hydro-Mill Company (1997), DV Industries (1998), DG Industries (1998), Chase Aerospace Limited (1998) and Hartford Tool and Die (1998).
The company also sold businesses that were not part of their aviation-focused strategy, such as Quality Park Products (1996) and Air Lab (1997).
In 1998, when Ill subsequently announced his preoccupations about cutbacks in aircraft production at Boeing Company, he also stated that there may be more work forthcoming on the new Boeing 737. This was an excellent fit for Triumph Air Repair, as much of their work consisted of servicing the Boeing 727 and 737 aircraft. It was at this time that Boeing Company purchased McDonnell Douglas, the first company to manufacture the KC-10 aircraft, which was the aerial refueling version of the Boeing DC-10. Soon to follow would be Triumph Air Repair's largest contract ever, a twelve-month deal to service auxiliary power units and line replaceable units for the United States Air Force KC-10 tankers. Boeing had several options to renew, increasing the potential of this arrangement ninefold.
In 1998, Triumph acquired four additional companies, bringing its grand total of subsidiaries to eighteen and its employee count to over two thousand in early 1999. It was at this time that Triumph purchased Ralee Engineering, a manufacturer of gigantic aircraft components and assemblies. This gave the conglomerate the ability to produce almost all of the parts used in commercial aircraft.
In 1999, Triumph infused six more companies into its colossal lineup of subsidiaries. The company produced flight control surfaces, control systems, and metal parts while providing MRO for almost every aircraft system except cabins, communications devices, landing gear, engines and the most comprehensive maintenance checks.[6]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the Boeing Company's failing Spokane, Washington facility was acquired, which is now known as Triumph Composite Systems. The conglomerate now stood at 41 companies.[7] In the same quarter of that year, the company restructured by discontinuing its Metals Group and combining its five aviation segments into three. The Control Systems and Structures Groups were combined into Triumph Aerospace Systems Group. The Gas Turbine Services and Operational Components Groups were unified, becoming Triumph Components Group. Triumph Aftermarket Services Group added Advanced Materials Technologies and Aerospace Technologies to its portfolio.[8]
Shortly thereafter, Triumph acquired the Parker Hannifin Corporation United Aircraft Products Division and Rolls-Royce Gear Systems. The company then reorganized into two groups, Triumph Aftermarket Services and Triumph Aerospace Systems. It also combined several of its Arizona subsidiaries into Triumph Engineered Solutions, which was decommissioned at the end of 2004.[9]
In 2009, Triumph Group purchased Mexmil Company, Kongsberg Automotive, Merritt Tool Company and Saygrove Defense & Aerospace Group.[10]
2010s[edit]
In June 2010, Triumph Group acquired Vought Aircraft Industries, a leading producer of aerostructures from the Carlyle Group. This acquisition close to doubled the company workforce, and created a 'Tier One Capable' supplier.[11][12]
In January 2014 the company sold its division Lee Aerospace back to the its original founder, Jim Lee. Triumph had owned Lee Aerospace for 14 years.[13]
In December 2015, Triumph Group Inc. announced that Daniel J. Crowley would be named president and chief executive officer effective 4 January 2016. Crowley succeeds Richard C. Ill, CEO from 1993-2012. Ill left retirement to step in after Jeffry D. Frisby resigned.[14]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
