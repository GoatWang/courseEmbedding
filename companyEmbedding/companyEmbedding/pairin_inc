AboutPAIRIN is a social enterprise company whose mission is to make education relevant and hiring equitable.Our Why PAIRIN was founded on the belief that all people have amazing value, but most of us never realize our potential. People are too often put into ill-fitting boxes, told we can’t, won’t and will never be able to attain our dreams. Many people hear this so much they never even dream big, or pursue their goals as if they are truly attainable. At PAIRIN, this is something we want to change.
Our Focus The PAIRIN team believes that by providing the right data, tools and resources, we can remove the barriers that prevent people and organizations from reaching maximum effectiveness. So, we give our all, every single day, to do what we can to change the way people and work are valued. 
We believe this problem requires solutions for three distinct groups:INDIVIDUALS must understand their strengths and what skills are in need of development to attain their goals.EDUCATORS and COACHES armed with those insights require the tools and expertise to help those in their care bridge critical gaps.EMPLOYERS need usable science to value the soft skills that truly matter to job performance, so their hiring processes can stop using arbitrary elimination criteria that removes entire classes of people from consideration.Why PAIRINPAIRIN is proud to have some pretty remarkable, but Friendly ScienceTM to support soft skills measurement and development. That’s a great reason to partner with us to attain your goals, but it’s not the most important reason to consider. 
Customers choose PAIRIN because we:
Consider your unique needs and goalsHelp you hire great people that you love working withSupport you in developing skills at every stepThe Process Making Science Friendly Since our founding, PAIRIN has made complicated science more friendly and accessible to the masses. Drawing from the most validated and well-accepted research in soft skills assessment, PAIRIN has revolutionized behavioral mapping by taking this advanced science and transforming it in an online format that every individual can now benefit from.
PAIRIN’s solution was built upon 60 years of research, 17 years of job performance measurement by the founders and was co-designed with partners from public education, industry, foundations and government.
The PAIRIN Survey consists of adjectives used to describe a person’s behavioral attributes and contains nine internal validity checks. Over the past 17 years, psychologists have successfully replicated virtually all major non-cognitive measures to create the most comprehensive system for assessing soft skills and mindsets in existence.

Press Release

									updated: Jun 27, 2017							

 





			DENVER, COLORADO, 
			June 27, 2017			(Newswire.com) -
	PAIRIN has been named a Colorado Company to Watch, acknowledging its drive, excellence and influence as a growing company in the state. Colorado Companies to Watch honors companies that develop valuable products and services, create quality jobs, enrich communities and create new industries throughout Colorado.
“It is an incredible honor to be named one of Colorado’s Companies to Watch, and we are excited to become a part of such an astounding group of companies who have received this award over the years,” said Michael Simpson, PAIRIN CEO and Co-founder. “This award motivates us as we move to the next phase of our growth, and emphasizes the confidence the Colorado community has in PAIRIN,” Michael added.
“We are pleased to recognize PAIRIN as one of Colorado’s 50 most innovative 2nd stage companies,” says Rick Ninneman, Colorado Companies to Watch Board Chairman. “These companies contribute significantly to the growth and economic independence of the state by developing new services and products, creating jobs, enriching communities and generating new industries.”

"It is an incredible honor to be named one of Colorado's Companies to Watch, and we are excited to become a part of such an astounding group of companies who have received this award over the years."


				Michael Simpson,
		PAIRIN CEO and Co-founder		
		
	


Colorado Companies to Watch works to recognize the driving economic forces in the state by focusing not merely on growth, but on the true impact and influence of an organization. By focusing on second stage companies across the state, the program offers distinct insight into the state’s economic landscape and recognizes organizations often overlooked for the critical impact they have in their industries, communities and regions, as well as our state as a whole.
PAIRIN is also the recent award winner of the Denver Chamber of Commerce’s Start-Up of the Year Award and has earned recognition in both the local and national landscapes as a successful business influencing the future of talent development in the nation. PAIRIN measures and develops the soft skills and mindsets that are 75 percent of what is needed for long-term success in career and life. PAIRIN’s unique approach to workforce development spans from students and career seekers to the businesses hiring from those programs, making its broad knowledgebase extremely valuable at each step of the workforce readiness pipeline.
About PAIRIN
PAIRIN is a social enterprise software company whose mission is to make education relevant and hiring equitable. The PAIRIN Readiness Management System™ is the world’s first industry independent cloud-based solution for integrating soft skills development and matching into any program or company. PAIRIN continues to lead the skills-based talent pipeline evolution for education and industry with their Friendly Science™ approach of making proven science more accessible to the masses.

About Colorado Companies to Watch
Colorado Companies to Watch is an awards program honoring 2nd-stage companies headquartered in the state of Colorado. The 400 companies that have been honored since the program’s inception demonstrate high performance in the marketplace or exhibit innovative products or processes. The program is designed to seek businesses from a wide range of industries throughout the state, not just the major metropolitan areas. The 50 companies selected each year make an astounding impact on Colorado's economy by collectively providing thousands of jobs and contributing millions of dollars in revenue. The Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT) launched the program in 2009 in conjunction with the Edward Lowe Foundation and valuable community partners from across Colorado.

DENVER, Feb. 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- PAIRIN announced today the launch of the new PAIRIN Lite product, which features a new model of licensing for science-based hiring solutions to meet the needs of small and medium business owners. PAIRIN's unique software as a service (SaaS) allows organizations to quickly and easily identify which job applicants are most like their top performers by prioritizing applicants via a ranking percentage.


Companies can survey their top performers to create custom targets by job role or to assess fit to the company's culture. And, they can now achieve this at a rate that is affordable for all businesses, regardless of size. By offering their assessment component for free for an unlimited amount of applicants, and allowing employers to use the system for free for one position forever, PAIRIN is lowering the cost barrier to bring the evaluation of soft skills to every single company.
Building upon science backed by 60 years of research and 16 years of business application by the founders, PAIRIN is the most comprehensive measurement in existence with over 100 essential skills, or "soft skills." These include a variety of qualities from strengths, virtues, emotional intelligence, as well as, mindsets and motivators. The importance of soft skills has been increasingly recognized by both employers and educators alike as at least 75% of the reason people succeed or fail in a job, making the evaluation provided through PAIRIN a beneficial tool to hiring managers in identifying and predicting an individual's long-term advancement at a company.
"PAIRIN Lite is the first solution to put highly-sophisticated science that was previously too costly and complicated, into the hands of hiring managers at small and medium businesses so they can finally make reliable hiring decisions based on the same employee performance factors as Fortune 500 companies with huge budget leverage," said Michael Simpson, PAIRIN Co-founder and CEO. "Now, any business can make very wise hiring decisions for free, get custom interview guides, and identify exactly what makes their top performers great," he added.
Beyond the initial time and money savings, PAIRIN also provides hiring leaders with a multitude of resources to make their lives easier during and after the hiring process. PAIRIN offers over 1,200 proven interview questions that are suggested based on an individual's profile strengths and weaknesses, allowing managers to be able to conduct the most productive interviews. Applicants are organized in a single cloud-based location with resumes, contact information, and ranking scores displayed for quick and easy access. Skill gaps are also identified and can be used to chart and measure professional development plans for employees from the very start.
