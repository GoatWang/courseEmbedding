Parity

What is 'Parity'
Parity refers to two things being equal to each other. The term "par value" for a bond is similar to parity. Parity can also refer to two securities having equal value, such as a convertible bond and the value of the stock if the bondholder chooses to convert into common stock.
In an exchange market, parity occurs when all brokers bidding for the same security have equal standing due to identical bids. When parity occurs, the market must determine which bidding broker will obtain the security by alternative means. Therefore, the winning bid is typically awarded by random draw. In foreign exchange markets, currencies are at parity when the exchange rate relationship is exactly one to one.

BREAKING DOWN 'Parity'
Many investors have to make decisions about the value of two different investments. A convertible bond, for example, allows the investor to own a bond and earn a stated rate of interest or convert the bond into a fixed number of shares of common stock. Assume, for example, that an investor can own a $1,000 corporate bond with a market price of $1,200 or convert the bond into 100 shares of common stock. If the stock’s market price is $12, the market value of the 100 shares of stock is also $1,200. As a result, the bond and the stock are at parity.
Factoring in Options
The term "parity" also applies to stock options. One call option, for example, allows the owner to buy 100 shares of stock at a specific price (strike price) for a stated period of time. Assume that an investor owns a $50 call option that expires on September 30. The investor has the right to buy 100 shares of stock at $50 per share until the expiration date in September.
The intrinsic value of an option is the difference between the strike price and the market price of the stock. If the stock's market price is $60 per share, for example, the option's intrinsic value is $10 per share. If the market price of the call option is also $10 per share, the option is trading at parity.
How Currency Trading Defines Parity
Companies based in the United States that have operations in foreign countries must convert U.S. dollars into other currencies. If a U.S. firm does business in France, for example, the company can convert U.S. dollars into euros and sends those euros to fund its French business operations. If the exchange rate is $1 to €1, the currencies are at parity.
Examples of Parity in Asset Management
Risk parity is an asset management process that evaluates risk based on asset classes rather than allocation of capital. Tradition asset allocation strategy divides assets between stocks, bonds and cash. The goal is to provide diversify and reduce risk by using these the types of investments. Risk parity, on the other hand, allocates dollars based on four components: equities, credit, interest rates and commodities. Risk parity attempts to reduce risk and increase investment returns.

Risk Parity

What is 'Risk Parity'
Risk parity is a portfolio allocation strategy based on targeting risk levels across the various components of an investment portfolio. The risk parity approach to asset allocation allows investors to target specific levels of risk and to divide that risk equally across the entire investment portfolio in order to achieve optimal portfolio diversification for each individual investor. Risk parity strategies are in contrast to traditional allocation methods that are based on holding a certain percentage of investment classes, such as 60% stocks and 40% bonds, within one's investment portfolio.

BREAKING DOWN 'Risk Parity'
The risk parity approach to portfolio asset allocation focuses on the amount of risk in each component rather than the specific dollar amounts invested in each component. In other words, risk parity focuses not on the allocation of capital (like traditional allocation models), but on the allocation of risk. Risk parity considers four different components: equities, credit, interest rates and commodities, and attempts to spread risk evenly across the asset classes. The goal of risk parity investing is to earn the same level of return with less volatility and risk, or to realize better returns with an equal amount of risk and volatility (versus traditional asset allocation strategies).
A traditional 60/40 portfolio can attribute 80 to 90% of its risk allocation to equities. As a result, the portfolio's returns will be dependent upon the returns of the equity markets. Proponents of the risk parity strategy state that while the 60/40 approach performs well during bull markets and periods of economic growth, it tends to fail during bear markets and economic slumps. The risk parity approach attempts to balance the portfolio to perform well under a variety of economic and market conditions.
Several risk parity-specific products, including mutual funds, are available, and investors can also build their own risk parity portfolios through careful research or by working with a qualified financial professional. The first risk parity fund, the All Weather hedge fund, was introduced by Bridgewater Associates in 1996.

                            ShapeShift Breaks New Ground With 'Prism' Digital Asset Portfolio Product                        

May 22, 2017 at 19:00 UTC by Pete Rizzo

Amid a booming market for cryptocurrencies, Swiss startup ShapeShift is launching a new kind of exchange that specializes in the sale of synthetic ethereum assets.
In short, its newest product, Prism, available today in closed beta, is less of an exchange and more a new way to trade cryptocurrencies, enabling users to create custom "prisms" by putting ether into a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain that is designed to mimic the price fluctuations of any of the hundreds of available cryptographic assets traded on exchanges.
And that's where ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees believes the company's second product could come to solve problems for traders and investors.
Voorhees told CoinDesk:
"If you want to get 20 different coins today, you have two ways of doing it. What most people do they make an account at the exchange, they make an account at the exchange and they just leave them there. It causes a huge counterparty risk."
Still, Voorhees cautioned that Prism isn't meant to be "all things to all people", but rather just a product for the growing number of more casual cryptocurrency users who want to gain exposure to certain assets without the risk created when dealing with exchanges.
And that's a valid concern in an industry where exchanges have proven susceptible to hacks, fraud and issues with banking providers that have impaired their operations and cost users money.
With Prism, the user experience changes. Instead of buying a cryptocurrency and keeping those funds on an exchange (or holding the keys in an offline wallet), users put a dollar amount, invest it in "bitcoin", "ether" and "monero" and select the exposure they would like the "portfolio" to have relative to the price fluctuations of each asset.

In this case, there is no bitcoin or monero, only ether in a smart contract that changes its value based on data fed to an oracle that receives its prices from traditional exchanges.
"Now that the Prism has been created, the investor can watch the current value of their portfolio, which will rise and fall with the value of the underlying assets," the company stated.
There's also a social component, with the most successful prisms showing up on a leaderboard of where these custom assets are ranked. "People can see the Prism you made, and they can clone it and make their own portfolio," Voorhees said.

In this way, the product is the latest that seeks to capitalize in the run-up of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, which exceeded $60bn for the first time this year, reaching a new all-time high last week.
The basics
Users create Prisms by first putting up a certain amount of collateral (denominated in ether) into a smart contract. (Behind the scenes, a smart contract operated by ShapeShift deploys a smart contract that represents the portfolio.)

Users then fund the address they provide, and for which they responsible for maintaining, keeping the custody of the assets underlying the portfolio.

Finally, users send funds to the address, thereby creating a contract. The result is that the portfolio doesn't even hold ether assets, but rather it tracks contract terms, which are set up to change to track the value of all the assets.
"A prism portfolio doesn't have a bunch of proxy tokens sitting somewhere, it is simply ethereum as collateral put into the contract by the buyer and ether put into the contract from the seller, and the price can rise and fall," he continued.

The back-end
Still, to create the Prism, another user needs to take the other side of the trade that sets up the account, effectively betting against each investment in the portfolio.
Future versions of the product, Voorhees said, may enable users to enter into such agreements with other users, but to start, ShapeShift will be the counterparty to every transaction, hedging its trades in the background to ensure the integrity of its finances.
"The simplest explanation is you make a prism of 1 bitcoin, that's the whole prism. It's worth 1 bitcoin. ShapeShift takes the other side of that, so that means ShapeShift is short 1 bitcoin. ShapeShift just buys a bitcoin from someone, then if bitcoin goes up it lost $10 on the prism, but gained $10 on bitcoin, so it's a wash," he explained.
In this way, ShapeShift will make its money on closing costs associated with the accounts.
Users will be charged a 2.4% fee to close out Prisms, plus 0.05 ETH (about $6 today), a fee that covers the gas cost the ShapeShift must pay to run the smart contracts on the public ethereum blockchain.
As the Prisms are fully with ether capital, there's also a 1% per month fee paid to cover that cost of capital.
Iterative drive
The product launch also marks an evolution for ShapeShift, originally founded in 2013 as an advancement over traditional order-book exchanges.
Instead of trading, users of the original ShapeShift project swap between cryptocurrencies, a process that occurs without the need for account creation or management, reducing trust in the service, and as long argued by Voorhees, creating a value proposition in line with the spirit of decentralized economic networks.
Still, Voorhees appears to already be thinking ahead to the next step.
In conversation, he mentions how the technology exists for users to take their Prism and issue tokens on the ethereum blockchain representing shares in that Prism.
"There's no block on someone doing that," he said.
Voorhees has even gone so far as to conceptualize a time when regulated firms may even use a white-label version of the service, or a similar type of technology, for the more traditional financial assets that are well-known by Wall Street.
When broaching the subject, I even float the idea, speculating it could as far as 20 years into the future, should the technology mature sufficiently.
Voorhees concluded:
"Well, more like in five years, but I don't want to get into that too much."

A traditional asset allocation framework allocates to various asset classes with the goal of matching important risk exposures. In reality, many asset classes share exposures to common risk factors and thus are highly correlated, particularly with equities. This article explains how investors can achieve more intuitive and perhaps more sensible portfolios with an approach based on risk factors.
The traditional asset allocation framework, unsurprisingly, starts with assets. It is a tradition based on convenience and, perhaps, an implicit assumption that key asset classes match well to the important risk exposures. The more modern asset allocation and analytic framework anchors, instead, on “risks.”1  While the two frameworks may lead to similar outcomes, the risk-based approach can often offer greater simplicity and allow for more natural asset allocation intuition. In this article, I explain the benefits of the risk-based approach relative to the asset-based approach. Additionally, I introduce simplifying analogies, which facilitate building intuition on the differences between the two approaches. Toward the end of the article, I also offer three applications of the risk-based framework to demonstrate investment issues, which, otherwise, would not be apparent in an asset-based analytical framework. However, a complete description on how to implement a risk-based approach is outside of the scope of this article. 
Asset Classes vs. Risk Exposures
In the asset-based framework, the allocation process involves assigning weights to the various asset classes available to the investor (e.g., equities, bonds, commodities, real estate, etc.). Asset classes are captured by their corresponding market indexes. Each specific major asset category is split across finer asset classes such as U.S., international, and emerging markets for equities, and U.S. Treasuries, sovereigns, and corporates for bonds. In this framework, assets are investment vehicles for “owning” risk exposures; so the “asset-based” approach is, essentially, an “investment product-based” approach.
The more modern analytical framework is a risk-based approach, which makes a strong distinction between investment vehicles and risk exposures. In this framework, the allocation process involves assigning weights to a set of risk exposures rather than assets. The allocation process first determines the “risks” that an investor wants to hold, taking into account how the risks interact with each other and the premia they generate. Then, the investor can construct his preferred combination of “assets” to achieve his desired risk exposures, taking into account the valuation levels attached to assets. Typically, the investor will have a preference for using “attractively priced” assets to access the desired risk exposure.2
The standard criticism of the traditional asset-based approach is that it leads to portfolios that are dominated by equity-like risk, even though portfolios appear to be well diversified.3 This occurs, in part, because very different assets can often contain significant exposure to equity-like risk. Generally, most researchers agree that there are a few primary economic risk exposures: shocks to economic growth, shocks to inflation, and shocks to credit availability, among others. Many assets, if not most, contain multiple risk exposures. For example, corporate bonds are exposed to all three of the above risks. Similarly, high yielding stocks can also have significant exposure to all three risks. Therefore, adding high yield bonds to a portfolio of high yielding stocks wouldn’t necessarily improve the portfolio’s risk diversification, despite the increase in asset class diversification.
Nutrients are to Foods as Risks are to Assets
The risk-based approach, with its associated technical jargon such as “risk factor loadings,” can seem unintuitive to many investors. I find the following food analogy to be very effective at illustrating the risk-based framework.4 It is often convenient to think of risks as nutrients, assets as foods, and portfolios as meals. People need to consume a mix of nutrients, which vary by individual circumstances. Because nutrients come bundled in various foods—dairy, grains, meats, for example—people must combine foods to create a meal that supplies them with the desired nutrition. However, it is likely that many different meals would provide comparable nutrition. Thus, personal taste and food prices often dictate the preferred meal.5
In asset allocation language, individual asset classes contain different risk exposures. A desired combination of risks can be achieved with different asset allocation portfolios. Ultimately, prices, costs, and investment governance will dictate the preferred portfolio.
The food analogy is also helpful for understanding tactical asset allocation (TAA). For example, when food prices change, we can choose to consume the same nutrients at a lower cost by eating a different meal consisting of different food ingredients. In the risk framework, TAA can be understood as tactically rebalancing toward out-of-favor assets that provide “cheaper” access to a set of underlying economic risks and away from the “expensive” assets offering the same risk exposures.
Applications of the Risk-Based Framework
We illustrate the risk-based framework with the following three applications. These applications are meant to illustrate investment insights, which would not be available through the traditional asset-based analysis.
Application 1: Re-thinking “rebalancing and the strategic portfolio weights”
In the asset-based framework, the stocks (proxied by the S&P 500 Index) and bonds (proxied by the BarCap Agg Index) are viewed as fundamental portfolio building blocks. U.S. investors generally hold large (and often static) strategic allocations tied to the two benchmarks, with a 60% equity/40% bond strategic allocation as the traditional “norm.”
It is dangerous, however, to assume that the S&P 500 or the BarCap Agg6 are assets with static risk exposures over time. In 1995, technology stocks comprised 9.4% of the S&P 500. The index had a P/E ratio of 17.4 and a dividend yield of 2.2%. In 2000, technology stocks became 21.2% of the S&P 500, pushing the index volatility from its historical average of 15% to 24%, the P/E ratio to 24.4, and the dividend yield to 1.2%. Similarly, in 2000 the BarCap Agg had a 4.5 year duration, while yielding 6.4%. Today, the BarCap Agg has duration risk of 5 years, while yield fell to an abysmal 1.6%. Clearly, a disciplined rebalance back toward the 60/40 allocation over this period would have produced a portfolio with wildly fluctuating underlying risk exposures!
Using the food analogy again, it is instructive to think of the BarCap Agg as a hamburger. As America demanded more “manly” beef patties, fast food restaurants moved to double patties, often with bacon to boot. The proteins, not to mention the calories and fat, of today’s gourmet burgers are significantly higher than the burgers of the past (333 calories for an average burger 20 years ago vs. 590 calories today). Given the Agg’s significant increase in duration risk, not to mention the lower yield—is it wise to still insist on a hamburger combo meal? In fact, would it not be better to change our meal completely and source our proteins and calories from cheaper ingredients?
Application 2: Interpreting hedge fund performances
 From the asset-based framework, hedge funds are particularly difficult to examine. Many hedge funds trade exotic and illiquid assets. The hedge funds, which hold conventional securities, would often apply complex strategies involving leverage and shorting. The complexity has sometimes led investors to treat hedge funds as a separate asset class, to which the cynics retort that the only shared characteristics for entrees in the asset class are opacity and high fees.
Much of the black-box complexity can be unraveled in the risk-based space, providing some useful insights into hedge fund strategies. It turns out that many hedge fund strategies can be mimicked using more liquid and traditional assets. This is because many hedge funds, despite their exotic holdings and strategies, actually (probably unintentionally) end up owning fairly commonplace risk exposures. Further, for the average funds, there is often little evidence that accessing standard risks through more exotic assets or using complex trading strategies has led to superior returns.7  To be fair, some hedge funds may provide exotic risk exposures that are not found in conventional assets or strategies. For example, earning returns from exposures to extreme economic shocks by writing options is an innovation that expands the investment frontier.
Using our nutrient analogy, hedge fund providers argue that their products provide exclusive nutritional compounds in the form of “alphas” and rare nutrients in the form of “exotic betas.” Hard-to-get nutrients and exclusive health compounds are necessarily expensive. We now know that the average hedge fund actually provides nutrients that can be found, readily, in standard assets; only a small fraction of hedge funds truly provide the hard-to-get “exotic betas” and even fewer provide proprietary “alpha.” In this context, most hedge funds are more like foo-foo health foods, such as bird nest and shark fin, which, at hundreds to thousands of dollars per pound, are advertised to combat aging and cancer, but actually contain nothing more than garden variety vitamins and proteins.
Application 3: Risk parity
 Risk parity is an asset allocation portfolio heuristic that attempts to provide a diversified portfolio of risk exposures. Specifically, it seeks to overcome the heavy dependence on equities in the conventional 60/40 allocation portfolio. The implementation of the concept is often in the “asset” space. This means there would be parity in the assets’ contribution to the overall portfolio volatility, but no parity in the underlying economic risk exposures.
The popular and standard risk parity solution is based on volatility weighting of “distinct” asset classes. As with a naïve reliance on the 60/40 allocation, a naïve asset-based approach to risk parity is also sub-optimal, because asset classes can often appear distinct but actually contain similar risks.8 A seemingly diversified risk parity portfolio, constructed from equities, commodities, high yield credit, real estate, and bonds, is like a mixed grill of beef, pork, lamb, and chicken with a small side salad—i.e., not a balanced meal nutritionally. This risk parity portfolio probably provides no better diversification than a simple 60/40 equity/bond portfolio.
Conclusion
When investors analyze choices in the asset-based framework, the large variety of different yet related assets can make the analysis extremely complex; naïve investors can often mistake the asset diversity in their portfolios for adequate risk diversification. Further, because assets contain both risks and valuation in the same bundle, it would lead to easier analyses if we unbundle the two components. The risk-based approach to asset allocation allows us to separate the two, leading to more intuitive and perhaps more sensible portfolio solutions. Despite the technical jargon and the seemingly more abstract framework, the risk-based approach has a lot to offer investors—particularly in a world where investment options and strategies are becoming exponentially more complex.

1. The modern approach has grown out of the literature on APT (see Ross, 1976) and the subsequent refinement of the risk factors into meaningful economic risk exposure (see Chen, Roll, and Ross, 1986).
2. Note that this “unbundling” of risk and valuation decision allows us to think carefully about what (beta) risks we are willing to take to earn returns and to examine how diversified our sources of “beta” risks are. The valuation question enters next. For many investors, who believe that assets can be mispriced relative to their risk exposures, this offers an opportunity for asset allocation “alpha” through selecting cheaper assets to gain the desired risk exposures.
3. Note that the classic pension portfolio, structured from the 60/40 equity/bond construct, has 90% of its total portfolio variance driven by equity risk. See Bhansali, Davis, Hsu, Li, and Rennison (2012) for a review of the risk concentration issue commonly found in asset-based asset allocation approaches.
4. The nutrient vs. food analogy is not original; it has been used previously by Professor John Cochrane at the University of Chicago and Professor Andrew Ang at Columbia University.
5. Also important is that some assets provide access to a particular risk without introducing other unwanted risks. For example, chicken breasts provide protein more effectively than rib-eye steaks, which are both more expensive and contain more artery-clogging saturated fat.
6. BarCap Agg is the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index, which is one of the most commonly used bond indices.  It contains almost all of the U.S. investment grade bonds, including Treasury, agency, mortgage, and corporate bonds; the weights are based on market capitalization of the bond issues.  The index is generally dominated by Treasury bonds due to the issuance size of U.S. Treasuries relative to other bonds.
7. See Fung and Hsieh (1997a,b, 2004), Aggrawal and Naik (2000), Ennis and Sebastian (2003), and Hasanhodzic and Lo (2007). For a comprehensive survey review of the literature on hedge fund performance, see Eling (2008).

Can Risk Parity Outperform If Yields Rise?

Topic:
Risk Parity




AQR White Paper
Risk parity investing is, in our view, a reasonable investment strategy which emphasizes diversification over concentration. It is not, as some critics have said, simply “leveraging bonds.” We believe there is strong theoretical and empirical backing to suggest that more diversified portfolios, like risk parity portfolios, can produce superior risk-adjusted returns relative to concentrated portfolios.
Over the long term, we believe risk parity persistently offers a small edge that can compound to a large advantage over time. That edge has held up historically, even during long periods of moderately rising interest rates and even if that cumulative rise in rates is substantial.
To be sure, risk parity investing is not a panacea. If all asset classes go down, a risk parity portfolio will lose money. When equities are soaring, it may do very well but will likely underperform 60/40 equity/bond portfolios and other strategies that load up on equity risk. When interest rates rise sharply — and, more generally, when multiple nonequity asset classes perform poorly — risk parity will, at times, struggle to keep up with equity-dominated portfolios. 
However, as this paper demonstrates, risk parity may outperform strategies dependent on equity risk in the long run, even though a prolonged period of rising rates. Anyone evaluating risk parity should consider a range of scenarios, including the equity crash that severely hurts 60/40 investors, as well as more-common situations where some asset classes perform reasonably well and others perform not so well. In these more-common scenarios, diversification would provide meaningful benefit to a portfolio.
