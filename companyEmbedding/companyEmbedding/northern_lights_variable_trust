SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search.htm, or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. The Fund was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on November 2, 2005 and is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company (File No. 811-21853). The Fund is a series investment company as defined by Rule 18f-2 under the 1940 Act and is currently comprised of fourteen portfolios managed by seven different investment advisers and three subadvisers. The portfolios share a single Board of Trustees (“Board”) and service providers for example, auditors and fund counsel. The investment advisers are not affiliated with Gemini and may or may not be affiliated with each other.
2. Shares of the portfolios will not be sold to the general public, but will be offered to Separate Accounts of a Participating Insurance Company, Qualified Plans, the Adviser for seed money and General Accounts.
3. Gemini provides administrative, fund accounting and transfer agent services to the portfolios, subject to the supervision of the Board. Gemini may provide individuals to serve as officers of the Insurance Funds, which officers may be directors, officers or employees of Gemini or its affiliates. Gemini is paid a fee for its services, which may consist of a base fee, a per account fee and/or an asset-based fee.
4. The Insurance Funds may offer their Shares to Separate Accounts of Participating Insurance Companies to serve as an investment medium to support variable life insurance contracts (“VLI Contracts”) and variable annuity contracts (“VA Contracts”) (together, “Variable Contracts”) issued through such accounts. If a Separate Account is registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act, or is exempt from such registration under Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act, it will be a “separate account” as defined by Rule 0-1(e) (or any successor rule) under the 1940 Act. For purposes of the Act, the Participating Insurance Company that Start Printed Page 44626establishes such a Separate Account is the depositor and sponsor of the account as those terms have been interpreted by the Commission with respect to variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts.
5. As described more fully below, the Insurance Funds will sell Shares to Separate Accounts only if each Participating Insurance Company sponsoring such a Separate Account enters into a participation agreement (a “Participation Agreement”) with such Insurance Fund. The Participation Agreement will govern participation by the Participating Insurance Company in such Insurance Fund and will memorialize, among other matters, the fact that the Participating Insurance Company will remain responsible for establishing and maintaining any Separate Account covered by the Participation Agreement and for complying with all applicable requirements of state and federal law pertaining to such accounts and to the sale and distribution of variable contracts issued through such accounts. The role of the Insurance Funds under this arrangement insofar as federal securities laws are applicable, will consist of offering Shares to the Separate Accounts and fulfilling any conditions that the Commission may impose upon granting the order.
6. The use of a common management investment company (or investment portfolio thereof) as an investment medium for both VLI Accounts and VA Accounts of the same Participating Insurance Company, or of two or more insurance companies that are affiliated persons of each other, is referred to herein as “mixed funding.” The use of a common management investment company (or investment portfolio thereof) as an investment medium for VLI Accounts and/or VA Accounts of two or more Participating Insurance Companies that are not affiliated persons of each other, is referred to herein as “shared funding.”
7. Applicants propose that the Insurance Funds be permitted to offer and sell Shares to Qualified Plans administered by a trustee. Federal tax law permits investment companies to increase their net assets by selling shares to Qualified Plans.
8. Qualified Plans may invest in shares of an investment company as the sole investment under the Qualified Plan, or as one of several investments. Qualified Plan participants may or may not be given an investment choice depending on the terms of the Qualified Plan itself. The trustees or other fiduciaries of a Qualified Plan may vote investment company shares held by the Qualified Plan in their own discretion or, if the applicable Qualified Plan so provides, vote such shares in accordance with instructions from participants in such Qualified Plans. Applicants have no control over whether trustees or other fiduciaries of Qualified Plans, rather than participants in the Qualified Plans, have the right to vote under any particular Qualified Plan. Each Qualified Plan must be administered in accordance with the terms of the Qualified Plan and as determined by its trustee or trustees.
9. Applicants propose that the Insurance Funds may also sell Shares to its Adviser for the purpose of providing seed capital to a portfolio. The Treasury Regulations permit such sales as long as the return on shares held by the adviser or an affiliate is computed in the same manner as shares held by Separate Accounts, the adviser or an affiliate does not intend to sell the shares to the public, and sales to an investment adviser or affiliate are only made in connection with the creation of a series of an investment company. Applicants propose that the Insurance Funds also be permitted to offer and/or sell Shares to the General Accounts of Participating Insurance Companies. The Treasury regulations permit sales to general accounts as long as the return on shares held by general accounts is computed in the same manner as for shares held by Separate Accounts and the Participating Insurance Company does not intend to sell the shares to the public.
10. The use of a common management investment company (or investment portfolio thereof) as an investment medium for VLI Accounts, VA Accounts, investment advisers, a General Account and Qualified Plans is referred to herein as “extended mixed funding.”
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 9(a)(2) of the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for any company to serve as an investment adviser or principal underwriter of any investment company, including a unit investment trust, if an affiliated person of that company is subject to disqualification enumerated in Section 9(a)(1) or (2) of the Act. Sections 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act have been deemed by the Commission to require “pass-through” voting with respect to an underlying investment company's shares.
2. Rule 6e-2(b)(15) under the 1940 Act provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the Act to VLI Accounts organized as unit investment trusts (“UITs”) supporting scheduled premium VLI Contracts and to their life insurance company depositors. The exemptions granted by the Rule are available, however, only where a fund offers its shares exclusively to VLI Accounts of the same Participating Insurance Company and/or of Participating Insurance Companies that are affiliated persons of the same Participating Insurance Company and then, only where scheduled premium VLI Contracts are issued through such VLI Accounts. Therefore, VLI Accounts, their depositors and their principal underwriters may not rely on the exemptions provided by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) if shares of a portfolio are held by a VLI Account through which flexible premium VLI Contracts are issued, a VLI Account of an unaffiliated Participating Insurance Company, an unaffiliated investment adviser, any VA Account or a Qualified Plan. In other words, Rule 6e-2(b)(15) does not provide exemptions when a scheduled premium VLI Account invests in shares of a management investment company that serves as a vehicle for mixed funding, extended mixed funding or shared funding.
3. Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) under the 1940 Act provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the Act to VLI Accounts organized as UITs supporting flexible premium variable life insurance contracts and their life insurance company depositors. The exemptions granted by the Rule are available, however, only where a fund offers its shares exclusively to VLI Accounts (through which either scheduled premium or flexible premium VLI Contracts are issued) of the same Participating Insurance Company and/or of Participating Insurance Companies that are affiliated persons of the same Participating Insurance Company, VA Accounts of the same Participating Insurance Company or of affiliated Participating Insurance Companies, or the General Account of the same Participating Insurance Company or of affiliated Participating Insurance Companies. Therefore, VLI Accounts, their depositors and their principal underwriters may not rely on the exemptions provided by Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) if shares of a portfolio are held by a VLI Account of an unaffiliated Participating Insurance Company, a VA Account of an unaffiliated Participating Insurance Company, an unaffiliated investment adviser, the general account of an unaffiliated Participating Insurance Company, or a Qualified Plan. In other words, Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) provides exemptions when a VLI Account supporting flexible premium Start Printed Page 44627VLI Contracts invests in shares of a management investment company that serves as a vehicle for mixed funding but does not provide exemptions when such a VLI Account invests in shares of a management investment company that serves as a vehicle for extended mixed funding or shared funding.
4. As explained below, Applicants maintain that there is no policy reason for the sale of Shares to Qualified Plans to prohibit or otherwise limit a VLI Account and its Participating Insurance Company depositor from relying on the relief provided by Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15). Notwithstanding, Rule 6e-2 and Rule 6e-3(T) each specifically provides that the relief granted thereunder is available only where shares of the underlying fund are offered exclusively to insurance company separate accounts. In this regard, Applicants request exemptive relief in cases where VLI Accounts hold Shares when such Shares are also sold to Qualified Plans.
5. Applicants are not aware of any reason for excluding separate accounts and investment companies engaged in shared funding from the exemptive relief provided under Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15), or for excluding separate accounts and investment companies engaged in mixed funding from the exemptive relief provided under Rule 6e-2(b)(15). Similarly, Applicants are not aware of any reason for excluding Participating Insurance Companies from the exemptive relief requested because the Insurance Funds may also sell their Shares to Qualified Plans. Rather, Applicants assert that the proposed sale of Shares to Qualified Plans, in fact, may allow for the development of larger pools of assets resulting in the potential for greater investment and diversification opportunities, and for decreased expenses at higher asset levels resulting in greater cost efficiencies.
6. For the reasons explained below, Applicants have concluded that investment by Qualified Plans in the Insurance Funds should not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts between owners of VLI Contracts and other types of investors or between owners of VLI Contracts issued by unaffiliated Participating Insurance Companies.
7. Consistent with the Commission's authority under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act to grant exemptive orders to a class or classes of persons and transactions, Applicants request exemptions for a class consisting of VLI Accounts investing in shares of existing and future portfolios of Insurance Funds, their Participating Insurance Company depositors and their principal underwriters.
8. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in part, that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision or provisions of the Act, or the rules or regulations thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants submit that the exemptions requested are appropriate and in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors, and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
9. Section 9(a)(3) of the 1940 Act provides, among other things, that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in Sections 9(a)(1) or (2). Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(i) and (ii) and Rules 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(i) and (ii) under the Act provide exemptions from Section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to the limitations discussed above on mixed funding, extended mixed funding and shared funding. These exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in management of the underlying investment company.
10. The relief provided by Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(i) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(i) permits a person that is disqualified under Sections 9(a)(1) or (2) of the 1940 Act to serve as an officer, director, or employee of the life insurance company, or any of its affiliates, so long as that person does not participate directly in the management or administration of the underlying investment company. The relief provided by Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(ii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(ii) under the 1940 Act permits the life insurance company to serve as the underlying investment company's investment adviser or principal underwriter, provided that none of the insurer's personnel who are ineligible pursuant to Section 9(a) participates in the management or administration of the investment company.
11. In effect, the partial relief granted in Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) under the 1940 Act from the requirements of Section 9 of the Act limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with Section 9 to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of Section 9. Those rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act to apply the provisions of Section 9(a) to all individuals in a large insurance complex, most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in that organization. Applicants assert that it is also unnecessary to apply Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act to the many individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies (or affiliated companies of Participating Insurance Companies) that may utilize the Insurance Funds as investment vehicles for Separate Accounts. There is no regulatory purpose served in extending the monitoring requirements to embrace a full application of Section 9(a)'s eligibility restrictions because of mixed funding, extended mixed funding or shared funding. The Participating Insurance Companies and Qualified Plans are not expected to play any role in the management of the Insurance Funds. Those individuals who participate in the management of the Insurance Funds will remain the same regardless of which VA Accounts, VLI Accounts, insurance companies, investment advisers, or Qualified Plans invest in the Insurance Funds. Applying the monitoring requirements of Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act because of investment by VLI Accounts and Qualified Plans would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory purpose. Furthermore, the increased monitoring costs could reduce the net rates of return realized by owners of VLI Contracts and Qualified Plan participants. Moreover, Qualified Plans, unlike separate accounts, are not themselves investment companies, and therefore are not subject to Section 9 of the 1940 Act. Furthermore, it is not anticipated that a Qualified Plan would be an affiliated person of an Insurance Fund except by virtue of its holding 5% or more of an Insurance Fund's shares.
12. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii) under the 1940 Act provide exemptions from pass-through voting requirements with respect to several significant matters, assuming the limitations on mixed funding, extended mixed funding and shared funding are observed. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(A) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A) provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its variable life insurance contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying Start Printed Page 44628investment company, or any contract between such an investment company and its investment adviser, when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority (subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A) of Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T)).
13. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(B) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)(2) provide that an insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of owners of its variable life insurance contracts if such owners initiate any change in an underlying investment company's investment policies, principal underwriter or any investment adviser (provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii), (b)(7)(ii)(B) and (b)(7)(ii)(C) of Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T)).
14. In the case of a change in the investment policies of the underlying investment company, the insurance company, in order to disregard contract owner voting instructions, must make a good faith determination that such a change either would: (1) Violate state law, or (2) result in investments that either (a) would not be consistent with the investment objectives of its separate account, or (b) would vary from the general quality and nature of investments and investment techniques used by other separate accounts of the company, or of an affiliated life insurance company with similar investment objectives.
15. Both Rule 6e-2 and Rule 6e-3(T) generally recognize that a variable life insurance contract is primarily a life insurance contract containing many important elements unique to life insurance contracts and is subject to extensive state insurance regulation. In adopting subparagraph (b)(15)(iii) of these Rules, the Commission implicitly recognized that state insurance regulators have authority, pursuant to state insurance laws or regulations, to disapprove or require changes in investment policies, investment advisers, or principal underwriters.
16. The sale of Shares to Qualified Plans or the Adviser will not have any impact on the exemptions requested herein regarding the disregard of pass-through voting rights. Shares sold to Qualified Plans will be held by such Qualified Plans, not insurance companies. The exercise of voting rights by Qualified Plans, whether by trustees, other fiduciaries, participants, beneficiaries, or investment managers engaged by the Qualified Plans, does not raise the type of issues respecting disregard of voting rights that are raised by VLI Accounts. With respect to Qualified Plans, which are not registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act, there is no requirement to pass through voting rights to Qualified Plan participants. Indeed, to the contrary, applicable law expressly reserves voting rights associated with Qualified Plan assets to certain specified persons.
17. If a named fiduciary to a Qualified Plan appoints an investment manager, the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held, unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustee(s) or another named fiduciary. The Qualified Plans may have their trustee(s) or other fiduciaries exercise voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the Qualified Plans in their discretion. Some Qualified Plans, however, may provide for the trustee(s), an investment adviser (or advisers), or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from Qualified Plan participants.
18. Where a Qualified Plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions, Applicants do not see any potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among the Variable Contract owners and Qualified Plan participants with respect to voting Shares. Accordingly, unlike the circumstances surrounding Separate Accounts, because Qualified Plans are not required to pass through voting rights to participants, the issue of resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts of interest should not arise with respect to voting Shares.
19. In addition, if a Qualified Plan were to hold a controlling interest in an Insurance Fund, Applicants do not believe that such control would disadvantage other investors in such Insurance Fund to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the shares of any open-end management investment company. In this regard, Applicants submit that investment in a portfolio by a Qualified Plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by VLI Account investments in the portfolio. Unlike VLI Account investments, Qualified Plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of Participating Insurance Companies or state insurance regulators.
20. Where a Qualified Plan provides participants with the right to instruct the trustee(s) how to vote portfolio shares, Applicants see no reason why such participants generally or those in a particular Qualified Plan, either as a single group or in combination with participants in other Qualified Plans, would vote in a manner that would disadvantage VLI Contract owners. The purchase of Shares by Qualified Plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed or shared funding.
21. Applicants recognize that the prohibitions on mixed and shared funding might reflect concern regarding possible different investment motivations among investors. When Rule 6e-2 was first adopted, variable annuity separate accounts could invest in mutual funds whose shares were also offered to the general public. Therefore, the Commission staff may have been concerned with the potentially different investment motivations of public shareholders and owners of variable life insurance contracts. There also may have been some concern with respect to the problems of permitting a state insurance regulatory authority to affect the operations of a publicly available mutual fund and the investment decisions of public shareholders.
22. For reasons unrelated to the 1940 Act, however, Internal Revenue Service Ruling 81-225 (Sept. 25, 1981) effectively deprived VA Contracts funded by publicly available mutual funds of their tax-benefited status. The Tax Reform Act of 1984 codified the prohibition against the use of publicly available mutual funds as an investment vehicle for Variable Contracts. In particular, Section 817(h) of the Code, in effect, requires that the investments made by both VLI Accounts and VA Accounts be “adequately diversified.” If such a separate account is organized as part of a “two-tiered” arrangement where the account invests in shares of an underlying open-end investment company (i.e., an underlying fund), the diversification test will be applied to the underlying fund (or to each of several underlying funds), rather than to the separate account itself, but only if “all of the beneficial interests” in the underlying fund “are held by one or more insurance companies (or affiliated companies) in their general account or in segregated asset accounts.” Accordingly, a separate account that invests in a publicly available mutual fund will not be adequately diversified for these purposes. In addition, any underlying fund, including an Insurance Fund that sells Shares to Separate Accounts, would, in effect, be precluded from also selling its Shares to the public. Consequently, the Insurance Fund may not sell Shares directly to the public.
23. Applicants assert that the rights of an insurance company or a state insurance regulator to disregard the voting instructions of owners of Start Printed Page 44629Variable Contracts is not inconsistent with either mixed funding or shared funding. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners Variable Life Insurance Model Regulation (the “NAIC Model Regulation”) suggests that it is unlikely that insurance regulators would find an underlying fund's investment policy, investment adviser or principal underwriter objectionable for one type of Variable Contract but not another type. The NAIC Model Regulation has long permitted the use of a single underlying fund for different separate accounts. Moreover, Article VI, Section 3 of the NAIC Model Regulation has been amended to remove a previous prohibition on one separate account investing in another Separate Account. Lastly, the NAIC Model Regulation does not distinguish between scheduled premium and flexible premium variable life insurance contracts. The NAIC Model Regulation, therefore, reflects the NAIC's apparent confidence that such combined funding is appropriate and that state insurance regulators can adequately protect the interests of owners of all Variable Contracts.
24. Applicants assert that shared funding by unaffiliated insurance companies does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several or all states. A particular state insurance regulator could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other states in which the insurance company offers its contracts. However, the fact that different insurers may be domiciled in different states does not create a significantly different or enlarged problem.
25. Shared funding by unaffiliated insurers, in this respect, is no different than the use of the same investment company as the funding vehicle for affiliated insurers, which Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) permit under the 1940 Act. Affiliated insurers may be domiciled in different states and be subject to differing state law requirements. Affiliation does not reduce the potential, if any exists, for differences in state regulatory requirements. In any event, the conditions set forth below are designed to safeguard against, and provide procedures for resolving, any adverse effects that differences among state regulatory requirements may produce. If a particular state insurance regulator's decision conflicts with the majority of other state regulators, then the affected Participating Insurance Company will be required to withdraw its separate account investments in the relevant portfolio. This requirement will be provided for in the Participation Agreement that will be entered into by Participating Insurance Companies with an Insurance Fund.
26. Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) under the 1940 Act give Participating Insurance Companies the right to disregard the voting instructions of VLI Contract owners in certain circumstances. This right derives from the authority of state insurance regulators over VLI Accounts and VA Accounts. Under Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15), a Participating Insurance Company may disregard VLI Contract owner voting instructions only with respect to certain specified items. Affiliation does not eliminate the potential, if any exists, for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies, principal underwriter or investment adviser initiated by such contract owners. The potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) under the 1940 Act that the Participating Insurance Company's disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific good faith determinations.
27. A particular Participating Insurance Company's disregard of voting instructions, nevertheless, could conflict with the voting instructions of a majority of VLI Contract owners. The Participating Insurance Company's action possibly could be different than the determination of all or some of the other Participating Insurance Companies (including affiliated insurers) that the voting instructions of VLI Contract owners should prevail, and either could preclude a majority vote approving the change or could represent a minority view. If the Participating Insurance Company's judgment represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, then the Participating Insurance Company may be required, at the Insurance Fund's election, to withdraw its VLI Accounts' and VA Accounts' investments in the relevant portfolio. No charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. This requirement will be provided for in the Participation Agreement entered into between the Participating Insurance Company and the Insurance Fund.
28. Applicants assert that there is no reason why the investment policies of a portfolio would or should be materially different from what these policies would or should be if the portfolio supported only VA Accounts or VLI Accounts, whether flexible premium or scheduled premium VLI Contracts. Each type of insurance contract is designed as a long-term investment program.
29. Each portfolio will be managed to attempt to achieve its specified investment objective, and not favor or disfavor any particular Participating Insurance Company or type of insurance contract. There is no reason to believe that different features of various types of Variable Contracts will lead to different investment policies for each or for different Separate Accounts. The sale of all Variable Contracts and ultimate success of all Separate Accounts depends, at least in part, on satisfactory investment performance, which provides an incentive for each Participating Insurance Company to seek optimal investment performance.
30. Furthermore, no single investment strategy can be identified as appropriate to a particular Variable Contract. Each “pool” of VLI Contract and VA Contract owners is composed of individuals of diverse financial status, age, insurance needs and investment goals. A portfolio supporting even one type of Variable Contract must accommodate these diverse factors in order to attract and retain purchasers. Permitting mixed and shared funding will provide economic support for the continuation of the portfolios. Mixed and shared funding will broaden the base of potential Variable Contract owner investors, which may facilitate the establishment of additional portfolios serving diverse goals.
31. Applicants do not believe that the sale of Shares to Qualified Plans will increase the potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors. In particular, Applicants see very little potential for such conflicts beyond those that would otherwise exist between owners of VLI Contracts and VA Contracts. Applicants submit that either there are no conflicts of interest or that there exists the ability by the affected parties to resolve potential conflicts consistent with the best interests of Variable Contract owners and Qualified Plan participants.
32. Applicants considered whether there are any issues raised under the Code, Treasury Regulations, or Revenue Rulings thereunder, if Qualified Plans, VA Accounts, and VLI Accounts all invest in the same portfolio. Applicants have concluded that neither the Code, nor the Treasury Regulations nor Revenue Rulings thereunder, present any inherent conflicts of interest if Qualified Plans, VLI Accounts, and VA Accounts all invest in the same portfolio.
33. Applicants note that, while there are differences in the manner in which Start Printed Page 44630distributions from VLI Accounts and Qualified Plans are taxed, these differences have no impact on the portfolios. When distributions are to be made, and a VLI Account or Qualified Plan is unable to net purchase payments to make distributions, the VLI Account or Qualified Plan will redeem shares of the relevant portfolio at its net asset values in conformity with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act (without the imposition of any sales charge) to provide proceeds to meet distribution needs. A Participating Insurance Company will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of the Qualified Plan.
34. Applicants considered whether it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving voting rights to VLI Contract owners and Qualified Plans. In connection with any meeting of an Insurance Fund's shareholders, the relevant transfer agent will inform each Participating Insurance Company, Adviser, and Qualified Plan of their share holdings and provide other information necessary for such shareholders to participate in the meeting (e.g., proxy materials). Each Participating Insurance Company then will solicit voting instructions from owners of VLI Contracts and VA Contracts as required by either Rules 6e-2 or 6e-3(T), or Section 12(d)(1)(E)(iii)(aa) of the 1940 Act, as applicable, and its Participation Agreement with an Insurance Fund. Shares held by a General Account of a Participating Insurance Company will be voted by the Participating Insurance Company in the same proportion as Shares for which it receives voting instructions from its Variable Contract owners. Shares held by Qualified Plans will be voted in accordance with applicable law. The voting rights provided to Qualified Plans with respect to the Shares would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to Qualified Plans with respect to shares of mutual funds sold to the general public. Furthermore, if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a Qualified Plan's decision to disregard Qualified Plan participant voting instructions, if applicable, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, the Qualified Plan may be required, at the election of the relevant Insurance Fund, to withdraw its investment in a portfolio, and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal.
35. Applicants do not believe that the ability of an Insurance Fund to sell Shares directly to its Adviser, Qualified Plans, or General Account gives rise to a senior security. “Senior Security” is defined in Section 18(g) of the 1940 Act to include “any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends.” As noted above, regardless of the rights and benefits of participants under Qualified Plans and owners of VLI Contracts, VLI Accounts, VA Accounts, Participating Insurance Companies, Qualified Plans, and the Adviser only have, or will only have, rights with respect to their respective Shares. These parties can only redeem such Shares at net asset value. No shareholder of a portfolio has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends.
36. Applicants do not believe that the veto power of state insurance commissioners over certain potential changes to portfolio investment objectives approved by owners of VLI Contracts creates conflicts between the interests of such owners and the interests of Qualified Plan participants. Applicants note that a basic premise of corporate democracy and shareholder voting is that not all shareholders may agree with a particular proposal. Their interests and opinions may differ, but this does not mean that inherent conflicts of interest exist between or among such shareholders or that occasional conflicts of interest that do occur between or among them are likely to be irreconcilable.
37. Although Participating Insurance Companies may have to overcome regulatory impediments in redeeming shares of a portfolio held by their VLI Accounts, the Qualified Plans and the participants in participant-directed Qualified Plans can make decisions quickly and redeem their Shares and reinvest in another investment company or other funding vehicle without impediments, or as is the case with most Qualified Plans, hold cash pending suitable investment. As a result, conflicts between the interests of VLI Contract owners and the interests of Qualified Plans and Qualified Plan participants can usually be resolved quickly since the Qualified Plans can, on their own, redeem their Shares.
38. Finally, Applicants considered whether there is a potential for future conflicts of interest between Participating Insurance Companies and Qualified Plans created by future changes in the tax laws. Applicants do not see any greater potential for material irreconcilable conflicts arising between the interests of VLI Contract owners (or, for that matter, VA Contract owners) and Qualified Plan participants from future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exists between Variable Contract owners.
39. Applicants assert that permitting an Insurance Fund to sell Shares to its Adviser for the purpose of obtaining seed money or to the General Account will enhance management of the Insurance Fund without raising significant concerns regarding material irreconcilable conflicts among different types of investors. A potential source of initial capital is the Adviser or a Participating Insurance Company. However, the provision of seed capital by the Adviser or by a Participating Insurance Company may be deemed to violate the exclusivity requirement of Rule 6e-2(b)(15) and/or Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15). Given the conditions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.817-5(f)(3) and the harmony of interest between a portfolio, on the one hand, and its Adviser or a Participating Insurance Company, on the other, Applicants assert that little incentive for overreaching exists. Furthermore, such investment should not implicate the concerns discussed above regarding the creation of material irreconcilable conflicts. Instead, investments by an Adviser or by General Accounts, will permit the orderly and efficient creation and operation of a portfolio, and reduce the expense and uncertainty of using outside parties at the early stages of the portfolio's operations.
40. Various factors have limited the number of insurance companies that offer Variable Contracts. These factors include the costs of organizing and operating a funding vehicle, certain insurers' lack of experience with respect to investment management, and the lack of name recognition by the public of certain insurance companies as investment experts. In particular, some smaller life insurance companies may not find it economically feasible, or within their investment or administrative expertise, to enter the Variable Contract business on their own. Use of a portfolio as a common investment vehicle for VLI Accounts would reduce or eliminate these concerns. Mixed and shared funding should also provide several benefits to owners of VLI Contracts by eliminating a significant portion of the costs of establishing and administering separate underlying funds.
41. Participating Insurance Companies will benefit not only from the investment expertise of the Adviser, but also from the potential cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by larger pools of funds. Mixed and shared funding also would permit a greater amount of assets available for investment by a portfolio, thereby Start Printed Page 44631promoting economies of scale, by permitting increased safety through greater diversification, or by making the addition of new portfolios more feasible. Therefore, mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer VLI Accounts. This should result in increased competition with respect to both VLI Account design and pricing, which can in turn be expected to result in more product variety.
42. Applicants also submit that, regardless of the type of shareholder in a portfolio, the Adviser is or would be contractually and otherwise obligated to manage the portfolio solely and exclusively in accordance with that portfolio's investment objectives, policies and restrictions, as well as any guidelines established by the Board. Thus, each portfolio will be managed in the same manner as any other mutual fund.
43. Applicants note that VLI Accounts historically have been employed to accumulate shares of mutual funds that are not affiliated with the depositor or sponsor of the VLI Account. In particular, Applicants assert that sales of Shares, as described above, will not have any adverse federal income tax consequences to other investors in the portfolios.
44. In addition, Applicants assert that granting the exemptions requested herein is in the public interest and will not compromise the regulatory purposes of Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), or 15(b) of the 1940 Act or Rules 6e-2 or 6e-3(T) thereunder.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions which shall apply to each Insurance Fund:
1. A majority of the Board will consist of persons who are not “interested persons” of an Insurance Fund, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, and as modified by any applicable orders of the Commission, except that if this condition is not met by reason of death, disqualification or bona fide resignation of any trustee or trustees, then the operation of this condition will be suspended: (a) For a period of 90 days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board, (b) for a period of 150 days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies, or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order upon application, or by future rule.
2. The Board will monitor an Insurance Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between and among the interests of the owners of all VLI Contracts and VA Contracts and participants of all Qualified Plans investing in the Insurance Fund, and determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to such conflicts. A material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons, including: (a) An action by any state insurance regulatory authority, (b) a change in applicable federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action or interpretive letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax or securities regulatory authorities, (c) an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding, (d) the manner in which the investments of an Insurance Fund are being managed, (e) a difference in voting instructions given by VA Contract owners, VLI Contract owners, and Qualified Plans or Qualified Plan participants, (f) a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard the voting instructions of contract owners; or (g) if applicable, a decision by a Qualified Plan to disregard the voting instructions of Qualified Plan participants.
3. Participating Insurance Companies (on their own behalf, as well as by virtue of any investment of General Account assets in a portfolio of an Insurance Fund), the Adviser, and any Qualified Plan that executes a Participation Agreement upon becoming an owner of 10% or more of the assets of a portfolio (collectively, “Participants”) will report any potential or existing conflicts to the Board. Each Participant will be responsible for assisting the Board in carrying out the Board's responsibilities under these conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for the Board to consider any issues raised. This responsibility includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by each Participating Insurance Company to inform the Board whenever Variable Contract owner voting instructions are disregarded, and, if pass-through voting is applicable, an obligation by each trustee for a Qualified Plan to inform the Board whenever it has determined to disregard Qualified Plan participant voting instructions. The responsibility to report such information and conflicts, and to assist the Board, will be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their Participation Agreement with an Insurance Fund, and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the Variable Contract owners. The responsibility to report such information and conflicts, and to assist the Board, also will be contractual obligations of all Qualified Plans under their Participation Agreement with the relevant Insurance Fund, and such agreements will provide that these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of Qualified Plan participants.
4. If it is determined by a majority of the Board, or a majority of the disinterested trustees, that a material irreconcilable conflict exists, then the relevant Participant will, at its expense and to the extent reasonably practicable (as determined by a majority of the disinterested trustees), take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict, up to and including: (a) Withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of their VLI Accounts or VA Accounts from the relevant portfolio and reinvesting such assets in a different investment vehicle including another portfolio, (b) in the case of a Participating Insurance Company, submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected Variable Contract owners and, as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group (i.e., VA Contract owners or VLI Contact owners of one or more Participating Insurance Companies) that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to the affected contract owners the option of making such a change, (c) withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the Qualified Plans from the affected portfolio and reinvesting them in a different investment medium, and (d) establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard Variable Contract owner voting instructions, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, then the Participating Insurance Company may be required, at the election of the Insurance Fund, to withdraw such Participating Insurance Company's VA Account and VLI Account investments in a portfolio, and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a Qualified Plan's decision to disregard Qualified Plan participant voting instructions, if applicable, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, the Qualified Plan may be required, at the election of the Start Printed Page 44632Insurance, to withdraw its investment in a portfolio, and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a Board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action will be a contractual obligation of all Participants under their Participation Agreement with the Insurance Fund, and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of Variable Contract owners or, as applicable, Qualified Plan participants.
For purposes of this Condition 4, a majority of the disinterested trustees of the Board will determine whether or not any proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict, but, in no event, will an Insurance Fund or the Adviser be required to establish a new funding vehicle for any Variable Contract or Qualified Plan. No Participating Insurance Company will be required by this Condition 4 to establish a new funding vehicle for any Variable Contract if any offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the Variable Contract owners materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict. Further, no Qualified Plan will be required by this Condition 4 to establish a new funding vehicle for the Qualified Plan if: (a) A majority of the Qualified Plan participants materially and adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict vote to decline such offer, or (b) pursuant to documents governing the Qualified Plan, the Qualified Plan trustee makes such decision without a Plan participant vote.
5. The Board's determination of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and its implications will be made known in writing promptly to all Participants.
6. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all Variable Contract owners whose Contracts are issued through registered VLI Accounts or registered VA Accounts for as long as required by the 1940 Act as interpreted by the Commission. However, as to Variable Contracts issued through VA Accounts or VLI Accounts not registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act, pass-through voting privileges will be extended to Variable Contract owners to the extent granted by the Participating Insurance Company. Accordingly, such Participating Insurance Companies, where applicable, will vote the Shares held in their Separate Accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely received from Variable Contract owners. Participating Insurance Companies will be responsible for assuring that their Separate Accounts investing in the relevant portfolio calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other Participants.
The obligation to calculate voting privileges as provided in this application shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their Participation Agreement with an Insurance Fund. Each Participating Insurance Company will vote Shares held in its VLI or VA Accounts for which no timely voting instructions are received, as well as Shares held in its General Account or otherwise attributed to it, in the same proportion as those Shares for which voting instructions are received. Each Qualified Plan will vote as required by applicable law, governing Qualified Plan documents and as provided in this application.
7. As long as the 1940 Act requires pass-through voting privileges to be provided to Variable Contract owners or the Commission interprets the Act to require the same, the Adviser or any General Account will vote its respective Shares in the same proportion as all votes cast on behalf of all Variable Contract owners having voting rights; provided, however, that the Adviser or General Account shall vote its shares in such other manner as may be required by the Commission or its staff.
8. Each Insurance Fund will comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act requiring voting by shareholders (which, for these purposes, shall be the persons having a voting interest in its shares), and, in particular, an Insurance Fund will either provide for annual meetings (except to the extent that the Commission may interpret Section 16 of the Act not to require such meetings) or comply with Section 16(c) of the Act (although each Insurance Fund is not, or will not be, one of those trusts of the type described in Section 16(c) of the Act), as well as with Section 16(a) of the Act and, if and when applicable, Section 16(b) of the Act. Further, each Insurance Fund will act in accordance with the Commission's interpretations of the requirements of Section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of trustees and with whatever rules the Commission may promulgate thereto.
9. An Insurance Fund will make Shares available under a Variable Contract and/or Qualified Plan at or about the time it accepts any seed capital from the Adviser or from a General Account of a Participating Insurance Company.
10. Each Insurance Fund has notified, or will notify, all Participants that disclosure regarding potential risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate in VLI Account and VA Account prospectuses or Qualified Plan documents. Each Insurance Fund will disclose, in its prospectus that: (a) Shares may be offered to VA Accounts and VLI Accounts funding both VA Contracts and VLI Contracts and, if applicable, to Plans, (b) due to differences in tax treatment and other considerations, the interests of various Variable Contract owners participating in an Insurance Fund and the interests of Qualified Plan participants investing in an Insurance Fund, if applicable, may conflict, and (c) the Board will monitor events in order to identify the existence of any material irreconcilable conflicts and to determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to any such conflicts.
11. If and to the extent Rule 6e-2 and Rule 6e-3(T) under the 1940 Act are amended, or Rule 6e-3 under the Act is adopted, to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the Act, or the rules thereunder, with respect to mixed or shared funding, on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested in this application, then an Insurance Fund and/or Participating Insurance Companies, as appropriate, shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with Rules 6e-2 or 6e-3(T), as amended, or Rule 6e-3, to the extent such rules are applicable.
12. Each Participant, at least annually, shall submit to the Board on behalf of an Insurance Fund such reports, materials or data as the Board reasonably may request so that the trustees of the Board may fully carry out the obligations imposed upon the Board by the conditions contained in this application. Such reports, materials and data shall be submitted more frequently if deemed appropriate by the Board. The obligations of the Participants to provide these reports, materials and data to the Board, when it so reasonably requests, shall be a contractual obligation of all Participants under their Participation Agreement with an Insurance Fund.
13. All reports of potential or existing conflicts received by the Board, and all Board action with regard to determining the existence of a conflict, notifying Participants of a conflict and determining whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or other appropriate records, and such minutes or other Start Printed Page 44633records shall be made available to the Commission upon request.
14. Each Insurance Fund will not accept a purchase order from a Qualified Plan if such purchase would make the Qualified Plan an owner of 10 percent or more of the assets of a portfolio unless the Qualified Plan executes an agreement with an Insurance Fund governing participation in the portfolio that includes the conditions set forth herein to the extent applicable. A Qualified Plan will execute an application containing an acknowledgement of this condition at the time of its initial purchase of shares.
Conclusion
Applicants submit, for all the reasons explained above, that the exemptions requested are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
Start Signature
For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.
Elizabeth M. Murphy,
Secretary.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  The principal value and investment return of an investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.  The returns shown do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or on the redemptions of Fund shares.  Returns greater than 1 year are annualized.  For performance information current to the most recent month-end, please call 1-888-777-0535.

	BCM Decathlon Portfolios









	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	June 30, 2012 (Unaudited)








	1.




	ORGANIZATION






	The BCM Decathlon Portfolios (each a Portfolio, collectively the Portfolios) is comprised of three different actively managed portfolios. Each Portfolio is a diversified series of shares of beneficial interest of Northern Lights Variable Trust (the Trust), a statutory trust organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as an open-end management investment company. The Portfolios are intended to be funding vehicles for variable annuity contracts and flexible premium variable life insurance policies offered by the separate accounts of various insurance companies. The assets of each portfolio are segregated and a shareholder's interest is limited to the portfolio in which shares are held. Each portfolio pays its own expenses. The investment objective of each portfolio is as follows:














	Portfolio






	Primary Objective







	Aggressive Portfolio




	Income and capital appreciation.






	Conservative Portfolio




	Income and capital appreciation.






	Moderate Portfolio




	Income and capital appreciation.









	The Aggressive Portfolio, Conservative Portfolio and Moderate Portfolio currently offer one class of shares: Class 2 Shares.  Class 2 shares are offered at net asset value.  The Portfolios commenced operations on April 30, 2012.






	2.




	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Portfolios in the preparation of their financial statements. These policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).






	Securities valuation 

	Securities listed on an exchange are valued at the last reported sale price at the close of the regular trading session of the exchange on the business day the value is being determined, or in the case of securities listed on NASDAQ at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price (NOCP).  In the absence of a sale such securities shall be valued at the last bid price on the day of valuation.   Short-term debt obligations having 60 days or less remaining until maturity, at time of purchase, are valued at amortized cost.  Investments in open-end investment companies are valued at net asset value.  





	In unusual circumstances, instead of valuing securities in the usual manner, securities will be valued at their fair market value as determined in good faith by the Trusts Fair Value Committee and in accordance with the Trusts Portfolio Securities Valuation Procedures (the Procedures). The Board of Trustees (the Board) will review the fair value method in use for securities requiring a fair market value determination at least quarterly. The Procedures consider, among others, the following factors to determine a securitys fair value: the nature and pricing history (if any) of the security; whether any dealer quotations for the security are available; and possible valuation methodologies that could be used to determine the fair value of the security.  














	BCM Decathlon Portfolios







	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)




	June 30, 2012 (Unaudited)










	Valuation of Fund of Funds

	- The Portfolios may invest in portfolios of open-end investment companies (the underlying funds).  Open-end funds are valued at their respective net asset values as reported by such investment companies. Open-end funds value securities in their portfolios for which market quotations are readily available at their market values (generally the last reported sale price) and all other securities and assets at their fair value based on the methods established by the board of directors of the open-end funds.

	 






	Each Portfolio utilizes various methods to measure the fair value of all of its investments on a recurring basis. GAAP establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation methods. The three levels of input are:










	Level 1 

	Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Portfolio has the ability to access.



	Level 2 

	Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument in an inactive market, prices for similar instruments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, yield curves, default rates and similar data.



	Level 3 

	Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, to the extent relevant observable inputs are not available, representing the Portfolios own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability, and would be based on the best information available.





	The availability of observable inputs can vary from security to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of security, whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets, and other characteristics particular to the security. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.  Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.





	The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety, is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.





	The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.  The following tables summarize the inputs used as of June 30, 2012 for each Portfolios investments measured at fair value:

	The Portfolios did not hold any Level 3 securities during the period.


	There were no transfers into or out of Level 1 or Level 2 during the current period presented. It is the Portfolios policy to record transfers into or out of Level 1 or Level 2 at the end of the period.






	Security transactions and related income


	

	Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis.  Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized on securities purchased over the lives of the respective securities. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Realized gains or losses from sales of securities are determined by comparing the identified cost of the security lot sold with the net sales proceeds.






	Dividends and distributions to shareholders 

	Dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains if any, are declared and paid annually. Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on ex-date and are determined in accordance with Federal income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP. These book/tax differences are considered either temporary (e.g., deferred losses, capital loss carryforwards) or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the composition of net assets based on their Federal tax-basis treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification.  These reclassifications have no effect on net assets, results from operations or net asset values per share of the Portfolios.






	Federal income tax 

	It is each Portfolios policy to qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income and net realized gains to shareholders. Therefore, no Federal income tax provision is required.





	Each Portfolio will recognize the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is more likely than not to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities.  Management has analyzed each Portfolios tax positions, and has concluded that no liability for unrecognized tax benefits should be recorded related to uncertain tax positions expected to be taken in each Portfolios 2011 tax returns. Each Portfolio

	identified its major tax jurisdictions as U.S. Federal, Nebraska and foreign jurisdictions where the Portfolios make significant investments; however, the Portfolios are not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will change materially in the next twelve months.






	Use of Estimates 





	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Expenses 

	Expenses of the Trust that are directly identifiable to a specific Portfolio are charged to that Portfolio.  Expenses, which are not readily identifiable to a specific Portfolio, are allocated in such a manner as deemed equitable, taking into consideration the nature and type of expense and the relative sizes of the Portfolios in the Trust.






	Indemnification 

	The Trust indemnifies its officers and Trustees for certain liabilities that may arise from the performance of their duties to the Trust.  Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Portfolios enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities.  Each Portfolios maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Portfolios that have not yet occurred.  However, based on experience, the Portfolios expect the risk of loss due to these warranties and indemnities to be remote.

	INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT / TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES






	The business activities of the Portfolios are overseen by the Board, which is responsible for the overall management of the Portfolios. Beaumont Capital Management (BCM) serves as the Portfolios Investment Advisor (the Advisor). The Portfolios have employed Gemini Fund Services, LLC (GFS) to provide administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services and custody administration services. A Trustee and certain officers of the Portfolios are also officers of GFS, and are not paid any fees directly by the Portfolios for serving in such capacities.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)




	June 30, 2012 (Unaudited)



	 











	Pursuant to an Advisory Agreement with the Portfolios, the Advisor, under the oversight of the Board, directs the daily investment operations of the Portfolios and supervises the performance of administrative and professional services provided by others.  As compensation for its services and the related expenses borne by the Advisor, the Portfolios pay the Advisor a management fee, computed on average daily net assets and accrued daily and paid monthly, at an annual rate of 0.95% of each Portfolios average daily net assets.





	The Portfolios have adopted a Distribution Plan and Agreement (the Plan) pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act with respect to the sale and distribution of Class 2 shares. The fee is calculated at an annual rate of 0.25%, and is paid to Northern Lights Distributors, LLC (the Distributor) to provide compensation for ongoing shareholder servicing and distribution related activities and/or maintenance of each Portfolios shareholder accounts, not otherwise required to be provided by the Advisor.





	The Distributor acts as the Portfolios principal underwriter in a continuous public offering of the Portfolios Class 2 shares and is an affiliate of GFS.





	Effective April 1, 2012, with the approval of the Board the Portfolios pays its pro rata share of a total fee of $3,500 per quarter for the Northern Lights Variable Trust to each Trustee who is not affiliated with the Trust or Adviser.  The Portfolios pays the chairperson of the audit committee its pro-rata share of an additional $500 per quarter. The interested persons who serve as Trustees of the Trust receive no compensation for their services as Trustees.  None of the executive officers receive compensation from the Trust.





	Pursuant to the terms of an administrative servicing agreement with GFS, each Portfolio pays to GFS a monthly fee for all operating expenses of the Portfolio, which is calculated by each Portfolio on its average daily net assets. Operating expenses include but are not limited to Fund Accounting, Fund Administration, Transfer Agency, Legal Fees, Audit Fees, Compliance Services, Shareholder Reporting Expense and Custody Fees. The approved entities may be affiliates of GFS. GFS provides a Principal Executive Officer and a Principal Financial Officer to the Portfolios.





	In addition, certain affiliates of GFS provide ancillary services to the Portfolios as follows:







	Northern Lights Compliance Services, LLC (NLCS),


	an affiliate of GFS, provides a Chief Compliance Officer to the Trust, as well as related compliance services, pursuant to a consulting agreement between NLCS and the Trust. Under the terms of such agreement, NLCS receives customary fees from the Portfolios.







	GemCom, LLC (GemCom),


	an affiliate of GFS, provides EDGAR conversion and filing services as well as print management services for the Portfolios on an ad-hoc basis. For the provision of these services, GemCom receives customary fees from the Portfolios.

	6. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS






	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04 Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in GAAP and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). ASU No. 2011-04 amends FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to establish common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with GAAP and IFRSs. ASU No. 2011-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the impact these amendments may have on the Portfolios financial statements.





	In December 2011, FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11 related to disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities. The amendments in this ASU require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.  The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. The guidance requires retrospective application for all comparative periods presented.  Management is currently evaluating the impact this amendment may have on the Portfolios financial statements.

	7. UNDERLYING INVESTMENT IN OTHER INVESTMENT COMPANIES






	The Portfolios currently invest a portion of their assets in the Fidelity Money Market Portfolio.  The Portfolios may redeem their investments from the Fidelity Money Market Portfolio at any time if the Advisor determines that it is in the best interest of the Portfolio and its shareholders to do so.  





	The performance of the Portfolios may be directly affected by the performance of the Fidelity Money Market Portfolio.  The financial statements of the Fidelity Money Market Portfolio, including the portfolio of investments, can be found at Fidelitys website www.fidelity.com or the Security and Exchange Commissions website www.sec.gov and should be read in conjunction with the Portfolios financial statements.  As of June 30, 2012 the percentage of net assets invested in the Fidelity Money Market Portfolio was 85.7%, 94.7% and 94.6% for the Moderate, Aggressive and Conservative Portfolios, respectively.

	The Portfolios are required to recognize in the financial statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.   For non-recognized subsequent events that must be disclosed to keep the financial statements from being misleading, the Portfolios are required to disclose the nature of the event as well as an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made.   Management has determined that there were no subsequent events to report through the issuance of these financial statements.

	EXPENSE EXAMPLES




	June 30, 2012 (Unaudited)









	As a shareholder of the BCM Decathlon Portfolios, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchases, and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees; distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees; and other Fund expenses.  This example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the BCM Decathlon Portfolios and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.





	The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period from January 1, 2012 through June 30, 2012.



	Actual Expenses






	The Actual Expenses line in the table below provides information about actual account values and actual expenses.  You may use the information below; together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the table under the heading entitled Expenses Paid During Period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period.



	Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes






	The Hypothetical line in the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Power Income Funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Funds actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balances or expenses you paid for the period. You may use this information to compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of other funds.





	Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales charges (loads). Therefore, the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds.  In addition, if these transactional costs were included, your costs would have been higher.

	SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION




	June 30, 2012 (Unaudited)














	Approval of Advisory Agreement BCM Decathlon Aggressive Portfolio, BCM Decathlon Moderate Portfolio and BCM Decathlon Conservative Portfolio







	In connection with the regular meeting held on February 22, 2012, the Board of Trustees (the Board) of the Northern Lights Variable Trust (the Trust), including a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust or interested persons to the investment advisory agreement (the Independent Trustees), discussed the approval of an investment advisory agreement (the Advisory Agreement) between Beaumont Financial Partners, LLC (Beaumont or the Adviser) and the Trust, on behalf of BCM Decathlon Aggressive Portfolio, BCM Decathlon Moderate Portfolio and BCM Decathlon Conservative Portfolio (each a Portfolio, collectively referred to as the BCM Portfolios). In considering the proposed Advisory Agreement, the Board received materials specifically relating to the Advisory Agreement. These materials included: (a) information on the modeled investment performance of the Advisers investment strategy and appropriate indices with respect to the modeled performance; (b) the resources available with respect to compliance with the Portfolios investment policies and restrictions and with policies on personal securities transactions; (c) the overall organization of the Adviser; (d) comparative fee information against a peer group of similarly managed mutual funds; and (de) the financial condition of the Adviser.   





	In their consideration of the proposed Advisory Agreement, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, did not identify any single factor as controlling, and the following summary does not detail all the matters considered. Matters considered by the Board, including the Independent Trustees, in connection with its approval of the Advisory Agreement include the following:





	Nature, Extent and Quality of Services.  The Board reviewed the financial statements information of Beaumont, and information about other resources, including personnel, of the firm.  The Board discussed the history of the firm and the background and experience of its fund management personnel.  The Trustees, including the Independent Trustees, concluded that Beaumont has the ability to provide a level of service consistent with the Boards expectations.



	Performance

	.  Because the BCM Portfolios had not yet commenced operations, the Trustees could not consider the Portfolios investment performance.  However, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, considered back-tested past performance of the AIM Decathlon Indices compared to various benchmarks.  The Board concluded that the Adviser has the potential to deliver reasonable performance.



	Fees and Expenses.

	 The Board noted that the Adviser proposed to charge the following annual advisory fees based on the average net assets of the applicable Portfolio:





	Fund








	Annual Advisory Fee





	BCM Conservative


	0.95%


	BCM Moderate


	0.95%


	BCM Aggressive


	0.95%






	BCM Decathlon Portfolios




	SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION(Continued)




	June 30, 2012 (Unaudited)






	The Trustees further noted that Beaumont has agreed to enter into expense limitation agreements with the Trust to limit the expense ratio for each Portfolio to 1.95% for the first 2 years of operations.  Beaumont also provided comparative fee information for separate accounts it manages and a peer group of other similar mutual funds.  The Trustees noted that the initial management fee and expense ratio are higher than the average, but within the range of fees charged by other funds in the peer group.  Furthermore, the management fees charged are lower than the Advisers direct separate accounts it currently manages.  The Trustees concluded that each of the BCM Portfolios advisory fees, as well as its overall expense ratio, was reasonable.






	Economies of Scale

	.  The Board considered whether economies of scale will emerge with respect to the management of the BCM Portfolios and whether potential exists for realization of any further economies of scale.  The Trustees noted that the Adviser has agreed a breakpoint reduction to 0.85% will be appropriate once the Portfolios reach economies of scale.  After discussion, it was the consensus of the Board, including the Independent Trustees,  that based on the anticipated size of each BCM Portfolio for the initial two years of its Advisory Agreement, economies of scale was not a relevant consideration at this time.



	Profitability

	.  The Board considered the anticipated profits to be realized by the Adviser in connection with the operation of the BCM Portfolios, based on materials provided to the Board, and whether the amount of profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of the BCM Portfolios.  They also considered that 12b-1 fees ; however, the Board noted that the Adviser expects that  all 12b-1 fees will be paid  to insurance platforms or used for other marketing or distribution costs.  The Trustees, including the Independent Trustees, concluded that because of the BCM Portfolios expense limitation agreements and expected asset levels, the Board was satisfied that the Advisers level of profitability from its relationship with BCM Portfolios would not be excessive.



	Conclusion.

	 Having requested and received such information from the Adviser as the Board believed to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the proposed Advisory Agreement with Beaumont, and as assisted by the advice of independent counsel, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, approved such Advisory Agreement.

Annuities May Be a Smart Fit for Your Investment Plan

Are you worried about outliving your income? That’s a risk that you may be able to do something about. When you invest in an annuity, you set the stage to receive income in the future, subject to the terms, conditions and or limitations of the insurance contract.
An annuity is a long-term contract you purchase from an insurance company. It is designed to help accumulate assets to provide income for retirement. Annuities do have limitations. If early withdrawals occur penalties may apply and earnings are taxable as ordinary income and may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty if withdrawn prior to age 59½.
How do annuities work?
An annuity is a long term investment that is issued by an insurance company designed to help protect you from the risk of outliving your income. Through annuitization, your purchase payments (what you contribute) are converted into periodic payments that can last for life.
Nationwide's annuities are flexible so you can choose one that enables you to:

Invest a lump sum or invest over a period of time 
Start receiving payments immediately or at some later date
Select a fixed, variable or indexed rate of return

Investing involves risk and may lose value. All guarantees and protections are subject to the claims paying ability of the issuing company, but the guarantees do not apply to any variable accounts which involve investment risk and possible loss of principal.
What type of annuity could fit into your investment plan?
Whether your needs are immediate or long-term, you can choose the type of annuity whose features work for your situation:

Variable – With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.


Variable annuities are sold by prospectus. Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying investment options contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional or the insurance company.
Immediate – An immediate annuity is usually purchased with a lump-sum and guaranteed income starts almost immediately. Your investment converts into a guaranteed stream of income that is irrevocable once payments begin. In some situations, funds can be accessed, but some restrictions apply.
Fixed – With fixed annuities, the principal investment and earnings are both guaranteed and fixed payments are made for the term of the contract.
Fixed Indexed – This special class of annuities yields returns on contributions based on a specified equity-based index, such as the S&P 500.


A fixed indexed annuity offers returns based on the changes in a securities index, such as the S&P 500® Composite Stock Price Index. Indexed annuity contracts also offer a specified minimum which the contract value will not fall below, regardless of index performance. After a period of time, the insurance company will make payments to you under the terms of your contract.


A fixed indexed annuity is not a stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investment.

Variable Annuities Offer Investment Choices

With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.
Watch this video to learn how variable annuities can offer unique benefits for unique characters like you. 










Variable immediate annuity features
With an immediate annuity, you begin receiving income payments immediately. Immediate annuities are usually purchased with a lump-sum payment.

Variable deferred annuity features
Some of the advantages of variable deferred annuities include:

Tax-deferred growth potential in the accumulation phase (Earnings are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn. There may be a 10% federal tax penalty on withdrawals before age 59½. Naturally, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced if you take any early withdrawals.)
Death benefits for your beneficiaries
Tax-free/penalty-free transfers among underlying investment options
A variety of payout options, including systematic withdrawals and annuitization (You may face surrender charges if you withdraw your money early.)
 


Read this important information

Keep in mind that investing involves market risk and your investment return, principal value and periodic payments will fluctuate over time. You could end up with more or less than the amount you invested.
An annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred investment designed for retirement. It will fluctuate in value. It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization. It provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments. An annuity isn’t intended to replace emergency funds or to fund short-term savings goal.
You should also know that an annuity contains guarantees and protections that are subject to the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay for them. But these guarantees don’t apply to any variable accounts that are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of your principal.
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company, and it’s sold by prospectus. You should read these documents. They describe risk factors, fees and charges that may apply to you. Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees and the expense of the underlying investment options.
Neither Nationwide nor our representatives give legal or tax advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor for answers to specific questions.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Annuities issued by Nationwide Life Insurance Company or Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Columbus, Ohio. 

Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying funds contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional, contact Nationwide or click links to product information below.

The 8 Best Places To See The Northern Lights








Experiencing the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights is a goal for many people. This beautiful light display can only be seen in the late fall and winter months, and only from the northernmost areas of the world. Sometimes, when the lights are at their fullest, you can see them farther south, but this is a very rare occasion.
If it is your dream to see the Northern Lights, you will find that the following eight places offer you the best view of the Aurora Borealis.
1. Fairbanks, Alaska
Fairbanks may be one of the northernmost cities in the United States, but it may not be north enough to enjoy the Northern Lights. There are, however, tours that are specifically designed to take people north past the Arctic Circle so that they can experience the Northern Lights. Visitors will need to fly into Anchorage and then find transportation to Fairbanks. One of the best methods is the Alaska Winter Snow Train. This is a wonderful ride through the wilderness and adds to the overall experience.

With a wide range of styles, prices, and menu options, the following are 10 of the best buffets the area has to offer.
1. The Spice Market Buffet
Located in the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, this buffet has one of the largest selections of food available on the strip. Constantly buzzing with activity, The Spice Market has routinely been voted the best buffet on the Strip, and with flavors from around the globe, it is certain to have something for everyone.

10 Best Caribbean Island Vacation Destinations








The Caribbean has some of the most beautiful vacation destinations in the world. This makes it popular with tourists worldwide. Many people, however, have trouble deciding which island to visit. Although it may seem that every Caribbean island is equally desirable and perfect, the fact is there are significant differences among them. Let’s look at the top ten Caribbean islands and what type of traveler each is best suited for.
10. Aruba
Aruba offers a diverse number of activities for people of all ages. On the one hand, it’s extremely family friendly, with many resorts catering to families with kids. On the other hand, you can find many adult-centered activities, such as nightlife and a wide assortment of casinos. Aruba also has a slightly different landscape from many Caribbean islands, having more of a desert appearance rather than forests.
