We are in constant pursuit of exceptionally talented and motivated individuals with a history of outstanding achievement, who are interested in developing and implementing automated trading strategies. If you think you’ve got what we’re looking for (historically less than 1% of applicants have received employment offers) then read on. 


At SCM, our success is built on the foundation of quantitative research and development, paired with the capability to implement developments rapidly, efficiently and accurately. If you’re driven by intellectual curiosity and the challenge of solving difficult problems, SCM has what you’re looking for.
We work in small teams where creative problem solving is encouraged. The work is demanding and rewarding, and the atmosphere is friendly, professional and non-bureaucratic.

Dress is casual, and we provide numerous amenities including a well-appointed fitness center with locker rooms and shower facilities, as well as a bike room for those who commute by bike.
SCM also provides a broad range of benefits, including a fully paid comprehensive health plan (with dental and vision), as well as a 401(k) retirement plan with maximum company matching contributions and discretionary 401(k) profit sharing contributions.
We’re located in the heart of Philadelphia’s Main Line suburbs, near the intersection of Interstate 476 and US Route 30, and we have a SEPTA train station adjacent to our office. This convenient location offers employees the option of living in a major city, or a wide variety of suburbs ranging from urban to bucolic. We’re also centrally located amidst several nationally acclaimed public school districts and private schools.
All of this promotes an exceptional quality of life and an environment that is highly conducive to long and fulfilling careers, as evidenced by our extraordinarily low employee turnover rate.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for ScanSource (NASDAQ:SCSC) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.50)Consensus Price Target: $45.25 (11.87% upside)

Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP) Downgraded to Hold at Zacks Investment Research


					Posted by Chloe McGuire on Jul 19th, 2017 // No Comments




Zacks Investment Research cut shares of Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research note published on Monday morning. 
According to Zacks, “Roper has outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. The stock benefitted from good first-quarter results as well as raised guidance. We continue to believe that the Roper’s asset-light business model will boost financial performance in the long run. Also, winning of key projects like New York City’s MTA project are long term growth drivers. Its aggressive acquisition strategy will continue to help boost its performance. In 2016, Roper spent nearly $3.7 billion in software acquisitions, which include ConstructConnect and Deltek, which will help boost its performance especially in the software and network businesses. Meanwhile, estimates have been stable lately ahead of the company's Q2 earnings release. The company has mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. However, stiff competition, weakness in oil and gas, and a leveraged balance sheet remain overhangs. “

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Mueller Industries (NYSE:MLI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A
