Early life and education[edit]
Weinstein grew up in a secular Jewish family.[4] Weinstein first enrolled in a chess workshop at the age of five and earned the title of National Master by the time he was sixteen.[5] He is also a skilled poker and blackjack player.[6] In 2005, Warren Buffett invited him to a poker tournament, where he won a Maserati.[7] Weinstein graduated from Stuyvesant High School in New York City and from the University of Michigan in 1995 with a degree in Philosophy.[4]
Deutsche Bank[edit]
Boaz worked at Deutsche Bank from 1998–2009. He was Co-Head of Global Credit Trading where he oversaw a team of approximately 650 professionals and was a member of the Global Markets Executive Committee. Boaz rose to prominence in 2006 and 2007, when the Saba proprietary trading group cleared over $1.5 billion in profits. Weinstein was promoted at age 27 to become Deutsche Bank’s youngest ever Managing Director.[4] His proprietary trading group was widely reported to have lost about 18% on $10 billion of capital in 2008, his only losing year out of his eleven years at Deutsche Bank.[8]
Saba Capital Management[edit]
In 2009, Weinstein went ahead with a plan to lift out 15 members of his team to start his own credit-focused hedge fund, Saba Capital Management, based in New York.[9][10] Saba launched its flagship fund in August 2009 with $140 million.
In March 2011, Saba was listed as the fastest growing hedge fund in 2010 by Absolute Return + Alpha Magazine.[11] Weinstein was also included in Fortune Magazine’s 40 Under 40 list in 2010 and 2011.[12][13] In 2012, Weinstein profited from a notable $6-billion loss incurred by JPMorgan on account of a failed investment in credit derivatives attributed to Bruno Iksil.[14][15][16]
As of March 2017, Saba managed $1.7 billion in assets.[17]
Philanthropy[edit]
Weinstein serves on the Board of Directors of Stuyvesant High School and is also a Leadership Council member for Robin Hood, New York’s largest poverty-fighting organization.
Weinstein's philanthropy has focused on public school education, New York City, and Jewish causes.[18][19][20][21]
Personal life[edit]
In 2010, Weinstein married Tali Farhadian in a Jewish ceremony at the Central Synagogue in Manhattan.[22] Tali was born in 1975 in Iran to a Jewish family that fled the fall of the Shah in 1979.[23] She is a Rhodes Scholar and was previously an attorney with the United States Department of Justice.[22]
In 2012 Weinstein was reported to have bought a $25.5 million property on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, from the estate of Huguette Clark.[24][25]

The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

Boaz Weinstein, the hedge fund manager famous for betting against the JPMorgan Chase trader known as the “London Whale,” is being accused of his own accounting chicanery.In a case that could have chilling lessons for investors in certain kinds of illiquid assets, Mr. Weinstein — a chess master who made his career exposing and gambling on mispriced assets — is being sued by the Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada, formerly the largest investor in his hedge fund, Saba Capital.The pension fund sought to liquidate its investment in Mr. Weinstein’s fund earlier this year after he piled up a string of losses over the last two years.The pension fund estimated it was owed $500 million and gave Mr. Weinstein less than two months to refund the money.

Mr. Weinstein pleaded with the pension fund to allow him to pay it back in installments over several quarters, arguing that it would be difficult to get top dollar for some of the most illiquid assets — like corporate bonds — which would otherwise be valued at fire-sale prices.

The pension fund said no. It wanted the money immediately.So Mr. Weinstein set about conducting an auction for the corporate bonds, but only three of nine dealers made bids.As might be expected, the valuations ascribed to the bonds were significantly less than their original value. Now the pension fund is claiming in a lawsuit that it got about $12 million less than it should have for those illiquid assets, contending that Mr. Weinstein “improperly manipulated the values of certain of the funds’ assets with the objective of artificially depressing the price paid” to the fund.The lawsuit — and the valuation that the fund received — illustrate an issue that has been bubbling up over the last year: It is very possible that a liquidity panic could lead to the next financial crisis.William H. Gross, the bond investor, sounded the alarm earlier this summer on “possible exit and liquidity problems in future months and years.” The potential for such a crisis isn’t restricted to large pension funds and wealthy investors.“Mutual funds, hedge funds and E.T.F.s are part of the ‘shadow banking system,’ where these modern ‘banks’ are not required to maintain reserves or even emergency levels of cash,” Mr. Gross wrote in a letter to investors. “Since they in effect now are the market, a rush for liquidity on the part of the investing public, whether they be individuals in 401(k)’s or institutional pension funds and insurance companies, would find the ‘market’ selling to itself with the Federal Reserve severely limited in its ability to provide assistance.”

Whether Mr. Weinstein valued the assets in his fund properly or not will be up the court to decide. Many facts on both sides that are necessary to truly understand what happened have yet to emerge.But what we do know from the lawsuit is that Mr. Weinstein had to value his portfolio as if it were being sold tomorrow, and it demonstrates, at least to some degree, that selling illiquid assets in a hurry usually results in sharply lower prices.

Stephen A. Schwarzman, co-founder and chairman of the Blackstone Group, is a Wall Street veteran who has been anxious that many regulations put in place since 2008 have made it harder for banks to act as intermediaries and stand in to buy assets if the markets seize up.“A liquidity drought can exacerbate, or even trigger, the next financial crisis,” Mr. Schwarzman wrote in The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. “Sellers will offer securities, but there will be no buyers. Prices will drop sharply, causing large losses for investors, pension funds and financial institutions. Additional fire sales will aggravate the decline.”Not everyone is convinced a liquidity crisis is upon us. Matt Levine, a columnist for Bloomberg View, calls it “the liquidity illusion,” which he defines as a narrative that “big investors buy a lot of bonds thinking that they’ll be easy to unload in a crash, but in fact they won’t be easy to unload, and there’ll be panicked fire sales that worsen the crash and lead to a real crisis.”He asks: “How is that illusion tenable when everyone talks about it all the time? What big investor is suffering from the liquidity illusion? Presumably not all the investors who are quoted constantly in stories about the liquidity illusion, right?”If Mr. Weinstein wins the case, the Canadian pension fund may have suffered the liquidity illusion.Others have suffered the liquidity illusion, too. General Electric’s sale of its GE Capital unit could be described as a case study on what happens when you try to sell illiquid assets quickly.The company is in the process of selling down its GE Capital business, worth some $500 billion in relatively illiquid assets. It recently took a $16.4 billion charge. While it might not be directly analogous to the fire sale of illiquid corporate bonds, and that charge figure includes some accounting issues, it shows how difficult it is to sell large amounts of assets at one time.“The suggestion that Saba ‘shopped for lowball bids’ for two bonds in our portfolio is ludicrous and totally unsubstantiated,” Mr. Weinstein said in a statement. “On the contrary, Saba initiated an industry-standard auction process to determine the value of the two bonds. This allowed us to determine objectively the level of interest by real-life purchasers, instead of relying on subjective estimates for extremely illiquid instruments in which institutional trading was virtually nonexistent.” He added: “The suggestion that I manipulated the valuation of two bonds for my personal gain is utter nonsense.”A spokesman for the pension fund, Mark Boutet, said, “Since this matter is before the courts, we are not commenting.”We’ll see what the courts eventually have to say about all of this. But that could take years, and we might see a liquidity crisis — and many more cases like this one — first.

Boaz Weinstein
Net worth: $450 million
Founder & Chief Investment Officer, Saba Capital Management
Age: 38





Boaz Weinstein is best known as the financial whiz kid who identified the trade made by Bruno Iksil, JP Morgan's notorious "London Whale," this past summer.   The young hedge fund manager has been making a name for himself on the Street for years – and amassing a fortune in the process. The chess phenom was born and raised in New York City and majored in philosophy at the University of Michigan. He then spent just over a decade at Deutsche Bank where, at the age of 27, he became the youngest managing director in the bank's history.  In 2009, he started his own fund, Saba Capital, with $140 million in capital. His reputation as one of the savviest debt traders on the street has ballooned along with his firm, which now manages just over $5.5 billion.

Boaz worked at Deutsche Bank from 1998–2009. He was Co-Head of Global Credit Trading where he oversaw a team of approximately 650 professionals and was a member of the Global Markets Executive Committee. Boaz rose to prominence in 2006 and 2007, when the Saba proprietary trading group cleared over $1.5 billion in profits. Weinstein was promoted at age 27 to become Deutsche Bank’s youngest ever Managing Director.[4] His proprietary trading group was widely reported to have lost about 18% on $10 billion of capital in 2008, his only losing year out of his eleven years at Deutsche Bank.[8]
Saba Capital Management[edit]
In 2009, Weinstein went ahead with a plan to lift out 15 members of his team to start his own credit-focused hedge fund, Saba Capital Management, based in New York.[9][10] Saba launched its flagship fund in August 2009 with $140 million.
In March 2011, Saba was listed as the fastest growing hedge fund in 2010 by Absolute Return + Alpha Magazine.[11] Weinstein was also included in Fortune Magazine’s 40 Under 40 list in 2010 and 2011.[12][13] In 2012, Weinstein profited from a notable $6-billion loss incurred by JPMorgan on account of a failed investment in credit derivatives attributed to Bruno Iksil.[14][15][16]
As of March 2017, Saba managed $1.7 billion in assets.[17]
Philanthropy[edit]
Weinstein serves on the Board of Directors of Stuyvesant High School and is also a Leadership Council member for Robin Hood, New York’s largest poverty-fighting organization.
Weinstein's philanthropy has focused on public school education, New York City, and Jewish causes.[18][19][20][21]
Personal life[edit]
In 2010, Weinstein married Tali Farhadian in a Jewish ceremony at the Central Synagogue in Manhattan.[22] Tali was born in 1975 in Iran to a Jewish family that fled the fall of the Shah in 1979.[23] She is a Rhodes Scholar and was previously an attorney with the United States Department of Justice.[22]
In 2012 Weinstein was reported to have bought a $25.5 million property on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, from the estate of Huguette Clark.[24][25]

Saba Capital Joins Other Quant Hedge Funds Experiencing a Tough 2012

















































































 
























Saba Capital Joins Other Quant Hedge Funds Experiencing a Tough 2012

Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital has had an under-performing third quarter and overall, a bad year so far. Saba Capital made it into the Forbes’ list of highest earning hedge fund managers for 2011, if that’s any consolation. Boaz Weinstein is famous for profiting from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s trading losses, but did not have similar luck in the following months.

The fund has lost 0.91 percent year to date and had negative returns for Q3 2012, according to sources familiar with the matter. The net performance for the third quarter was -3.27 percent. The fund has lagged in five out nine months, and as of September 2012, the total firm assets are just above $5.3 billion. The fund’s major strategies are based on credit long/short , credit relative value, and capital structure arbitrage. Lately Saba has been making bets on collateralized loan obligations (CLO), as reported by Bloomberg news. Some consider these type of investments risky, despite higher yields and short term debt obligations.
“Some CLOs issued before 2008 are still undervalued comparing to the underlying assets,” James Wang, a money manager at Saba in New York, told Bloomberg in an interview. Wang likes debt better than old CLOs, which “are more stable because they are short-dated” and “have relatively low volatility compared to the average CLO.”
There are a number of other hedge funds who have had a losing year so far, the common theme in their investing strategy is a quantitative, algorithm driven approach. Woodbine Capital Advisors is losing capital, as investors have pulled out their money, according to sources who spoke to ValueWalk. The total assets were down as much as $500 million earlier this year, while in its high times the fund has managed as much as $3.2 billion. The firm’s highest gain for almost two years has been a profit of +2.96 percent for the month of July 2012. Woodbine lost by 0.32 percent in August.
Other funds that implement aggressive computer driven algorithms to circle investment ideas are Hutchin Hill, BlueCrest Capital, Winton Capital, and one of Man Group’s Plc (LON:EMG) funds. Winton Capital detracted by 3.28 percent, Man Group’s AHL has fallen by 4 percent in the year so far. Hutchin Hill, which also profited off the JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) London Whale Trade, has been moderately profitable for this year.

The Natan Fund

                    Natan inspires young philanthropists to actively engage in Jewish giving by funding innovative projects that are shaping the Jewish future.

Natan believes that educated, engaged, and entrepreneurial philanthropy can transform both givers and nonprofit organizations. Natan members pool their charitable contributions, set the philanthropic strategy and agenda for the foundation, and allocate funds to innovative organizations that are building new vision for the Jewish people and the State of Israel. Through unique educational events and experiences, and through a rigorous, hands-on grantmaking process, Natan is creating an influential, philanthropically-minded community of young Jews dedicated to transforming the Jewish future.

Natan supports entrepreneurial organizations with annual budgets under $1.5 million that demonstrate an innovative approach to addressing the challenges facing the Jewish people.

Since 2002, Natan has awarded over $7.7 million to 128 social entrepreneurs and emerging nonprofits and has generated well over $800,000 in additional funds for these organizations through challenge grants and individual contributions from Natan members.

The Natan board underwrites Natan's operating expenses, so 100% of contributions goes to Natan's grantees.

Natan is named in memory of JJ Greenberg (1965-2002), a friend to many of Natan's founding members and a Jewish leader who embodied generosity, joy, and a passion for Jewish life. JJ's Hebrew name was Natan, a form of the Hebrew word for "give."
