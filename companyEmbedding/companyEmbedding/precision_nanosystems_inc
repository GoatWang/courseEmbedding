Lipid Nanoparticles - Precision Nanosystems            
NanoAssemblr PlatformFormulation and Drug DevelopmentPayloadOVERVIEWLipid NanoparticlesLiposomesPolymeric NanoparticlesLipid NanoparticlesThe ideal targeted delivery vehicleLipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are well suited as delivery vehicles in gene therapy via nucleic acid delivery to primary cells. Modulating genes has become common practice in disease research both for understanding and treating genetic ailments. In research, modulating the expression of genes can help identify the proteins involved in a disease. As a treatment, delivering a nucleic acid to suppress protein expression or replace a disease-causing protein can reverse the disorder. The low toxicity and low immunogenicity make LNPs unique alternatives to viral and cationic gene delivery systems.The main obstacle to nucleic acid delivery is that the therapeutic genetic material becomes degraded once injected or applied systemically to an organism. Furthermore, nucleic acids are large molecular constructs that cannot be easily endocytosed or passively absorbed by cells. To overcome these challenges, LNPs have been developed to encapsulate and protect nucleic acids at high encapsulation efficiency. Also,  LNPs are broadly applicable because they are taken up through a nearly-ubiquitous endogenous pathway. Their low toxicity allows them to be used with challenging cell types and to be translated from in vitro to in vivo studies.| PUBLICATIONS |
The NanoAssemblr Spark has an operating nanoparticle formulation volume of 25 – 250 μL. By ensuring yields nearing 100%, the Spark is ideal for target validation screening and nanoparticle formulation development that involves scarce or expensive nucleic acid constructs and nanoparticle excipients.
REQUEST QUOTE
The NanoAssemblr Benchtop system is designed for rapid prototyping of novel nanoparticle formulations of 1 to 15mL, that would be difficult to make with alternative manufacturing methods. Software enables the control of input mixing parameters for optimizing particle characteristics such as size and encapsulation efficiency.
REQUEST QUOTE
The NanoAssemblr Blaze bridges the gap between nanoparticle discovery and clinical development. The system can manufacture between 10 mL and 1 L which allows researchers to use the Blaze for nanoparticle discovery, for preclinical toxicology testing, and for early Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) studies.

The NanoAssemblr™ BenchtopREQUEST QUOTE CONTACT US BROCHUREControlled and tuned nanomedicine designThe NanoAssemblr Benchtop is a nanoparticle synthesis system that gives researchers reproducibility and ease-of-use for iterating on nanoparticle formulations and therapeutic delivery experiments. Proprietary microfluidics technology enables controlled, bottom-up, molecular self-assembly of nanoparticles through millisecond mixing of components at nanolitre scale. The NanoAssemblr Benchtop is capable of manufacturing nanoparticle volumes between 1 to 20 mL per batch, which is ideal for low-cost formulation and process development. The quick and precise manufacture of nano-medicines allows for 30+ formulations in a day. Users can control size by process and composition – even tweak process parameters such as mixing ratios, flow rate and lipid composition in order to fine tune size.The Benchtop instrument harnesses Precision NanoSystems’ microfluidic mixing technology to simplify and control the formulation of nanoparticles. The system allows the encapsulation of constructs using novel excipient design that are difficult or not possible using alternative methods. From nucleic acids to hydrophobic drugs, the Benchtop enables tuning for the optimization of nanoparticle encapsulation efficiency and payload release and activity, whether it be in liposome, lipid nanoparticle or polymeric nanoparticle approaches.Applications:Gene delivery via high in vivo cell transfection efficiencyNanoparticle designDrug developmentLipid nanoparticles formulationLiposome encapsulationPolymeric nanoparticles
The NanoAssemblr™ Benchtop Cartridges$625.00
 Spec SheetNanoAssemblr Microfluidic Cartridges are used with the Benchtop Instrument for the synthesis of a variety of nanoparticles (liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles). These disposable cartridges have a broad solvent compatibility and can be used to make nanoparticles via nanoprecipitation. The nanoparticles self-assemble while the formulation components are rapidly mixed through the microfluidic channels of the cartridges. Size and properties of the nanoparticles can be altered through the flow rate at which formulation materials are pumped through the cartridge.
Precise and rapid microfluidic mixing at different flow rate ratios allows researchers to finely tune particle size. This, along with varying nanoparticle composition provides a convenient means of modifying particle properties.
The NanoAssemblr Spark has an operating nanoparticle formulation volume of 25 – 250 μL. By ensuring yields nearing 100%, the Spark is ideal for target validation screening and nanoparticle formulation development that involves scarce or expensive nucleic acid constructs and nanoparticle excipients.

 Polymeric Nanoparticles - Precision Nanosystems            
NanoAssemblr PlatformFormulation and Drug DevelopmentPayloadOVERVIEWLipid NanoparticlesLiposomesPolymeric NanoparticlesPolymeric NanoparticlesPolymer-based nanoparticles can improve the efficacy, solubility, toxicity, bioavailability and pharmacokinetic
profile of a drug molecule. Numerous applications are being developed, including:
• Biodistribution of chemotherapeutic agents in tumours to reduce off-target toxicity and widen the therapeutic window
• Encapsulation and delivery of biomolecules for genetic medicine, gene-editing, and immunotherapy
• Encapsulation and co-delivery of multiple APIs and/or image contrast agents for combination drug therapy or theranosticsChallengesCommon challenges exist when developing therapeutic polymeric nanoparticles. These include:
• Particle size control
• Efficient drug loading
• Process reproducibility
• Process scalability
These challenges can affect the safety and efficacy of the polymer formulation as well as the efficiency with which new formulations can move through the development pipeline.
NanoAssemblr™ Technology:Key Benefits  How It Works  ResourcesKey Benefits of the NanoAssemblr Platform:The NanoAssemblr platform is designed to accelerate pre-clinical and clinical development of polymer nanoparticle drug formulations. Conventional approaches to nanoparticle synthesis employ turbulent mixing, which is difficult to control and highly variant across points in space and time. In contrast, NanoAssemblr microfluidic mixers exploit the physics of confined fluid flow to achieve non-turbulent mixing which is highly uniform throughout the mixing volume, and highly reproducible at any given time. Specifically, these advances empower users to overcome the aforementioned challenges to nanoparticle research and development:Particle Size ControlCombining reproducible microfluidics with precise fluid injection allows users to efficiently find and dial in the optimal conditions for nanoparticle formation.
Systematically explore the parameter space that influences size and adjust parameters in the NanoAssemblr software such as Total Flow Rate (TFR) and Flow Rate Ratio (FRR). Dial in parameters to achieve a specific size with the same particle composition.
Download the Application Note “PLGA Nanoparticles: Tuning particle size using the NanoAssemblr Benchtop Instrument” for details.Efficient Drug LoadingImproved drug loading efficiency compared to conventional methods.PLGA nanoparticles formed in the presence of model drug Coumarin6 exhibit high encapsulation efficiency.
Download the Application Note “Production and In Situ Drug Loading Using the NanoAssemblr Benchtop Instrument and the Impact of Solvent Removal Methods.” for details.PLGA nanoparticles smaller than 100nm in size, produced in three separate batches by three independent operators, demonstrating inter-operator and batch-to-batch consistency.
Download the Application Note “Reproducible Production of Sub-100 nm PLGA Nanoparticles using the NanoAssemblr Microfluidic Platform” for details.Scalable ProductionThe NanoAssemblr continuous flow microfluidic process can be scaled up by increasing total volume injected through a single mixer, or by employing multiple mixer in parallel without affecting the underlying conditions of nanoparticle synthesis. This allows formulations to be optimized at bench scales, and scaled up with little to no re-optimization at each change in batch size.
Formulation parameters optimized on the Benchtop (up to 15 mL) were transferred unchanged to the Blaze (up to 1000 mL) and the same size and PDI were achieved for PLGA-NPs. Samples can also be concentrated as desired using centrifugal filtration and tangential flow filtration.VersatileThe controlled nanoprecipitation process occurring in the NanoAssemblr microfluidic device is suitable for creating a variety of different polymer particles including:
• Biodegradable polymer nanoparticles (ex: PLGA) (see webinar, application notes, poster)
• Amphiphilic block co-polymer micelles (ex: PEG-PLA) (see poster)
• Dendrimer nanoparticles
• Polymer-drug conjugates
Control size of PEG-PLGA block copolymer micelles: micelle size was tuned by changing instrument parameters such as Total Flow Rate (TFR) and Flow Rate Ratio
(FRR). TFR and FRR are easily specified using the included NanoAssemblr software.How it worksThe NanoAssemblr Benchtop instrument is suited for bench-scale formulation development and optimization. Polymers in a solvent
and an aqueous phase are loaded into separate syringes. The syringes are then connected directly to the semi-disposable
NanoAssemblr microfluidic cartridge. Computer controlled injectors regulate injection of the two phases into the microfluidic channels in
the cartridge, where rapid, homogeneous mixing ensures particles are formed under consistent conditions. Computer controlled
independent injection of both liquids allows mixing speed and mixing ratio to be easily dialled-in, which allows systematic optimization of
particle formation parameters. The system uses fully disposable fluid path driven by disposable syringes to minimize sample
contamination and maximize convenience. The Benchtop is designed for batch sizes between 1 mL and 15 mL, with flow rates up to 18
mL/min.Related resources:• See the NanoAssemblr Benchtop page for more information about the system hardware.

University of British Columbia and Precision NanoSystems Publish Lipid Nanoparticle Article in Langmuir  January 23, 2012/in All News /by James TaylorPrecision NanoSystems, a provider of innovative tools for the development and manufacture of best-in-class nanoparticles for use as medicines, and in medical research, collaborated with scientists from the University of British Columbia to develop lipid nanoparticle systems using the NanoAssemblr technology. This work has been recently published in the journal, Langmuir (2012, 28 (7): 3633-3640). The article &#8220;Bottom-Up Design and Synthesis of Limit Size Lipid Nanoparticle Systems with Aqueous and Triglyceride Cores Using Millisecond Microfluidic Mixing&#8221; describes the development of &#8220;limit-size&#8221; systems (the smallest achieveable aggregates compatible with the packing of the molecular constiuents in a defined and energetically stable structure) with either polar, or non-polar cores. Liposome systems (polar core) comprising POPC, or POPC and cholesterol could be manufactured at limit sizes of 20 nm and 40 nm, respectively. Further, these systems were amenable to pH gradient-mediated  encapsulation of the anti-cancer drug, doxorubicin. Non-polar systems (nanoemulsions) formulated with the triglyceride triolein and the phospholipid POPC could be readily manipulated to vary particle size in the range 20 nm – 50 nm. To our knowledge this is the first report of stable triglyceride emulsions in this size range generated by a scalable manufacturing process.About Precision NanoSystems, Inc.At Precision NanoSystems we are creating innovative tools for the development and manufacture of best-in-class nanoparticles for use as medicines, and in medical research.

About Precision NanoSystems’ Technology and Applications

Precision NanoSystems Inc. (PNI) empowers researchers to advance the application of nanoparticles in understanding and treating disease, particularly in genetic medicine.PNI’s nanoparticle technology enables the potent transfection of primary cells with high cell transfection efficiency (efficient nucleic acid delivery) achieved using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Furthermore, PNI’s versatile NanoAssemblr™ nanoparticle formulation platform enables rapid, reproducible, and scalable lipid nanoparticle and liposome formulation, as well as polymeric nanoparticle production.

The NanoAssemblr platform simplifies the formulation of nanoparticles to accelerate nanoparticle research from drug target discovery to therapeutic nanoparticle manufacturing for the clinic. For example, drug targets can be screened using NanoAssemblr Transfection Reagents prepared on the NanoAssemblr Spark™ at a microlitre scale. Armed with this knowledge, researchers can then optimize their genetic medicines, polymeric nanoparticles and liposomal encapsulation technologies at the millilitre scale using the NanoAssemblr Benchtop. For larger scale animal and early CMC studies, the NanoAssemblr Blaze™ uses the same process parameters optimized for LNP, polymer and liposome encapsulation developed on the Benchtop. The Blaze seamlessly scales nanoparticle formulations, further bridging the gap between nanoparticle discovery and clinical development. As a final step towards the clinic, process parameters can be transferred to the NanoAssemblr Scale-Up system, which is suitable for the GMP environment where LNP and polymer nanoparticles synthesis, or liposome manufacturing for clinical trials, can be accomplished.
