Early life and education[edit]
Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Ford's cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis.
Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975[1] and went on to graduate from Princeton University in 1979, having majored in history and served as president of the Ivy Club. He played on the Princeton rugby team as well. In 1984 he received an M.S. in management as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management.[5]
Career[edit]
He joined Ford in 1979 and 1981 held a variety of positions, beginning in product development and on the financial staff, a grooming ground for future executives. He served several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (since divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations.
Corporate governance[edit]
Ford gave up an executive position in heavy truck program management to become chairman of the finance committee on the Board of Directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected Chairman of the Board in September 1998, and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well.[6] On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as President and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's Executive Chairman.[2]
At the time of his stepping down, Ford was ranked 264th on Forbes' list of top-earning CEOs, at $10,000,000.00 per year.[7][8]
Business developments[edit]
In 2000, he announced that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade.[citation needed] That commitment proved to be impractical, given consumer preference for heavy towing capacity and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal.[citation needed] Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint.[citation needed] Some environmentalists[who?] questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda.[citation needed] Ford's position is that for the company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand.[citation needed] During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand.[citation needed]
Under Bill Ford's direction, Ford Motor Company made technological progress toward improving fuel efficiency, with the introduction of the Hybrid Electric Escape, the most fuel efficient SUV on the market, achieving 36 mpg (EPA) in city driving.[9] The Escape's platform mates Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute are also scheduled to receive hybrid-electric powertrain options, along with other upcoming vehicles in the Ford product line including the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup will be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved to be overly optimistic, and had to be abandoned. Ford also continues to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition, to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford is currently marketing high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, and the Volvo XC70 and Volvo XC90. Ford is also developing sporty new crossover SUVs, such as the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX, and Mazda CX-7.
Ford has expanded its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate on a range of fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.[10]
Speaking at conference in November 2000 in London Ford suggested that the company may one day offer a service where it owns vehicles and makes them available to people when they need access to them.[11]
Market competition, health care and raw material costs, led Ford to announce a second restructuring for its North American operations in four years. Ford's restructuring plan, dubbed "The Way Forward", reversed a $1.6 billion loss during 2009 in its North American operations. The company returned to profitability in 2010.[12]
Fontinalis Partners[edit]
Bill Ford has been a vocal advocate for improvements to be made in all modes of global transportation. Bill Ford has stated that governments and private industry will need to rethink transportation infrastructure and technology as the global population expands and the existing infrastructure is unable to keep pace.[13] In January 2010, Bill Ford announced the launch of a strategic investment firm, Fontinalis Partners, with the purpose of investing in innovative companies developing next-generation mobility solutions. Bill Ford co-founded the firm with Ralph Booth (Chairman and CEO of Booth American Company and successful media and telecom investor), Mark Schulz (former head of Ford Motor Company’s international operations), Chris Cheever, and Chris Thomas.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Ford is married to Lisa Vanderzee Ford, and they have four children, all living in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[citation needed]
Trivia[edit]
Ford became widely known when he was serving as the new Chairman of the Board. On February 1, 1999, when the Ford Rouge Powerhouse had an explosion that killed several Ford employees, Bill Ford rejected the ideas of his advisers and rushed to the scene from the nearby Ford World Headquarters. One of his staff cautioned, "Generals don't go out to the front lines." Ford's retort: "Then bust me down to private." Ford stopped and gave an account of the explosion to roadside television crews.[15]
According to news reports, Ford "is a tae kwon do blackbelt, a vegan[16] and a folk guitar player." Ford also plays on the company hockey team and has won in their division at the 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 USA Hockey Pond Hockey National Championships in Eagle River, Wisconsin.[citation needed]
Ford also is Vice Chairman of the Detroit Lions football team, Chairman of the Detroit Economic Club, and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of The Henry Ford museum. He also is a Vice Chairman of Detroit Renaissance and a member of the Board of Directors of eBay Inc.[citation needed]
In 2000, Ford was cited to be worth around $2.8 billion based on the company's high stock price; however, today Ford's stake in the company is valued lower.[citation needed]
In 2009, Ford was featured in the IFTA nominated[17] Canadian-Irish docudrama Death or Canada. Ford gives insight into the trials his family faced when they fled Ireland in 1847, at the height of the An Gorta Mór or Great Hunger, making their way to the United States through Canada, as many Irish immigrants of the time did.
In 2011, Ford was inducted into Irish America magazine's Hall of Fame.[18]

Early life and education[edit]
Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Ford's cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis.
Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975[1] and went on to graduate from Princeton University in 1979, having majored in history and served as president of the Ivy Club. He played on the Princeton rugby team as well. In 1984 he received an M.S. in management as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management.[5]
Career[edit]
He joined Ford in 1979 and 1981 held a variety of positions, beginning in product development and on the financial staff, a grooming ground for future executives. He served several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (since divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations.
Corporate governance[edit]
Ford gave up an executive position in heavy truck program management to become chairman of the finance committee on the Board of Directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected Chairman of the Board in September 1998, and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well.[6] On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as President and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's Executive Chairman.[2]
At the time of his stepping down, Ford was ranked 264th on Forbes' list of top-earning CEOs, at $10,000,000.00 per year.[7][8]
Business developments[edit]
In 2000, he announced that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade.[citation needed] That commitment proved to be impractical, given consumer preference for heavy towing capacity and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal.[citation needed] Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint.[citation needed] Some environmentalists[who?] questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda.[citation needed] Ford's position is that for the company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand.[citation needed] During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand.[citation needed]
Under Bill Ford's direction, Ford Motor Company made technological progress toward improving fuel efficiency, with the introduction of the Hybrid Electric Escape, the most fuel efficient SUV on the market, achieving 36 mpg (EPA) in city driving.[9] The Escape's platform mates Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute are also scheduled to receive hybrid-electric powertrain options, along with other upcoming vehicles in the Ford product line including the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup will be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved to be overly optimistic, and had to be abandoned. Ford also continues to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition, to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford is currently marketing high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, and the Volvo XC70 and Volvo XC90. Ford is also developing sporty new crossover SUVs, such as the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX, and Mazda CX-7.
Ford has expanded its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate on a range of fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.[10]
Speaking at conference in November 2000 in London Ford suggested that the company may one day offer a service where it owns vehicles and makes them available to people when they need access to them.[11]
Market competition, health care and raw material costs, led Ford to announce a second restructuring for its North American operations in four years. Ford's restructuring plan, dubbed "The Way Forward", reversed a $1.6 billion loss during 2009 in its North American operations. The company returned to profitability in 2010.[12]
Fontinalis Partners[edit]
Bill Ford has been a vocal advocate for improvements to be made in all modes of global transportation. Bill Ford has stated that governments and private industry will need to rethink transportation infrastructure and technology as the global population expands and the existing infrastructure is unable to keep pace.[13] In January 2010, Bill Ford announced the launch of a strategic investment firm, Fontinalis Partners, with the purpose of investing in innovative companies developing next-generation mobility solutions. Bill Ford co-founded the firm with Ralph Booth (Chairman and CEO of Booth American Company and successful media and telecom investor), Mark Schulz (former head of Ford Motor Company’s international operations), Chris Cheever, and Chris Thomas.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Ford is married to Lisa Vanderzee Ford, and they have four children, all living in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[citation needed]
Trivia[edit]
Ford became widely known when he was serving as the new Chairman of the Board. On February 1, 1999, when the Ford Rouge Powerhouse had an explosion that killed several Ford employees, Bill Ford rejected the ideas of his advisers and rushed to the scene from the nearby Ford World Headquarters. One of his staff cautioned, "Generals don't go out to the front lines." Ford's retort: "Then bust me down to private." Ford stopped and gave an account of the explosion to roadside television crews.[15]
According to news reports, Ford "is a tae kwon do blackbelt, a vegan[16] and a folk guitar player." Ford also plays on the company hockey team and has won in their division at the 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 USA Hockey Pond Hockey National Championships in Eagle River, Wisconsin.[citation needed]
Ford also is Vice Chairman of the Detroit Lions football team, Chairman of the Detroit Economic Club, and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of The Henry Ford museum. He also is a Vice Chairman of Detroit Renaissance and a member of the Board of Directors of eBay Inc.[citation needed]
In 2000, Ford was cited to be worth around $2.8 billion based on the company's high stock price; however, today Ford's stake in the company is valued lower.[citation needed]
In 2009, Ford was featured in the IFTA nominated[17] Canadian-Irish docudrama Death or Canada. Ford gives insight into the trials his family faced when they fled Ireland in 1847, at the height of the An Gorta Mór or Great Hunger, making their way to the United States through Canada, as many Irish immigrants of the time did.
In 2011, Ford was inducted into Irish America magazine's Hall of Fame.[18]

Early life and education[edit]

On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Ford's cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis.

Early life and education[edit]
Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Ford's cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis.
Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975[1] and went on to graduate from Princeton University in 1979, having majored in history and served as president of the Ivy Club. He played on the Princeton rugby team as well. In 1984 he received an M.S. in management as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management.[5]
Career[edit]
He joined Ford in 1979 and 1981 held a variety of positions, beginning in product development and on the financial staff, a grooming ground for future executives. He served several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (since divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations.
Corporate governance[edit]
Ford gave up an executive position in heavy truck program management to become chairman of the finance committee on the Board of Directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected Chairman of the Board in September 1998, and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well.[6] On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as President and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's Executive Chairman.[2]
At the time of his stepping down, Ford was ranked 264th on Forbes' list of top-earning CEOs, at $10,000,000.00 per year.[7][8]
Business developments[edit]
In 2000, he announced that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade.[citation needed] That commitment proved to be impractical, given consumer preference for heavy towing capacity and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal.[citation needed] Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint.[citation needed] Some environmentalists[who?] questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda.[citation needed] Ford's position is that for the company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand.[citation needed] During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand.[citation needed]
Under Bill Ford's direction, Ford Motor Company made technological progress toward improving fuel efficiency, with the introduction of the Hybrid Electric Escape, the most fuel efficient SUV on the market, achieving 36 mpg (EPA) in city driving.[9] The Escape's platform mates Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute are also scheduled to receive hybrid-electric powertrain options, along with other upcoming vehicles in the Ford product line including the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup will be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved to be overly optimistic, and had to be abandoned. Ford also continues to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition, to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford is currently marketing high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, and the Volvo XC70 and Volvo XC90. Ford is also developing sporty new crossover SUVs, such as the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX, and Mazda CX-7.
Ford has expanded its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate on a range of fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.[10]
Speaking at conference in November 2000 in London Ford suggested that the company may one day offer a service where it owns vehicles and makes them available to people when they need access to them.[11]
Market competition, health care and raw material costs, led Ford to announce a second restructuring for its North American operations in four years. Ford's restructuring plan, dubbed "The Way Forward", reversed a $1.6 billion loss during 2009 in its North American operations. The company returned to profitability in 2010.[12]
Fontinalis Partners[edit]
Bill Ford has been a vocal advocate for improvements to be made in all modes of global transportation. Bill Ford has stated that governments and private industry will need to rethink transportation infrastructure and technology as the global population expands and the existing infrastructure is unable to keep pace.[13] In January 2010, Bill Ford announced the launch of a strategic investment firm, Fontinalis Partners, with the purpose of investing in innovative companies developing next-generation mobility solutions. Bill Ford co-founded the firm with Ralph Booth (Chairman and CEO of Booth American Company and successful media and telecom investor), Mark Schulz (former head of Ford Motor Company’s international operations), Chris Cheever, and Chris Thomas.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Ford is married to Lisa Vanderzee Ford, and they have four children, all living in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[citation needed]
Trivia[edit]
Ford became widely known when he was serving as the new Chairman of the Board. On February 1, 1999, when the Ford Rouge Powerhouse had an explosion that killed several Ford employees, Bill Ford rejected the ideas of his advisers and rushed to the scene from the nearby Ford World Headquarters. One of his staff cautioned, "Generals don't go out to the front lines." Ford's retort: "Then bust me down to private." Ford stopped and gave an account of the explosion to roadside television crews.[15]
According to news reports, Ford "is a tae kwon do blackbelt, a vegan[16] and a folk guitar player." Ford also plays on the company hockey team and has won in their division at the 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 USA Hockey Pond Hockey National Championships in Eagle River, Wisconsin.[citation needed]
Ford also is Vice Chairman of the Detroit Lions football team, Chairman of the Detroit Economic Club, and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of The Henry Ford museum. He also is a Vice Chairman of Detroit Renaissance and a member of the Board of Directors of eBay Inc.[citation needed]
In 2000, Ford was cited to be worth around $2.8 billion based on the company's high stock price; however, today Ford's stake in the company is valued lower.[citation needed]
In 2009, Ford was featured in the IFTA nominated[17] Canadian-Irish docudrama Death or Canada. Ford gives insight into the trials his family faced when they fled Ireland in 1847, at the height of the An Gorta Mór or Great Hunger, making their way to the United States through Canada, as many Irish immigrants of the time did.
In 2011, Ford was inducted into Irish America magazine's Hall of Fame.[18]

William Clay Ford Jr.
Executive Chairman, Ford Motor Company
As Executive Chairman of Ford Motor Company, William Clay Ford Jr. is leading the company that put the world on wheels into the 21st century. He joined the Board of Directors in 1988 and has been its chairman since January 1999. Through the years, his vision for the company has remained unchanged.
“I believe the purpose of a company is to make people’s lives better,” he says. “That is how we became great in the past and it is how we will become even greater in the future.
Under Bill Ford’s leadership Ford Motor Company was named the Best Global Green Brand among all companies in the world in 2014, and one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for the seventh year in a row in 2016.
“The ongoing success of Ford Motor Company is my life’s work,” he says.  “Nothing is more important to me than our reputation as a family company that people trust to do the right thing.”
After joining the company in 1979 as a product planning analyst, he held positions in manufacturing, sales, marketing, product development and finance. During the 1982 Ford-United Auto Workers labor talks, which launched the employee involvement movement that revolutionized the industry, he served on the company’s National Bargaining Team. In 1983 he began a 12-month course of study as an Alfred P. Sloan fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was elected chairman and managing director of Ford Switzerland in 1987.
As head of Business Strategy for the Ford Automotive Group in 1990, he helped develop guidelines for establishing low-volume manufacturing plants in emerging markets. After being appointed general manager of Climate Control Division in 1992, he led a profit turnaround and a major improvement in product quality. He also established the company’s first wildlife habitat at a plant location and the first automotive plant in the world to use 25 percent post-consumer materials in all of its plastic parts. While he was general manager the division won the President’s Commission on Environmental Quality Award.
Bill Ford was elected a company vice president and head of the company’s Commercial Truck Vehicle Center in 1994. He left that position in order to assume the chairmanship of the Board of Directors’ Finance Committee in 1995. In addition to his duties as chairman, he served as chief executive officer of the company from October 2001 to September 2006, when he was named executive chairman. As CEO, he improved quality, lowered costs and delivered exciting new products. During his time in that position he took the company from a $5.5 billion loss in 2001 to three straight years of profitability.
A lifelong environmentalist, Bill Ford is committed to developing products that benefit customers and society. Under his leadership, in 2000 Ford Motor Company published its first corporate citizenship report outlining the economic, environmental and social impact of company products and operations around the world. In 2004, the company completed the world’s largest brownfield reclamation project, the restoration of its Ford Rouge Center in metropolitan Detroit. He also championed the Escape Hybrid, the world’s first hybrid-electric sport utility vehicle.
“During the last industry downturn, Ford invested heavily in fuel economy and technology at a time when many others were pulling back,” he says. “It absolutely was the right thing to do.”
Looking to the future, in 2011 he began outlining the company’s vision of what sustainable transportation will look like in the years ahead, as well as the steps it will take to get there. That future includes vehicles that communicate with each other and the world around them to make driving safer, ease traffic congestion and sustain the environment. As the next step in these efforts, in 2015 the company announced Ford Smart Mobility, its plan to deliver advances in connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles, the customer experience and data and analytics.
“My great-grandfather helped put the world on wheels so everyone could enjoy the benefits of mobility,” he says. “Our vision is to expand on that thinking, using advanced technology and new business models so that personal mobility remains viable in a crowded world.”
Bill Ford’s charitable, volunteer and business efforts are highlighted by his commitment to the city of Detroit. As vice chairman of the Detroit Lions professional football team, he led efforts to build a new, environmentally-friendly stadium in Detroit that was the site of Super Bowl XL. Through Detroit Lions Charities, he helped develop the Detroit Police Athletic League youth football program into one of the largest in the country.
Under his leadership the company’s philanthropic arm, Ford Motor Company Fund and Community Services, focused its efforts on helping communities, supporting education and improving safety through driving skills training. In 2005 he launched the Ford Volunteer Corps to enhance the efforts of employee volunteers serving communities around the world. In its first ten years, Ford 30,000 volunteers worked on more than 9,000 projects in 40 countries.
In 2015, he championed the 30 Under Thirty program to develop the next generation of Ford philanthropic leaders and the Bill Ford Better World Challenge, which provides grant funding for projects that engage employees and local nonprofits in addressing needs that will improve community life and make people’s lives better.
Bill Ford is Chairman of the Board of the Detroit Economic Club, a member of the Board of Trustees of The Henry Ford and the Henry Ford Health System, and is Chairman of the New Michigan Initiative of Business Leaders for Michigan. He also served on the Board of Directors of eBay Inc. from 2005 to 2015. He was inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame in 2011. He also is a founding partner of Fontinalis Partners, LLC, a Michigan-based investment firm that acts as a strategic operating partner to transportation infrastructure technology companies. 
In recognition of his commitment to education and devotion to the Detroit community, in 2015 he was given the Ambassador for Humanity Award by the USC Shoah Foundation Institute.
Bill Ford was born in Detroit in May 1957. He is an avid fly fisherman and car enthusiast, enjoys playing hockey and tennis, and is a martial arts black belt.
He holds a bachelor of arts degree from Princeton University and a master of science degree in management from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He also has been awarded an honorary doctor of environmental sciences and engineering degree from Koc University, an honorary doctor of laws degree from the University of Michigan, an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from Bradley University and an honorary doctorate of economic science from University College Cork and the National University of Ireland.

William Clay Ford, Jr.William Clay (Bill) Ford Jr. (born May 3, 1957) is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ford Motor Company.BackgroundHe was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford. His father was William Clay Ford, Sr., and his mother was Martha Parke Firestone, the granddaughter of Harvey Firestone. He graduated from Princeton University in 1979 and in 1984, received an MS in Management from the MIT Sloan School of Management.Early CareerHe joined Ford in 1979 and held a variety of positions -- notably beginning in the finance staff, a grooming ground for future executives, and several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (sinced divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations.Corporate GovernanceFord gave up his executive position in heavy truck product management to become chairman of the finance committee, a non-executive corporate governance position, for several years before becoming Chairman. He also served as chairman of the board without the CEO title for some time before then-CEO Jacques Nasser was ousted. The ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values -- Nasser was known to be mostly about money and power, while Ford is noted for valuing people and tradition.Notable acts and eventsBill generated a name for himself when he was serving only as Chairman and not CEO. On February 1, 1999 when the Ford Rouge Powerhouse had an explosion that killed several Ford employees, Bill Ford rejected the ideas of his advisors and rushed to the scene from Ford World Headquarters. One of his staff cautioned, "Generals don't go out to the front lines." Ford's retort: "Then bust me down to private." Ford stopped and gave a heart-breaking account of the explosion to roadside television crews.In both 2004 and 2005 Ford has announced contribution of his performance-based stock bonuses to scholarship funds benefitting employees, and to charity.According to news reports, Ford "is a tae kwon do blackbelt, a student of Zen and Tibetan Buddhism and a folk guitar player."He is noted as an environmentalist.1�

Ford, William Clay Jr.Date of Birth:  May 3, 1957Biography from Current Biography (1999)Copyright (c) by The H. W. Wilson Company. All rights reserved.Ford Jr., William ClayChairman of Ford Motor Co.    Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motor Company, once responded to insinuations of nepotism with the gruff remark that there were no "crown princes" in his company. In recent years the company has indeed looked every bit the meritocracy its scion envisioned; Ford family members have been notably absent from the corporate leadership. Since the retirement of Henry Ford II in 1980, the world's second largest company has been led by so-called professional managers--in other words, non-Fords--who have ensured that the company's chain of command is scaled by only the most deserving family members. Lacking nostalgia, these managers are far more concerned with the value of the company stock than they are with the family name and its presence in the organizational scheme.    Thus the appointment, in January 1999, of William Clay Ford Jr. as chairman of the board of directors at Ford represented less a prince's inevitable assumption of his father's throne than the culmination of a career of hard work and struggling up the corporate ladder. The event marked William Ford's triumph over suspicions of nepotism and signaled the family's return to a visible role in the company in a time when they seemed to be in danger of losing it.    William Clay Ford Jr., the great-grandson of Henry Ford, was born in Detroit, Michigan, on May 3, 1957 into the branch of the Ford family that controls 37 of the family's stock in Ford. His father, William Clay Ford Sr., the brother of Henry Ford II, was a high-ranking Ford executive who retired as vice chairman in 1989. He is estimated to be worth $500 million, $405 million of which comes from his shares in the company. William's mother, Martha Firestone, is the granddaughter of rubber company founder Harvey Firestone and so has added to the family wealth. Described as studious, patient and thoughtful, William Jr. excelled both in athletics and academics, and received a blue-chip education. He attended the elite Hotchkiss School in Lakeview, Connecticut, where he played soccer, hockey, and tennis. In 1975 he entered Princeton, in New Jersey, where he majored in history and took up rugby.    Upon graduation from college in 1979, William Ford Jr. needed to decide whether or not to enter the family business. At the time the prospects for family members seeking top executive positions within the company were not as bright as one might imagine. With Henry Ford II's impending retirement, for the first time in the company's history the top-level leadership roles would be filled by individuals outside the Ford family--a breed of executives notoriously suspicious of Ford family members with aspirations in the company. Consequently, William Jr. was somewhat hesitant about taking a job there. "At Princeton, I felt there were a lot of other companies to work for. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that everything I have is due to Ford Motor Co. and that I ought to give it my best shot," he recalled to Alex Taylor III of Fortune (January 16, 1989). He started as a products planning analyst in Advanced Vehicles Development.    William's career at Ford has largely consisted of a series of short-term appointments, described by William as "summer jobs," and rapid promotions. Three years after joining the company, William was appointed a member of Ford's National Bargaining Team for labor talks with the United Auto Workers Union. He was then appointed marketing strategy analyst for North American Automotive Operations and was named to the board of trustees of the Edison Institute, which oversees the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. In June 1983 William spent some time away from Ford to improve his knowledge of finance with a year-long course of study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a prestigious Alfred P. Sloan fellow. After receiving a master's degree in management, William returned to Ford as an international finance specialist. In April 1985 William became a Car Product Development planning manager. The next year he was named director of Commercial Vehicle Marketing for Ford of Europe, and in 1987 William was elected Chairman and managing director of Ford Switzerland, a Ford Motor Co. subsidiary. In this post he supervised a sales and dealer support organization of 110 people responsible for moving 25,000 cars per year.    Following the death of Henry Ford II in September 1987, the Ford family was forced to deal with a number of issues that would determine its role in the company for decades to come. Most pressing was the family's imminent loss of stock in (due to estate taxes levied after a death)--and hence control of--the Ford Motor Co. Although Henry Ford did much to leave his heirs in control of the company, as decades passed their grip necessarily began to loosen. In 1936, 11 years before his death, Henry established the Ford Foundation as a way of circumventing the estate tax. Henry and his son Edsel gave 95 of the company's stock to the foundation and the remaining stock was reserved for the family, who held the voting power. After becoming a publicly held stock in 1956, the Ford Foundation assumed 60 of the company's votes while the family received the remainder of the vote through class B shares. A class B share is a special type of stock worth eight times the normal vote. However, only family members may own it and once it is sold to a non-family member its reverts to normal status. Therefore, the family's voting power declines as members die and stock is sold off to pay estate taxes.    At a meeting in December 1987, the family sought to remedy their problem by forming a trust to retain or increase influence on the company's board and to raise funds to buy any family shares put up for sale. After this move toward solidarity, which united the far-flung Ford family and consolidated their interests, they looked to reestablish within the company's leadership the family presence they had lost with the death of Henry II. The two most likely candidates were Edsel B. Ford II, a son of Henry II, and his cousin, William Jr. Edsel is nine years older than William, and in some ways the cousins are opposites. William had always been serious and studious; Edsel, a cigar and race-car driving enthusiast and Detroit celebrity, was notorious within family circles for having struggled to finish high school and college. Nonetheless, Edsel was initially, and for a long time, the family's great hope. His progression withing the company, however, had been slowed early on by reports of a short temper as well as a lack of creativity.    On January 14, 1988, Edsel Ford II and William Ford Jr. joined William Ford Sr. on the board of directors. Tension developed immediately, however, between then-CEO Donald Petersen and the new board members over the slow pace of their careers. By the end of the year, Edsel was loudly complaining that neither he nor William Jr. held seats on the powerful executive and financial committees--the forums in which important decisions on issues such as capital spending are discussed. Following the retirement of William Ford Sr. in March, both Edsel and William Jr. were named to the committees. Shortly afterward William Jr. was promoted to manager of heavy-truck engineering and manufacturing, and thus took charge of Ford's sole heavy-truck plant, located in Louisville, Kentucky, and its 800 employees.    With the end of the 1980s, a series of appointments and promotions rapidly moved William up the Ford chain of command. In 1990 he was promoted to director of business strategy, a position in which he was responsible for developing long-term goals and strategies, and which is usually a stepping stone to more senior executive positions. Many observers saw the appointment as a turning point, indicating that William, not Edsel, was the family member most likely to eventually take the helm of the company. William, however, dismissed such speculations in a statement made to the New York Times (March 8, 1990): "I don't think that this will make me the leading family representative at Ford. Edsel and I will continue to work as a team." Nevertheless, the company's faith in William became evident again in 1995, when the board of directors appointed him chairman of the financial committee, a position his father once held. The numerous responsibilities of the chairmanship forced William to resign his operating role in the company.    William took on another new challenge in 1995 when he became vice chairman of the National Football League's Detroit Lions, a team owned by his father. William had been increasingly involved with the Lions since becoming the team's treasurer in 1982. As vice chairman, William proved to be an activist with a distinct vision for the team's future. One of his first acts was to save the team's prestigious Thanksgiving-day game, which the league had threatened to give away to a better team. William was responsible for numerous innovations including introducing a new marketing campaign, restructuring the ticketing policy, launching a team website, and starting weekly radio and television shows. But the most impressive accomplishment of his tenure thus far has been the deal he made to move the Lions from suburban Pontiac to a new $265 million domed stadium in Detroit proper. Under the plan, Ford will foot half the bill while several city government agencies will pay the rest. As if to signal a renewed confidence in the Lions, the NFL has promised to hold a Super Bowl in the new stadium.    Many industry pundits rightly saw William's promotion in the Lions' organization, and his ensuing take-charge leadership, as a prelude to taking over at Ford. With the announcement that Alex Trotman, CEO and chairman of Ford since 1993, would retire at the end of 1998, the board of directors elected William Clay Ford Jr. as chairman and chose long-time Ford executive Jacques Nasser as Chief Executive Officer. In a move that is common in Europe but rare in American business, the board decided to split the leadership duties by putting Nasser in charge of the day-to-day activities of the company. On his partnership, William remarked to Ron Stodghill II of Time (December 8, 1997), "The two of us together would be natural. Jacques and I are very good friends. It doesn't have to be one of us or the other running the company." As Stodghill explained, the double appointment caters to the long-term interests of the Ford family, by putting one of their own at the top of the company ("I'm a Ford," William said, "so I'm not going anywhere else."), and should also satisfy the short-term concerns of Wall Street investors by utilizing the talents of the cost-cutting Nasser.    With William in charge, Ford will begin to examine the host of environmental problems linked with automobile emissions. In an industry where environmentalism is usually viewed as anathema, William has already peeved some of his fellow auto executives with several bold,public assertions. In a 1997 address to colleagues, he criticized the car industry for its inaction on the issue of global warming. In Automotive News (September 14, 1998), Aaron Robinson reported that William called global warming a threat "real enough so that we all ought to be concerned." To act on his concerns, William has formed and chairs an environment committee on the company's board. An avid outdoorsman, he drives a battery-operated Ford truck that uses no gasoline and produces no emissions. Ford historian Douglas Brinkley told Daniel McGinn of Newsweek (November 23, 1998), "Bill Ford Jr. has a visionary streak that hasn't been seen since the original Henry Ford. . . . It's not enough for him to run the company--he wants to make the automobile pollution-free."    Although there may be some questions about which direction the new chairman will take his company in the coming years, one thing is certain: William Ford Jr. inherits a company that is as financially strong as it has been in years. Former CEO Alex Trotman's ambitious Ford 2000 globalization plan was a smashing success, and profits climbed briskly during six consecutive years of high sales. As analyst John Casesa told Stodghill, "The family is happy with what it sees. The company is flush with cash, and there is a feeling that Ford is starting to reassert its leadership in the industry." William Ford Jr. told McGinn that having a Ford in charge again "sets our company apart . . . it gives us an identity that other nameless, faceless corporations don't have."    William Clay Ford Jr. lives in Michigan with his wife, the former Lisa Vanderzee, and their four children. He enjoys playing hockey and flyfishing, and is a Civil War buff.2�

News Item, Ford Jr. takes on role he was born to play10/31/2001 - Updated 07:33 AM ET From USATodayFord Jr. takes on role he was born to play By James Cox and David Kiley, USA TODAY William Clay Ford Jr., new chief executive of Ford Motor, justified his decision to race to the scene of a tragic factory explosion in 1999 by saying that Ford employees were family to him.Related story Image woes help lead to Nasser's ouster Detroit Lions players and employees are family, too, he has said."Family" was the word he chose again Tuesday, using it often as he talked about how he ended up CEO of the auto company founded by his great-grandfather, Henry Ford.  "I bleed Ford blue," he told cheering employees.He replaces the hard-nosed, controversial Jacques Nasser, ousted late Monday, as CEO.  But blood loyalties and family history have long stirred ambivalence in Ford Jr. He has refused over the years to read biographies of the visionary Henry.  He quit the company in 1995 after serving in 17 midlevel management jobs.  And he recently fled the family's multimansion compound in exclusive Gross Pointe Woods, Mich., buying a house in Ann Arbor."I certainly never sought this job.  Lord knows, I don't need it," Ford told The Detroit News.  "But when I saw what was happening to our company, I thought I could help us. It was clear to me that we had relationships with our employees that are not what they could be, and relationships with our dealers and other constituencies are not good."Bill Ford, as the 44-year-old likes to be called, is clearly his family's choice to head the world's No. 2 automaker. But as apples go, he could not have fallen farther from the tree.Great-grandpa Henry was a driven, self-educated man, a mechanical genius who fought unions and, later in life, became an overbearing, anti-Semitic crackpot.  His son, Edsel, eventually got the company reins but died struggling with the pressures of business and his increasingly bizarre father.Young Bill got a prep school education before going to Princeton and MIT.  He is a tae kwon do blackbelt, a student of Zen and Tibetan Buddhism and a folk guitar player.His most notable contribution since becoming chairman 2 years ago has been to try to make Ford the most environmentally friendly automaker.  He has horrified many in the industry — and many at the company — by publicly blaming auto emissions for greenhouse gases causing climate change. He speaks passionately about a future with cleaner alternative fuels, recyclable cars and compostable parts.At the moment, Ford's problem is that its earnings are decaying like compost.  The automaker lost $692 million in the third quarter as sales fell 9% and unit volume dropped 15% in North America.Market share in North America, Ford's most profitable area, has been sliding as defect rates have skyrocketed. The company ranked last among the seven largest carmakers in a quality survey earlier this year.Heading into a recession and a cyclical downturn in auto sales, Ford has lost its dominance in the highly profitable pickup and sport-utility categories.The Taurus and Sable, the company's workhorse passenger cars, are tired. Operations in Europe, Latin America and Asia are beset with problems.The biggest blow to the company's bottom line and its pride has been the Explorer fiasco.  Ford spent $500 million last year on the recall of 6.5 million tires for the Explorer and Mercury Moutaineer. It will take a $2.1 billion after-tax charge to pay for costs associated with replacing nearly 13 million more Bridgestone/Firestone tires. Pending lawsuits and lost vehicle sales could add hundreds of millions more to the final tab.To dig out from the mess, Bill Ford has surrounded himself with grayer, wiser heads. That includes Nick Scheele, 57, named Tuesday as president and chief operating officer; Jim Padilla, 55, who will take over as head of Ford North America; and Carl Reichardt, 70, named vice chairman and head of the finance committee.Coaxing Reichardt, former chairman of Wells Fargo, out of retirement seems a major step in the right direction. He has Wall Street's trust, essential for a company that has gone through three CFOs in 3 years."We need to rebuild relationships," Ford said. "I'll be spending a lot of time with Wall Street, dealers, employees, suppliers.  A lot of those relationships are broken or not healthy."Key constituencies Key will be suppliers and dealers.Suppliers, who once stood in line to win Ford's business, complain that the automaker has been especially brutal in dictating price cuts to them.  Even worse, they contend they get little in return for helping Ford design new engines because once the design is finished, Ford puts supply contracts up for open bid.Dealers want assurances that somebody is listening.  They say Nasser barely seemed to know they existed until it was too late. He infuriated them by exploring the idea of Ford-owned dealerships and service centers.  He seldom bothered to show up at dealers' national meetings.In May, Nasser seemed to acknowledge that he had erred.  "I believe we are only hurting ourselves when we think, speak or act as if our partners are outsiders," he wrote in an internal memo.Ford isn't broken, says Hoot McInerny, a legendary Detroit-area Lincoln-Mercury dealer.  "What would it take to fix things?  Quality, quality, quality," he says.  "We just need another turn of the wrench."Nasser, an Australian of Lebanese descent, wanted constant change and improvement. He saw himself as a reformer in the mold of GE's Jack Welch. Even though he was a 33-year Ford veteran, he had spent little time building valuable loyalties in Dearborn and never bothered to court the family.Nasser plunged Ford into new areas, and in the process, he took his eye off the basics, analysts say."If you've got good products, good quality, you and I could run Ford Motor Co.," McInerny says. "He got caught up in the downturn of the economy, and the crowning blow was the Explorer and the tires."Nasser's in-your-face style rubbed Ford family members the wrong way.  The clan has a history of deflating larger-than-life executives on the company payroll.Bill Ford's uncle, Henry II, fired then-president Lee Iacocca after growing irritated that Iacocca's outsize personality had become Ford's public persona.Ford is "structured like an organization of baronies, and the family does not like when a CEO has too strong and dominant a personality," says Gerald Meyers, a former Ford executive and former CEO of American Motors.Various Ford heirs control 40% of the company's voting shares, each of which has 17 times the voting power of an ordinary share of common stock.The family has been collecting $85 million a year in dividends.  The board's recent decision to slash the dividend dropped the family's cut by about 40%.  And it's not just the dividend checks: The value of Ford family shares has fallen almost 50% in the past year."Billy" — as he is called by the other 12 Fords of the fourth generation — owns shares worth about $90 million at current prices, according to Forbes magazine's Richest 400 issue.For love of the company Ford, himself, said his family was "thrilled" to have one of its own atop the company again.  "But I'm not approaching this job as a member of the family, but as someone who loves the company."Ford and Scheele promise a return to the basics, meaning higher-quality cars and trucks.  Along with Padilla and Reichardt, they are expected to make decisions more by consensus than the autocratic Nasser, who had 16 managers reporting to him directly before July."I want the company to succeed.  To do that, we need to get the best people. And if the best people are outside Ford, we will go after them or we'll grow them up from inside," Ford told The News.  "I listen a lot.  I encourage a lot. I want to hear what people think.  This company is too big for any one person to run, I don't care who you are."Bill Ford, industry insiders say, is not likely to stick around as CEO more than 3 or 4 years.  By then, Scheele is likely to retire, and the company will go in search of a professional manager to be its next CEO.  Ford is expected to be more involved than a figurehead but somewhat less of an authority figure than many other CEOs."William Clay Ford's presence may provide a more stable operating environment," says Merrill Lynch analyst John Casesa.  Still, the downturn in the economy and in the industry are "likely to overshadow even the best efforts of the new Ford management team for the near future."Ford Jr. bleeds Detroit Lions "Honolulu blue," as well as Ford blue.  He said Tuesday that the CEO's job would leave him less time with his beloved Lions.Lions employees say he knows everyone from the coaches to the interns. They recall when he used to play in Friday afternoon touch football games — usually as quarterback — with the staff.Inevitably, running his great-grandfather's auto company will cut into the time he can spend with his father's football team."Unless they need me to play quarterback," he joked about the 0-6 Lions. "And the way things are going.  ..."�

News Item, New generation rallies to put a Ford back at topCEO Bill Jr. takes control at critical junctureMonday, June 2, 2003John T. Greilick / The Detroit NewsBy Mark Truby and Bill Vlasic / The Detroit NewsWith the support of his family, including father Bill Ford Sr., Bill Ford Jr. took over the company's top job after 22 years of non-family CEOs. The fourth generation of Fords now has a firm hand on the automaker's future.DEARBORN -- They gathered on a fall weekend in early October 2001, more than 30 members of an extended family facing a critical point in their history.The Fords, heirs to the automotive dynasty, had met regularly for 15 years at the company founded by Henry Ford nearly a century before. But this time was different.It was time for one of their own, 44-year-old Ford Motor Co. Chairman Bill Ford Jr., to save the company that gave them immense wealth and immeasurable pride.When Bill Jr. addressed the group -- his parents, sisters, in-laws and cousins -- the message could not have been clearer. Ford was in deep trouble, and he was ready to move.The response was unanimous. The family stood united behind him."We didn't like what was going on at all," said Anne Ford, Bill Jr.'s cousin and daughter of the last family leader, Henry II. "Something needed to be done."Three weeks later, Bill Jr. summoned Ford CEO Jacques Nasser to his 12th-floor corner office at Ford headquarters and fired him, ending one of the most tumultuous periods in Ford's storied history.After 22 years and five outsiders as chief executive, a Ford was in the driver's seat again at the world's second-biggest automaker.While employees, shareholders and dealers cheered Bill Jr.'s ascension to the top, nobody was more relieved than the family whose name defines an industry that changed the American way of life.Together, they control 40 percent of the voting power in a $163 billion global automotive Goliath and own company stock worth at least $1.3 billion. Other fabled business dynasties -- the du Ponts, Rockefellers and Firestones -- have faded away, but the Fords have marched in lockstep through generations."There's such tremendous pride in the company," Bill Jr. said. "That's the glue that has kept us together."But even with a Ford at the helm now, maintaining family power indefinitely will be a titanic task.If Bill Jr. fails to engineer a comeback, Wall Street could sour on the family's leadership. And down the road, complex inheritance-tax issues and the growing number of heirs could disrupt the family's singleness of purpose."It won't be easy for them to maintain cohesion," said Bob Casey, the longtime historian at the Henry Ford Museum. "They are a family, after all. The stakes are just a whole lot higher for them."The family will convene again later this month, but this occasion will be cause for celebration.Amid the gala events commemorating Ford's 100-year anniversary on June 16, the far-flung descendants of Henry Ford will bask in the glow of an industrial icon. They'll come from the stately estates of Grosse Pointe, and from homes in New York, Connecticut, Florida and California."I heard that 100 percent are expected for the centennial," said Edsel Ford II, a Ford director and retired company vice president.And above all else, the Fords believe in -- and depend on -- unity."The family has the greatest loyalty to the business that you could ever imagine," said Philip Caldwell, Henry II's successor as CEO in 1979. "It's deeper than tradition."Henry Ford II's death leaves gapIt was the darkest day that many Fords can remember -- the death on Sept. 29, 1987, of Henry Ford II, the patriarch and guiding force of the Ford Motor Co. for four decades.He had retired as CEO eight years earlier but still loomed large over the company. The family had control of Ford through the special 40 percent voting power of its Class B stock, but it had lost its rudder.Speculation began immediately on Wall Street, in the media and throughout the industry. Was there another Ford in the automaker's future?Henry II's brother, Bill Ford Sr., became vice chairman in 1980, but displayed no ambition beyond that. Attention shifted to the next generation, the 13 cousins who were the great-grandchildren of Henry Ford.Three of the founder's great-grandsons already were working for Ford, and a fourth wanted a voice in management as well.The oldest, Walter Ford III, worked in marketing, but would become better known for his dashing lifestyle and two messy divorces than his accomplishments at Ford.Henry II's only son, Edsel II, was on a much faster track as general sales manager of Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division. His cousin, Bill Jr., had just been named head of Ford of Switzerland, and harbored grander ambitions.The fourth cousin, Benson Ford Jr., was the black sheep of the clan. When his father, Benson Sr., died in 1978, he scandalized the family by suing to control the estate. "I have money," he said in court. "I want to participate in the affairs of Ford Motor Co."The fifth of Henry's great-grandsons, Alfred Ford, was not a factor. On a vacation in Hawaii, he joined the Hare Krishna movement and took the Hindu name Ambarish Das. Then he moved to San Francisco, far away from the demands of being a Ford."Nobody knows me as a Ford here," he said at the time. "I don't feel I'm strong enough to live in Detroit and be the spiritual person I want to be."The eight women among the fourth generation had no illusions of scaling the corporate ladder at Ford. One married and bought a winery in upstate New York. Another became a teacher and wed an investment banker.Charlotte Ford, Henry II's oldest daughter, summed up the gender gap:"I have no desire to be on the board of Ford Motor Co.," Charlotte, a Detroit debutante turned New York socialite, said in 1978. "Anyway, I was born a girl and that takes care of that."Outsiders keep control for 22 yearsBy the time of Henry II's death, management of the company was firmly in the hands of career Ford executives. Caldwell had been succeeded as CEO by Donald Petersen, a hard-charging product specialist who was leading Ford to record profits.In 1988, Petersen acceded to Henry II's long-stated desire to have Edsel II and Bill Jr. join the board of directors, but denied the young Fords spots on any board committees.Quietly, the family coalesced. They began holding regular meetings, rallying around Bill Sr. and their two hopes for the future -- Edsel II and Bill Jr.Together, they put a stop to the sale by some family members of the priceless Class B shares. A trust was formed to vote the majority of the shares, with Bill Sr., and later Bill Jr. and Edsel II, serving as the key trustees.Whether management wanted their involvement or not, the family was determined to protect its enormous interest in the business."The family has always voted together," Bill Jr. said. "I can't imagine where that wouldn't be the case."Bill Ford Jr. starts climbingWith Ford cruising along with robust sales and profits in the 1990s, the family had little incentive to rock the boat. But in 1995, a seemingly obscure event changed the course of the company.Soft-spoken and diplomatic, Bill Sr. had proved to be a stabilizing force both in the family and on the board of directors. However, in a critical passage of power, he gave up the chairmanship of the board's influential finance committee.His replacement: Bill Jr., who resigned as a full-time Ford employee. Two years later, he broadened his power base by adding a committee post overseeing environmental and public policy issues."It was a real change in the representation of the family, a generational change from Bill Sr. to Bill Jr.," said Allan Gilmour, Ford's current vice chairman.Bright, personable and politically savvy, Bill Jr. had emerged as the favorite to one day run Ford. All doubt was removed when Edsel II, then president of Ford's credit arm, retired in 1998 after 24 years with the company.The stage was set for Bill Jr. to make his mark.Standing in his way, though, was the latest professional manager to serve as Ford chairman and CEO -- Alex Trotman.When the board discussed succession plans, Trotman boldly opposed Bill Jr.'s desire to serve as nonexecutive chairman.In one meeting, Trotman proclaimed that there was no place for "royalty" at Ford.Bill Jr. didn't back down, and shot back a retort at the Scottish-born Trotman, who had been knighted by the Queen of England."That's easy for you to say, Sir Alex," he said.Trotman's dismissive attitude incensed Ford family members. At that point, they put their muscle squarely behind Bill Jr."We really pushed for Bill to become chairman," said his cousin, Charlotte. "Everybody wanted it. It was just how it could be done."Bill Jr., Nasser team up at topMajor changes were at hand. Ford's outside directors grilled Bill Jr. on his goals and vision for the company. When the smoke cleared, the board elected Bill Jr. as chairman and Jacques Nasser, head of worldwide automotive operations, as CEO.They made an odd couple. Born in Lebanon, raised in Australia and a veteran of Ford postings around the world, Nasser epitomized the globe-trotting CEO armed with loads of operating experience.Bill Jr. came from a different world. A Grosse Pointe-raised blue blood and avowed environmentalist, the blue-eyed, boyish Bill Jr. was a fresh, if untested, force in the executive suite.Together he and Nasser vowed to lead Ford into the 21st century.The odd man out was Edsel II. Bill Jr. downplays the idea that he beat out his cousin to win the chairmanship."The truth is there wasn't a runoff between Edsel and I," Bill Jr. said. "That would have been something the family would not have wanted. It would have been divisive."Historian Doug Brinkley, who researched Ford for five years for a new book on the company, "Wheels for the World," said the family turned to Bill Jr. to guard its interests."The feeling was that Bill was willing to deal in a cutthroat business manner and would better protect the family's 40 percent stake," Brinkley said.Edsel II, for his part, won't entertain any notion that he lost a power struggle. "Bill," he said, "was the right person at the right time."The Fords in 2002. Front, from left: Bill Ford Jr., Lynn Alandt, Martha Parke Firestone Ford, William Clay Ford, Charlotte Ford, Edsel B.

Third row, from left: Francee Ford, Benson Ford Jr., Lindsey Ford Buhl, Jason Ingle, Avery Bourke, Elena Ford. Back row, from left: Alessandro Uzielli, David Buhl, Eleanor Ford, Joe Rippolone.Company plummets under Nasser reignThe tandem of Bill Jr. and Nasser hit the ground running: buying European luxury brands Land Rover and Volvo and launching an all-out push to transform Ford into a diversified consumer company.But in August 2000, the first Firestone tire recall stopped Ford's momentum dead. The following year was a nightmare -- employee lawsuits charging age discrimination, anger among dealers opposed to Nasser's policies, poor product quality and evaporating profits.Now on the inside, Bill Jr. still wasn't sure he had a true grasp of the company. By early 2001, he was questioning if the dynamic, but polarizing, Nasser could manage Ford out of its downward spiral.Nasser has declined comment on Ford matters since his firing. But, according to current and former Ford executives, Bill Jr. pushed hard for more day-to-day involvement in operations.In July 2001, the board established the "office of chairman and chief executive" to give Bill Jr. more hands-on input. By then, the company was careening over a cliff.Family members grew increasingly worried by the frightening turn of events. In family meetings, the tension ratcheted up with every new revelation of Ford's festering troubles."We saw what was happening to the company and we didn't like it at all," Charlotte said. "We were ready (for Bill to become CEO) whenever he decided it was appropriate."In late October, with Nasser attending the Tokyo Motor Show, Bill Jr. quietly held discussions with board members about forcing Nasser out. Irv Hockaday, the retired chairman of Hallmark Cards Inc., and Carl Reichardt, former head of Wells Fargo & Co., helped him build consensus among other outside directors.At least one family member, Henry II's daughter Anne, personally contacted directors to express her hope that Bill Jr. step in as CEO."I called board members to support Bill," she said. "I lobbied for Bill. We were all behind Bill, but the board had to make the decision."She emphasized that the family never raised the issue of its 40-percent voting bloc to sway the board."We have a controlling interest but we didn't try to use that," she said. "Not to say we won't in the future."It wasn't necessary. The board could not live any longer with Nasser, either. The mantle of leadership, once passed on from Henry Ford to Henry II, fell squarely on the shoulders of Bill Jr.Keeping control won't be easyPower has returned to the family. But can it remain there in the decades to come?A difficult test will come upon the deaths of Bill Sr., 78, and his 79-year-old sister, Josephine.They own a combined 28.3 million shares of Class B stock, or 40 percent of the total. Under current law, their inheritance taxes could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.Bill Jr. said a special stock fund should help their estates handle a huge tax hit. If the family was forced to sell too many of its Class B shares, its powerful voting stake would vanish.That's a bridge the Fords hope never to cross."Before it got to that point, the family would probably go and seek out a buyer rather than just everybody dumping shares on the open market," Bill Jr. said.Selling out, however, is not even discussed by the family. "Frankly, we are about 180 degrees from that," he said.A trickier issue is what happens with the fifth generation of Fords. They number at least 34 and range from elementary school students to adults in their late 30s.If the dynasty is to survive, some will have to take a role in Ford affairs. So far, only Charlotte's daughter, Elena, has decided to make a career at Ford.She hopes that others will gravitate to the family business."This is not just for us, it's for our grandchildren and our grandchildren's children," said Elena, a mother of four children and an executive in Ford's international operations. "We have to deliver the future."Edsel II has four sons, the oldest of whom is Henry III, a recent college graduate. Would he be pleased to see his sons join the company?"The more members of the family working for Ford Motor Co., the better," said Edsel II. "As long as they work hard."The corporate life is not meant for everybody, said Alessandro Uzielli, Anne's son. He spent six months at Ford of Europe before choosing to produce films in Hollywood. His second movie, the 1998 comedy "Bongwater," was a minor cult hit, and he is now reopening the storied La Dolce Vita restaurant in Beverly Hills.Being a Ford heir can have its downside in L.A. business circles. "People try to take advantage of you," he said.Yet even as he pursues another career path, he realizes the bigger responsibility facing all the Fords in the future."It is all of our intent to keep things as they are," he said, "for as long as we can."�

Biography[edit]
Born on March 14, 1925, in Detroit, Michigan to Edsel Ford[3] and Eleanor Lowthian Clay, Ford served in the U.S. Navy Air Corps during World War II. Following the war, Ford married Martha Parke Firestone, the granddaughter of Harvey Firestone and Idabelle Smith Firestone, on June 21, 1947. They had four children together: Martha Parke Morse (b. 1948); Sheila Firestone Hamp (b. 1951); William Clay Ford Jr. (b. 1957); and Elizabeth Hudson Ford (b. 1961). William first met Martha at a lunch in New York arranged and attended by both of their mothers, according to the biography The Fords. Martha then was a Vassar student who had the college nickname “Stoney.” William was a naval cadet at St. Mary's U.S. Navy Pre-Flight School .They married on June 21, 1947 at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Akron, Ohio. By that time both families had acquired considerable wealth, and the matchup between the grandchildren of two empire-builders was reported by numerous news outlets. The Akron Beacon Journal called the Firestone-Ford nuptials “the biggest society wedding in Akron’s history” and “the biggest show Akron has seen in years” in numerous articles chronicling the event. The couple received gifts from F.B.I. Director J. Edgar Hoover, media publisher John S. Knight, and Mina Miller Edison.
The couple had four children: Martha Parke Morse (b. 1948), Sheila Firestone Hamp (b. 1951), William Clay Ford, Jr. (b. 1957), and Elizabeth Ford Kontulis (b. 1961). His son William was as of 2015 the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ford Motor Company. He had previously been the Chief Executive Officerand Chief Operating Officer of Ford. William also serves as Vice Chairman of the Detroit Lions.
The Fords have 14 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.
In 1948, a year after Henry Ford's death, Ford was appointed to Ford Motor Company's board of directors.[4] Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut in 1943[1] and received a Bachelor of Science in Economics from Yale University in 1949;[5] he was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity, captain of the soccer and tennis teams, an honorable mention all American selection in soccer senior year, and winner of 7 varsity letters as a collegiate athlete.[6][7]
After graduating, Ford worked for the Ford Motor Company, and briefly led the Continental Division.[5] The Continental Division, however, was short-lived and merged with the Lincoln Motor Company shortly before Ford's public stock offering. Ford redesigned the Lincoln Continental, a vehicle his father created; in 1955, the Continental Mark II was released. Only two pictures adorned his office wall, his father's Continental and his updated Mark II.[8]
Ford was chairman of the board at the Henry Ford Museum, from 1951 to 1983.[9] He was also involved in other historic properties, serving on the boards of the Wayside Inn and Seaboard Properties, which managed the Dearborn Inn and Botsford Inn.[10]
On April 10, 1952, an iron ore-hauling ship, the SS William Clay Ford, was named in honor of him.
On November 22, 1963, Ford purchased a controlling interest in the Detroit Lions of the National Football League, from Edwin Anderson and Lyle Fife for $4.5 million. He was also chairman of the short-lived Detroit Cougars, a professional soccer team, which played in the USA and NASL leagues.
He was Ford Motor Company's Design Committee chairman for 32 years, from 1957 to 1989.[11] He served on the board of directors for 57 years, retiring on May 12, 2005, including being chairman of the Finance Committee.[5][12] His son, William Clay Ford Jr., was Ford Motor Company's CEO at the time.
According to the Forbes magazine, Ford was the 371st richest person in the United States in 2013, with an approximate net worth of $1.4 billion.[2] Ford reportedly owned in Ford Motor Company: 6.7 million shares of Class B stock and 26.3 million common shares; in other words, Ford was the largest single shareholder.[A][14]
Ford died of pneumonia, five days before his 89th birthday, at his home in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, on March 9, 2014.[15][16][17][18] He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, Detroit.[19]

Notes[edit]



^ In 2000 the company restructured and paid out a $10 billion special dividend. According to an article from 2000, incidental to a repurchase of outstanding shares: "The Ford family holds all 71 million shares of the company's Class B stock, along with a small number of the company's 1.1 billion common shares. Under rules designed to preserve family control and drafted when the company went public in 1956, the family holds 40 percent of the voting power at the company as long as it continues to own at least 60.7 million shares of the Class B stock -- even though the Class B shares make up only 6 percent of the company's overall equity. ... Why does this exist? The Ford family owns all 70+ million shares of the Class B stock. It is a way for them to ensure they keep control of the company no matter how much stock they have to issue to avoid bankruptcy. Some argue that dual class structures are inherently unfair because you are decoupling ownership from voting power."[13]

William Clay Ford, Jr.
 

Executive Chairman, Ford Motor Co.
 








We kind of screwed up the world... and I think this next generation is going to be the one that’s going to save us.
As Executive Chairman of Ford Motor Company, William Clay Ford Jr. is leading the company that put the world on wheels into the 21st century. A lifelong environmentalist, Ford is committed to increasing shareholder value by developing products that please customers and benefit society. Under his leadership, in 2000 Ford Motor Company published its first corporate citizenship report outlining the economic, environmental and social impact of company products and operations around the world. He has been with the company for decades, having started in 1979 as a product planning analyst.
He holds a bachelor of arts degree from Princeton University, a master of science degree in management from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

It might sound strange coming from the scion of a family whose name is synonymous with cars, but Bill Ford is worried about a world with too many automobiles. “Even if we clean up our cars, 4 billion clean cars is still 4 billion cars,” he tells this Climate One audience. “Most everybody has been focused on CO2 and fossil fuels and the effect that has on us politically and environmentally. That’s absolutely an appropriate focus,” says William Clay Ford, Jr., Executive Chairman, Ford Motor Co.

Year In Review
Letter from William Clay Ford, Jr. and Mark Fields

















William Clay Ford, Jr., Executive Chairman
















Mark Fields, President and Chief Executive Officer







“It has been 15 years since we published our first report addressing the economic, environmental and social impacts of our products and operations around the world. During that time, throughout a variety of economic conditions, business cycles and social transformations, we have been reporting on the progress of our sustainability efforts.
We’re proud of how we have been transforming our company, from the vehicles we make to the way in which we make them. From water use to human rights to carbon dioxide emissions, we have moved forward and made substantial progress toward a suite of goals and commitments we have set for ourselves.
Between 2000 and 2014, for example, we cut our total global water use by 62 percent, or more than 10 billion gallons, and achieved our original water-reduction goal two years ahead of schedule.
More than 10 years ago, we introduced the world’s first hybrid SUV, and today we remain committed to offering customers the “power of choice” for fuel efficiency. In early 2015, we built our 5 millionth EcoBoost®-powered gasoline vehicle. Our fuel-saving EcoBoost technology is now available in every region where we operate and offered on more than 80 percent of our global nameplates.


“At Ford, mobility is about far more than motion. It is really about progress. Human progress.”



Mark FieldsPresident and Chief Executive Officer


We also have led our industry in groundbreaking work to reduce environmental impacts, and we were the first automaker to take on the issue of human rights to enhance working conditions in the supply chain.
Our efforts were acknowledged in 2014 when we were named by Interbrand as the Best Global Green Brand in the world – the number one company not just in the automotive industry but among all types of businesses. Further validation came in 2015 when we were named to the Ethisphere Institute’s list of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for the sixth year in a row, the only automaker to earn the recognition in each of the last six years.
We are honored to receive these recognitions. Nonetheless, we know our sustainability journey is far from over, and we are determined to go further, particularly as our industry is evolving faster than ever before.
Our Priorities
As we build on our strong foundation and continue to transform to meet the needs of the future, we are driven by three priorities:

Accelerating our pace of progress on the One Ford plan
Delivering product excellence with passion
Driving innovation in every part of our business

Ford is a growth company in a growing global industry. The past five years mark one of the most consistently profitable periods in our recent history, and we are poised to accelerate our progress in all areas of our business.
We also are a proven innovator, in a period of swift technological advancement. Already, technology has enabled rapid evolution in our vehicles. However, revolutions in connectivity and technology, as well as the changing needs and desires of our customers, are opening avenues for entirely new ways of thinking about our business. It’s not only about cars and trucks. It’s about helping people and things move seamlessly and efficiently using all available modes of transportation.
Ford Smart Mobility
In 2012, we announced our Blueprint for Mobility, which defines our vision for what transportation will look like in 2025 and beyond, and the technologies, business models and partnerships needed to get there. Our plan outlines a future of connected cars that communicate with each other and the world around them to make driving safer, ease traffic congestion and sustain the environment. We already have put in place many of the building blocks of this future.


“Growing up, there was something almost heroic about the car. The automobile represented possibility. I think we are there again.”



Bill FordExecutive Chairman


Earlier this year, we introduced Ford Smart Mobility, which is our plan to operationalize that vision and use innovation to take Ford to the next level in connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles, the customer experience and big data. We also announced more than 25 mobility experiments around the world to test breakthrough transportation ideas to create better customer experiences, more flexible usership models and social collaboration that can reward customers. You can find more details on the exciting experiments we are conducting, as well as the global megatrends that are driving our thinking, elsewhere in this report.
We’re pursuing Ford Smart Mobility in line with our bedrock conviction that the benefits of breakthrough technologies should be democratized. Our goal is to make connectivity, mobility and autonomous vehicles accessible to millions of people – not just a select few.
Changing the Way the World Moves
Without question, we are embarking on one of the most transformative periods in our history.
We understand that the winners will be the innovators, the disruptors and those willing to break with tradition and find new solutions. That’s why we are pushing ourselves even harder to think, act and disrupt like a startup company.
We are driving to be both a product company and a mobility company. Our vision is nothing less than to change the way the world moves.
At Ford, we view this as the ultimate opportunity. In fact, it is as big of an opportunity as when our founder put the world on wheels more than a century ago. Henry Ford believed that a good business makes excellent products and earns a healthy return. But he proved that a great business does all that while creating a better world.
That is what continues to drive us each day.
Our Blueprint for Sustainability, which focuses on our products and global environmental footprint, brings to life our pledge to build a strong business, deliver great products and create a better world – and to make this pledge relevant in a future that will be very different from the past.”

Two-Minute Summary
We are driving to be both a product company and a mobility company. Our vision is nothing less than to change the way the world moves. At Ford, we view this as the ultimate opportunity. In fact it is as big of an opportunity as when our founder put the world on wheels more than a century ago.
Take a quick look at what we’ve achieved this year...




Innovating Mobility Solutions
In early 2015, we announced Ford Smart Mobility, which is using innovation to take Ford to the next level in connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles, big data and the customer experience. We view the disruption that’s taking place in mobility as something to embrace – not fear. We want Ford to be part of the solution by redefining what’s possible.
As the first step, in 2014 we kicked off 25 mobility experiments around the globe.

Offering World-Class Product Quality and Safety
Producing great products is an integral part of mobility innovation. World-class quality and safety are two of the pillars that underpin our approach.
Fifteen of our 2015 model year vehicles earned five stars for overall safety in the U.S. New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), compared to nine for the 2014 model year.
Our 2014 reported “things gone wrong” data shows that our quality is back on track in North and South America and is at best-ever levels in Europe and Asia Pacific.

Read more in Product Quality and Safety





Delivering Environmental Benefits
We are on course to meet our science-based climate stabilization goal and are implementing a suite of fuel-efficiency technologies across millions of vehicles. In the U.S., we improved the average fuel economy of our combined car and truck fleet by 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013.
We are also making improvements in our operations to meet our energy, CO2, water and waste goals. Globally, we reduced our absolute water use by 3 percent from 2013 to 2014.

Read more in Climate Change and Environment





Empowering Our People
The skills and talents of our employees enable us to adapt and succeed in changing times. We’re counting on our people to push us further, so we can predict and respond to the mobility needs of the future.
In 2014, our global workforce grew by about 6,000 people to 187,000 people strong. We achieved record high Total Employee Satisfaction in the Pulse Survey for salaried employees and the best overall safety track record in the company’s history.

Read more in Our People





Leveraging Our Supply Chain
For more than a dozen years, Ford has promoted sound working conditions and environmental sustainability, working collaboratively with our suppliers and other automakers to raise standards across the automotive supply chain.
A total of 280 supplier companies in six countries were trained in 2014 on corporate social responsibility.
In addition, 95 percent of our strategic production suppliers have a code of conduct aligned with Ford’s Code of Human Rights, Basic Working Conditions and Corporate Responsibility.

Read more in Supply Chain





Supporting Our Communities
We invest in the locations where our employees live and work, focusing on education, driver safety and community life, including environmental and social issues such as the human right to water.
As our business expands globally, so does our community engagement. Our financial contributions and employee volunteer efforts span 48 countries worldwide.
In 2014, Ford invested $45.6 million in communities and our employees contributed 160,000 volunteer hours – the equivalent of a $3.5 million investment.

Ford also served as the president, CEO, and COO until turning over those roles to former Boeing executive Alan Mulally in September 2006.[2][3] Ford is also the vice chairman of the Detroit Lions NFL franchise.[4]

Early life and education[edit]
Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Ford's cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis.
Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975[1] and went on to graduate from Princeton University in 1979, having majored in history and served as president of the Ivy Club. He played on the Princeton rugby team as well. In 1984 he received an M.S. in management as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management.[5]
Career[edit]
He joined Ford in 1979 and 1981 held a variety of positions, beginning in product development and on the financial staff, a grooming ground for future executives. He served several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (since divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations.
Corporate governance[edit]
Ford gave up an executive position in heavy truck program management to become chairman of the finance committee on the Board of Directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected Chairman of the Board in September 1998, and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well.[6] On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as President and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's Executive Chairman.[2]
At the time of his stepping down, Ford was ranked 264th on Forbes' list of top-earning CEOs, at $10,000,000.00 per year.[7][8]
Business developments[edit]
In 2000, he announced that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade.[citation needed] That commitment proved to be impractical, given consumer preference for heavy towing capacity and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal.[citation needed] Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint.[citation needed] Some environmentalists[who?] questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda.[citation needed] Ford's position is that for the company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand.[citation needed] During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand.[citation needed]
Under Bill Ford's direction, Ford Motor Company made technological progress toward improving fuel efficiency, with the introduction of the Hybrid Electric Escape, the most fuel efficient SUV on the market, achieving 36 mpg (EPA) in city driving.[9] The Escape's platform mates Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute are also scheduled to receive hybrid-electric powertrain options, along with other upcoming vehicles in the Ford product line including the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup will be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved to be overly optimistic, and had to be abandoned. Ford also continues to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition, to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford is currently marketing high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, and the Volvo XC70 and Volvo XC90. Ford is also developing sporty new crossover SUVs, such as the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX, and Mazda CX-7.
Ford has expanded its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate on a range of fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.[10]
Speaking at conference in November 2000 in London Ford suggested that the company may one day offer a service where it owns vehicles and makes them available to people when they need access to them.[11]
Market competition, health care and raw material costs, led Ford to announce a second restructuring for its North American operations in four years. Ford's restructuring plan, dubbed "The Way Forward", reversed a $1.6 billion loss during 2009 in its North American operations. The company returned to profitability in 2010.[12]
Fontinalis Partners[edit]
Bill Ford has been a vocal advocate for improvements to be made in all modes of global transportation. Bill Ford has stated that governments and private industry will need to rethink transportation infrastructure and technology as the global population expands and the existing infrastructure is unable to keep pace.[13] In January 2010, Bill Ford announced the launch of a strategic investment firm, Fontinalis Partners, with the purpose of investing in innovative companies developing next-generation mobility solutions. Bill Ford co-founded the firm with Ralph Booth (Chairman and CEO of Booth American Company and successful media and telecom investor), Mark Schulz (former head of Ford Motor Company’s international operations), Chris Cheever, and Chris Thomas.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Ford is married to Lisa Vanderzee Ford, and they have four children, all living in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[citation needed]
Trivia[edit]
Ford became widely known when he was serving as the new Chairman of the Board. On February 1, 1999, when the Ford Rouge Powerhouse had an explosion that killed several Ford employees, Bill Ford rejected the ideas of his advisers and rushed to the scene from the nearby Ford World Headquarters. One of his staff cautioned, "Generals don't go out to the front lines." Ford's retort: "Then bust me down to private." Ford stopped and gave an account of the explosion to roadside television crews.[15]
According to news reports, Ford "is a tae kwon do blackbelt, a vegan[16] and a folk guitar player." Ford also plays on the company hockey team and has won in their division at the 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 USA Hockey Pond Hockey National Championships in Eagle River, Wisconsin.[citation needed]
Ford also is Vice Chairman of the Detroit Lions football team, Chairman of the Detroit Economic Club, and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of The Henry Ford museum. He also is a Vice Chairman of Detroit Renaissance and a member of the Board of Directors of eBay Inc.[citation needed]
In 2000, Ford was cited to be worth around $2.8 billion based on the company's high stock price; however, today Ford's stake in the company is valued lower.[citation needed]
In 2009, Ford was featured in the IFTA nominated[17] Canadian-Irish docudrama Death or Canada. Ford gives insight into the trials his family faced when they fled Ireland in 1847, at the height of the An Gorta Mór or Great Hunger, making their way to the United States through Canada, as many Irish immigrants of the time did.
In 2011, Ford was inducted into Irish America magazine's Hall of Fame.[18]

Early life and education[edit]
Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Ford's cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis.
Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975[1] and went on to graduate from Princeton University in 1979, having majored in history and served as president of the Ivy Club. He played on the Princeton rugby team as well. In 1984 he received an M.S. in management as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management.[5]
Career[edit]
He joined Ford in 1979 and 1981 held a variety of positions, beginning in product development and on the financial staff, a grooming ground for future executives. He served several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (since divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations.
Corporate governance[edit]
Ford gave up an executive position in heavy truck program management to become chairman of the finance committee on the Board of Directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected Chairman of the Board in September 1998, and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well.[6] On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as President and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's Executive Chairman.[2]
At the time of his stepping down, Ford was ranked 264th on Forbes' list of top-earning CEOs, at $10,000,000.00 per year.[7][8]
Business developments[edit]
In 2000, he announced that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade.[citation needed] That commitment proved to be impractical, given consumer preference for heavy towing capacity and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal.[citation needed] Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint.[citation needed] Some environmentalists[who?] questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda.[citation needed] Ford's position is that for the company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand.[citation needed] During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand.[citation needed]
Under Bill Ford's direction, Ford Motor Company made technological progress toward improving fuel efficiency, with the introduction of the Hybrid Electric Escape, the most fuel efficient SUV on the market, achieving 36 mpg (EPA) in city driving.[9] The Escape's platform mates Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute are also scheduled to receive hybrid-electric powertrain options, along with other upcoming vehicles in the Ford product line including the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup will be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved to be overly optimistic, and had to be abandoned. Ford also continues to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition, to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford is currently marketing high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, and the Volvo XC70 and Volvo XC90. Ford is also developing sporty new crossover SUVs, such as the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX, and Mazda CX-7.
Ford has expanded its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate on a range of fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.[10]
Speaking at conference in November 2000 in London Ford suggested that the company may one day offer a service where it owns vehicles and makes them available to people when they need access to them.[11]
Market competition, health care and raw material costs, led Ford to announce a second restructuring for its North American operations in four years. Ford's restructuring plan, dubbed "The Way Forward", reversed a $1.6 billion loss during 2009 in its North American operations. The company returned to profitability in 2010.[12]
Fontinalis Partners[edit]
Bill Ford has been a vocal advocate for improvements to be made in all modes of global transportation. Bill Ford has stated that governments and private industry will need to rethink transportation infrastructure and technology as the global population expands and the existing infrastructure is unable to keep pace.[13] In January 2010, Bill Ford announced the launch of a strategic investment firm, Fontinalis Partners, with the purpose of investing in innovative companies developing next-generation mobility solutions. Bill Ford co-founded the firm with Ralph Booth (Chairman and CEO of Booth American Company and successful media and telecom investor), Mark Schulz (former head of Ford Motor Company’s international operations), Chris Cheever, and Chris Thomas.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Ford is married to Lisa Vanderzee Ford, and they have four children, all living in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[citation needed]
Trivia[edit]
Ford became widely known when he was serving as the new Chairman of the Board. On February 1, 1999, when the Ford Rouge Powerhouse had an explosion that killed several Ford employees, Bill Ford rejected the ideas of his advisers and rushed to the scene from the nearby Ford World Headquarters. One of his staff cautioned, "Generals don't go out to the front lines." Ford's retort: "Then bust me down to private." Ford stopped and gave an account of the explosion to roadside television crews.[15]
According to news reports, Ford "is a tae kwon do blackbelt, a vegan[16] and a folk guitar player." Ford also plays on the company hockey team and has won in their division at the 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 USA Hockey Pond Hockey National Championships in Eagle River, Wisconsin.[citation needed]
Ford also is Vice Chairman of the Detroit Lions football team, Chairman of the Detroit Economic Club, and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of The Henry Ford museum. He also is a Vice Chairman of Detroit Renaissance and a member of the Board of Directors of eBay Inc.[citation needed]
In 2000, Ford was cited to be worth around $2.8 billion based on the company's high stock price; however, today Ford's stake in the company is valued lower.[citation needed]
In 2009, Ford was featured in the IFTA nominated[17] Canadian-Irish docudrama Death or Canada. Ford gives insight into the trials his family faced when they fled Ireland in 1847, at the height of the An Gorta Mór or Great Hunger, making their way to the United States through Canada, as many Irish immigrants of the time did.
In 2011, Ford was inducted into Irish America magazine's Hall of Fame.[18]

Early life and education[edit]
Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Ford's cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis.
Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975[1] and went on to graduate from Princeton University in 1979, having majored in history and served as president of the Ivy Club. He played on the Princeton rugby team as well. In 1984 he received an M.S. in management as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management.[5]
Career[edit]
He joined Ford in 1979 and 1981 held a variety of positions, beginning in product development and on the financial staff, a grooming ground for future executives. He served several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (since divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations.
Corporate governance[edit]
Ford gave up an executive position in heavy truck program management to become chairman of the finance committee on the Board of Directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected Chairman of the Board in September 1998, and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well.[6] On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as President and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's Executive Chairman.[2]
At the time of his stepping down, Ford was ranked 264th on Forbes' list of top-earning CEOs, at $10,000,000.00 per year.[7][8]
Business developments[edit]
In 2000, he announced that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade.[citation needed] That commitment proved to be impractical, given consumer preference for heavy towing capacity and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal.[citation needed] Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint.[citation needed] Some environmentalists[who?] questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda.[citation needed] Ford's position is that for the company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand.[citation needed] During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand.[citation needed]
Under Bill Ford's direction, Ford Motor Company made technological progress toward improving fuel efficiency, with the introduction of the Hybrid Electric Escape, the most fuel efficient SUV on the market, achieving 36 mpg (EPA) in city driving.[9] The Escape's platform mates Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute are also scheduled to receive hybrid-electric powertrain options, along with other upcoming vehicles in the Ford product line including the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup will be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved to be overly optimistic, and had to be abandoned. Ford also continues to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition, to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford is currently marketing high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, and the Volvo XC70 and Volvo XC90. Ford is also developing sporty new crossover SUVs, such as the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX, and Mazda CX-7.
Ford has expanded its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate on a range of fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.[10]
Speaking at conference in November 2000 in London Ford suggested that the company may one day offer a service where it owns vehicles and makes them available to people when they need access to them.[11]
Market competition, health care and raw material costs, led Ford to announce a second restructuring for its North American operations in four years. Ford's restructuring plan, dubbed "The Way Forward", reversed a $1.6 billion loss during 2009 in its North American operations. The company returned to profitability in 2010.[12]
Fontinalis Partners[edit]
Bill Ford has been a vocal advocate for improvements to be made in all modes of global transportation. Bill Ford has stated that governments and private industry will need to rethink transportation infrastructure and technology as the global population expands and the existing infrastructure is unable to keep pace.[13] In January 2010, Bill Ford announced the launch of a strategic investment firm, Fontinalis Partners, with the purpose of investing in innovative companies developing next-generation mobility solutions. Bill Ford co-founded the firm with Ralph Booth (Chairman and CEO of Booth American Company and successful media and telecom investor), Mark Schulz (former head of Ford Motor Company’s international operations), Chris Cheever, and Chris Thomas.[14]
Personal life[edit]
Ford is married to Lisa Vanderzee Ford, and they have four children, all living in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[citation needed]
Trivia[edit]
Ford became widely known when he was serving as the new Chairman of the Board. On February 1, 1999, when the Ford Rouge Powerhouse had an explosion that killed several Ford employees, Bill Ford rejected the ideas of his advisers and rushed to the scene from the nearby Ford World Headquarters. One of his staff cautioned, "Generals don't go out to the front lines." Ford's retort: "Then bust me down to private." Ford stopped and gave an account of the explosion to roadside television crews.[15]
According to news reports, Ford "is a tae kwon do blackbelt, a vegan[16] and a folk guitar player." Ford also plays on the company hockey team and has won in their division at the 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 USA Hockey Pond Hockey National Championships in Eagle River, Wisconsin.[citation needed]
Ford also is Vice Chairman of the Detroit Lions football team, Chairman of the Detroit Economic Club, and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of The Henry Ford museum. He also is a Vice Chairman of Detroit Renaissance and a member of the Board of Directors of eBay Inc.[citation needed]
In 2000, Ford was cited to be worth around $2.8 billion based on the company's high stock price; however, today Ford's stake in the company is valued lower.[citation needed]
In 2009, Ford was featured in the IFTA nominated[17] Canadian-Irish docudrama Death or Canada. Ford gives insight into the trials his family faced when they fled Ireland in 1847, at the height of the An Gorta Mór or Great Hunger, making their way to the United States through Canada, as many Irish immigrants of the time did.
In 2011, Ford was inducted into Irish America magazine's Hall of Fame.[18]

Bill Ford is a car guy — his great-grandfather was Henry Ford, and he grew up inside the massive Ford Motor Co. So when he worries about cars' impact on the environment, and about our growing global gridlock problem, it's worth a listen. His vision for the future of mobility includes "smart roads," even smarter public transport and going green like never before.

Early life and education[edit]
Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and great-grandson of Harvey Firestone. His father was William Clay Ford Sr. and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Ford's cousin. Ford has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Sheila Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis.
Ford graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1975[1] and went on to graduate from Princeton University in 1979, having majored in history and served as president of the Ivy Club.

About William Clay Ford, Jr.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Clay_Ford,_Jr.
William Clay "Bill" Ford Jr. (born May 3, 1957 in Detroit, Michigan), is the great-grandson of Henry Ford, and serves as the executive chairman of Ford Motor Company, Ford also served as the President, CEO, and COO until turning over those roles to former Boeing executive Alan Mulally in September 2006. Ford is also the Vice Chairman of the Detroit Lions NFL franchise.
Background
Ford was born in Detroit, Michigan, the great-grandson of both Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone. His father is William Clay Ford, Sr., and his mother is Martha Firestone. On his mother's side his grandparents are Harvey S. Firestone, Jr. and Elizabeth Parke Firestone. On his father's side his grandparents are Edsel Bryant Ford and Eleanor Lowthian Clay. Edsel Ford II, son of Henry Ford II and also a board member, is Bill's cousin. Bill has three sisters: Martha Morse (who has 3 children), Shelia Hamp (who has 3 children), and Elizabeth Kontulis. Bill attended the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut and went on to graduate from Princeton University in 1979, having majored in history and served as president of The Ivy Club. He played on the Princeton rugby team as well. In 1984 he received an S.M. in Management as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management. He is married to Lisa Vanderzee, and they have four children, all living in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Early career
He joined Ford in 1979 and 1981 held a variety of positions, beginning in product development and on the financial staff, a grooming ground for future executives. He served several years as a mid-ranking executive in product development. He also briefly headed the Climate Control Division (since divested from the company as part of the Visteon spinoff). At the time of the Ford 2000 reorganization, he was in charge of heavy truck operations.
Corporate governance
Ford gave up an executive position in heavy truck program management to become chairman of the finance committee on the Board of Directors, a non-executive corporate governance position. He was elected Chairman of the Board in September 1998, and took office on January 1, 1999. Ford added the title of Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2001, following the ouster of then-CEO Jacques Nasser. That ouster reflected significant differences in corporate values—Nasser focused on maximizing corporate profits and shareholder value, while Ford was noted for valuing people and tradition. With the retirement of Ford President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed those roles as well. On September 5, 2006, Ford announced that he was stepping down as President and CEO, naming former Boeing senior executive Alan Mulally as his replacement. Ford continues as the company's Executive Chairman
At the time of his stepping down, Ford was ranked 264th on Forbes' list of top-earning CEOs, at $5,140,000 per year. Mr. Ford donates most of his compensation to various charitable causes.
Personal
Bill Ford generated a name for himself early when he was serving as the new Chairman of the Board. On February 1, 1999, when the Ford Rouge Powerhouse had an explosion that killed several Ford employees, Bill Ford rejected the ideas of his advisers and rushed to the scene from the nearby Ford world headquarters building. One of his staff cautioned, "Generals don't go out to the front lines." Ford's retort: "Then bust me down to private." Ford stopped and gave a heart-breaking account of the explosion to roadside television crews.
According to news reports, Ford "is a tae kwon do blackbelt, a vegetarian and a folk guitar player."  Ford also plays on the company hockey team, which has won their division at the 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 USA Hockey Pond Hockey National Championships in Eagle River, Wisconsin.
Ford also is Vice Chairman of the Detroit Lions football team, Chairman of the Detroit Economic Club, and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of The Henry Ford museum. He also is a Vice Chairman of Detroit Renaissance and a member of the Board of directors of eBay Inc. In 2000, Ford was cited to be worth around $2.8 billion considering the companies high stock price, however today Ford's stake in the company is valued lower.
In 2009, Ford was featured in the IFTA nominated[8] Canadian-Irish docudrama Death or Canada. Ford gives insight into the trials his family faced when they fled Ireland in 1847, at the height of the An Gorta Mór or Great Famine, making their way to the United States through Canada, as many Irish Immigrants of the time did.
Ford Motor Company and environmental issues
Bill Ford is known to be a conscientious environmentalist, having driven an electric Ford Ranger EV, and currently a Hybrid Electric Escape. In 2000, he announced that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade. That commitment proved to be impractical, given consumer preference for heavy towing capacity and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal. Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint. Some environmentalists questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda. Ford's position is that for the company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand. During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand. As a result, Ford's total market share dropped in the U.S.
Under Bill Ford's direction, Ford Motor Company made technological progress toward improving fuel efficiency, with the introduction of the Hybrid Electric Escape, the most fuel efficient SUV on the market, achieving 36 mpg (EPA) in city driving. The Escape's platform mates Mercury Mariner and Mazda Tribute are also scheduled to receive hybrid-electric powertrain options, along with other upcoming vehicles in the Ford product line including the Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan. Ford announced that half of the vehicle lineup will be available with advanced hybrid-electric powerplant options by 2010, although the Company's earlier pledge to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles a year by 2010 proved to be overly optimistic, and had to be abandoned. Ford also continues to study Fuel Cell-powered electric powertrains, and is currently demonstrating hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. In addition, to the Ford Escape, Hybrid Escape, Mercury Mariner, and Mazda Tribute, Ford is currently marketing high efficiency crossover SUVs such as the Ford Freestyle, and the Volvo XC70 and Volvo XC90. Ford is also developing sporty new crossover SUVs, such as the Ford Edge, Lincoln MKX, and Mazda CX-7.
Ford is also expanding the current lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate on a range of fuel mixtures - such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual fuel vehicles generally have two fuel tanks - one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline - with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles - the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 - in 2006. 
Speaking at the Greenpeace business conference in November 2000 in London he said "The day will come when the notion of car ownership becomes antiquated. If you live in a city, you don't need to own a car" explaining that Ford was repositioning itself as a 'purveyor of mobility' and would own the vehicles and make them available to people when they need access to them.
Strong competition from Asian competitors, soaring health care and raw material costs, and a slide in U.S. market share led Ford to announce a second restructuring for its North American operations in four years. Saddled with a junk debt rating and facing a sharp drop in U.S. market share, Ford's restructuring plan, dubbed "The Way Forward", was designed to reverse a $1.6 billion loss last year in its North American operations. Globally, however, the company made $2 billion in 2005.
Fontinalis Partners
As a lifelong environmentalist and a regular speaker on the topic of global gridlock, Bill Ford has become an advocate for improvements to be made in all modes of global transportation. Bill Ford has stated that governments and private industry will need to rethink transportation infrastructure and technology as the global population expands and the existing infrastructure is unable to keep pace.
In January 2010, Bill Ford announced the launch of a strategic investment firm, Fontinalis Partners, with the purpose of investing in intelligent transportation companies seeking to integrate technology into everyday transportation. Bill Ford co-founded the firm with Ralph Booth (Chairman and CEO of Booth American Company and successful media and telecom investor), Mark Schulz (former head of Ford Motor Company’s international operations), Chris Cheever, and Chris Thomas.
Fontinalis Partners made its first investment in January 2010 when it invested in Parkmobile International, a provider of mobile parking payment systems that allow users to pay for and monitor parking using their mobile phones. In June 2010, Fontinalis Partners added to its portfolio with an investment in Everyday Solutions, a company that provides GPS-driven software and hardware to school districts to allow for the monitoring of school bus fleets.[ In May 2011, Fontinalis Partners invested in SQLstream, a stream computing company that addresses the growing need to analyze real-time data for a wide variety of business and government applications, including the real-time analysis of sensor and GPS data in order to reduce congestion and optimize personal mobility. In June 2011, Fontinalis Partners invested in Streetline, a provider of smart parking solutions that enable cities and private operators to collect parking data via in-ground sensors, which can then be distributed through smart phone and web applications to provide users with information on real-time parking availability. Fontinalis Partners continues to evaluate additional opportunities to invest in companies solving global transportation issues.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Just think in terms of green energy and how much time, money, brain power and policy action has started to pour into green energy, and I think that's wonderful.
