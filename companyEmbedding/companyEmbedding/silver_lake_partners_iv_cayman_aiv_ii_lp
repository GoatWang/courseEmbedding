            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Silver Lake was founded in 1999, at the height of the late 1990s technology boom to make private equity investments in mature technology companies as opposed to the startups pursued actively by venture capitalists. Among the firm's founders were the four amigos [2] Jim Davidson who had led the Technology Investment Banking business at Hambrecht & Quist; David Roux who had an operational and entrepreneurial background having served as chairman and CEO of Liberate Technologies, executive vice president at Oracle Corporation and senior vice president at Lotus Development; Roger McNamee, who had previously co-founded Integral Capital Partners, a hybrid investment fund that made investments in publicly traded companies and venture capital investments in early stage startups; and Glenn Hutchins, who came from Blackstone Group and served as a Special Advisor on economic and healthcare policy in the early Clinton Administration and previously worked at Thomas H. Lee Partners;.[3][3]
The firm raised its first fund, Silver Lake Partners, with $2.3 billion of investor commitments. Silver Lake's first fund was among the best performing funds of its vintage.
The firm's second fund, Silver Lake Partners II was raised in 2004 with $3.6 billion of commitments.[4]
The firm's third fund, Silver Lake Partners III was raised in 2007 with $9.6 billion of commitments.[5] Also in 2007, the firm launched its middle-market investment business, Silver Lake Sumeru, hiring Ajay Shah and the former investment team of Shah Capital Partners. Sumeru completed fundraising for its debut fund in 2008 with $1.1 billion of capital.[6] Silver Lake also launched its credit focused business, Silver Lake Financial in 2007. Silver Lake Financial is headed by Roger Wittlin, who joined the firm together with a group of staff from Sutter Credit Strategies, a division of Wells Fargo.
In 2013, the firm raised its fourth fund, Silver Lake Partners IV, which closed in 2013 with $10.3 billion in committed capital.
Key personnel[edit]
In 2004, McNamee left Silver Lake to found Elevation Partners, an entertainment and media focused private equity firm, with Bono.[7]
On December 20, 2007 Cisco Systems' development chief, Charles Giancarlo, announced his departure from Cisco and his new position as partner and managing director at Silver Lake.[8]
In January 2008, as the mid-2000s buyout boom was coming to an end, Silver Lake sold a 9.9% stake in its management company to CalPERS for $275 million, implying a valuation of approximately $2.8 billion for the firm.[9]
Contemporaneously with the raising of the firm's fourth large-cap fund in 2013, 'Silver Lakes new four amigos',[10] a group of four investment professionals Mike Bingle, Egon Durban, Ken Hao and Greg Mondre, all of whom had been with the firm since its founding took leadership positions as managing partners in the firm alongside founder Jim Davidson.
In October 2013, it was announced that Skype's chief operating officer and development chief, Mark Gillett would depart from Microsoft [11] and succeed Giancarlo as a managing director and head of value creation,[12] while Giancarlo would transition to be a senior advisor to the firm.
Investments[edit]
Since inception in 1999, Silver Lake has made investments through leveraged buyout transactions, minority growth investments and PIPE investments in over 40 companies.
Silver Lake's current and realized portfolio of investments includes or has included technology industry companies such as Avago Technologies, AVI-SPL, Business Objects, Flextronics, Gartner, Instinet, IPC Systems, MCI Inc., MultiPlan, NASDAQ, NetScout Systems, NXP Semiconductors, Sabre Holdings, Seagate Technology, Serena Software, SunGard, Talend, TD Ameritrade, Technicolor SA, UGS Corp., Virtu Financial, and Flixbus.
The following table details some of Silver Lake's private equity investments:


Investment
Year
Company description


EMC
2015
On 12 October 2015, EMC announced that they have agreed on a buy-out by Michael Dell, MSD Capital, and Silver Lake for $33.15 per share in a complicated cash transaction which includes tracking stock in VMware, which will remain a publicly traded company. The deal, when completed, will total $67 billion, the largest technology buyout ever. Dell continues to hedge its bets that mergers are the way to expand the company when others are betting that spinoffs and smaller companies are better.[13]


Dell
2013
On 5 February 2013, Dell Inc. announced that they have agreed on a buy-out by Michael Dell and Silver Lake for $13.65 per share in cash. The shares of founder and CEO Michael Dell and some of its key management are not included in this deal. Microsoft additionally provided $2 billion in the form of a loan to assist with the buy-out.[14][15] If the deal is completed Dell will be de-listed from NASDAQ and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and will again be a fully privately owned company as it was before its first Initial public offering. According to Michael Dell this move will make it easier to work on a long-term growth strategy as the company can make choices that will pay out on the longer term, without the need to address to demands of (short term) individual share-holders.[14]
The deal was completed on October 30, 2013, and at $24.4 billion was the largest technology buyout ever, surpassing the 2006 buyout of Freescale Semiconductor for $17.5 billion.[16] Other smaller investors are MSD Capital, an investment firm to manage the wealth of Michael Dell, Microsoft with a $2 billion loan and several debt-facilities from banks like Barclays, Credit Suisse, Bank of America and Royal Bank of Canada.[17]



Skype
2009
Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board announce the acquisition of 65% of Skype for $1.9 billion from E-Bay, valuing the business at $2.75 billion. In May 2011, Microsoft agreed to acquire Skype for $8.5 billion in cash.
[18][19][20][21]


Avaya
2007
Silver Lake and TPG Capital completed an $8.2 billion leveraged buyout of the enterprise telephony and call center technology company that was formerly a unit of Lucent.
[22]


Sabre Holdings
2006
Silver Lake and TPG Capital announced a deal to buy Sabre Holdings, which operates Travelocity, Sabre Travel Network and Sabre Airline Solutions, for approximately $4.3 billion in cash, plus the assumption of $550 million in debt. Earlier in 2006, Blackstone acquired Sabre's chief competitor Travelport.
[23]


NXP Semiconductors
2006
In August 2006, a consortium of Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and AlpInvest Partners acquired a controlling 80.1% share of semiconductors unit of Philips for €6.4 billion. The new company, based in the Netherlands, was renamed NXP Semiconductors.
[24][25]


SunGard
2006
SunGard was acquired by a consortium of seven private equity investment firms in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. The partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake, which led the deal as well as Bain Capital, the Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco at the end of the 1980s leveraged buyout boom. Also, at the time of its announcement, SunGard would be the largest buyout of a technology company in history, a distinction it would cede to the buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction is also notable in the number of firms involved in the transaction. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive. In 2015 the consortium sold Sungard to FIS.
[26]


Avago Technologies
2005
In 2005, the semiconductor division of Agilent was acquired by Silver Lake and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, to form Avago Technologies, one of the largest privately held semiconductor companies in the world. In 2009, Avago completed a $650 million initial public offering.
[27]
[28][29]



Reuters news service reports that Silver Lake Partners is among more than a dozen private equity firms subpoenaed by New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman regarding a widely used tax strategy within the industry that may illegally cut their tax bills by hundreds of millions of dollars.
Controversy[edit]
After the sale of Skype to Microsoft in 2011,[20] Silver Lake was accused of unfairly depriving an employee of an options windfall.[30] At issue was a clause in the Skype employee stock option grant agreement. The repurchase right gave Skype the authority to buy back shares at the grant price, when an employee left the company, even when those shares were vested.

Silver Lake was founded in 1999, at the height of the late 1990s technology boom to make private equity investments in mature technology companies as opposed to the startups pursued actively by venture capitalists. Among the firm's founders were the four amigos [2] Jim Davidson who had led the Technology Investment Banking business at Hambrecht & Quist; David Roux who had an operational and entrepreneurial background having served as chairman and CEO of Liberate Technologies, executive vice president at Oracle Corporation and senior vice president at Lotus Development; Roger McNamee, who had previously co-founded Integral Capital Partners, a hybrid investment fund that made investments in publicly traded companies and venture capital investments in early stage startups; and Glenn Hutchins, who came from Blackstone Group and served as a Special Advisor on economic and healthcare policy in the early Clinton Administration and previously worked at Thomas H. Lee Partners;.[3][3]
The firm raised its first fund, Silver Lake Partners, with $2.3 billion of investor commitments. Silver Lake's first fund was among the best performing funds of its vintage.
The firm's second fund, Silver Lake Partners II was raised in 2004 with $3.6 billion of commitments.[4]
The firm's third fund, Silver Lake Partners III was raised in 2007 with $9.6 billion of commitments.[5] Also in 2007, the firm launched its middle-market investment business, Silver Lake Sumeru, hiring Ajay Shah and the former investment team of Shah Capital Partners. Sumeru completed fundraising for its debut fund in 2008 with $1.1 billion of capital.[6] Silver Lake also launched its credit focused business, Silver Lake Financial in 2007. Silver Lake Financial is headed by Roger Wittlin, who joined the firm together with a group of staff from Sutter Credit Strategies, a division of Wells Fargo.
In 2013, the firm raised its fourth fund, Silver Lake Partners IV, which closed in 2013 with $10.3 billion in committed capital.
Key personnel[edit]
In 2004, McNamee left Silver Lake to found Elevation Partners, an entertainment and media focused private equity firm, with Bono.[7]
On December 20, 2007 Cisco Systems' development chief, Charles Giancarlo, announced his departure from Cisco and his new position as partner and managing director at Silver Lake.[8]
In January 2008, as the mid-2000s buyout boom was coming to an end, Silver Lake sold a 9.9% stake in its management company to CalPERS for $275 million, implying a valuation of approximately $2.8 billion for the firm.[9]
Contemporaneously with the raising of the firm's fourth large-cap fund in 2013, 'Silver Lakes new four amigos',[10] a group of four investment professionals Mike Bingle, Egon Durban, Ken Hao and Greg Mondre, all of whom had been with the firm since its founding took leadership positions as managing partners in the firm alongside founder Jim Davidson.
In October 2013, it was announced that Skype's chief operating officer and development chief, Mark Gillett would depart from Microsoft [11] and succeed Giancarlo as a managing director and head of value creation,[12] while Giancarlo would transition to be a senior advisor to the firm.
Investments[edit]
Since inception in 1999, Silver Lake has made investments through leveraged buyout transactions, minority growth investments and PIPE investments in over 40 companies.
Silver Lake's current and realized portfolio of investments includes or has included technology industry companies such as Avago Technologies, AVI-SPL, Business Objects, Flextronics, Gartner, Instinet, IPC Systems, MCI Inc., MultiPlan, NASDAQ, NetScout Systems, NXP Semiconductors, Sabre Holdings, Seagate Technology, Serena Software, SunGard, Talend, TD Ameritrade, Technicolor SA, UGS Corp., Virtu Financial, and Flixbus.

Year
Company description


EMC
2015
On 12 October 2015, EMC announced that they have agreed on a buy-out by Michael Dell, MSD Capital, and Silver Lake for $33.15 per share in a complicated cash transaction which includes tracking stock in VMware, which will remain a publicly traded company. The deal, when completed, will total $67 billion, the largest technology buyout ever. Dell continues to hedge its bets that mergers are the way to expand the company when others are betting that spinoffs and smaller companies are better.[13]


Dell
2013
On 5 February 2013, Dell Inc. announced that they have agreed on a buy-out by Michael Dell and Silver Lake for $13.65 per share in cash. The shares of founder and CEO Michael Dell and some of its key management are not included in this deal. Microsoft additionally provided $2 billion in the form of a loan to assist with the buy-out.[14][15] If the deal is completed Dell will be de-listed from NASDAQ and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and will again be a fully privately owned company as it was before its first Initial public offering. According to Michael Dell this move will make it easier to work on a long-term growth strategy as the company can make choices that will pay out on the longer term, without the need to address to demands of (short term) individual share-holders.[14]
The deal was completed on October 30, 2013, and at $24.4 billion was the largest technology buyout ever, surpassing the 2006 buyout of Freescale Semiconductor for $17.5 billion.[16] Other smaller investors are MSD Capital, an investment firm to manage the wealth of Michael Dell, Microsoft with a $2 billion loan and several debt-facilities from banks like Barclays, Credit Suisse, Bank of America and Royal Bank of Canada.[17]



Skype
2009
Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board announce the acquisition of 65% of Skype for $1.9 billion from E-Bay, valuing the business at $2.75 billion. In May 2011, Microsoft agreed to acquire Skype for $8.5 billion in cash.
[18][19][20][21]


Avaya
2007
Silver Lake and TPG Capital completed an $8.2 billion leveraged buyout of the enterprise telephony and call center technology company that was formerly a unit of Lucent.
[22]


Sabre Holdings
2006
Silver Lake and TPG Capital announced a deal to buy Sabre Holdings, which operates Travelocity, Sabre Travel Network and Sabre Airline Solutions, for approximately $4.3 billion in cash, plus the assumption of $550 million in debt. Earlier in 2006, Blackstone acquired Sabre's chief competitor Travelport.
[23]


NXP Semiconductors
2006
In August 2006, a consortium of Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and AlpInvest Partners acquired a controlling 80.1% share of semiconductors unit of Philips for €6.4 billion. The new company, based in the Netherlands, was renamed NXP Semiconductors.
[24][25]


SunGard
2006
SunGard was acquired by a consortium of seven private equity investment firms in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. The partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake, which led the deal as well as Bain Capital, the Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco at the end of the 1980s leveraged buyout boom. Also, at the time of its announcement, SunGard would be the largest buyout of a technology company in history, a distinction it would cede to the buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction is also notable in the number of firms involved in the transaction. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive. In 2015 the consortium sold Sungard to FIS.
[26]


Avago Technologies
2005
In 2005, the semiconductor division of Agilent was acquired by Silver Lake and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, to form Avago Technologies, one of the largest privately held semiconductor companies in the world. In 2009, Avago completed a $650 million initial public offering.
[27]
[28][29]



Reuters news service reports that Silver Lake Partners is among more than a dozen private equity firms subpoenaed by New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman regarding a widely used tax strategy within the industry that may illegally cut their tax bills by hundreds of millions of dollars.
Controversy[edit]
After the sale of Skype to Microsoft in 2011,[20] Silver Lake was accused of unfairly depriving an employee of an options windfall.[30] At issue was a clause in the Skype employee stock option grant agreement. The repurchase right gave Skype the authority to buy back shares at the grant price, when an employee left the company, even when those shares were vested.

Silver Lake was founded in 1999, at the height of the late 1990s technology boom to make private equity investments in mature technology companies as opposed to the startups pursued actively by venture capitalists. Among the firm's founders were the four amigos [2] Jim Davidson who had led the Technology Investment Banking business at Hambrecht & Quist; David Roux who had an operational and entrepreneurial background having served as chairman and CEO of Liberate Technologies, executive vice president at Oracle Corporation and senior vice president at Lotus Development; Roger McNamee, who had previously co-founded Integral Capital Partners, a hybrid investment fund that made investments in publicly traded companies and venture capital investments in early stage startups; and Glenn Hutchins, who came from Blackstone Group and served as a Special Advisor on economic and healthcare policy in the early Clinton Administration and previously worked at Thomas H. Lee Partners;.[3][3]
The firm raised its first fund, Silver Lake Partners, with $2.3 billion of investor commitments. Silver Lake's first fund was among the best performing funds of its vintage.
The firm's second fund, Silver Lake Partners II was raised in 2004 with $3.6 billion of commitments.[4]
The firm's third fund, Silver Lake Partners III was raised in 2007 with $9.6 billion of commitments.[5] Also in 2007, the firm launched its middle-market investment business, Silver Lake Sumeru, hiring Ajay Shah and the former investment team of Shah Capital Partners. Sumeru completed fundraising for its debut fund in 2008 with $1.1 billion of capital.[6] Silver Lake also launched its credit focused business, Silver Lake Financial in 2007. Silver Lake Financial is headed by Roger Wittlin, who joined the firm together with a group of staff from Sutter Credit Strategies, a division of Wells Fargo.
In 2013, the firm raised its fourth fund, Silver Lake Partners IV, which closed in 2013 with $10.3 billion in committed capital.
Key personnel[edit]
In 2004, McNamee left Silver Lake to found Elevation Partners, an entertainment and media focused private equity firm, with Bono.[7]
On December 20, 2007 Cisco Systems' development chief, Charles Giancarlo, announced his departure from Cisco and his new position as partner and managing director at Silver Lake.[8]
In January 2008, as the mid-2000s buyout boom was coming to an end, Silver Lake sold a 9.9% stake in its management company to CalPERS for $275 million, implying a valuation of approximately $2.8 billion for the firm.[9]
Contemporaneously with the raising of the firm's fourth large-cap fund in 2013, 'Silver Lakes new four amigos',[10] a group of four investment professionals Mike Bingle, Egon Durban, Ken Hao and Greg Mondre, all of whom had been with the firm since its founding took leadership positions as managing partners in the firm alongside founder Jim Davidson.
In October 2013, it was announced that Skype's chief operating officer and development chief, Mark Gillett would depart from Microsoft [11] and succeed Giancarlo as a managing director and head of value creation,[12] while Giancarlo would transition to be a senior advisor to the firm.
Investments[edit]
Since inception in 1999, Silver Lake has made investments through leveraged buyout transactions, minority growth investments and PIPE investments in over 40 companies.
Silver Lake's current and realized portfolio of investments includes or has included technology industry companies such as Avago Technologies, AVI-SPL, Business Objects, Flextronics, Gartner, Instinet, IPC Systems, MCI Inc., MultiPlan, NASDAQ, NetScout Systems, NXP Semiconductors, Sabre Holdings, Seagate Technology, Serena Software, SunGard, Talend, TD Ameritrade, Technicolor SA, UGS Corp., Virtu Financial, and Flixbus.
The following table details some of Silver Lake's private equity investments:

Company description


EMC
2015
On 12 October 2015, EMC announced that they have agreed on a buy-out by Michael Dell, MSD Capital, and Silver Lake for $33.15 per share in a complicated cash transaction which includes tracking stock in VMware, which will remain a publicly traded company. The deal, when completed, will total $67 billion, the largest technology buyout ever. Dell continues to hedge its bets that mergers are the way to expand the company when others are betting that spinoffs and smaller companies are better.[13]


Dell
2013
On 5 February 2013, Dell Inc. announced that they have agreed on a buy-out by Michael Dell and Silver Lake for $13.65 per share in cash. The shares of founder and CEO Michael Dell and some of its key management are not included in this deal. Microsoft additionally provided $2 billion in the form of a loan to assist with the buy-out.[14][15] If the deal is completed Dell will be de-listed from NASDAQ and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and will again be a fully privately owned company as it was before its first Initial public offering. According to Michael Dell this move will make it easier to work on a long-term growth strategy as the company can make choices that will pay out on the longer term, without the need to address to demands of (short term) individual share-holders.[14]
The deal was completed on October 30, 2013, and at $24.4 billion was the largest technology buyout ever, surpassing the 2006 buyout of Freescale Semiconductor for $17.5 billion.[16] Other smaller investors are MSD Capital, an investment firm to manage the wealth of Michael Dell, Microsoft with a $2 billion loan and several debt-facilities from banks like Barclays, Credit Suisse, Bank of America and Royal Bank of Canada.[17]



Skype
2009
Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board announce the acquisition of 65% of Skype for $1.9 billion from E-Bay, valuing the business at $2.75 billion. In May 2011, Microsoft agreed to acquire Skype for $8.5 billion in cash.
[18][19][20][21]


Avaya
2007
Silver Lake and TPG Capital completed an $8.2 billion leveraged buyout of the enterprise telephony and call center technology company that was formerly a unit of Lucent.
[22]


Sabre Holdings
2006
Silver Lake and TPG Capital announced a deal to buy Sabre Holdings, which operates Travelocity, Sabre Travel Network and Sabre Airline Solutions, for approximately $4.3 billion in cash, plus the assumption of $550 million in debt. Earlier in 2006, Blackstone acquired Sabre's chief competitor Travelport.
[23]


NXP Semiconductors
2006
In August 2006, a consortium of Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and AlpInvest Partners acquired a controlling 80.1% share of semiconductors unit of Philips for €6.4 billion. The new company, based in the Netherlands, was renamed NXP Semiconductors.
[24][25]


SunGard
2006
SunGard was acquired by a consortium of seven private equity investment firms in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. The partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake, which led the deal as well as Bain Capital, the Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco at the end of the 1980s leveraged buyout boom. Also, at the time of its announcement, SunGard would be the largest buyout of a technology company in history, a distinction it would cede to the buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction is also notable in the number of firms involved in the transaction. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive. In 2015 the consortium sold Sungard to FIS.
[26]


Avago Technologies
2005
In 2005, the semiconductor division of Agilent was acquired by Silver Lake and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, to form Avago Technologies, one of the largest privately held semiconductor companies in the world. In 2009, Avago completed a $650 million initial public offering.
[27]
[28][29]



Reuters news service reports that Silver Lake Partners is among more than a dozen private equity firms subpoenaed by New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman regarding a widely used tax strategy within the industry that may illegally cut their tax bills by hundreds of millions of dollars.
Controversy[edit]
After the sale of Skype to Microsoft in 2011,[20] Silver Lake was accused of unfairly depriving an employee of an options windfall.[30] At issue was a clause in the Skype employee stock option grant agreement. The repurchase right gave Skype the authority to buy back shares at the grant price, when an employee left the company, even when those shares were vested.

Silver Lake - Overview





                    Overview
                








 Print



Silver Lake is the global leader in technology investing, with about $39 billion in combined assets under management and committed capital and a team of approximately 100 investment and value creation professionals located around the world. Dedicated to the thesis that the dynamism and rapid pace of innovation in global technology demand intensely focused domain expertise, Silver Lake differentiates itself from generalist investment firms by devoting its full scope of talent and intellectual capital to the singular mission of investing in the world’s leading technology companies and tech-enabled businesses. Applying the strategic insights of an experienced industry participant, the operating skill of a world-class management team, and the investing capabilities of a leading private equity firm, Silver Lake leverages the deep knowledge and expertise of a global team based in Silicon Valley, New York, London, Hong Kong, and Tokyo.
Unparalleled Technology Sector Expertise
Applying an analytically rigorous and data-focused approach, Silver Lake invests strategically and selectively across the broad value chain and sub-verticals of the technology industry, from semiconductors, cloud computing, and IT infrastructure to tech-enabled financial markets, transaction processing, mobile communications, and e-commerce.   
Launched in 1999 as a specialist firm focused on private technology company investments, Silver Lake has maintained its strategic discipline since its founding but has expanded its sector expertise to encompass four primary investment strategies:

Silver Lake Partners (SLP) invests in large-cap technology companies and tech-enabled businesses.
Silver Lake Sumeru invests in middle market technology companies and tech-enabled businesses.
Silver Lake Waterman provides growth capital to later-stage companies in the technology and technology-enabled industries, offering flexible solutions to finance expansion and acquisitions.
Silver Lake Kraftwerk provides growth capital to technology and tech-enabled businesses driving efficiency across the operations, energy, and resources industries.

Investing in Market Leaders Positioned for Dynamic Growth
Leveraging a deep network of relationships throughout the global technology industry, Silver Lake seeks to cultivate proprietary or specialized investment opportunities not typically available to generalist investors. Silver Lake’s ideal target company has a leading position in its market, a competitively advantaged business model, a strong management team, proprietary core technologies, sound business processes, and the potential for transformational value creation. The firm seeks to formulate its investments to enable growth and frequently employs conservative capital structures designed to drive aggressive investment in new initiatives, innovation, and business expansion. Today Silver Lake’s portfolio of investments collectively generates more than $142 billion of revenue annually and employs more than 300,000 people globally.
Partnership with Premier Management Teams
Partnering with proven leaders drawn from across the global technology industry and tech-enabled businesses, Silver Lake and its portfolio company management teams work in concert to establish and sustain differentiated competitive advantage in their respective markets. Seeking to capitalize on innovative or disruptive business models, Silver Lake and its management partners aim to achieve performance metrics that are not dependent on prevailing macroeconomic conditions. Silver Lake believes that its portfolio companies interact with nearly every sizeable participant in the technology value chain, providing access, relationships, and insights across all sub-sectors of their opportunity set.
Value Creation Driven Through Strategic and Operational Discipline
Building upon a commitment to enhance the operational performance of its portfolio companies that has been a hallmark of the firm since its inception, Silver Lake has built a dedicated value creation team with extensive operating experience around the world, including professionals drawn from some of the largest and most successful companies in the global technology industry. The value creation and investment teams work collaboratively with Silver Lake’s portfolio companies to introduce new products and services, enter new global markets, launch new strategic partnerships, and expand the international network of relationships available to management. The value creation team also works closely with Silver Lake’s investment professionals to assist in the due diligence and evaluation of prospective investment opportunities, offering deep knowledge of a specific sub-sector or technology. Silver Lake believes its value creation initiatives have been essential drivers of past performance and will remain central to its differentiated, specialist investment strategy.

corresponding Item of the Schedule 13D as described below. Except as specifically provided herein, this Amendment No. 3 does not modify any of the information previously reported in the Schedule 13D. Capitalized terms used but not defined
herein shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Schedule 13D.   


Item 4.
Purpose of Transaction  Item 4 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the
following paragraph at the end thereof:  On February 1, 2016, pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 28,
2015, by and among the Issuer, Broadcom Corporation (Broadcom), Pavonia Limited, Safari Cayman L.P., Avago Technologies Cayman Holdings Ltd., Avago Technologies Cayman Finance Limited, Buffalo CS Merger Sub, Inc. (CS Merger
Sub) and Buffalo UT Merger Sub, Inc. (UT Merger Sub, and, together with CS Merger Sub, the Merger Subs), (a) the Issuer was indirectly acquired by Pavonia Limited pursuant to the terms of a scheme of arrangement
under Singapore law consummated in accordance with Section 210 of the Companies Act (Chapter 50 of Singapore), and (b) the Merger Subs merged with and into Broadcom, with Broadcom as the surviving corporation in such mergers (collectively,
the Transactions). As a result of the Transactions, (x) both the Issuer and Broadcom became indirect subsidiaries of Pavonia Limited, and (y) all issued Ordinary Shares of the Issuer were exchanged on a one-for-one basis
for newly issued ordinary shares of Pavonia Limited. Pavonia Limited was subsequently renamed Broadcom Limited.   


Item 5.
Interest in Securities of the Issuer  Items 5(a), 5(b), 5(c) and 5(e) of the Schedule 13D are
hereby amended and restated to reflect the following:  (a)  (b) As a result of the transactions described in the final paragraph of Item 4
of this Schedule 13D, none of the Reporting Persons has, and no Reporting Person may be deemed to have, beneficial or other ownership of any Ordinary Shares. 
(c) As reported on a Form 4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 19, 2016, on January 15, 2016, Mr. Kenneth Y. Hao
acquired 7,186 Ordinary Shares of the Issuer as a result of the exercise of an option at an exercise price of $31.49 per share. These securities are held by Mr. Hao for the benefit of certain entities (Silver Lake) affiliated with
Silver Lake (Offshore) AIV GP IV, Ltd. (AIV GP IV). Mr. Hao served as a director of the Issuer until the time of the Transactions described above in Item 4. Pursuant to Mr. Haos arrangement with Silver Lake with
respect to director compensation, upon the sale of these securities, the proceeds from such sale(s) are expected to be remitted to Silver Lake. Mr. Hao is a director of AIV GP IV. 
Except as set forth above, none of the Reporting Persons have effected any transactions in the Issuers Ordinary Shares in the past sixty days. 
 


(e)
On February 1, 2016, the Reporting Persons ceased to be the beneficial owners of any Ordinary Shares. 


Signatures 
After reasonable inquiry and to the best of its knowledge and belief, the undersigned certify that the information set forth in this statement is true,
complete and correct.  Dated this 1st day of February, 2016.
