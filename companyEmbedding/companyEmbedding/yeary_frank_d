Frank D. Yeary


Frank D. Yeary is executive chairman of CamberView Partners, a leading source of independent, investor-led advice for public companies. He was vice chancellor of his alma mater, University of California, Berkeley, from 2008 to 2012 and prior to this appointment was global head of mergers & acquisitions at Citigroup Investment Banking. Until its sale in 2015, he was also chairman and co-founder of Level Money Inc., a financial organization helping the next generation of young adults achieve financial balance.
As vice chancellor at UC Berkeley, Yeary led the development of a new sustainable financial strategy, designed and implemented the university’s first comprehensive middle-class financial aid program, and initiated and oversaw the implementation of one of the largest re-engineering and cost-reduction efforts ever undertaken by a public university. In addition, for nearly two years he acted as chief administrative officer managing a portfolio including finance, human resources, labor relations, internal controls and intercollegiate athletics.
Prior to his appointment at UC Berkeley, Yeary held various positions in the investment banking division of Citigroup. During the period 2004 to 2008 he was global head of mergers & acquisitions, where he significantly restructured the department, nearly tripled revenues and led the firm from fifth-largest to the second-largest M&A business, as ranked by global M&A volume. Prior to 2004, he was global head of the Technology, Media and Telecom (TMT) investment banking practice at Salomon Smith Barney.
Yeary received a bachelor’s degree from University of California, Berkeley, in history and economics. He is on the board of directors of PayPal Holdings Inc.
