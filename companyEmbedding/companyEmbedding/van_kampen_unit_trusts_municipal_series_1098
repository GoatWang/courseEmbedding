Preliminary Prospectus Dated July 16, 2012
 VAN KAMPEN UNIT TRUSTS, MUNICIPAL SERIES 1119

 The attached final Prospectus for a prior series of the fund is hereby used
as a preliminary Prospectus for the above stated series. The narrative          
information and structure of the attached final Prospectus will be substantially
the same as that of the final Prospectus for this series. Information with      
respect to pricing, the number of units, dates and summary information regarding
the characteristics of securities to be deposited in this series is not now     
available and will be different since each series has a unique Portfolio.       
Accordingly, the information contained herein with regard to the previous series
should be considered as being included for informational purposes only. Ratings 
of the securities in this series are expected to be comparable to those of the  
securities deposited in the previous series. However, the Estimated Current     
Return for this series will depend on the interest rates and offering prices of 
the securities in this series and may vary materially from that of the previous 
series.                                                                         

Information contained herein is subject to completion or amendment. Such  
units may not be sold nor may an offer to buy be accepted prior to the time the 
registration statement becomes effective. This Prospectus shall not constitute  
an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any  
sale of the units in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would  
be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of 
any such state.                                                                 

(Incorporated herein by reference is the final prospectus from Van Kampen 
Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1098 (Registration No. 333-181896) as filed on    
July 13, 2012, which shall be used as a preliminary prospectus for the current  
series of the fund.)                                                            

  The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved these
securities or passed upon the adequacy of this Prospectus. Any representation to
the contrary is a criminal offense.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Explore high-conviction investing with Invesco

                                           At Invesco, high-conviction investing means helping our clients achieve outcomes that go beyond the limitations of traditional market benchmarks.

Our high-conviction strategies include these distinct approaches





Fundamental active
Portfolio managers choose investments based on the fundamental of a company and its stock or bond.



High conviction means assessing companies on how financially strong they are, not just how big they are.

Built from investments with specific characteristics – quality, low volatility, fundamentals and other relevant factors.

Examining sector and factor performance in the third quarter of 2016
Posted by Nick Kalivas, Senior Equity Product Strategist on Sep. 26, 2016

The high beta, value and size factors outperformed the broad-market S&P 500 Index by a sizeable margin during the third quarter. The S&P 500 Index rose a healthy 3.85%, but 14 smart beta strategies and two smaller-cap indices all outperformed the broader market.
