K4Connect, a user-centric technology integration company, announced today that it has raised $1.9 million in a seed round to support the launch of its debut product for senior living communities. The product, K4Community, transforms community apartments and residences into smart homes that are responsive to individual residents' needs and preferences via a single easy-to-use application. With new home automation products appearing on the market daily, K4Connect is the first company to bring them together in an integrated solution specifically designed and developed to meet the evolving needs of the rapidly growing, though underserved, senior living market.The senior market, which is expected to double in size over the next 15 years, is prime for an influx of new technologies and investments. The momentum in the market is evidenced by strong support for K4Connect from several leading investors, including: Silicon Valley-based Sierra Ventures and Better Ventures; North Carolina-based Lowe's Companies, Inc.; and Florida's Stonehenge Growth Equity Partners. Individuals including Stephen Morton, President and COO of Signature Senior Living, and Chris Regan, a patent attorney with Allen, Dyer, Doppelt, Milbrath & Gilchrist, P.A., as well as two other unnamed investors have committed funds for K4Connect's growth.Sierra Ventures and Stonehenge were previous investors in AuthenTec, the fingerprint sensor technology company co-founded by K4Connect CEO F. Scott Moody. AuthenTec's technology is now the foundation for Apple's Touch ID. Similarly, Regan previously served as outside patent counsel for AuthenTec, which had more than 200 patents when acquired by Apple in 2012.'K4Connect's first product is bridging the gap between smart technologies and the 43 million seniors living in the United States. The company's focus on improving quality of life for seniors will be essential as our population ages,' said Ben Yu, Managing Director of Sierra Ventures. 'We could not be more excited to reinvest in an entrepreneur like Scott. Much like our prior investment in him and the team at AuthenTec, we see K4Connect solving a global problem by making extremely complex technology accessible to everyday consumers.'                                                                                                                                                                         'By putting the residents' needs first, there is no doubt that K4Community is making a material difference in peoples' lives,' said Morton, co-founder of Southern Assisted Living, whose 40 senior living communities were acquired by Brookdale in 2006. 'My experience in this industry has taught me that the products that empower seniors themselves are the ones that succeed, and that is what I see here.'The company's patent-pending software platform seamlessly integrates disparate smart devices, systems and technologies into a single responsive system. This makes life simpler and healthier for seniors, while arming community staff and operators with actionable resident data and analytics to help improve quality of care and customer satisfaction. 'The overwhelmingly positive support we have received from investors confirms that K4Connect will be important to the future of senior care,' said Moody. 'As more of America's 75 million baby boomers transition to retirement, senior living communities need new ways to distinguish themselves from competitors. Our product improves quality of care, streamlines community operations, and most importantly, helps make residents' lives simpler, healthier and happier.'About K4ConnectK4Connect is a technology integration company based in Raleigh, North Carolina. Its differentiated software platform can integrate any number of disparate smart devices, systems and applications into a single responsive system. The company's initial K4-branded products, including the previously announced K4Community, are specifically tailored for seniors and individuals living with disabilities.

K4Connect and Garmin Collaborate to Revolutionize Senior Living Community Wellness

Integration Pairs Wearable Technology with "Connected-Life" Platform to Encourage an Active, Social Lifestyle for Older Adults




Jul 18, 2017, 8:00am EDT














RALEIGH, N.C., July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- K4Connect, a mission-centered technology company that brings together the latest advances in technology to create solutions to serve and empower older adults and individuals living with disabilities, today announced a collaboration with Garmin International, Inc. (Garmin) to integrate wearable devices as part of K4Community, K4Connect's "connected-life" platform. The first fully integrated Garmin activity tracker, vívofit® 3, is immediately available as part of K4Community, K4Connect's offering designed specifically for the residents (and their families), staff and operators of senior-living communities.  
This unique collaboration between K4Connect and Garmin delivers numerous benefits to senior-living residents, as well as community staff and operators. The integration provides residents with the tools they need to easily and continuously track their wellness and fitness information through the same K4Community application they use daily to foster "simpler, healthier and happier" lives. Including Garmin devices as part of the ever-expanding K4Community capabilities encourages residents to live a more active and social lifestyle, while providing staff the information and tools to help their residents in achieve their personal goals. 
According to the recent report from AARP, "Building a Better Tracker: Older Consumers Weigh In on Activity and Sleep Monitoring Devices," older adults are highly interested in using technology to help them track and improve their own health. In fact, over 75 percent of participants in the study reported activity and sleep trackers to be useful. 
In addition to steps and activity levels, Garmin wearables can also monitor heart rate,  track sleep, and provide many other health and fitness metrics. Garmin devices also provide minimal user friction given their long battery life, water resistance and seamless interface with K4Community. Senior-living community staff members also have a view of real-time analytics showing activity and wellness trends, allowing them to provide the best in care and support.  
"Connected wellness devices provide a huge opportunity for older adults to live a healthier life and incorporating the latest in advances in wearable technology from a renowned company like Garmin goes a long way toward helping us achieve our mission of serving older adults," said Scott Moody, co-founder, CEO and Chief Client Advocate of K4Connect. "K4Community is designed with a senior resident centric perspective, eliminating any potential barriers of enjoying the benefits of a fitness tracker." 
"Moreover, residents walking together and comparing daily step counts helps foster socialization and recent data shows that isolation in seniors increases the risk of heart disease by 29 percent. We're excited to be teaming with Garmin, and this is just the beginning of what we see as a long-term relationship, focused on serving older adults and those living with disabilities," Moody added. 
"We have a deep passion to positively affect older adults' overall health and well-being and can now reach a broader audience through this collaboration," said Travis Johnson, Lead Product Manager, Garmin Health. "Results from the initial deployments and pilots have been very good, accentuated by the older adult's overall high usage rate. We've also been inspired by K4Connect's mission and focus on serving others and look forward to making a difference in people's lives for a long time to come."

Our Story
 
 
 


In the beginning, we were all about technology. We used to talk about being a “systems integration company connecting any number of disparate devices, systems and applications into a single cohesive system” and how we were going to do that in “your home, office or anywhere-in-between.” It was all about what people sometimes call the “smart home” or the “internet of things”, although the hype did not always prove true. Honestly, we were inventing some pretty neat stuff, making the hype a reality, but we had no idea how powerful the idea, and our technology, could be until our CEO met Eric, an individual living with the challenges of MS, who told him,
“…you guys can make my life better.”
It was with those words that it became clear that we found our purpose, that the technologies we were developing could solve real and significant problems for an underserved part of our worldwide community.
From that day forward, our mission at K4Connect has been to create solutions that serve and empower older adults and individuals living with disabilities, enhancing their lives by integrating the latest in smart technologies into a single responsive system.
Bottom line – we believe technology should be purposeful, person-centric and harmonious.

(Garmin) to integrate wearable devices as part of K4Community, K4Connect's "connected-life" platform. The first fully integrated Garmin activity tracker, vívofit® 3, is immediately available as part of K4Community, K4Connect's offering designed specifically for the residents (and their families), staff and operators of senior-living communities.  This unique collaboration between K4Connect and Garmin delivers numerous benefits to senior-living residents, as well as community staff and operators. The integration provides residents with the tools they need to easily and continuously track their wellness and fitness information through the same K4Community application they use daily to foster "simpler, healthier and happier" lives. Including Garmin devices as part of the ever-expanding K4Community capabilities encourages residents to live a more active and social lifestyle, while providing staff the information and tools to help their residents in achieve their personal goals.According to the recent report from AARP, "Building a Better Tracker: Older Consumers Weigh In on Activity and Sleep Monitoring Devices," older adults are highly interested in using technology to help them track and improve their own health. In fact, over 75 percent of participants in the study reported activity and sleep trackers to be useful.In addition to steps and activity levels, Garmin wearables can also monitor heart rate,  track sleep, and provide many other health and fitness metrics. Garmin devices also provide minimal user friction given their long battery life, water resistance and seamless interface with K4Community. Senior-living community staff members also have a view of real-time analytics showing activity and wellness trends, allowing them to provide the best in care and support. "Connected wellness devices provide a huge opportunity for older adults to live a healthier life and incorporating the latest in advances in wearable technology from a renowned company like Garmin goes a long way toward helping us achieve our mission of serving older adults," said Scott Moody, co-founder, CEO and Chief Client Advocate of K4Connect. "K4Community is designed with a senior resident centric perspective, eliminating any potential barriers of enjoying the benefits of a fitness tracker.""Moreover, residents walking together and comparing daily step counts helps foster socialization and recent data shows that isolation in seniors increases the risk of heart disease by 29 percent. We're excited to be teaming with Garmin, and this is just the beginning of what we see as a long-term relationship, focused on serving older adults and those living with disabilities," Moody added."We have a deep passion to positively affect older adults' overall health and well-being and can now reach a broader audience through this collaboration," said Travis Johnson, Lead Product Manager, Garmin Health. "Results from the initial deployments and pilots have been very good, accentuated by the older adult's overall high usage rate. We've also been inspired by K4Connect's mission and focus on serving others and look forward to making a difference in people's lives for a long time to come."For more information on K4Community, please visit, https://www.k4connect.com/operators/.About K4ConnectK4Connect creates solutions that serve and empower older adults and individuals living with disabilities, helping those it serves enjoy life via a connected-life software suite that brings together the best in home automation products, health and wellness technologies, and communication and social functionality.

Works well with Express and follows similar middleware patterns (.on, .use).
Uses web sockets, but degrades gracefully to other methods when not available (polling).
Built-in support for name spacing, rooms, and authentication.

Let’s look at a basic example of how to build a simple Express web server with Socket.io handling the real-time communication. First, open a new file in your favorite text editor called “server.js” and add the following lines of code:

var app = require('express')();
var http = require('http').Server(app);
var io = require('socket.io')(http);

Here we’ve done three things:

Create an instance of the Express web server.
Create an http listener and attach Express.
Create a Socket.io server and attach it to the http listener

Express will handle most of the http requests, but any requests to “/socket.io/” will be passed through to the Socket.io engine.
Next we need to serve out some html to the client:

app.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});

Socket.io needs to know what to do with incoming messages. For our chat room, we are going to send the incoming message out to everyone who is connected, so in the “connection” event handler, we’ll attach a new handler for when “chat message” messages are received:

io.on('connection', function(socket){
  socket.on('chat message', function(msg){
    io.emit('chat message', msg);
  });
});

Then we tell our server to start listening on port 3000:

http.listen(3000, function(){
    console.log('listening on *:3000');
});

That’s it for server.js, save it, and now our server is ready to run. However, before we can run, we still need to build our “index.html” file that is being served out:

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Socket.IO chat</title>
    <style>
      * { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }
      body { font: 13px Helvetica, Arial; }
      form { background: #000; padding: 3px; position: fixed; bottom: 0; width: 100%; }
      form input { border: 0; padding: 10px; width: 90%; margin-right: .5%; }
      form button { width: 9%; background: rgb(130, 224, 255); border: none; padding: 10px; }
      #messages { list-style-type: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; }
      #messages li { padding: 5px 10px; }
      #messages li:nth-child(odd) { background: #eee; }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ul id="messages"></ul>
    <form action="">
      <input id="m" autocomplete="off" /><button>Send</button>
    </form>
    <script src="https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.2.0.js"></script>
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.js"></script>
    <script>
      var socket = io();
      $('form').submit(function(){
        socket.emit('chat message', $('#m').val());
        $('#m').val('');
        return false;
      });
      socket.on('chat message', function(msg){
        $('#messages').append($('<li>').text(msg));
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

As you can see, its a basic chat window with a text input and send button at the bottom. We’ve also set up two basic javascript events:

Send the message in the text input when the Send button is pressed.
Append the message to the div when a “chat message” is received from the server.

To run the example, install the required modules and execute with node:

npm install socket.io
npm install express
node server.js

And point your browser at http://localhost:3000
