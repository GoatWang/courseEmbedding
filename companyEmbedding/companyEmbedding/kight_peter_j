Business Wire




Jun 14, 2012 6:00 AM EDT













 




























































  The Board of  Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN; www.huntington.com) has unanimously elected Peter J. (Pete) Kight, founder and former chairman and chief executive officer of groundbreaking financial electronic services and product provider CheckFree, to its board. A native of Columbus, Kight is one of the world’s most respected leaders in financial services technology, most notably in the fields of electronic funds transfer, online banking and electronic billing and payment. Kight is currently co-chairman and managing partner of The Comvest Group.   Peter J. (Pete) Kight has been appointed to the board of Huntington Bancshares Inc. (Photo: Business Wire)   “Pete is one of the most successful entrepreneurs and influential leaders in the electronic consumer payments industry. He is also a pioneer and a visionary as well as an extraordinarily effective executive,” said Stephen D. Steinour, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Huntington. “Huntington will benefit enormously from his insights and advice as we continue to explore ways to leverage technology to make banking more efficient and convenient for our customers. As a Columbus native, Pete shares Huntington’s vision for the Midwest to help our local communities grow and prosper.”  Kight built CheckFree from an electronic consumer bill pay pioneer to encompass multiple types of payments and processing infrastructures. CheckFree’s growth toward dominance of the electronic payment industry under Kight’s leadership included leveraging business intelligence to detect and prevent fraud, electronic billing, reconciliation and operational risk management capabilities. Kight, who continued to serve through March 2010 as vice chairman of FiServ following CheckFree’s acquisition, holds more than a dozen patents for electronic banking and payment systems.  “I am delighted to join Huntington, which has been at the forefront of innovative banking and community programs,” said Kight. “I look forward to being part of an active board that is committed to increasing shareholder value and its communities as we grow the bank.”

COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Board of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ: HBAN; www.huntington.com) 
      has unanimously elected Peter J. (Pete) Kight, founder and former 
      chairman and chief executive officer of groundbreaking financial 
      electronic services and product provider CheckFree, to its board. A 
      native of Columbus, Kight is one of the world’s most respected leaders 
      in financial services technology, most notably in the fields of 
      electronic funds transfer, online banking and electronic billing and 
      payment. Kight is currently co-chairman and managing partner of The 
      Comvest Group.
    


      “Pete is one of the most successful entrepreneurs and influential 
      leaders in the electronic consumer payments industry. He is also a 
      pioneer and a visionary as well as an extraordinarily effective 
      executive,” said Stephen D. Steinour, chairman, president and chief 
      executive officer of Huntington. “Huntington will benefit enormously 
      from his insights and advice as we continue to explore ways to leverage 
      technology to make banking more efficient and convenient for our 
      customers. As a Columbus native, Pete shares Huntington’s vision for the 
      Midwest to help our local communities grow and prosper.”
    

      Kight built CheckFree from an electronic consumer bill pay pioneer to 
      encompass multiple types of payments and processing infrastructures. 
      CheckFree’s growth toward dominance of the electronic payment industry 
      under Kight’s leadership included leveraging business intelligence to 
      detect and prevent fraud, electronic billing, reconciliation and 
      operational risk management capabilities. Kight, who continued to serve 
      through March 2010 as vice chairman of FiServ following CheckFree’s 
      acquisition, holds more than a dozen patents for electronic banking and 
      payment systems.
    

      “I am delighted to join Huntington, which has been at the forefront of 
      innovative banking and community programs,” said Kight. “I look forward 
      to being part of an active board that is committed to increasing 
      shareholder value and its communities as we grow the bank.”
    

      Kight is an Ellis Island Medal of Honor recipient and was the first 
      recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from Bank Technology News, 
      a SourceMedia publication.
