What are analysts saying about Box stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Box stock: 
1. Rosenblatt Securities analysts commented, "We believe this could help clarify some confusion regarding how BOX is positioned vs. both One Drive and Sharepoint, which could shorten sales cycles. It is our view that this combi- nation could be more significant over time than the IBM relationship due to the prevalence of Office 365 in enterprise accounts." (7/17/2017)
2. Drexel Hamilton analysts commented, "We are taking a haircut to FY4Q numbers as a result of the intense competitive pressures. But we remain positive on Sprint’s massive spectrum portfolio, which positions it well to exceed growing capacity demands. Our TP remains unchanged at US$11 based on 7.0x our CY18E adj. EBITDA ex-leasing. Impact Verizon’s Feb 12 th unlimited launch, triggered universal unlimited. Though postpaid phone churn was originally expected to be ~5bps lower QoQ, increased competition caused it to remain flat. We note that the churn impact peaked during week 1 and then tailed off, reflecting Sprint’s continued leadership in price (Fig. 1). Current promos include: 1) a single line under Unlimited Freedom for US$50/mo for one year and US$60/mo after that; 2) two lines for US$90/mo; and 3) US$30 off any order placed online or by phone and a free activation for new customers. Meanwhile, prepaid momentum is building up, driven by Boost/Virgin. We are modelling a sequential improvement in trends with churn ~10bps lower QoQ, at the expense of Cricket and MetroPCS. We now expect FY4Q16 total revenues to go ex- growth at US$7.98bn with adj. EBITDA of US$2.37bn." (3/31/2017)
3. FIG Partners analysts commented, "Box delivered another strong quarter ahead of consensus, supported by good large deal momentum (64 deals >$100K), newer products (especially Governance, KeySafe, Zones), and the IBM channel (contributing to 18 six-figure deals). We're also pleased to see Box meet its positive FCF target in 4QFY17, while setting a positive FCF target for all of FY18 even as it accelerates sales investment. We remain bullish and continue to believe that IBM and Box's various newer products (Governance, KeySafe, Zones, Shuttle, etc.) provides a solid base for growth. There's also room for upside as even newer efforts gain traction (Platform, Relay) and international sales ramp (helped by Zones and sales investment). We're raising our revenue projections, though modestly increasing our loss per share projections reflecting the sales investment." (3/2/2017)

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 12 Buy Ratings, 1 Strong Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.82)Consensus Price Target: $23.00 (19.54% upside)

Investment Management

What We Do
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT: TAILORED SOLUTIONS
Investment Management is implemented as part of your overall plan and involves the management and/or oversight of all family assets on an ongoing basis.
At The Tarbox Group, we focus on the “big picture” decisions that maximize the likelihood investment returns will meet your goals.
We think the top three most important factors in designing a portfolio are:

Strategic asset allocation: This is the most significant component affecting portfolio returns.
Diversification: It is essential to diversify among asset classes, investment styles and holdings to reduce risk.
Costs: Keeping expenses and taxes to a minimum has a tremendous effect on long-term returns.

To build your customized portfolio we use the following investment process:

We start with a review of your current investments, tax situation, income needs, family dynamics, and short- and long-term goals.
This provides a risk/reward profile that leads toward the selection of a targeted asset allocation.
We work with you to establish an Investment Policy Statement (IPS) that sets the parameters and allocation among our four model portfolios: Stable Growth, Conservative Growth, Moderate Growth and Growth.
We customize your portfolio based on your current holdings, preferences, tax situation, and other factors.

We use a variety of asset types to build portfolios, and we have a strong preference for liquidity where possible.
THE END RESULT
Our goal is not to beat a particular index – it’s to meet or exceed your specific required or targeted rate of return. We aim to provide you with greater peace of mind, while achieving the returns you need to meet your financial goals over the long term.

Wealth Management

What We Do
WEALTH MANAGEMENT: CUSTOMIZED EXPERTISE
Our wealth management services begin with the evaluation and review of your financial concerns, risks and objectives. We help develop strategies to accomplish agreed-upon goals, and use a coordinated implementation and follow-through process once decisions are made.
Often, the most important things we do for our clients involve unanticipated events or situations outside of the realm of basic financial planning. We are here for you and your family and you can call on us at any time!
Whether it’s sorting through tax issues on a complicated real estate transaction, wiring funds to a foreign country with short notice, acting as “gatekeeper” to vet proposals or meeting with your young adult children to help educate them and get them going on the right financial path, we can help.
THE END RESULT
We aim to simplify the management of your financial affairs while providing solutions to meet your unique goals. We are confident that you will be pleased with the results.
