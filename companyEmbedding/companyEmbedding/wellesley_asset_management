Story





		Greg Miller was a man on a mission. His grandfather had hit it big, then lost it all. His father, pretty much the same story. A successful CPA and businessman, he wasn’t about to make the same mistake.

		Listen to Greg’s story and hear about what helped to preserve his portfolio, and how that same strategy is now working to help Wellesley’s clients.





		Greg’s Father, Grandfather and Greg in 1972

 Wellesley Asset Management 


Convertible Bond Program
Fact Sheet


Wellesley's investment strategy is a multi-step process based on fundamental analysis. First, they typically look for convertible bond issues from entities that are financially strong, have attractive "put" and "call" provisions and an appropriate equity premium. Second, Wellesley seeks companies with expanding sales and profits, good management, and positive overall prospects. Third, the overall economic outlook is considered, including interest rate projections and prospects for the industry. The goal is to select convertible bonds with the potential to produce attractive absolute returns over full market cycles (5 to 7 year periods) with minimal losses. Read more >>

StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for fixed income funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for  fixed income funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.

PRICE AND DISTRIBUTIONS

NAVFor funds with a fluctuating price per share, the net asset value (NAV) is the market value of a mutual fund's total assets, minus liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. The value of a single share is called its share value or share price.For money market funds that seek to maintain a stable price per share, the NAV is calculated by valuing securities at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

SEC yield
A non-money market fund's SEC yield is based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30 day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.The SEC yield for a money market fund is calculated by annualizing its daily income distributions for the previous seven days.

BASED ON HOLDINGS' YIELD TO MATURITY/DIVIDEND FOR LAST 30 DAYS OF PRIOR MONTH






Dividend yieldThe annual rate of return on a share of stock, determined by dividing the annual dividend by its current share price. In a stock mutual fund, this figure represents the average dividend yield of the stocks held by the fund.

Fees and minimums
Fees and minimums




Purchase fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor buys shares. This fee is not a sales charge or load because it is paid directly to the fund to offset the costs of trading certain securities.


None



Redemption fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor sells shares. A redemption fee differs from a back-end load because the money is paid back into the fund. Many funds charge redemption fees only when shares are bought and then sold within a specific period of time, generally in an effort to discourage market-timing and short-term trading. Some brokers also charge their clients redemption fees for the sale of securities.

* Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). ”NR” is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include a fund’s investment in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund or Vanguard Municipal Cash Management Fund, each of which invests in high-quality money market instruments and may serve as a cash management vehicle for the Vanguard funds, trusts, and accounts. U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, and U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities appear under ”U.S. Government.” Credit-quality ratings for each issue are obtained from Barclays using ratings derived from Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard & Poor’s (S&P). When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used. When ratings are available from two of the agencies, the lower rating is used. When one rating is available, that rating is used.

Risk and volatility are based on the share class with the earliest inception date.
Risk measures are calculated from trailing 36-month fund returns relative to the associated benchmarks.
The fund is subject to several bond and stock market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, because bond and stock prices can move in different directions or to different degrees, the fund’s bond and short-term investment holdings may counteract some of the volatility experienced by the fund’s stock holdings. The fund’s performance could be hurt by: Interest rate risk: The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates.Income risk: The chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates.Credit risk: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.Call risk: The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income.Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.Investment style risk: The chance that returns from large-capitalization value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.
