Leslie Stone Heisz joined the boards of directors of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. and Kaiser Foundation Hosptials in January 2015. She is a member of the Audit and Compliance Committee, the Governance, Accountability and Nominating Committee, and the Community Benefit Committee.
Heisz has more than 20 years of senior-level investment banking experience, advising C-suite executives and boards of directors on complex matters, including business strategy, mergers, acquisitions, financial restructurings, capital structure, and debt and equity financings.
Heisz has held a number of executive-level roles at firms including Lazard Freres & Co., Wasserstein Perella & Co., Salomon Brothers, and Price Waterhouse (now known as PwC), before deciding in 2010 to focus solely on board service. In 2015, the National Association of Corporate Directors named Heisz to the NACD Directorship 100, which recognizes individuals who participate in board work and influence how that work is done.
Heisz serves on the boards of Edwards Lifesciences Corp. and Public Storage. She has served on several Fortune 1000 boards across several industries, including, most currently, Towers Watson, a leading global professional services company, and Ingram Micro, Inc., the world’s largest distributor of computer and technology products. She previously served on the boards of HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc., an AA-rated specialty insurer, and IGT (International Game Technology), a leading electronic games supplier.
Heisz earned a master of business administration from the University of California, Los Angeles Anderson School of Management with concentrations in finance and accounting, and a bachelor’s degree in economics-systems science, magna cum laude, also from UCLA.

Testimonials
"All Natural Stone has an amazing selection and the best customer service. We worked on our "high end" bathroom with them and came back again for another remodel project. High integrity and commitment to dates. They are also great at helping think through design."
- Ron S., Menlo Park

"So many choices, and amazing  service! When we remodeled our kitchen we checked several places in the city and on the Peninsula. Couldn't find a better selection than here. Got our countertops and backsplash all in one place!"
- Jonathan S., San Francisco

"A fantastic selection. Wow! The most beautiful samples.  The sales person was very helpful but not overly so.  She told us if we made an appointment, she would show us different tile combinations.  We are definitely going back to do that."
- Wendy B., Pleasanton

Porcelain Tile
Porcelain tile, a sister of ceramic tile, is composed of a much finer clay than ceramic and is fired at higher temperatures. This process makes porcelain tile more homogeneous; achieving through-body coloration, making scratches and nicks less obvious. It also makes porcelain much stronger and less prone to moisture and stain absorption. For those reasons, porcelain can be used in both indoor and outdoor applications.
 
 

Natural Stone Tile
Natural stone tile is available in almost as many styles as clay tile, with polished marble flooring, granite flooring, slate flooring or the very popular travertine, and have become the hallmarks of formal interiors. As with any natural product, you can expect imperfections common to the type of flooring you are purchasing. These imperfections only add to the aesthetic appeal and won’t devalue your new floor. If you’ve ever admired the beauty of a stone fireplace, you can begin to appreciate the beauty this type of look can bring to your entire space.

Ceramic Tile
Ceramic tile is generally made with red clay-based materials and other natural materials that are mined buy kamagra 100mg generic viagra from the earth. Traditional ceramic tile can be naturally colored and left unglazed, like terra cotta. It can also feature colored or highly designed surfaces, which can be glazed (finished with a glass surface) from matte to high gloss.

Hand painted tile can transform any plain surface into a Designer Showcase, and will give any Home or even Business that Designer Look.
 
 
 

Metal Tile
Metal tile is widely used as accent pieces, mixed in with other types of tile or stone. The metal tiles tend to have a relief or raised pattern set into them. Metal inlays in a kitchen backsplash are a great way to add another design element as well as a unique way to tie in with metal appliances and cabinet hardware. Metal tile works especially well with tumbled and antique stone. Some can be used for floor inlays. A natural pewter or nickel look is the most popular, but finishes range from old world rustic iron to stainless steel contemporary.

- Jonathan S., San Francisco

"A fantastic selection. Wow! The most beautiful samples.  The sales person was very helpful but not overly so.  She told us if we made an appointment, she would show us different tile combinations.  We are definitely going back to do that."
