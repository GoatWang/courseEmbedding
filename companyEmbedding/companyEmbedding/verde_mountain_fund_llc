Outgoings

Business Rates/Property Tax
                        No properties were found where VERDE MOUNTAIN FUND, LLC is liable for the business rates / property tax. This could be for a number of reasons. The council hasnt published the data We havent found or been able to process the councils data The company is part of a group of companies and another company in the group is liable for business rates The registered office may be a residential address which does not have a commercial designation. If the business is run from home then it won't be a commercial property and hence won't be liable for business rates. Serviced offices are increasingly popular and therefore a business may not be paying business rates directly - the building owner is and this is incorporated in the office rental charge.
