Why OneOme’s RightMed® test?

Over 4 billion prescriptions are issued each year.1 However, not all drugs are effective for all people. In fact, response rates for many drugs are only between 50-75%.2 Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) account for up to 7% of all hospital admissions and up to 20% of re-admissions, according to estimates.3,4 ADRs are the fourth leading cause of death and are estimated to cost $136 billion annually.5 An estimated 10-20% of ADRs may be due to genetic factors.6
Healthcare providers like you may use pharmacogenomic information to make better prescription decisions.  
The OneOme RightMed pharmacogenomic test includes 22 actionable genes that cover more than 340 of the most commonly used drugs drugs across ONCOLOGY, PSYCHIATRY, and 28 OTHER DISEASE AREAS.

Our solution
Pharmacogenomics — effectively integrated into patients’ everyday clinical care.







The OneOme RightMed® pharmacogenomic test

The OneOme RightMed test is a physician-ordered pharmacogenomic test that analyzes a patient’s DNA to determine how he or she may respond to certain medications. The analysis is provided to the physician in the form of a static and interactive report which clearly identifies which prescription drugs are — or aren’t — likely to work. This information can help providers make better prescription decisions, protect patients from adverse drug reactions and drug ineffectiveness, and reduce healthcare costs.

PROVIDER TOOLKIT PATIENT TOOLKIT






How people metabolize drugs 


Poor metabolizer (PM)
Metabolizes drugs much
more slowly than normal.  

Intermediate metabolizer (IM)
Metabolizes more
slowly than normal.  

Normal metabolizer (NM)
Metabolizes at a
normal rate.  

Ultrarapid metabolizer (UM)
Metabolizes more
quickly than normal.  


Pharmacogenomics, the study of how an individual's genes affect his or her response to medications, examines metabolization as a major factor contributing to an individual's response to drugs. Knowing how a patient will metabolize, or break down, many drugs will help physicians determine which drugs may work for their patients and reduce the trial-and-error approach.  
Depending on variations in a patient’s genes, that patient may break down a drug too slowly or too quickly. If the patient is a poor metabolizer of a given drug, he or she may be exposed to too much of it, which may result in an adverse drug reaction (ADR). If the patient is an ultrarapid metabolizer of a drug, he or she may not get enough to have any effect at all. Since genes don’t change with time, this patient will always be an ultrarapid metabolizer of that drug.  
Physicians can use this information to determine optimal drugs and doses for their patients.






Co-developed by Mayo Clinic, the RightMed test is:


COMPREHENSIVE: Rigorous, proprietary analysis that covers 22 GENES, 340+ COMMONLY PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS, and 28 CONDITIONS


INDIVIDUALIZED: Comprised of a patient’s genetic information, medication history, and drug-to-drug interactions


CREDIBLE: Co-developed and exclusively licensed with Mayo Clinic; characterized by SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL DATA


ACTIONABLE: Provides enhanced static reports and interactive decision support tools for easy readability and quick decision-making within the provider workflow


ACCESSIBLE: Affordable — offered at a low-cost, out-of-pocket expense.


CONVENIENT: Customized 24/7 logistics and customer support including expert medical, genetics, and pharmacology staff on call
  


for providers for pharmacists for patients






Testing for today and tomorrow 
OneOme brings clarity and insight into new and existing medications. OneOme’s RightMed PGx test may help with:


CURRENT PRESCRIPTIONS (REACTIVELY): Physicians can get insight into why a patient might be experiencing adverse effects or is not experiencing the expected benefits from a drug they’re already taking


PRESCRIPTION DECISIONS (PROACTIVELY): Before prescribing a new medication, physicians can leverage a patient’s PGx profile to make more informed decisions



Because DNA does not change with time, the OneOme RightMed PGx test may provide years of more accurate decision-making.







 OneOme's process 

OneOme’s RightMed pharmacogenomic test analyzes a patient’s genetic information through our curated clinical PGx knowledgebase to provide information on the individual patient’s PGx profile. The actionable results are delivered to the provider through a variety of decision support tools.

Put pharmacogenomics to work
Pharmacists are uniquely qualified to help patients and healthcare teams utilize pharmacogenomics (PGx) by introducing and providing the OneOme RightMed® test. Covering 340+ DRUGS and 28 MEDICAL CONDITIONS, the test can help pharmacists guide optimal drug selection and dosing, much like recommending a dosing adjustment based on drug interaction or renal dysfunction. Pharmacists’ distinct education, skills, and expanding role in healthcare position them to champion processes for pharmacogenomic testing and interpretation of results – and with it, a new level of care.
Drug list sample report







Era of personalized medicine 
Trial-and-error as a prescription method can cause adverse drug reactions or inadequate patient response. This often can lead to therapeutic failures before the right drug and dosage are found.  
The approach to care is changing. Pharmacists are optimizing the paradigm of patient care by incorporating genomics into clinical decision making. This proactive approach advances pharmacy by improving patient care and personalizing drug therapies.

OUR MISSION
Making   prescriptions   personal








 About us 
OneOme was established by Invenshure, LLC and Mayo Clinic to provide a comprehensive, cost-effective pharmacogenomic solution integrated into patients’ everyday clinical care. OneOme’s key product offering is the RightMed® pharmacogenomic test, a physician-ordered genetic test that predicts how a patient’s DNA and current prescriptions may affect their response to medications. The analysis is provided to the physician in the form of static and interactive reports that identifies which prescription drugs are — or aren’t — likely to work. This information can help providers make better prescription decisions, protect patients from adverse drug reactions and drug ineffectiveness, and reduce healthcare costs.  
Our mission is to deliver the most cost-effective, comprehensive, clinically actionable pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing and tools for all providers and patients worldwide.  
The OneOme RightMed pharmacogenomic test integrates a patient’s genetic profile, current prescriptions, and drug-drug interactions and processes this information using a proprietary algorithm-based platform—developed with years of pharmacogenomics expertise and curated clinical data—to provide a dynamic, actionable report. We continue to develop, improve, and update our algorithms and database of clinical information, enabling healthcare providers to treat each patient uniquely based on their pharmacogenomic results. Now you have the potential to make a prescription the right one, the first time. 
OneOme is a privately held company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota and backed by Invenshure, LLC and Mayo Clinic. Our team of scientists, pharmacists, engineers, and seasoned staff create solutions to significantly expand the role of pharmacogenomics in individualized medicine.

	Revolutionary Prescription Writing and Ordering Portal based on a Patient�s 
	Genetic Profile allows Physicians to provide more Personalized Medications

	 




 


Paul 
	Owen


	Chief Executive Officer

 


	OneOme, LLC.



www.oneome.com 


 


	Interview conducted by:


	Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published � November 21, 2016

 


CEOCFO: Mr. Owen, what is the concept 
	behind OneOme, LLC�? 


Mr. Owen: 
OneOme was 
	established in late 2013, early 2014 in collaboration with three cofounder 
	scientists from Mayo Clinic to develop a comprehensive, low-cost 
	pharmacogenomic test and interactive tools that would allow providers to 
	combine a patient�s genetic profile as well as his or her current 
	medications to identify the optimal drug therapy the first time. 


 


CEOCFO: Why patients as opposed to doctors 
	as a beginning? 


Mr. Owen: 
That is a great 
	question. It is actually for both. There is a tremendous amount of benefit 
	for the patients. There are more than four billion prescriptions that were 
	written in 2015, just within the United States alone. Scientific and 
	clinical evidence shows that less than half of those work as intended for 
	various reasons. How you metabolize drugs is one of the factors contributing 
	to that response. The OneOme pharmacogenomic test may identify which 
	inherited genetic variations you have to predict how you will or will not 
	metabolize a drug. While this doesn�t apply to all medications, it does 
	allow providers to get much more precise in our prescription writing which 
	benefits patients. By using pharmacogenomics, providers don�t have to take a 
	trial-and-error approach but can start to narrow down the process of finding 
	the most effective medications that an individual should be on. The cost of 
	adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to the health system is about one hundred and 
	thirty-five billion dollars per year. ADRs are the fourth-leading cause of 
	death in the United States. Pharmacogenomic testing can help to reduce the 
	number of ADRs and the associated costs to the health care system. So for 
	the providers, pharmacogenomics benefits them by reducing the overall cost 
	to the health system and also increases patient satisfaction.
 


CEOCFO: Do most patients still feel that 
	the doctor knows what he or she is doing and is taking this into account? 
	Are people generally realizing that may not be the case? 



Mr. Owen: 
With President 
	Obama�s 2015 State of the Union address about precision medicine and more 
	information available about personalized or precision medicine, I think 
	individuals are starting to realize that they can take more responsibility 
	in their healthcare. It�s not a lack of trust with their physicians, but 
	rather, after patients learn about pharmacogenomics and its benefits, they 
	often have a higher level of confidence the prescription is right for their 
	genetics. 

 


CEOCFO: Would you tell us how the OneOme 
	RightMed� works? 


Mr. Owen: We 
	have made every effort to make ordering our test very simple. It starts with 
	your healthcare provider ordering the OneOme RightMed pharmacogenomic test. 
	Once the order is placed, we send a simple cheek swab kit either to the 
	provider�s office where they can collect the patient�s sample or directly to 
	the patient�s home. The patient swabs the inside of his or her mouth for 
	about ten seconds on each side, replaces it back in the tube and sends the 
	kit back to our laboratory in a pre-labeled and pre-paid box. Within seven 
	to 10 days from when we receive the sample, the ordering provider would be 
	able to access the test results through our secure portal. This then allows 
	the provider to look at the medications in multiple different ways within 
	our portal, called RightMed Advisor, an interactive tool that allows users 
	to search and select medications based on current medical indications
	such as cardiovascular or psychiatric conditions
	or medications. RightMed Advisor provides clinical guidance based on 
	industry standards (CPIC, DWG), provides drug-gene interactions details, 
	checks for drug-drug interactions, displays drug alternatives, and 
	integrates with Surescripts for the previous 12 months of the patient�s 
	prescription history. The provider can save and print custom drug reports. A 
	PDF report is also available for downloading that shows the drugs binned 
	into three categories based on the patient�s genetic makeup. Some drugs can 
	be taken as directed (binned green) as the results indicate that the patient 
	is expected to have no issues metabolizing those medications. A patient may 
	also have red binned drugs, which should be prescribed with great caution 
	and yellow binned drugs, which should be prescribed with caution. These are 
	cases where the patient either metabolizes the medications too quickly or 
	too slowly which can result in no effect or potentially an adverse effect. 
	The report also breaks down the medications based on different indications 
	such as cardiovascular 
	disease, cancer, chronic pain, psychiatric conditions, etc., so the provider 
	can quickly identify which medications are safe to use for the indication 
	the patient has presented with. 

 


CEOCFO: Would the doctor or the patient 
	provide a list of the medications they are taking? 



Mr. Owen: 
Yes. We have two 
	different ways to do that. The doctor would likely collect the medications 
	that the individual is currently taking. However, in our ordering portal, 
	through a company called Surescripts, we have the ability to also 
	incorporate, if the patient consents, a list of all the medications that 
	have been prescribed to the individual throughout the last 12 months. That 
	can also be incorporated into their analysis and into the RightMed Advisor. 
	Therefore, the physician can go in and look at drug-to-drug interactions, so 
	if there is one medication that should not be taken with another medication 
	they can see that easily and potentially prescribe a recommended 
	alternative. 

 


CEOCFO: Is dosage important or would 
	it not matter if a drug is not right?


Mr. Owen: 
Yes, dosage does 
	matter. For example, if you metabolize a drug slower or faster than normal, 
	your physician may recommend a different dose of a particular medication. 
	The FDA, PharmGKB and CPIC (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation 
	Consortium) have some really good and reliable dosing guidelines that we 
	have incorporated into the test. If there is not a dosing guideline for a 
	particular medication, we do not provide dosing recommendations, because we 
	do not practice medicine; that is job of the provider as they have all of 
	the information about that patient�s health status and health history. We 
	just want to give them the absolute best information that they can get for 
	that individual when making a prescribing decision. 

 


CEOCFO: What is the science behind what 
	you are doing and what was the challenge in creating RightMed? 



Mr. Owen: 
The science is 
	bold. It is using your genetic profile from 22 genes that are involved in 
	the metabolism of many medications to accurately predict your response to 
	more than 340 medications. We feel as though the 22 genes that we have 
	selected have the most scientific and clinical pharmacogenomic evidence to 
	support inclusion in our test. Primarily, there are four organizations that 
	we look at to curate our medications: the FDA, PharmGKB,
	CPIC, and the Dutch pharmacogenomic 
	working group. There are four levels of scientific and clinical data used by 
	these organizations to assess the strength of data supporting the 
	association between the gene and the drug. Level 1 has published guidelines 
	from CPIC and FDA labels and level 2 has published clinical evidence of high 
	quality. Level 3 and 4 are not included in the OneOme test because we do not 
	believe that they have enough clinical evidence to be used in a diagnostic 
	test at this time. What we have done, from a OneOme perspective, is 
	established a rigorous, uniform procedure for reviewing, implementing and 
	retiring pharmacogenomic data into our proprietary database. Currently we 
	have curated more than 340 medications included in our database. We are 
	continually reviewing and updating our database as new information is 
	available. 

 


CEOCFO: Would you give an example of what 
	a doctor or patient might find and what action they should take? 



Mr. Owen: 
Using Clopidogrel 
	(brand name: Plavix), a platelet aggregation inhibitor, as an example: 
	Plavix is often prescribed for patients at risk for strokes, heart attacks, 
	or other heart problems. Thirty percent of the population receive no benefit 
	from the medication and have an increased risk of death resulting in an 
	FDA-label requiring genetic testing be performed before prescribing. 
	Warfarin is another example where you would want to ensure that you 
	understand your ability to metabolize Warfarin, before you started taking 
	it. 

 


CEOCFO: Let us take Warfarin for example. 
	Would it just not be as effective? What would be happening, depending on the 
	genotype? 


Mr. Owen: 
Warfarin, an 
	anti-coagulant that has been prescribed to more than 40 million Americans, 
	has a well-documented variability in response due to genetic variants. 
	Knowing your genotype can assist your healthcare provider in selecting the 
	optimal starting dosage. Certain variants in two genes can result in great 
	sensitivity to Warfarin, which could cause bleeding events or lack efficacy. 
	The OneOme pharmacogenomic test can simply and easily provide this 
	information at a low cost, potentially saving your life. 

 


CEOCFO: Are there other products on 
	the market competing with what you have developed?


Mr. Owen: 
There are a 
	number of pharmacogenomic companies and tests out there. However, many of 
	them are focused on only a one or a few indications, such as psychiatry. 
	What we set out to do is not focus on a few indications but instead provide 
	a comprehensive test that could provide valuable information to patients 
	throughout the course of their lifetime. After talking to many providers and 
	patients, we realize that an individual that may be treated for depression 
	or some type of a psychiatric event often times has other clinical 
	indications that they are addressing as well. Perhaps they could have 
	diabetes or they could have hypertension or something else. Therefore, we 
	cover 23 different clinical indications 
	(including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic pain, psychiatric 
	conditions, etc.) and to my knowledge there is not another 
	pharmacogenomic company out there that has both the depth and the breadth of 
	what we are covering to insure that you are looking at the whole individual, 
	verses just one clinical indication or area at a time. 

 


CEOCFO: What has changed at OneOme 
	since you became Chief Executive Officer? 


Mr. Owen: 
A number of 
	different things. We are a technology company as well as a diagnostic 
	company. I joined the organization in August of 2015 and since then we have 
	built out a CAP (College of American Pathologists) accredited CLIA (Clinical 
	Laboratory Improvement Amendments) lab to offer our 22 gene panel. We have 
	built out a number of different products that allow the provider to have the 
	information right at the bedside, which is very important to us. We have a 
	clinical decision support tool that is interactive and can be built into an 
	institution�s EMR (electronic medical record). We have built haplotype and 
	pharmacogenomic engines that allow us to look at, not just a drug to a 
	single gene interaction, but the interaction that multiple genes (or 
	enzymes) have on a drug�s metabolism. This is an important process because 
	there are many drugs that are metabolized by multiple genes. We utilize a 
	combinatorial analysis of a patient�s genes versus a single-gene analysis. 
	This approach tells us how variations in multiple genes interact and affect 
	the way a patient may respond to medications. We launched the product in 
	July of this past year and we have signed contracts with a number of large 
	health systems. We are in the process of getting them up and going and 
	ordering tests from us. We are also in the process of working with a number 
	of technology companies on building our decision support tool, so providers 
	can have easier access to the information through their electronic medical 
	records. 

 


CEOCFO: How are you able to get attention 
	in a healthcare system that is so overloaded with ideas? 



Mr. Owen: 
The receptivity, 
	both domestically and internationally, has been extremely strong! People are 
	very intrigued! One of the things that we chose to do after I joined the 
	organization last year was to go with an aggressive pricing model. We are 
	very passionate about keeping our costs low, because we want to be 
	accessible to all patients, regardless of whether they have healthcare 
	benefits or whether the test would be reimbursed or not. After much market 
	analysis, we decided that there would probably be a point where individuals 
	would pay out of the pocket if they had to in order to get this product. 
	Therefore, we came out with this product for $249 dollars. The receptivity 
	at the health system level has been quite strong, including at the senior 
	leadership level of these institutions. They understand it, because they 
	stay awake at night worrying about generating revenue and reducing costs, 
	and this product helps them achieve that goal. If you look into any of the 
	clinical literature about the health economics of pharmacogenomics there is 
	a tremendous story, particularly when the test is only $249 dollars. Doctors 
	routinely order one-time, one-use tests every day with costs that far exceed 
	the cost of our test. The great thing about our test, is that it provides 
	on-going value to the patient throughout the course of their lifetime and we 
	continually update our medication database so providers always have access 
	to the latest information when making a prescribing decision.

 


CEOCFO: Is it reimbursable or is that yet 
	to come? 


Mr. Owen: 
Yes, there are 
	specific genes that are reimbursable. It entirely ends up being about the 
	indications that the patient is being tested for and what the payer is 
	willing to reimburse for. Therefore, there is some pretty good data out 
	there that certain genes are reimbursed under the right clinical indication. 
	There are some genes like many of the cytochrome P450 genes that are often 
	tested for that are reimbursed quite well. We also know that from a 
	patient�s perspective he or she can use his or her
	Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to cover 
	these. 

 


CEOCFO: Are you funded for your next 
	steps? Are you looking for investments or partnerships? 



Mr. Owen: 
We are well 
	funded at this moment. We were co-founded between Invenshure, a health care 
	incubator Minneapolis-based company, and Mayo Clinic who both funded our 
	Series A financing. We are in the process of doing strategic raises for a 
	Series B. 

 


CEOCFO: Why is OneOme, LLC so important?



Mr. Owen: 
OneOme allows you 
	to take more control of your overall health. If you look at the statistics, 
	47.3 percent of the United States population has had one or more drugs 
	prescribed to them in the last thirty days. What I really find surprising is 
	that almost 21 percent of the United States population has had three 
	or more drugs prescribed to them in the last thirty days. I think the 
	important factor is that many, many individuals are affected by medications 
	throughout their lives and this test can help determine which medications 
	will work best for them. Plus, since your genes do not change throughout the 
	years you will be able to utilize the test results for different medications 
	throughout your lifetime. We have worked very, very hard to make this 
	affordable and as scientifically strong and clinically valid as possible for 
	patients and providers to make informed prescription decisions.




	 



	�The science is bold. It is using your genetic profile from 22 genes that 
	are involved in the metabolism of many medications to accurately predict 
	your response to more than 340 medications.�- Paul Owen

Pharmacogenomics — effectively integrated into patients’ everyday clinical care.







The OneOme RightMed® pharmacogenomic test

The OneOme RightMed test is a physician-ordered pharmacogenomic test that analyzes a patient’s DNA to determine how he or she may respond to certain medications. The analysis is provided to the physician in the form of a static and interactive report which clearly identifies which prescription drugs are — or aren’t — likely to work. This information can help providers make better prescription decisions, protect patients from adverse drug reactions and drug ineffectiveness, and reduce healthcare costs.

PROVIDER TOOLKIT PATIENT TOOLKIT






How people metabolize drugs 


Poor metabolizer (PM)
Metabolizes drugs much
more slowly than normal.  

Intermediate metabolizer (IM)
Metabolizes more
slowly than normal.  

Normal metabolizer (NM)
Metabolizes at a
normal rate.  

Ultrarapid metabolizer (UM)
Metabolizes more
quickly than normal.  


Pharmacogenomics, the study of how an individual's genes affect his or her response to medications, examines metabolization as a major factor contributing to an individual's response to drugs. Knowing how a patient will metabolize, or break down, many drugs will help physicians determine which drugs may work for their patients and reduce the trial-and-error approach.  
Depending on variations in a patient’s genes, that patient may break down a drug too slowly or too quickly. If the patient is a poor metabolizer of a given drug, he or she may be exposed to too much of it, which may result in an adverse drug reaction (ADR). If the patient is an ultrarapid metabolizer of a drug, he or she may not get enough to have any effect at all. Since genes don’t change with time, this patient will always be an ultrarapid metabolizer of that drug.  
Physicians can use this information to determine optimal drugs and doses for their patients.






Co-developed by Mayo Clinic, the RightMed test is:


COMPREHENSIVE: Rigorous, proprietary analysis that covers 22 GENES, 340+ COMMONLY PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS, and 28 CONDITIONS


INDIVIDUALIZED: Comprised of a patient’s genetic information, medication history, and drug-to-drug interactions


CREDIBLE: Co-developed and exclusively licensed with Mayo Clinic; characterized by SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL DATA


ACTIONABLE: Provides enhanced static reports and interactive decision support tools for easy readability and quick decision-making within the provider workflow


ACCESSIBLE: Affordable — offered at a low-cost, out-of-pocket expense.


CONVENIENT: Customized 24/7 logistics and customer support including expert medical, genetics, and pharmacology staff on call
  


for providers for pharmacists for patients






Testing for today and tomorrow 
OneOme brings clarity and insight into new and existing medications. OneOme’s RightMed PGx test may help with:


CURRENT PRESCRIPTIONS (REACTIVELY): Physicians can get insight into why a patient might be experiencing adverse effects or is not experiencing the expected benefits from a drug they’re already taking


PRESCRIPTION DECISIONS (PROACTIVELY): Before prescribing a new medication, physicians can leverage a patient’s PGx profile to make more informed decisions



Because DNA does not change with time, the OneOme RightMed PGx test may provide years of more accurate decision-making.







 OneOme's process 

OneOme’s RightMed pharmacogenomic test analyzes a patient’s genetic information through our curated clinical PGx knowledgebase to provide information on the individual patient’s PGx profile. The actionable results are delivered to the provider through a variety of decision support tools.

How your genes impact your
response to medications
 
Your genetic makeup can have a major influence on how you process drugs. In fact, genetic factors can account for up to 95% of how you respond to medications.1 
Depending on your genes, your body may break down a drug too slowly or too quickly, which may result in potential side effects, or no effect at all.  
Getting a pharmacogenomic test may help your physician identify effective medications for you.

Helping optimize patient care.







Put pharmacogenomics to work
Pharmacists are uniquely qualified to help patients and healthcare teams utilize pharmacogenomics (PGx) by introducing and providing the OneOme RightMed® test. Covering 340+ DRUGS and 28 MEDICAL CONDITIONS, the test can help pharmacists guide optimal drug selection and dosing, much like recommending a dosing adjustment based on drug interaction or renal dysfunction. Pharmacists’ distinct education, skills, and expanding role in healthcare position them to champion processes for pharmacogenomic testing and interpretation of results – and with it, a new level of care.

Era of personalized medicine 
Trial-and-error as a prescription method can cause adverse drug reactions or inadequate patient response. This often can lead to therapeutic failures before the right drug and dosage are found.  
The approach to care is changing. Pharmacists are optimizing the paradigm of patient care by incorporating genomics into clinical decision making. This proactive approach advances pharmacy by improving patient care and personalizing drug therapies.
