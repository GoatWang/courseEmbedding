Inside Insteel





Company Overview
Insteel Industries is the nation's largest manufacturer of steel
wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
We manufacture and market prestressed concrete strand and welded
wire reinforcement, including engineered structural mesh, concrete
pipe reinforcement, and standard welded wire reinforcement. Our
products are primarily sold to manufacturers of concrete products
that are used in nonresidential construction. We estimate that
approximately 85% of our sales are related to nonresidential

Company History
Leadership
Mission and Values



World-Class Manufacturer
Our ten world-class manufacturing facilities employ the latest
advancements in equipment technology, allowing us to minimize
changeover times and service our customers in a cost-effective
manner that meets their requirements. Given the highly competitive
nature of our business, we are intensely focused on operating as
the low cost producer and minimizing the costs associated with
converting hot-rolled steel wire rod, our primary raw material,
into finished product. Considering the substantial investments we
have made in our facilities and our advanced manufacturing
practices, we believe that our unit conversion costs compare
favorably with any of our competitors - domestic or offshore.
Our facilities are strategically located in close proximity to
our customers and suppliers, enhancing our customer service
capabilities and minimizing our costs for outbound and inbound
freight.
Underlying our manufacturing activities is a sophisticated
information systems infrastructure that provides us with a broad
range of performance metrics and decision-support tools to
continually monitor and fine tune our processes.

Our business strategy is focused on:  (1) achieving

cost producer; and (3) pursuing growth opportunities in our core
businesses that further our penetration of current markets served
or expand our geographic footprint. Headquartered in Mount Airy,
North Carolina, we operate ten manufacturing facilities that are
located in the U.S. in close proximity to our customers. Our growth
initiatives are focused on organic opportunities as well as
acquisitions in existing or related markets that leverage our
infrastructure and core competencies in the manufacture and
marketing of concrete reinforcing products.
Considering our technologically advanced manufacturing
facilities, low cost production capabilities, strong market
positions, sophisticated information systems and broad product
offering and geographic reach, we believe that we are

MOUNT AIRY, N.C., July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Insteel Industries, Inc. (NasdaqGS: IIIN) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended July 1, 2017. 
Third Quarter 2017 Results
Net earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased to $6.9 million, or $0.36 per share, from $13.5 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Insteel's results were unfavorably impacted by lower shipment and production volumes together with narrower spreads between selling prices and raw material costs relative to the prior year quarter.
Net sales decreased 16.2% to $96.9 million from $115.6 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting a 20.8% decrease in shipments and a 5.9% increase in average selling prices. Shipments decreased 7.5% sequentially from the second quarter of fiscal 2017 while average selling prices increased 3.5%. Shipments for the quarter were adversely affected by the excessive rainfall in many regions of the country, a reduction in new project activity and competitive pricing pressures. Gross margin narrowed 660 basis points to 17.2% from 23.8% due to the reductions in shipments and spreads, and higher manufacturing costs on the lower production volume. 
Cash flow from operations decreased to $4.5 million from $21.9 million in the prior year quarter primarily due to the relative changes in net working capital and the decrease in earnings. Net working capital used $5.8 million of cash while providing $6.3 million in the prior year quarter. 
Nine Month 2017 Results
Net earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 decreased to $18.7 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, from $27.4 million, or $1.44 per diluted share in the same period a year ago. Net sales decreased 7.4% to $292.0 million from $315.4 million in the prior year period, reflecting a 7.8% decrease in shipments and a 0.4% increase in average selling prices. Gross margin narrowed 340 basis points to 16.4% from 19.8% due to lower spreads and shipments, and higher manufacturing costs on lower production volume. 
Cash flow from operations decreased to $21.6 million from $45.7 million in the prior year period primarily due to the relative changes in net working capital and the decrease in earnings. Net working capital used $7.1 million of cash while providing $7.4 million in the prior year period. 
Capital Allocation and Liquidity
Capital expenditures for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 increased to $16.9 million from $9.1 million in the prior year period. Capital outlays for fiscal 2017 are expected to total up to $25.0 million largely related to the expansion of the Houston, Texas prestressed concrete strand ("PC strand") facility, additional investments in engineered structural mesh ("ESM") manufacturing capabilities and further upgrades of production technology and information systems.  
During the first nine months of fiscal 2017, Insteel returned $25.4 million of capital to shareholders through the payment of a special cash dividend of $1.25 per share and three regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.03 per share. Insteel ended the quarter debt-free with $37.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, and no borrowings outstanding on its $100.0 million revolving credit facility. 
Outlook
"As we move into the fourth fiscal quarter, the leading indicators for nonresidential construction remain positive and our customers are optimistic that business conditions will improve over the remainder of the year," commented H.O. Woltz III, Insteel's president and CEO. "We believe the recent increases in infrastructure funding that have been authorized at the state and local level will begin to favorably impact demand for our products later in the year. We also expect improved manufacturing costs driven by higher operating volumes together with our process improvement initiatives and the recent upgrading and expansion of our Houston PC strand facility."
Conference Call
Insteel will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. ET today to discuss its third quarter financial results. A live webcast of this call can be accessed on Insteel's website at http://investor.insteel.com/events.cfm and will be archived for replay until the next quarterly conference call.
