We can't believe it has been a year.  We can still hear his laugh, see his smile and remember so many good times. Brian made such an impression on our kids as well as Dave and I.  We miss him dearly.  He fought his battle with such grace.  We will always remember and will never forget... Brian Wildman.  Faith, Family and Friends!  What an inspiration.  The Bach Family

I worked with Brian at UPS for a good 3-5 years in the 1990s and I think maybe one of his younger brothers at RPS for a summer.  I'm not sure if I worked with him while he was married or if he'd moved on by then but reading his obituary about how his family and dedication to them doesn't surprise me. He was a stand up guy for even a part-time supervisor. I've got two kids of my own and I was born only 12 days earlier than Brian so this hits a little close to home even after not having heard the name Wildman for maybe 15 years. My condolences to his family and current co-workers at Gorton Foods.

Nothing but great memories of Brain; so sorry for your loss.  Brian was a positive in a world of negative.  He once talked me into going for a ride in his rail dune buggy one day at a camp ground party; I was wearing white and he said I wouldn't get that dirty.. When the ride was over I was covered in mud and a little upset.  When I got out of the rail; I stood there pointing at mud covered self, so he asked me to turn around and pointed out the fact that I was only half dirty and to quit crying a drink a beer...  I'm very happy to have met and spent time with Brian.  Condolences, and I did enjoy the buggy ride..

I'm going to miss Brian, I worked with him for 6yrs, he always kept me in a positive spirit, even though he was going through his fight, Brian was a strong man, and had a positive affect on everyone, I remember when he first came to work after he went through his first round with cancer, I saw him getting out of his car, when I was comming through the truck wash, I jumped out of the truck, and told him I wanted to hug him, because I was so happy to see him, and like Brian, he said, I'll take it!  I hugged him, and he went on down to work. 
I just thought of that, because we worked so many days after that together, I really enjoyed the time we spent together as freinds.
I'm really sorry for your loss!

Marti, Brett & Chad,
What I remember the most is Brian would come home from work, jump out of his vehicle, and within five minutes he was playing catch with one or both of the boys.  He never wasted a single minute.  You could see it on his face how much he loved spending quality time with you.  He was a very special person and will be greatly missed.  We know your faith will give you the strength you need through this journey.  If you ever need anything, please know we are here.  You are in our thoughts and prayers.

To a Wonderful Family,  This is such a sad time for so many, I cannot imagine how many lives Brian, Marti, Brett, Chad, and Grandparents have touched through his short life here! Every time I looked at Brian I could only think of my son-in-law, Mark Theile, and prayed to God not to take him from his family this soon. We always pray for that miracle and then we have to accept WHY? You have a beautiful family & wonderful friends, thats what keeps you going even though you have a heavy heart! To think Brian and Mark both went to W/C., loved sports, coached their kids and now both sons are playing together on the W/C football team brings tears to my eyes! Marti you are a special mom with a beautiful smile and God will give you the strength to go on just like my daughter, Becky, she also makes me very proud! I guess time only helps to accept what we can't change and knowing how much Brian loved all of you!!  God Bless You All!!  Love. hugs, and prayers,  Grandma Mary Milanowski

He was a hard worker and took pride in the way he did his job. Brian was an encouragement to me when he found out that I had some medical issues of my own. He was a good man who knew Jesus

I am so grateful for our friendship that started 8 years ago when Chad, Matt and Jake were in Kindergarten. The boys immediately were drawn together because of their similar fun-loving personalities. Our friendship grew quickly too. You both had a special way of supporting me professionally, as the boys' teacher as well as including me in the Assumption Family of Friends. You had a unique way of respecting that fine line. My initial plans were to only teach for a few years at ABVM but after you included me as part of the Assumption Family, I knew I wanted to stay permanently. I can't thank you enough for guiding me down a path that has been rewarding professionally and personally. I will always be grateful for our friendship.

My prayers are with Brian's family at this very difficult time.  I only wish that we had crossed paths more in life after our 4 years together at West Catholic.  I'll always remember one of those things that we would probably never admit to our kids...taking my Dad's Vette for a bit of a night 'out on the town'.  Nothing wild, except that it was before I officially had my license.  Brian, Steve Crystan and myself piled into a 2 seater Vette and we get pulled over.  'Luckily' Brian's Dad was with the GR Police and came to gather us up.  Still remember Brian's Dad driving me home in the car saying, "Ya know, I've always wanted to drive a Corvette, but, not this way!"
One of the more memorable things among 4 years of high school fun.  Wish you all the best during these tough days and glad I was able to share a small part of Brian's life so many years ago.  Rest in peace my friend.

Brian touched my life in a simple yet unforgettable way.  Gary and I laughed with Brian and Marti just sitting around a kitchen table (theirs or ours) or a bon fire anytime we were together.  Positive energy was Brian's gift and he generously shared it with others.  My life is better because of my 13-year friendship Brian Wildman; I only wish it could be longer.  You will be missed but not forgotten!  
Marti, Brett and Chad, I hold you in my heart and will keep you in my prayers.  You were Brian's life.  By simply being you and carrying on you will keep Brian's spirit alive!  I know you all will make him proud.  
I love you guys.  I am here for you.

Funeral Mass



















    	Life Stories
	

I was never a close friend of Brian but between softball and poker games I will never forget the double aces in one poker hand that Brian never let me forget for more than 20 years. He is a good man and will be missed.
