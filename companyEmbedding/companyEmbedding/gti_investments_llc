GTI Group LLC Key Developments

Sandhar Technologies And Quick Heal Technologies Reportedly Mulls IPO
Sep 28 15
Sandhar Technologies Limited and Quick Heal Technologies (P) Ltd. are reportedly seeking IPO. Quick Heal Technologies reportedly plans to raise INR 10 billion to INR 12 billion through an initial public offer. Quick Heal has reportedly hired three investment banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) as underwriters for the issue, which is expected to hit the market in the third quarter, said sources with direct knowledge of the matter. It has also mandated Jefferies LLC and ICICI Bank Ltd. (NSEI:ICICIBANK) as lead managers for the issue. The IPO could value the company, which makes anti-virus software for retail and enterprise customers, at around INR 40 million, the sources said. Quick Heal's board is due to meet later this week to finalise the exact percentage of equity dilution, one of the sources said. "We have just kick started the process and will wait for the right market conditions to launch it," the person said. "Probably by third quarter, we expect markets to be a bit more stable." Sandhar Technologies Limited is also planning to raise INR 4 billion to INR 5 billion through the primary market. Quick Heal, JPMorgan, ICICI Securities and Jefferies declined to comment.
