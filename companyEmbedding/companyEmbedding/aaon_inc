        heating. AAON geothermal heat pumps are engineered for high efficiency, application 
        flexibility and serviceability. 









AAON Precision Air Systems (1.4 MB)
Technology rooms have unique environmental requirements and necessitate 
        cooling systems that match those requirements. Comfort cooling systems are 
        appropriate for “comfort” environments – facilities that are occupied by people 
        or that house routine equipment and supplies. AAON precision air conditioning 
        systems provide the efficiency, reliability and flexibility to meet the increasing 
        demands for heat rejection, humidity control, filtration, and other requirements 
        of technology rooms and other high availability computer facilities. 









AAONAIRE Energy Recovery Systems (6.0 MB)
AAONAIRE energy recovery systems provide energy savings by recycling energy. 
        AAONAIRE systems also enhance indoor air quality by allowing larger amounts of 
        outside air to be provided to the space and through improved humidity control. 
        AAONAIRE systems save money through both an initial HVAC equipment reduction 
        and ongoing lifecycle operating savings. For much of the country, the payback 
        for the AAONAIRE system is less than one year.









Energy Savings with AAON Rigid Polyurethane Foam (1.8 MB)
Rigid polyurethane foam insulated panels offer superior performance 
        compared to fiberglass insulated HVAC panels. When compared to fiberglass-insulated 
        panels, rigid polyurethane foam panels offer more than twice the resistance to heat 
        transfer; directly preventing the loss of heating and cooling dollars through the 
        cabinet. The mechanical strength and rigidity of foam insulated equipment is 
        significantly improved; leading to tighter door seals and less “out of square” unit 
        installations. A thermal break is provided in every panel so that no metal in the 
        airstream is in contact with metal exposed to ambient conditions; the thermal break 
        virtually eliminates cabinet condensation during the cooling season.









Energy and Economics Analysis Program (1.3 MB)
The AAON Energy and Economics Analysis Program (AAON EEAP) is a tool for AAON 
        sales representatives, consulting engineers, design build contractors, building owners, 
        and other professionals involved in the design and analysis of commercial buildings 
        to show the energy and economic benefits of innovative and high performance HVAC 
        technology. Using AAON EEAP allows optimization of the design or renovation of a 
        building and its mechanical systems by comparing alternative designs.









AAON Corrosion Resistant Paint Test Report (1.3 MB)
Shows the corrosion resistance of the standard paint applied to the exterior of 
        AAON units. The paint finish is shown to be capable of withstanding at least 2,500 hours,
		with no visible corrosion effects, when tested in a salt spray and fog atmosphere in 
		accordance with ASTM B 117-95 test procedure. Typically the industry acceptability is 500
		to 1,000 hours. Optional exterior and interior application of the corrosion resistant 
		paint is also available.









Value in the Air: Why Direct Drive Backward Curved Plenum Fans?
Detailed paper on the characteristics and benefits of different types of HVAC 
        fans. Includes an introduction to fans and sections on fan selection, fan operating 
        characteristics, fan system effects, fan efficiency, fan control schemes, and how 
        fans relate to an HVAC system’s efficiency. 









Modulating Temperature and Humidity Control (4.9 MB)
Discusses the benefits associated with the modulating capacity scroll compressor 
        and the modulating humidity control options. Benefits include energy savings, extended 
        compressor operating life and improved temperature and humidity control, when compared 
        to on/off systems. A comparison of the power usage of hot gas bypass and the modulating 
        capacity scroll compressor is shown. Also includes a section on applications of 
        modulating temperature and humidity control. 









AAONDry (856 KB)
Water evaporated into the air of an enclosed pool room makes swimmers uncomfortable, 
        fogs windows, and condenses on and within walls causing structural damage. AAON offers 
        complete packaged dehumidification systems from 12 lbw/hr to 953 lbw/hr. These systems 
        provide a comfortable environment, minimize rapid deterioration of walls due to 
        condensation, and control humidity levels which drastically increases swimmer and 
        spectator comfort.









Digital Precise Air Control (D-PAC™) (748 KB)
Indoor environmental quality, occupant comfort and energy use are important criteria 
        when selecting an HVAC system design. AAON offers equipment utilizing a digital scroll 
        compressor with load matching temperature and humidity control with the highest energy 
        efficiency. The digital scroll compressor varies the volume of refrigerant that flows 
        through the cooling system allowing the compressor to unload down to 10% capacity while 
        controlling temperature to +/- 1°F and +/-5% RH and offering part load efficiencies up 
        to 20% greater than systems utilizing an on/off compressor.









Evaporative-Cooled Condenser (536 KB)
In the evaporative-cooled condensing process, water is sprayed over the condenser 
        coil as air passes across the coil to evaporate the spray and cool the refrigerant 
        tubes toward the ambient wet bulb temperature. The lower wet bulb condensing temperature 
        means that the evaporative-cooled condenser can reject more heat than an air-cooled 
        condenser, while requiring less compressor work and consuming less energy. As a result, 
        evaporative-cooled condensers can be 20% to 40% more efficient than a comparable 
        air-cooled condenser.

TULSA, Okla., July  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AAON, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAON) was recognized for excellence in product design in the 14th annual Dealer Design Awards Program sponsored by The Air Conditioning Heating & Refrigeration Newsmagazine. An independent panel of contractors acted as judges in the contest that had 81 entries. The company's WH Series was the Gold Award Winner in the Light Commercial category and the company's V3 Series was the Silver Award Winner in the Commercial Equipment category. The ACHR Newsis the leading trade magazine in the heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and refrigeration industries.

News Publisher Mike Murphy stated, "These awards give us a unique opportunity to recognize the outstanding research and development efforts that go into many of the products serving the HVACR industry and the awards issue gives our readers an opportunity to read about innovative installation and service solutions."
AAON WH Series Horizontal Configuration Small Packaged Water-Source Heat Pumps (1/2-5 tons) incorporate state-of-the-art manufacturing processes with the latest HVAC design technical knowledge to create a water-source heat pump with innovative design, performance, and serviceability. WH Series water-source heat pumps are available with replacement ready size to match conventional water-source heat pump products. Standard efficiencies of the WH Series significantly exceed ASHRAE standards. WH Series units consist of a light-weight all-aluminum cabinet construction with closed-cell neoprene foam rubber insulation for a fiber-free airstream. WH Series units include induction brazed copper piping and stainless steel drain pans. Energy saving features include single stage or two-step compressors, Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) or high efficiency Electronically Commutated Motor (ECM) direct drive supply fan, and aluminum microchannel air coil with a large face area for improved efficiency, reduced air pressure drop, reduced fan horsepower, reduced refrigerant charge and reduced unit weight. Premium options include low sound package to reduce fan and compressor sound, four-inch high efficiency filtration (up to MERV 14), hot gas reheat dehumidification, and energy saving factory installed waterside economizer with internal piping. WH Series units come with the peace-of-mind of a standard five-year parts warranty.
AAON V3 Series Energy Recovery Wheel Vertical Air Handling Units provide energy efficient 100% outside air ventilation, while being easy to install because of a compact footprint and easy to maintain because of large service access. Available from 450 to 10,000 cfm with overlapping cabinet sizes for application flexibility, the high performance V3 Series with energy recovery wheel includes high efficiency variable speed ECM driven direct drive backward curved plenum supply and exhaust fans, and double wall rigid polyurethane foam injected panel construction with lockable hinged service access doors.
"The recognition of the AAON WH Series and V3 Series in the 2017 Dealer Design Awards highlights the great work of our employees and demonstrates our continuing commitment to designing and engineering innovative and high value HVAC equipment," said Norm Asbjornson, CEO of AAON.
Winning entries in the Dealer Design Awards are featured in the July 24th, 2017 issue of The ACHR News, which is distributed nationally to over 33,000 HVACR contractors, wholesalers, and other industry professionals. For more information and further coverage, visit www.achrnews.com.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
