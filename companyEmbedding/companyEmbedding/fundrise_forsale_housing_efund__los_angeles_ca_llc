“You are treating me like I am your only customer.”

Posted on April 21, 2017 | Leave a comment


“Fast turns, spot-on execution and absolute cost transparency” has redefined Vintage, helping us to be a top three solution in North America.
Our work is highlighted every Monday in our IPOs and Transactions of the Week blog and email.  Importantly, our week’s success is further highlighted (and celebrated) by the appreciative notes our operations people receive each day from our clients.

We can’t not share the good news (anonymized for privacy). Sales can offer you full named references. Here is just a handful of our client services “Kudos” for this week.
.


Just received the printed version of the proxy today.  I couldn’t be happier with the result.  Our GC took out the first proxy statement that he was responsible for when he joined here about 15 years ago and compared it with the 2017 one and he’s just really blown away.  
Thanks again to you all.  Greatly appreciated.
.



Thanks everyone!  This is the first time I believe we ever filed on the last day. Unnerving, but you all made it happen. Congrats! .
.



Thank you all for all for everything!  This has been the easiest filing of our annual documents!
.



Thank you for all your hard work in getting this done for us!
It’s been a pleasure. I’m really happy with how the book came out and I’m really grateful for the continuous support and expertise you provided.  You were always there and willing to work out the details for us. You made this really easy for me.
.



A big thank you to you and your team for all of your help with the 10-K.
We’ve been very busy the last few months and we wouldn’t have been able to file on time if it wasn’t for your help. As always, it’s a pleasure working with you all.
.



Great job, by the way.  Thank you all again for making this process go as smoothly as possible.
.



You da Man!  Vintage rocks. Thanks for all you do for us.

.
Our rebrand was not just a logo change – it was a systemic and cultural reform throughout our operations.

Experts discuss “Extraordinary Acquirers” for consistently great M&A

Posted on April 14, 2017 | Leave a comment



What makes for an “extraordinary” acquirer? What explains the inconsistent returns of private equity funds? Four dealmakers weigh in on the results of M&A research.
Vintage question > A study in the Journal of Financial Economics titles “Extraordinary Acquirers” indicated that certain companies have consistently great M&A outcomes, whereas it is more difficult to identify specific aspects of deals that make them great. The study argues that qualities of these companies, such as organizational knowledge and integration practices, account for these exceptional M&A returns. What do you think, are there more “extraordinary acquirers” than there are “extraordinary deals”?
Rob Goldstein > My general view is there are more extraordinary acquirers than there are extraordinary deals. I do both public M&A and private equity, and my experience over the last 21 years is that the best-prepared acquirers in both arenas are the most likely to have success. I’ve been very impressed by certain clients who are extraordinarily diligent when it comes to learning about and understanding an industry, a product line, and a geographic sector before they even start zeroing in on specific targets.
At the same time, I don’t think there are hard and fast rules to this. I have seen plenty of acquirers who were not “extraordinary” or who weren’t the most prepared but got fortunate with finding a terrific asset and made a great return. There are also plenty of great acquirers out there who have bought lemons. Nobody bats 1.000. And it’s the same for the best private equity firms – I’ve represented some very smart private equity clients, and even they don’t bat 1.000.
As far as what makes an “extraordinary acquirer,” I think there can be overwhelming advantages to having a large organization in which you can draw upon the resources of industry experts and financial experts who bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table. When you are better prepared, know the market better, know what your objectives are, and in most cases adhere to rigid pricing characteristics, these acquirers are more likely to be successful than those who aren’t as disciplined and diligent. I have one client I worked with that had an incredible stable of talent to analyze all angles of a deal, and if they didn’t have some capability in-house, they would not hesitate to go to a market leader in the industry and get further information to validate their investment thesis.

One other thing I’ll mention is that success can depend on an acquirer’s ability to learn about complex industries – or stay out of them altogether. Healthcare is a major focus for us at McDermott Will & Emery, as well as a very active market generally for both strategics and private equity. And healthcare is a sector where you really have to know what you’re doing to succeed in M&A. I’ve had clients who were not experienced in the space who I think have been hesitant to get into it because it requires a tremendous amount of industry knowledge. On the flip side, I’ve seen a number of instances where people who are heavily into the healthcare market and understand the industry, the trends, and the regulatory side of things may well be willing to pay a higher multiple than they otherwise would because of their specialized knowledge.
Jim Rosener > As a legal advisor, my role pretty much ends at the closing of a deal, but I think the differentiator between a good transaction and a bad transaction starts the day after it closes. So in that way, I would say that post-closing execution is crucial. At private equity funds, that means having clear integration plans, cost control strategies, and a great understanding of what the next steps are on both standalone and tuck-in acquisitions. They need to have a really good understanding of all of the things that make a particular company run well.
That said, you have to buy something with reasonably good bones, such that you know you can do the work afterwards to make it great. And that’s why you need strong evaluation of a transaction, good modeling, and to some degree a negotiation of the allocation of risks that is done in creating the purchase agreement. These elements determine in part whether the deal you’ve done has the potential to be extraordinary. So there’s obviously a lot of work that goes into the evaluation of a target and the due diligence regarding a target. But ultimately, I think the ability to turn a target into a great acquisition depends most on the post-closing execution.

Michael Meyers > Truly extraordinary transactions are ultimately created by extraordinary acquirers in the post-transaction, and are further enhanced through cross-selling synergies of a product, process or service. I believe that the combination of proactive and visionary leadership in the C-suite, merged with the experience and expertise from different functional areas within a company, creates potent opportunities and successful transaction results. I’d also say that while financial metrics and process are important, I believe that highly skilled BD professionals can match these variables with gap analysis with respect to their process and integration skills. Experienced and thoughtful business development leadership considers organizational variables as a key component of their due diligence process, which increases the probability that integration will result in the anticipated accretion or exceed it.
One confounding variable relates to the legal limitations that are often present with respect to integration activities. As a result of this factor, the potential for integration needs to be well understood in advance. Ultimately, the vital integration drivers need to be identified and considered by the acquirer’s senior leadership and business development team. And carrying out integration in a multi-disciplinary way – across various functional areas of an organization — is critical. It entails a great deal more than a visionary CEO with a mandate from the top down.

eFunds™ | Fundrise



















Urban Housing Development eFunds™
Now, you can invest directly into building new homes for the next generation of American homeowners.




What is an eFund?



								Fundrise eFunds are a new tax-efficient alternative investment that gives everyday investors direct
								access to a professionally managed, diversified portfolio of for-sale housing in core US cities.
							

















SALE




For-sale housing

									Invest in single-family home
									building in core US cities
								











Diversified

									Each eFund intends to invest
									in many individual assets
								





















Passive growth

									Target long-term growth
									through appreciation
								













Direct-to-investor

									Save up to 40% on costs
									via our technology model
								











								Home ownership is important to millenials,
								but they want to live in the city.
							













75%




										believe home ownership
										is an important long-term goal
									







51%




										more likely to live in cities
										than other age groups
									


Source: Demand Institute; January 2015













The opportunity of a generation
The demand for reasonably priced new homes in cities is undeniable, and now you can invest in it.
Within the top US urban centers, there is endemic undersupply of housing which is priced within reach of millenial homebuyers. The eFunds intend to capitalize on the key demographic trends that have created pent up demand for affordable for-sale housing, including education and cultural shifts, a strong preference for a walkable, urban lifestyle, and an increasingly attractive buy versus rent cost analysis.
As Millennials shift from renting to home buying in the coming years, the eFunds aim to meet demand for attached homes and condos in high-growth neighborhoods in these core metro areas.
Graphic source: Bloomberg calculations using data from US Census Bureau, Zillow Group Inc, Bankrate.com






How does the investment work?



								Each eFund intends to invest in the acquisition of properties for the development and sale of single-family 
								homes. You earn potential returns based on any profits from the sale of the completed homes,
								and you may receive periodic cash distributions as the properties are sold.
							










1. Buy
We acquire property for the development and sale of homes in high-growth neighborhoods of major cities – places where young people actually want to live.









2. Develop
We build these homes to fit the needs of first-time, move-up, and active adult homebuyers — an underserved demographic in most urban areas.









3. Sell
Once the homes are complete, we leverage our national investor network to source interested homebuyers, and your return comes from any profits upon sale.










Quick facts



Minimum investment
$1,000


Distributions
Periodic, upon sale of assets


Time horizon
Approximately 5 years

Fees

Fundrise Portfolio
“Fundrise Portfolio” is the hypothetical projected return of a portfolio of commercial real estate, based the weighted average projected annual return of (a) the Fundrise Growth eREIT, for Rise Companies Corp. sponsored appreciation-focused investment products (such as joint-venture equity), based on the analysis included in the the Growth eREIT Performance Analysis, and (b) the Fundrise Income eREIT, for Rise Companies Corp. sponsored income-focused investment products (such as senior loans), based on (i) the analysis included in the Income eREIT Performance Analysis, (ii) discounted by approximately 20 – 30% to take into account potential default risks over the long-term. Accordingly, the projected annual returns under such methodology is approximately 11.95% and 8.00% for Rise sponsored appreciation focused investments and income focused investments, respectively, inclusive of appreciation and dividend reinvestment, and net of fees.
Traditional Portfolio
“Traditional Portfolio” is the hypothetical projected return of a portfolio of public equities (stocks), based on the California Public Employees Retirement System’s average annual return on public equities over the 20-year period from 1996 to 2016, which was 8.20%, inclusive of appreciation and dividend reinvestment, and net of fees.

Fundrise Files Reg A+: “For Sale Housing eFUND”, New Real Estate Investment Offer
 Tweet2 Share8 Share14 +15 Reddit Pin EmailShares 29

April 5, 2017 @ 4:38 pm By JD Alois 



Fundrise is adding a new investment vehicle to its growing list of opportunities for smaller investors. This time the real estate marketplace has filed a Form 1-A with the SEC for a “Fundrise For-Sale Housing eFUND”.
Fundrise started as a pure real-estate crowdfunding platform offering investors the chance to invest in both small and larger single properties. After rethinking their mission, Fundrise took the updated “Reg A+” exemption and launched a series of “eREITs”. These unlisted funds first focused on income or capital gains and then Fundrise created a series of geographically focused eREITs.  Now Fundrise is looking to develop single family attached and detached homes, including condos in southern California.
As the filing explains:
“In what we believe will be an innovative approach to combining real estate investment opportunities with home buying opportunities, we will primarily target the marketing of this offering and our For-Sale Housing to potential “homebuyer investors” (“HBIs”) in the Los Angeles, CA MSA, giving our homebuyer investors (HBIs) certain incentives, such as first-access or first-right to purchase homes as determined by our Manager, before they are widely marketed and giving us the opportunity to create a built-in market of prospective purchasers for our For-Sale Housing. For purposes of this Offering Circular, a “homebuyer investor”(or “HBI”) refers to an investor on the Fundrise Platform that ultimately buys For-Sale Housing from us.”
As with their other Reg A+ filings, Fundrise is seeking a maximum amount of $50 million (the legal limit).
For investors, the objective is to pay distributions from cash flow from operations as a partnership which means different taxation for investors (IE you receive a K-1)
Fundrise believes there is significant opportunity in the Millennial generation as they move on and move out to purchase their own homes. Fundrise says that according to the Demand Institute,, Millennials will pour $1.6 trillion into new home purchases, compared with $600 billion on rent. Fundrise wants to capitalize on that latent demand. They see an opportunity to target specific metropolitan areas where there is a supply/demand imbalance.
“Fundrise eFUNDs can use online tools to source interested homebuyers and help the homebuyer navigate a complicated and competitive process to purchase a home. The eFUND, specializing in for-sale housing in a geographic region, allows a homebuyer investor (HBI) to gain valuable market and real estate knowledge about their future home options while also allowing them to capitalize on a trend that they are actively participating in.”
Fundrise is one of the most successful real estate crowdfunding platforms in the US. Fundrise trailblazed crowdfunding before crowdfunding was a widely disseminated process to sell securities. The eFUND offer is not yet live on the Fundrise platform but you can expect an announcement fairly soon.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
