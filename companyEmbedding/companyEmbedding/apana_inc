Large retailer cuts water use by  22%

Read the Fortune article chronicling how APANA saved this retailer millions of gallons of water.

View Article




Multi-million dollar insurance claim avoided.

A multi-million dollar insurance claim was avoided when APANA discovered a leak flowing down a wall into stored inventory and instantly notified staff.





Food service operation fix eliminates 650,000+ gallon waste event.

Immediately upon installation, APANA identified a malfunctioning pressure release valve that had been wasting 1,800 gallons of hot water per day for over a year. In reducing hot water waste, electricity bills were also cut.





Cooling tower avoids 345,000 gallon waste event.

APANA pinpointed a performance issue after a service provider performed maintenance on a cooling tower. Left undetected, it would have resulted in a 30-day, 345,000-gallon waste event.





Irrigation system failure caught before expensive damage caused.

APANA identified a hidden mechanical failure in the underground irrigation system. Left undiscovered and unfixed, the leak would have severely damaged pavement and possibly caused a parking lot to collapse.





Major malfunctions identified in water softener system.

Two malfunctions were detected in a water softener system. In addition to using 40 percent more water than required, the system wasn’t rinsing properly due to a mechanical failure. APANA instantly alerted staff.





Winery goes beyond dashboards to achieve Net Positive 2030 goals

Monthly analysis of water use meant waste was hard to spot and any reparative action was delayed by 30 days, sometimes longer. Using APANA, mechanical failure and operational misuse were identified instantly with instructions on how to correct.





5-star hotel and spa rethinks water after costly event

A bathtub left running in a hotel room caused water damage. A faulty valve in the spa went undiscovered for months. With APANA, the hotel is notified as these types of waste events occur, and they receive guidance for what to do.





Large grocery halves  water waste.

Permitted water use was 8,000 gallons a day, but water bills showed more than 12,000 gallons. APANA instantly identified a range of issues to eliminate waste. After these were fixed, new ones appeared. Again, using APANA, staff quickly reacted and ended up cutting their water waste in half.

our journey

Our Story

As corporate water use and wastewater treatment specialists, our journey began when helping a client solve an urgent compliance problem. They were overwhelmed by excessive water flow and contamination. Our initial task was to expand their wastewater treatment plant. Almost immediately we realized problems were not outside in the treatment plant; they were inside the building.
If we could eliminate our client’s unnecessary water use and contamination at the source, their compliance issues would disappear. Not only would this be better for the environment, our client would avoid spending millions on building and running new treatment plants. A big idea was born.
Tests at several locations proved the idea could work. Our client reduced their water use by more than 20%. Savings exceeded the cost of keeping waste in check.
APANA has been on a mission to eliminate water waste in the built environment ever since.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
