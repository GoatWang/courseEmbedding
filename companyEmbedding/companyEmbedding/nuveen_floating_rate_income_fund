BEST FIXED-INCOME FUNDS
Fixed income is a type of investing or budgeting style for which real return rates or periodic income is received at regular intervals at reasonably predictable levels. Fixed-income budgeters and investors are often one and the same - typically retired individuals who rely on their investments to provide a regular, stable income stream.  Individuals who live on set amounts of periodically paid income face the risk that inflation will erode their spending power. Fixed-income investors receive set, regular payments that face the same inflation risk.           Income funds are named appropriately: their purpose is to provide current income on a steady basis. When referring to mutual funds, the terms "fixed-income," "bond," and "income" are synonymous. These terms denote funds that invest primarily in government and corporate debt. While fund holdings may appreciate in value, the primary objective of these funds is to provide a steady cash flow to investors. As such, the audience for these funds consists of conservative investors and retirees.        Bond funds are likely to pay higher returns than certificates of deposit and money market investments, but bond funds aren't without risk. Because there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically depending on where they invest.Individual bonds may be the best known type of fixed income security, but the category also includes bond funds, ETFs, CDs, and money market funds.Fixed Income ETFsFixed income exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are baskets of fixed income investments that trade as a single unit throughout the day.    Money Market FundsA money market fund is a type of fixed income mutual fund that invests in debt securities that are characterized by their short maturities and minimal credit risk.For money market funds, income can be either taxable or tax exempt, depending on the types of securities in which the fund invests. These may include short-term U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency notes, Eurodollar deposits, repurchase agreements, certificates of deposit, corporate commercial paper; or obligations of states, cities, or other types of municipal agencies. Bond FundsBond funds are professionally managed portfolios that invest in individual fixed income securities.Reasons to consider bond funds Potential for capital preservation, depending on the fundIncome generationDiversification for a potential hedge against stock market volatilityLiquidityFunds are guided by a stated objective, generally focusing on a particular sector, such as corporate or Treasury bonds; a broad category, such as investment grade or high yield securities; or a specific time horizon, such as short-, intermediate-, or long-term bonds. Individual BondsA bond is an interest-bearing security that obligates the issuer to pay the bondholder a specified sum of money, usually at specific intervals (known as a coupon), and to repay the principal amount of the loan at maturity. Zero-coupon bonds pay both the imputed interest and the principal at maturity. Here are the top fixed investment picks you should consider:Baird Short-Term Bond FundThe fund has returned 1.50 percent over the past year, 1.48 percent over the past three years, 2.04 percent over the past five years, and 3.17 percent over the past decade. It is a low risk investment with low fees.·Metropolitan West Intermediate Bond FundThe fund has returned 1.59 percent over the past year, 1.63 percent over the past three years, 3.55 percent over the past five years, and 5.43 percent over the past decade. It is a low risk investment with low fees.Vanguard Limited-Term Tax-ExemptVanguard Fund gives you a low-risk muni option. The fund has a duration of 2.5 years and charges just 0.20%. Average credit quality is double-A. But the fund yields only 0.9% (that’s a tax-equivalent 1.6% for a taxpayer in the highest bracket. Fidelity Intermediate Municipal IncomeIf you’re investing in a taxable account, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better fund than Fidelity Intermediate Municipal Income (FLTMX). Munis, which pay interest that is generally free of federal income tax, typically offer a bit less volatility than taxable bonds with similar characteristics. The fund’s average duration is 5 years, and its average credit quality is a relatively safe single-A.Non-Public Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)These are not the traditional REITs that trade on an exchange. Public REITs are too volatile. Private REITs typically perform steadily and are currently providing mid to high single-digit dividends. Again, do your homework. Some are great, while others are atrocious or too new.Variable annuities with guaranteed income optionsVariable annuities are not necessarily great investments because they tend to act just like expensive mutual funds. The real value comes from the potential income benefit. Most variable annuities currently offer a 5 or 6 percent guaranteed income for the life of the owner. The beauty of that income is that if the market drives the account up, income can increase, but if the market drives the account down, the income remains constant. In retirement, that is very important.

Objective

  
  The fund's investment objective is to achieve a high level of current income by investing in adjustable rate secured and unsecured senior loans and other debt instruments.
  


Highlights
Provides the potential for:

High monthly income
Adjustable dividends that can act as a possible hedge against rising short-term interest rates
Diversification for your overall income portfolio




Investment Strategy
The fund invests at least 80% of its managed assets in adjustable rate loans, primarily senior loans, though the loans may include unsecured senior loans and secured and unsecured subordinated loans. At least 65% of the fund’s managed assets must include adjustable rate senior loans that are secured by specific collateral. The fund uses leverage.

RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Senior Loan Risk: Senior loans, both secured and unsecured, may not be rated by a national rating agency, are  generally not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and generally are not listed on a securities exchange. Consequently, the amount of public information available about senior loans generally is less extensive than that available for more widely rated, registered and exchange-listed securities.  In addition, some adjustable rate loans may be unsecured or insufficiently collateralized, which increases the risk of fund losses if the loan’s issuer defaults.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Leverage Risk: The fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share NAV, market price, and distributions.  Leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative. Leverage is intended to increase common share net income, but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.  Different forms of leverage, including swaps, may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk. Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.LIBOR Floor Risk: Many floating rate loans issued after 2008 include a “LIBOR floor”, or minimum interest rate to which the loan’s spread is added, to calculate the loan’s overall interest rate.  As short-term market rates rise, such loans will not pay higher interest until prevailing rates exceed the floor rate stated in the loan documents. If such a fund uses floating rate leverage, the fund’s leverage costs will likely increase before its loan portfolio income increases, and the additional income provided by leverage may diminish until market rates exceed the LIBOR floor level.Basis Risk: As short-term rates change, interest from floating rate loans may not increase in concert with increases in floating rate leverage, introducing basis or imperfect hedging risk.Illiquid Securities Risk: The fund may not be able to sell securities in its portfolio at the time or price the fund desires.Loan Settlement Risk: Lack of established settlement standards or remedies for failure to settle may cause the fund to lack timely access to proceeds from selling loans, or to investment exposure from buying loans.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






†† INCOME ONLY DISTRIBUTIONS

				Distributions are sourced entirely from net investment income, unless noted otherwise.
				
						
							Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.

							A Word On Risk

							Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Debt or fixed income securities such as those held by the Fund, are subject to market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, derivatives risk, liquidity risk, and income risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Below investment grade or high yield debt securities are subject to liquidity risk and heightened credit risk. Foreign investments involve additional risks, including currency fluctuation, political and economic instability, lack of liquidity and differing legal and accounting standards. The value of the Fund’s convertible securities may decline in response to such factors as rising interest rates and fluctuations in the market price of the underlying securities. This Fund is subject to loan settlement risk due to the lack of established settlement standards or remedies for failure to settle.

						








Returns quoted represent past performance which is no guarantee of future performance.  Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than their original cost. Due to market conditions, current performance may be higher or lower than the data shown. Returns without sales charge do not reflect the imposition of the maximum sales charge, which would reduce returns. Total returns for a period of less than one year are cumulative.Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Class A shares have a 3.0% maximum sales charge. Class C shares have a 1% CDSC for redemptions within less than one year, which is not reflected in the one-year total return. Class I shares have no sales charge and may be purchased under limited circumstances or by specified classes of investors. Class R6 shares have no sales charge and are available to certain qualified retirement plans and other investors as set forth in the statement of additional information.Expense ratios are based on the Fund's most recent fiscal year end.
