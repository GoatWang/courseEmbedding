Midtown Tulsa features ranch homes and small apartment complexes where renters can enjoy proximity to the Tulsa River. Just south of Midtown Tulsa is the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa, a major employer and a touchstone for Sooner fans. With the Broken Arrow Expressway cutting through the neighborhood, commutes to downtown Tulsa for work are easy and quick.

Closer to the river, midtown residents enjoy fishing, kayaking, and hiking in the River Parks, as well as summertime concerts and fireworks. When you have out-of-town guests, take them to see the country's longest-running play, "The Drunkard and the Olio," at the much-loved Spotlight Theatre along the river.

Caydon planning Midtown apartment development

1 / 25


Back to Gallery
















Australian development firm Caydon Property Group said this week it plans to start construction in January on a high-end apartment project in Midtown.
According to a statement on the company's website:

The site for The Midtown is in a specifically chosen location, strategically placed for success. The area is poised to become the most exciting destination in Houston's inner city sitting alongside the Metro Rail, only five kms from the world's biggest Medical Precinct.




Caydon said the luxury project will offer hotel-style lifestyle with a "sky lounge, pool deck and its own dog park." The 380-unit building is being designed by Houston-based Ziegler Cooper Architects.
Earlier this year, the Australian Financial Review reported that Caydon principal Joe Russo paid $10.5 million for two Midtown development sites across from each other with plans for 1,000 apartments.
Russo offered his impressions of developing in Houston, noting the city's more relaxed building guidelines.

"There's no zoning at all like there is in Melbourne. You go through a planning authority but it's pretty straightforward. I bought my first site in January and will commence construction in November."
"There are no off-the-plan sales. I will build the tower, lease it up and then sell the apartments to a pension fund in one line. For me it's like a working holiday."

Caydon could not be reached immediately for more details, but this local real estate forum suggests the sites are along Main Street across from the Superblock.

Overview
Whether you're moving to California for a new job, a new tan or a new way of life, you're bound to find great apartments for rent and a Cali lifestyle that makes you want to shout the state motto, "Eureka!" (Greek for "I have found it").
What to Expect

California is a place of stark contrasts: The landscape runs the gamut from desert to ocean to mountain, green valleys to skyscrapers, sand to redwood forests, vineyards to office parks and everything in between. In the same day, if you're up for a drive, you can travel from hot, sandy Death Valley, the lowest point of the continental U.S., to cold, snowy Mount Whitney, the highest peak, with a stop in lush, gorgeous wine country along the way.
The diversity of the landscape and the lifestyle ensures a wide range of apartment rentals in various styles and price ranges. There truly is something for everyone in California, if you know what you want and you know where to look.
Where to Explore

While California offers many fine places to search for apartments, San Francisco and Los Angeles are two of the most popular cities to move to. Each city comprises diverse neighborhoods and attractions would fill several books—and has!—but here is a brief overview of what you'll find in these two unique cities:
San Francisco Apartments

The city by the bay, as San Francisco is known, is a cultural mecca famous for excellent restaurants, Victorian architecture, cable cars, rolling fog and the majestic Golden Gate Bridge. The city's expansive public transportation system makes it easy to get around without a car—a good thing, since parking can be difficult. Considering that the city is built on 43 hills, it's no wonder that the city streets are steep and curvy. If a spectacular view is what you're looking for, San Francisco's apartments have some of the finest.
San Francisco's numerous neighborhoods each have their own architecture and local flavor, and this often applies to their apartment rentals too: Many artists call Bernal Heights home. The gay-friendly Castro district hosts numerous cafes and an active nightlife. The Mission is traditionally known as the Latino quarter of the city and is home to artists and families. North Beach, famous for being the home of the Beat generation, is the city's Italian-American neighborhood&mdahs;and a great place to go for coffee. Cole Valley, near the historic Haight, features great restaurants and is popular among families and young professionals. Living in Pacific Heights means living near multi-million-dollar mansions and having great views of the bay.
Los Angeles Apartments

Despite what is depicted on TV, Los Angeles is more than just beaches, Beverly Hills and botoxed beauties. This large city is made up of dozens of varied communities and no true center, so you can create a lifestyle for yourself as rich as those you see in Hollywood movies. The one constant in this city, regardless of where you're looking for apartment rentals, is the need for a car. while there are buses and a subway system, a car is needed to enjoy all that the city has to offer.
The city's downtown is a growing area of lofts, luxury apartments and businesses, and is also home to many of the city's museums, theaters and historic landmarks. Hollywood defines the city for the millions of tourists who flock to the Walk of Fame and Mann's Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. West Hollywood features the Sunset Strip, a stretch of Sunset Boulevard showcasing the city's hottest nightclubs and live-music venues, and is also the center of the city's gay and lesbian community. Family-friendly Santa Monica and funky, artsy Venice feature apartments looking out over popular beaches and the vast Pacific Ocean.
When you're looking for Los Angeles-area apartments for rent, don't forget about the San Fernando Valley, known as "The Valley" to locals. Valley girls and boys enjoy warmer temperatures and cheaper rents on apartments than in many other areas of the city, as well as a more suburban lifestyle. For a cross between the quiet neighborhoods of The Valley and the fun in the sun of a beach community, explore apartments in the South Bay, which includes Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach.
What to Evaluate

The diversity that these two cities offer will make you want to consider the kind of lifestyle that suits you best. While you look for apartments, keep in mind that rent ranges can vary drastically, depending on the area and type of environment you choose, so you may have to broaden your search to include more affordable options. Whichever area you choose, you're bound to find a way to make your California dreamin'. become a reality!Rent.com is a free rental site that offers a large selection of trusted apartments and houses for rent.

Midtown Tulsa features ranch homes and small apartment complexes where renters can enjoy proximity to the Tulsa River. Just south of Midtown Tulsa is the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa, a major employer and a touchstone for Sooner fans. With the Broken Arrow Expressway cutting through the neighborhood, commutes to downtown Tulsa for work are easy and quick.

Closer to the river, midtown residents enjoy fishing, kayaking, and hiking in the River Parks, as well as summertime concerts and fireworks. When you have out-of-town guests, take them to see the country's longest-running play, "The Drunkard and the Olio," at the much-loved Spotlight Theatre along the river.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
