					Full Description



Evolving Systems, Inc., incorporated on January 10, 1996, is a provider of software solutions for service enablement, on-device activation and management of services for connected devices for network operators around the world. The Company is involved in developing, deploying, integrating and maintaining software solutions. The Company's software solutions support traditional and next generation network technologies, convergent service offerings, and advanced wireless and other broadband networks. The Company operates in two segments based on revenue type: license fees and services revenue, and customer support revenue. The Company offers software products and solutions in approximately five areas, including Mobile Analytics, Engagement and Advertising; Service activation solutions; Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card activation and management solutions; Connected device solutions, and Number inventory and management solutions.The Mobile Analytics, Engagement and Advertising enables carrier marketing departments to execute and manage personalized and contextually-relevant interactive campaigns that engage consumers in real time. The Service activation solutions are used to activate voice, video and data services for traditional and next generation wireless, wireline and cable networks. The SIM card activation and management solutions allocate and assign resources to a wireless device when it is first used. The Connected device solutions are used to manage and activate machine-to-machine (M2M) devices, such as e-readers, smart meters, gaming consoles, as well as other SIM-based industry specific devices. The Number inventory and management solutions are used by telecom operators to manage the receipt of number ranges from regulatory bodies, allocation of numbers to subscribers and recycling of disused numbers. Its Mobile Data Enablement (MDE) solution provides a data consumption and policy management solution for wireless carriers and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) that monitor the usage and consumption of data services.The Company's product portfolio consists of Real-Time Lifecycle Marketing (RLM), Dynamic SIM Allocation (DSA), Tertio Service Activation and Number Inventory and Management. Its Real-Time Lifecycle Marketing platform allows marketing departments to create and deploy personalized, location and contextually relevant, interactive customer engagement campaigns. The platform monitors customer events and behavioral patterns in real-time, building a profile of each subscriber. The RLM solution consists of various components, such as The Profiling Engine, The Campaign Manager and Campaign Modules.The Company's DSA solution enables new SIM cards that have not been pre-provisioned to be detected on first use, triggering a provisioning process and eliminating the need for pre-provisioning. DSA offers carriers an alternative to the traditional SIM distribution and activation practices. DSA is an integrated solution consisting of several components, such as First Use Register (FUR), which is responsible for the integration with the network, detecting the first use of a SIM card, enabling the update of the card and facilitating any optional dialogue with the subscriber; Task Management, a module that controls the process flow of tasks involved with completing the subscriber's activation process; Resource Management, which records and controls the management and assignment of specific inventory elements and resources; Menu Server, which defines and controls the menu dialogue with a subscriber; Smartphone Welcome Portal, which allows DSA to support activation processes through a browser-based dialogue, as well as a dialogue through menus on a phone screen; Promotions Engine, which enables DSA to offer promotions to end users as part of the on-device activation experience; In-Life Interaction Engine, which enables personalization options, such as number and tariff choice, or promotions, to be offered to users via their device after first use, as well as during the first use period; Operational Dashboard, which assists operators in the administration, operation, and maintenance of the DSA platform; Direct Authentication, which provides Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) SIM and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) SIM authentication; SIM Reservation Portal, which extends the personalization capabilities of DSA to more of an operator's customers, and Smart Dealer, which provides SIM retailers with a tool set that enables them to sell SIM cards. Its FUR component triggers the provisioning process, including the allocation of a definitive International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and the Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network-Number (MSISDN). Its Resource Management component allocates the resources used by the DSA solution, including IMSI and MSISDN values.The Company's service activation solution, Tertio, is used by carriers to activate a new subscriber or to add a new service to an existing subscriber. Tertio comprises various components, including Tertio Service Composer, which is a modeling tool that simplifies the creation of new services; Tertio Content Connector, which is a tool used for activation of next-generation services; Tertio Activation Designer, which is a tool designed to speed network feature activation, and Tertio Service Verification, which is a module that allows carriers to verify that the services implemented in the network match those that were in the original service order. The Company's number inventory solution, Total Number Management (TNM) enables operators to manage their telephone numbers, as well as other communication identifiers, such as Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and e-mail addresses. The components of TNM include Number management, Vanity/Golden number support and SIM management. The Company's professional and integration services cover all aspects of the project lifecycle, including system architecture, design, software development and customization, system integration, testing, live deployment and production support, program and project level management, post-implementation maintenance and domain and product expertise. It also provides managed services.The Company competes with Comptel, Amdocs, Oracle, Giesecke & Devrient GmbH, HP, Telcordia/Ericsson, Knowesis, Pontis and Business Logic Systems.
