I feel that Neil's greatest strength is that he 'gets out of the 
ivory tower.' This is a leadership trait that some of the greatest
leaders in history have demonstrated. For example, Abraham Lincoln 
spent the majority of his time among his troops in order to gather 
the first hand knowledge needed to make informed, accurate and 
timely decisions. The typical union soldier enjoyed a bond with 
Lincoln that few people would ever have with a U.S. president.
Myself and many others enjoyed such a bond with Neil Novich, who 
sacrificed much of his personal time to get to know us personally 
and professionally. 
I have the greatest admiration for Neil. He is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met and is a brilliant strategist. Neil was very successful executing strategies to drive operational excellence, organic growth and improved customer satisfaction. These initiatives were effectively and concisely communicated so that all employees would understand the goals and could identify their action to meet them. The urgency to perform well was continuously reinforced and the organization continued to improve despite the immense challenges presented by conversion to SAP and ongoing consolidations resulting from acquisitions, most notably, Integris Metals which doubled 
the company's size.
On a final note, the training and personal development I received at 
Ryerson has really taken me to the next level in my career. I can 
never thank Neil enough for all his support. I’m certain that any 
company Neil chooses to lead will be a great company.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended NeilGroupsBain & Company Global AlumniData Science & Machine Learning NewsletterCXO (CEO, COO, CKO, CFO, CIO, CPO, CMO, CAO, CVO, CDO, CRO, CLO, CSO & CTO) CommunityView Neil’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Neil directlyView Neil’s Full ProfileNot the Neil you’re looking for?

Neil S. Novich


What went right: In 2005, Mr. Novich engineered Ryerson's biggest acquisition ever by purchasing competitor Integris Metals Inc. of Minneapolis for $660 million. Ryerson was already the nation's largest steel distributor, but the deal doubled its revenues overnight.
Their strategy: Mr. Novich coveted Integris because of its market strength in aluminum and stainless steel, which fetch higher prices than carbon steel � Ryerson's primary product. The timing of the deal couldn't have been better. Prices for carbon steel, used to make cars and appliances, dropped in 2005, but "because Ryerson had more aluminum and stainless steel, it was able to post much higher results than people expected," says Timna Tanners, a steel industry analyst at UBS in New York.
Did it work? Ryerson's new product mix will make it less vulnerable to swings in steel prices, Ms. Tanners says. And because aluminum and stainless steel sell for $3,400 and $2,300 a ton vs. $640 a ton for carbon steel, the product mix will add to Ryerson's profit margins.

Mr. Novich has already started selling 20 overlapping facilities. He estimates that the company will start realizing the full savings � $50 million a year � from those divestitures and other cost-saving steps at the end of 2007.
In his favor: Mr. Novich credits last year's stock performance to the smooth integration of Integris. Before the deal closed, the top six executives at Ryerson and Integris put together the new management team by pulling the top talent from each of the companies. The result was a 20-member team evenly split between Ryerson and Integris executives. "We announced it early on and showed that it was a collaborative effort," he says.

Learning the truth about the history of your family and friends can be shocking, so please be cautious when using this tool.
TruthFinder does not provide consumer reports and is not a consumer reporting agency. We provide a lot of sensitive information that can be used to satisfy your curiosity, protect your family, and find the truth about the people in your life. You may not use our service or the information it provides to make decisions about consumer credit, employers, insurance, tenant screening, or any other purposes that would require FCRA compliance.
