Fitch Rates Cabela’s Credit Card Master Note Trust, Series 2015-II

      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Cabela’s Credit Card
      Master Note Trust’s asset-backed notes, series 2015-II, as follows:
    

      –$240,000,000 class A-1 fixed-rate ‘AAAsf’; Outlook Stable;
    

      –$100,000,000 class A-2 floating-rate ‘AAAsf’; Outlook Stable;
    

      –$32,000,000 class B fixed-rate ‘A+sf’; Outlook Stable;
    

      –$17,000,000 class C fixed-rate ‘BBB+sf’; Outlook Stable;
    

      –$11,000,000 class D fixed-rate ‘BB+sf’; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch’s ratings are based on the underlying receivables pool, available
      credit enhancement, World’s Foremost Bank’s underwriting and servicing
      capabilities, and the transaction’s legal and cash flow structures,
      which employ early redemption triggers.
    

      The transaction structure is similar to series 2015-I, with credit
      enhancement totalling 15% for class A, credit enhancement of 7% for the
      class B, credit enhancement of 2.75% plus an amount from a spread
      account for the class C, and credit enhancement of an amount from a
      spread account for the class D notes only.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating
      sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card
      asset-backed securities transactions: 1) increased defaults; 2) a
      reduction in monthly payment rate (MPR), and 3) a combination stress of
      higher defaults and lower MPR.
    

      Increasing defaults alone has the least impact on rating migration even
      in the most severe scenario of a 75% increase in defaults. The rating
      sensitivity to a reduction in MPR is more pronounced with a moderate
      stress, of a 25% reduction, leading to possible downgrades across all
      classes. The harshest scenario assumes both stresses occur
      simultaneously. The severe stress could lead to more drastic downgrades
      to all classes.
    

      To date, the transaction has exhibited strong performance with all
      performance metrics within Fitch’s initial expectations. For further
      discussion of Fitch’s sensitivity analysis, please see the presale
      report related to the transaction listed above.
    

      The presale report is available at ‘www.fitchratings.com‘.
      For more information about Fitch’s comprehensive subscription service

      credit reports on more than 20 asset classes, contact product sales at

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to
      this rating action.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Travel RewardsProgram Analysis
				Pick the right card for you using our travel rewards program analysis


 Best Travel Credit Cards

	If you're someone who travels often, a travel rewards card makes sense, as it will give you the biggest bang for your hard-earned buck. That's because these cards earn miles or points that can be redeemed for flights, hotel stays and more. In addition to high earning rates of 2% or more on everything you spend, many cards are offering some incredible intro bonuses right now worth $400 or more. Since figuring out how much your travel credit card's points or miles are worth can be difficult, we performed an in-depth Travel Rewards Program Analysis so you don't have to. Also, check out our list of the best travel credit cards we've reviewed below.

Pay No Interest Until 2019 with These Credit Cards

by Tasha Lockyer
March 31, 2017



Updated: June 21, 2017
If you’re carrying a balance on a credit card (or cards), it’s likely you’re wasting your hard-earned money on interest fees. Did you know there’s a way to avoid paying interest? 0% intro APR credit cards can save you a ton of money because they don’t charge any interest for the term of the card’s 0% intro APR period, which means they can help you pay down (or off) your balance as well as save you some dough on new purchases. Right now credit card issuers are offering surprisingly long 0% intro APR periods, and the best part is you don’t need excellent credit to get them. If you have good credit — usually thought to be a score around the 700s — you can save some serious cash with two cards that have 0% intro APRs so generous you won’t pay a dime of interest on balance transfers or purchases until 2019! There’s even a great card for those with average credit, typically considered to be a score above 670, who also want to earn cash back.
We’ve researched the top 0% intro APR credit cards on the market, and narrowed the field down to the best 5 options. These cards will give you the biggest bang for your buck, and as we mentioned above, are available to those with just good (or even average) credit.
Best for Paying No Interest Until 2019
Citi Simplicity Card – No Late Fees Ever
If you want to transfer your balance to a card with a REALLY long 0% intro APR that’s available to those with good credit, the Citi Simplicity Card (a NextAdvisor advertiser) is the perfect fit. You’ll enjoy an incredible 21-month 0% intro APR on both balance transfers and purchases. That means you’ll sail interest-free straight into 2019, saving a bunch of money in the process. The Citi Simplicity Card has a 3% balance transfer fee, but when compared to the interest you’d pay on your current credit card for 21 months, this one-time fee is no big deal — and you’ll still save a ton of money. If you’d prefer a card without this fee, check out the BankAmericard Credit Card, which is also described below. In addition to the super long 0% intro APR, the Citi Simplicity Card also has no late fees — ideal for anyone who might be a bit tardy with their payments — no annual fee and no penalty rates for late payments. Add free monthly Equifax FICO Scores to all these benefits, and the Citi Simplicity Card – No Late Fees Ever is a smart pick for anyone with less-than-perfect credit who wants to save money on interest fees.
Citi Diamond Preferred Card
Just like the Citi Simplicity Card, the Citi Diamond Preferred Card offers a ridiculously long 21-month 0% intro APR on balance transfers and purchases. This phenomenal 0% into APR is available to you if you have just good credit, and the card has no annual fee. Note that there is a 3% balance transfer fee (min. $10), but this is a pretty standard charge, as we noted above. Additional card perks include the ability to select your payment date, allowing you to sync it up with your paycheck, a personal concierge service, extended warranty protection and free monthly Equifax FICO Scores. The Citi Diamond Preferred Card will hit the spot if you want a card with a crazy long 0% intro APR term and a low ongoing APR.
The following cards won’t take you all the way to 2019 interest-free, but they do have super long 0% intro APRs and other benefits.
Best for No Balance Transfer Fees
BankAmericard Credit Card
This card is the perfect fit for anyone who doesn’t want to pay to transfer their credit card balance. That’s because in addition to having no annual fee, BankAmericard Credit Card charges absolutely no balance transfer fees as long as you make your transfers in the first 60 days you have the card (after that, it’s a 3% balance transfer fee, $10 min). You’ll also enjoy a lengthy 15-month 0% intro APR on both purchases and on balance transfers (balance transfers must be made in the first 60 days). Although it’s not quite as long as the 21-month 0% intro APR offered by Citi cards we detailed earlier, the no balance transfer free might make up for it. To find out for sure, use our free and easy Balance Transfer Calculator to see which card will save you the most money.
Best for Long 0% Intro APRs and Cash Back Rewards
Discover it — 18 month Balance Transfer Offer
Providing the same features and benefits usually only given to those with excellent credit, Discover it – 18 month Balance Transfer Offer is an excellent combination of a 0% intro APR, no annual fee and great cash back rewards, and it’s available to those with average to excellent credit (typically a credit score of 670+). First off, you’ll get an 18-month 0% intro APR on balance transfers (note there is a 3% transfer fee) and a 6-month 0% intro APR on purchases. Plus, you’ll earn a very generous 5% cash back in categories that rotate each quarter, up to the quarterly maximum (currently $1,500), and an unlimited 1% back on all other purchases. You do need to sign up each quarter to receive the 5% back, but this is quick and easy to do with reminder emails from Discover. On top of that, Discover will match all of the cash back you earned at the end of your first year. So if you earned $300 cash back in your first year, Discover will match it and give you a total of $600 back! All-in-all, Discover it is the perfect combination of a 0% intro APR and lucrative cash back rewards, and you only need average or better credit to qualify.
Citi Double Cash Card – 18 month BT offer
If you like cash back and 0% intro APRs but don’t want to keep track of rotating categories, the Citi Double Cash Card – 18 month BT offer is right up your alley. It starts off with no annual fee and an 18-month 0% intro APR on balance transfers (there is a 3% balance transfer fee). Although there is no 0% intro APR for purchases, the effective 2% cash back on all purchases might close the deal for you. Here’s how it works: you’ll earn 1% back when you make the purchases and the other 1% when you pay for it. It’s a good fit for anyone who tends to pay their purchases off each month, but even if you don’t, you’ll still get that extra 1% back when you eventually do pay off your purchase. Other card perks include a free monthly Equifax FICO Scores, Citi Price Rewind and a pass on your first late fee.
To see more cards that will help you avoid credit card interest, check our rankings of the best 0% intro APR credit cards. And if you’re planning to transfer a balance, be sure to plug in your transfer amount, monthly payment and credit level into our free Balance Transfer Calculator to see which card will allow you to save the most money.

Thank you for all the great questions! 
Robert, to apply for the Citi Double Cash Card – 18 month BT offer, visit our Citi Double Cash Card review and click “Apply Now.” You will then be taken to Citi’s website, where you can fill out an online application.
Diane, applying for a new credit card will result in a hard inquiry on your credit reports, which may lower your credit scores bit, but completing a balance transfer can actually have the opposite effect. We explain how that works in this blog post. 
Wayne, unfortunately the only way to know what your new card’s credit limit will be is to apply for the card, as there are a number of factors that determine your credit limit, including your credit scores, income, credit history and more. That said, if you are approved for a lower credit limit than you were hoping for, there are some options for you. 
Susan, if you still have a balance after the 0% intro APR period is up, you will not be required to pay back the interest. Instead, you will start paying interest on the current balance. This blog post explains this and everything else you need to know about what happens when your 0% intro APR period runs out.

I would like to apply for the citi double  cash card .







Diane Lannom April 24, 2017



When you use a a credit card to transfer balances, does it affect your credit rating?







Jeff Kitchen April 18, 2017



The 0%APR is not deferred interest, i.e, you don’t owe for interest not charged even if you don’t pay the balance off at the end of introductory period.  Basically, you’re getting free financing (except for the balance transfer fee, if applicable) for the duration of the Introductory period. After the introductory APR, the rate will rise to whatever was stated in the original offer and you will be assessed monthly interest on the current balance going forward.  Typically, balance transfers are charged the same interest rate as normal purchases.







Wayne Warner April 18, 2017



If I have a high credit card balance I want to transfer, how can I be sure I will be able to transfer that whole balance to a new card?







Susan Wyatt April 13, 2017



When the 18 ,months (or whatever time) is up, will we have to repay the interest that would have been charged for that time?







Tasha Lockyer April 4, 2017



Hi Patrick, when you say you have “Fair” credit is that a credit score of about 580-670? If you’re closer to 580 you probably won’t qualify for these cards, but if your score is closer to 670 you may. The only way to find out for sure is to apply. If you are having a hard time qualifying for a credit card, you might consider a Secured Credit Card. We review some secured cards that you can take a look at by clicking here.







Tasha Lockyer April 4, 2017



Hi Elizabeth, you can easily apply for any of the offers in this article by clicking on the card art or card name. You will then be taken to the card’s review page which has an Apply Now link at the top and bottom. Just click on that Apply Now page and you can start the application process.







Elizabeth Coley April 2, 2017



See your posts, would like to apply for the offers you state in your ads.







Patrick Gagliardi April 1, 2017

 Best Travel Credit Cards

	If you're someone who travels often, a travel rewards card makes sense, as it will give you the biggest bang for your hard-earned buck. That's because these cards earn miles or points that can be redeemed for flights, hotel stays and more. In addition to high earning rates of 2% or more on everything you spend, many cards are offering some incredible intro bonuses right now worth $400 or more. Since figuring out how much your travel credit card's points or miles are worth can be difficult, we performed an in-depth Travel Rewards Program Analysis so you don't have to. Also, check out our list of the best travel credit cards we've reviewed below.
