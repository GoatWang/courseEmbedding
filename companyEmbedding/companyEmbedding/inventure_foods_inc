Poore Brothers

Since 1986, Poore Brothers® has been delivering Arizona’s favorite potato chips. Poore Brothers® Potato Chips are kettle cooked to golden perfection for a hearty Home-Style taste. When it comes to full bodied flavor, Poore Brothers® is truly the chip of choice.
What gives Poore Brothers® Kettle Cooked Potato Chips an “Intensely Different”® Taste?
Our hand-crafted kettle cooked potato chips are sliced a little thicker and slow cooked at a lower temperature, one batch at a time. This process gives them more potato taste and a serious crunch. Additionally, we use only the best oils. Our oils are 100% pure with no additives or preservatives. Finally, we use a unique blend of spices to create wonderfully rich and surprisingly bold flavors.
Now you can enjoy your favorite kettle cooked chips anytime.

All onions are not created equal.  From their accidental discovery in the 1930s, to their hand planted and hand harvest practices today, Sweet Vidalia® Onions are world famous.  The South Georgia soil at Bland Farms produces this flavorful, mild and sweet onion with unmatched taste.
You don’t have to travel to Georgia to sample the Sweet Vidalia® Onion.  We use real Vidalia® Onions and bake them into a crunchy snack that delivers the true Vidalia® flavor experience.

Our History

While working as engineers installing and servicing bagging machines  			in snack food plants throughout the United States, Jay Poore and his  			older brother, Don, saw first-hand the finer details involved with  			potato-chip production. What they noticed during that time was a  			perceived void in the marketplace.
As a result, the brothers decided to develop their own snack brand  			by creating a kettle-cooked chip that was thicker than traditional  			varieties. So, in 1983, Bob’s Texas Style Potato Chips was born.  			After only three years, the chips became so popular with consumers  			that the brothers sold the business to a partner, moved to Arizona  			and launched the Poore Brothers brand. Starting with only a single  			kettle and one delivery truck, they relied on sampling and  			word-of-mouth advertising to grow the business.
The strategy paid off and, in 1996, the company went public with the  			help of a private investment group. Soon after the IPO, acquisitions  			started when Bob’s Texas Style Potato Chips was bought back in 1998.  			A Bluffton, Indiana, facility – the location where T.G.I. Friday’s  			snack foods are produced – was acquired in 1999, and the Boulder  			Canyon brand was purchased in 2000.
In May 2006, as part of the transition from a regional potato chip  			producer to a national marketer of snack foods, the Poore Brothers  			name was replaced with The Inventure Group to create a corporate  			identity that more closely reflects our diverse lineup of innovative  			consumer brands sold both nationally and internationally.

Recall -- Firm Press Release   FDA posts press releases and other notices of recalls and market withdrawals from the firms involved as a service to consumers, the media, and other interested parties. FDA does not endorse either the product or the company.   Inventure Foods, Inc. Issues Voluntary Recall Of Its Rader Farms® Fresh Start Smoothie Blend, Sunrise Refresh Fusion, And Daily Power Fusion Due To Possible Health Risk   Contact Consumer: Inventure  Foods Customer Service  866-890-1004  Media: Matt Jackson   Lambert, Edwards & Associates mjackson@lambert-edwards.com  616-233-0500 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – January 18, 2015 – Inventure Foods, Inc.  of Phoenix, Arizona, has issued a precautionary recall of its RADER  FARMS® Fresh Start Smoothie Blend, Fresh Start Sunrise Refresh  Fusion, and Fresh Start Daily Power Fusion because of a potential to be  contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes,  an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young  children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune  systems.  Although healthy individuals  may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache,  stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, listeria infection can cause  miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women. These recalled blends themselves did not test positive for Listeria monocytogenes.  However, Listeria  moncytogenes was detected on spinach and/or kale ingredients on another lot  which is currently placed on hold.  These  spinach and kale ingredients used to manufacture the recalled blends were  supplied by the same outside party. Fresh Start Smoothie  Blend is distributed in 48 oz. (3 lbs.) packages at Costco in Alaska, Arizona,  California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah,  Washington, and in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan of Canada. The Fresh Start Sunrise Refresh Fusion and Fresh Start Daily Power Fusion products are distributed in 35 oz. packages at  Walmart in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New  Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. The packages carry the Rader Farms and Fresh Start logos and  are sold in the frozen fruit aisle of the store.
