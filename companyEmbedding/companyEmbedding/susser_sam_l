Mergers & Acquisitions News
End of the Susser EraNew chairman taking over at Sunoco LP as old guard steps down, moves onBy 

Steve Holtz,
Editor in Chief, CSP Daily News


Greg Lindenberg,
Editor, CSP










May 01, 2015
Sam SusserHOUSTON – Following the transition of
Susser Holdings Corp. and its Stripes convenience store chain to
Sunoco LP, Sam L. Susser, called one of “the most visionary innovators in the c-store industry,” has resigned from the Sunoco LP board of directors, to be succeeded by Matthew S. Ramsey.Susser—who has served as non-executive chairman for Sunoco LP since August 2014 when Sunoco LP's parent, Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP) acquired Susser Holdings Corp.—will “pursue other interests,” the company announced. He could not be reached for comment.Also departing from Sunoco LP are Rocky Dewbre, who was president and CEO of Susser Petroleum Partners LP, and Mary Sullivan, who was CFO of Susser Holdings and then Sunoco LP, a source who asked not to be identified told CSP Daily News.The source also said that Sam Susser will no longer have an active role in the company."I want to thank Sam for his outstanding work and wise counsel during the merger of Susser with ETP, and through the integration of Susser's businesses with our Sunoco Inc. retail marketing and wholesale fuel distribution business," said Kelcy L. Warren, chairman and CEO of ETP, Houston. "Sam, his family and team have built an exceptional convenience-store and fuel-supply business that is an outstanding addition to the [ETP] portfolio of assets. Over the years, the Susser organization has been one of the most visionary innovators in the c-store industry through its Stripes retail chain.”He continued, “Under Sam's leadership, Stripes grew from five stores when Sam joined the business in 1988 to a total of 650 stores, with 640 branded dealers, 12,000 employees and $6.8 billion in revenue. Stripes is a premier c-store in every market it serves, and Sunoco and Stripes are now well-positioned to capitalize on the strong growth opportunities that Sam, his family and team have created for our brands in the Southwest and beyond. We applaud him for these accomplishments, and we wish the best for his new business ventures.”CSP named Sam Susser as its Retail Leader of the Year (RLOY) for 2014.Ramsey has served as a director of Sunoco LP since August 2014, serving as chair of Sunoco LP's audit committee and serving on Sunoco LP's compensation committee. He also serves as a director of Energy Transfer Equity LP, and is chairman of the audit committee, as well as a member of the compensation committee.The partnership also officially announced the resignations of Marshall S. McCrea, Martin Salinas Jr., and William P. Williams from the board due to other commitments. As a result of their departures, James W. Bryant and Richard D. Brannon have been appointed to the board. Bryant and Brannon previously served on the board of Regency Energy Partners LP, which has just merged with ETP. Brannon also previously served on the board of Sunoco LP.Houston-based Sunoco LP is a master limited partnership (MLP) that primarily distributes motor fuel to convenience stores, independent dealers, commercial customers and distributors. It also operates more than 150 convenience stores and gas stations. It conducts its business through wholly owned subsidiaries, as well as through its 31.58% interest in Sunoco LLC, in partnership with an affiliate of its parent company, ETP. While primarily engaged in natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil and refined products transportation, ETP also operates a retail and fuel distribution business through its interest in Sunoco LLC, as well as wholly owned subsidiaries, Sunoco Inc. and Stripes LLC that operate approximately 1,100 convenience stores and gas stations.

He was CEO of Susser Holdings Corp. since 1992 and served as nonexecutive chairman of the partnership since August, when Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP (NYSE: ETP) acquired Susser Holdings with the general partner of Sunoco LP. ETP changed Susser Petroleum Partners’ name to Sunoco LP in October.

Matthew Ramsey has been named the new chairman of the board. He has been a director of Sunoco since August, serving as chairman of the audit committee and a member of the compensation committee. He also serves as a director of ETP and is chairman of ETP’s audit committee and a member of its compensation committee.
Additionally, Marshall "Mackie" McCrea, Martin Salinas Jr. and William "Bill" Williams also resigned from the Sunoco LP board, and James "Jim" Bryant and Richard "Dick" Brannon have been appointed.
"I want to thank Sam for his outstanding work and wise counsel during the merger of Susser with ETP, and through the integration of Susser's businesses with our Sunoco Inc. retail marketing and wholesale fuel distribution business," Kelcy Warren, chairman and CEO of ETP, said in a statement. "Sam, his family and team have built an exceptional convenience store and fuel supply business that is an outstanding addition to the Energy Transfer portfolio of assets.”




 


Since Susser joined the family business in 1988, the Stripes convenience store chain grew from five stores to 650, with 640 branded dealers, 12,000 employees and $6.8 billion in revenue, Warren said in the statement.
“Sunoco and Stripes are now well-positioned to capitalize on the strong growth opportunities that Sam, his family and team have created for our brands in the Southwest and beyond,” Warren continued. “We applaud him for these accomplishments, and we wish the best for his new business ventures."

ETP & Susser: Future Juggernaut
Sam Susser says company has the potential to be a truly major player.

May 7, 2014, 04:05 pm



 



DALLAS and CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas -- Calling the pending acquisition of Susser Holdings Corp. "a very bittersweet moment for the Susser family," CEO and Chairman Sam L. Susser said today that Sunoco Inc. parent Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP) presented an offer the retailer couldn't refuse.
"[The Susser family] would have been happy to go on with things as they are, but Energy Transfer Partners presented a compelling proposal for our shareholders at [Susser Holdings], our unit holders at [Susser Petroleum Partners], as well as for our leadership team," he stated. "Pairing Stripes and Laredo Taco Company with Sunoco, one of the great fuel brands in the United States, [and] with the capability and resources of Sunoco and the ETP family, tees up our company for a tremendous future." 
The chief executive made these comments during the company's first-quarter 2014 earnings call (click here for related story). Sam Susser also spoke of the potential of the newly combined entity.
Susser Holdings, parent of Stripes convenience stores, has been dedicated to developing a team that is truly a leader amongst its peers, strives to respect each and every individual team member, runs every story on a one-at-a-time basis, and is built on a robust, scalable, low-cost technology platform, he said.  
"Combined with Sunoco's brand, logistics, credit card and geographic reach, this company has the potential to be a truly major player -- a juggernaut -- in the years ahead," Sam Susser added.
ETP Eager for Acquisition
At the same time Susser Holdings was discussing its first-quarter earnings this morning, Energy Transfer Partners was doing the same (click here for related story). The Dallas-based company said it is eager to acquire Susser Holdings, but can't guarantee its investors that ETP will move toward a simplification of its business structure.
"As we find ourselves today, the reality of MLP [master limited partnership] math … suggests that you actually do not reduce complexity in some instances," ETP CEO Kelcy Warren remarked during the company's earnings call. "I can't make a commitment that there will not be multiple MLPs underneath the family of MLPs of ETE [Energy Transfer Equity]. ... That's actually better for ETE." 
Energy Transfer Equity is a master limited partnership that owns the general partner interest and 100 percent of the incentive distribution rights of Energy Transfer Partners, which is the parent of Sunoco Inc. and Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, another master limited partnership.
"The compatibility of the MLPs and the sharing of opportunity that can grow the family has been a wonderful business plan," Warren continued. "I'd like to tell you that we're committed to simplifying our organization. I know the regulatory agencies would like to see that. We will try, but not to the detriment of our unit holders or the family." 

In prepared remarks, the company reported that the Susser Holdings acquisition, valued at $1.8 billion, will provide "a sound and deliberate exit path that generates significant cash proceeds for overall new leveraging and growth at ETP."
As CSNews Online previously reported, the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. By acquiring Susser Holdings, ETP will own the general partner interest and the incentive distribution rights in Susser Petroleum Partners LP, approximately 11 million Susser Petroleum common units -- representing approximately 50.2 percent of outstanding units -- and Susser's retail operations consisting of 630 Stripes convenience stores. 
Once completed, ETP will "drop down" all of its retail assets to Susser Petroleum, which will continue to operate as a publicly traded master limited partnership.
Jamie Welch, ETE's group chief financial officer and head of business energy transfer equity, also commented on the Susser Holdings acquisition during the earnings call. "The addition of Susser to the Sunoco network broadens Sunoco's geographic footprint and creates a portfolio of strong brands that should generate sustained earnings growth over time," said Welch. "ETE is very excited at the prospect of being the ultimate long-term [general partner/incentive distribution rights] runner of that business."
Noting there are numerous opportunities for strong performance and growth, Welch added, "We're also very pleased that the Susser family and their employees will be joining our family."
