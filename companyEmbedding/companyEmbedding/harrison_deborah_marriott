Deborah Marriott Harrison

BETHESDA, MD—Marriott International, Inc. has named Deborah Marriott Harrison—the company’s global officer, Marriott Culture and Business Councils, and the daughter of Executive Chairman J.W. Marriott Jr.—a director of the company effective on June 17, 2014.
Harrison fills the board position previously held by her brother, John W. Marriott III, for 12 years. Marriott III resigned from the board effective June 16, 2014 to devote more time to his other business interests and family matters. 
Harrison, 57, has held a number of positions with Marriott International, including positions in accounting and operations, and more recently as head of Marriott’s government affairs group from 2006 to 2013 and, since 2013, her current position as global officer, Marriott Culture and Business Councils. 
In her current position, Harrison oversees strategy for the company’s 76 worldwide business councils and works with the Marriott International’s associates, owners and franchisees to promote and protect Marriott’s culture and legacy, one of its key competitive advantages.  She also serves on the boards of the Marriott Foundation for People with Disabilities, the J. Willard and Alice S. Marriott Foundation, and the DC College Access Program. From 2011 to 2013, she served as a director of Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, a vacation ownership resorts company, which was spun off from the Company in November 2011.  
J.W. Marriott Jr. stated, “We are thrilled that Debbie will bring to the Board her enthusiasm, judgment and deep experience with our company and our culture. At the same time, I am so proud of the job John has done in his many years with the Company, and deeply appreciate the commitment and passion he has brought to his service on the Board. While we enthusiastically welcome Debbie, we have benefited greatly from John’s long and dedicated service.”
Harrison was appointed for a term that expires at the company’s next annual meeting of shareholders.  
John W. Marriott III is the CEO of JWM Family Enterprises, L.P., a private partnership that develops and owns hotels. Mr. Marriott held numerous positions over his 30-year career with the company, including EVP-Lodging and president of North American Lodging. He is a former chairman of the advisory board of the Smithsonian National Zoo and is a member of the board of directors of the Washington Airports Task Force.

With Rise in Travel Spending, Dreams Can Come True
        I took a summer vacation to Alaska. This natural beauty of a state might be our 49th, but it was my 50th. Why all this talk of my summer vacation? Well, Allianz Global Assistance (AGA) just released data earlier this week saying that Americans are spending more on summer vacations this year, topping $100 billion for the first time in the AGA survey’s eight-year history. This represents a 12.5% increase over last year.

Marriott Foundation for People With Disabilities

                    The Foundation was established in 1989 to enhance employment opportunity for young people with disabilities. 250,000 youth exit special education in the U.S. each year. A year after exit, more than 50% will remain unemployed, while many more will be significantly under-employed; results that lead directly to the 70% unemployment rate among adults with disabilities. By intervening with youth as they leave special education, the Foundation provides the guidance and support they will need to achieve vocational success.
