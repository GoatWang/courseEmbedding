Granite Point Mortgage Trust (GPMT) has yet to declare their first dividend. 

 The mortgage REIT focuses on CRE (commercial real estate). The most similar competitor is Blackstone Mortgage Trust (BXMT). Investors love BXMT. BXMT regularly trades at the highest price to book ratio. When they are not in first place, they are usually in second or third place. I believe investors will come to adore GPMT the same way. Granite Point Mortgage Trust’s dividend GPMT should declare their first dividend in September. Based on comparisons with BXMT, the most likely dividend level is $0.42 to $0.45. If GPMT follows in Blackstone’s lead, then $0.45 would be the best estimate. Based on a recent price of $19.09, this would be a 9.43% dividend yield. BXMT’s dividend Blackstone Mortgage Trust pays out 9.36% on their trailing book value. The dividend yield is only 8% based on the recent price of $31.03. How to predict a dividend 

 To estimate GPMT’s dividend we begin with the asset yield. I am estimating that it will be at least 5.43% on interest-earning assets. Further, GPMT will probably use similar leverage to other major mortgage REITs investing in CRE. That means GPMT should be running leverage of roughly 3.5x for assets to equity. Assuming 5.43% and 3.5x gives us roughly 19% in gross annual interest income on common equity.
 Interest expense For mortgage REITs investing in CRE with a 3.5x leverage ratio, interest expense usually runs between 39% and 40% of gross interest income. 19% times 60% leaves us with about 11.4% in net interest income on common equity. Operating expenses I would expect total operating expenses to run about 3.3% on equity. In this case, if preferred shares existed the operating expense would probably scale higher with the preferred equity. Therefore, I believe the lack of preferred equity is positive for the common shareholders. 11.4% minus 3.3% gives us 8.1%. The expected return on equity should average out to around 8.1%. However, mortgage REITs often add a few of those expenses back when calculating core EPS. I am estimating that those adjustments could drive core earnings on equity up to 9.36%. If core earnings on equity come in at roughly 9.36% and the initial book value begins at $19.23 it would give us $1.80 per year in expected core earnings. I expect management to establish a dividend policy that matches dividends to roughly their expected level of core earnings. If management comes to the same estimate for core earnings, this is the dividend level that makes the most sense. Significant upside If interest rates increase, the interest rate on assets will also increase because these are CRE loans. As rates move higher, the expected level of core earnings on equity also increases. If GPMT trades materially above book value, it should trigger the company to issue additional shares. The market frequently reacts negatively on the announcement. However, each share issued at a significant premium to book value will increase book value per share across the company. Since we are forecasting core earnings to run about 9.36% on book, a 5% increase in book value could drive a 5% increase in core earnings. Assuming the dividend follows core earnings, each issuance above book value should support future dividend growth. Based on the price to book value ratio for BXMT and the difference in dividend yields, GPMT has an immediate 18% upside. If GPMT issues new shares to capitalize on a premium to book value when it is available, it could drive the book value and dividend materially higher. Because GPMT is a smaller mortgage REIT, each new issuance of equity can grow book value faster and the cash can be put to work quickly. This strategy of issuing above book value to grow book value and earnings provides another 5% to 10% upside over the next two years.
 Risks to the investment Because GPMT invests in a leveraged portfolio of CRE loans, they are exposed to credit risk from the companies they are lending to. A significant increase in defaults on those loans would hurt their performance. If the loans defaulted and the collateral value were less than the outstanding balance, GPMT would be stuck eating a loss. When GPMT issues a loan it is usually at a substantial discount to the estimated value of the collateral. The difference between the loan amount and the collateral value gives GPMT a margin of protection. If inflation picks up within the next several years, the value of the collateral should also increase. Strong buy for Granite Point Mortgage Trust under $19.04 GPMT currently trades around $19. At these prices, the stock appears excellent. The company is trading below trailing book value and the expected forward dividend yield based on my projections is 9.43%. GPMT would have to rally significantly to trade at the same price to book ratio as BXMT. Even if investors want to focus on the dividend yield, there is a material difference between 9.43% and the 8% BXMT is currently paying.

Blackstone Mortgage Trust - Strong Investment Opportunity Heading Into Earnings? - Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc. (NYSE:BXMT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Blackstone Mortgage Trust - Strong Investment Opportunity Heading Into Earnings?Jul.20.17 | About: Blackstone Mortgage (BXMT) Matthew Utesch Dividend investing, dividend growth investing, long only, REITsSummaryPart of Blackstone Group which has $102 Billion of investor capital under management. Raised $15 Billion in new assets in 2016.No defaulted or impaired loans in the portfolio.Weighted Average Loan-to-Value of 61%.Collateral is diversified across a number of industries, including Office, Hotel, Retail, Multifamily, Condos, and more.Earnings have been light over the last two quarters, leading the company's share price to fall from its 52-week high by approximately 4.5% over the last month.Investment Thesis Sometimes, the market gives us the opportunity to capitalize on the type of investments that are best referred to as "Hindsight is 2020." At some point in time, every investor regrets the one golden gem that they should've purchased or continued to hold onto. On certain occasions, the market gives you the opportunity to redeem yourself and purchase a holding at levels that cannot be passed over. Blackstone Mortgage Trust (BXMT) is one of those investments that fit this description for me. I have paid attention to it for several years, but I have never put in the time or the effort to research just how good of an investment it really is. Between the capital gains and dividends, I estimate that I would be sitting on a solid return of approximately 40% to 45% had I invested when I first started following this stock. While the pullback of 4.5% doesn't seem like anything to get too excited over, I would contend that I expect the upcoming quarterly report to be a healthy earnings beat for BXMT (it has strong 2nd quarter earning beats for the last two years). With a strong portfolio of loans tied to LIBOR, BXMT has positioned itself to benefit from what it expects to be a continuing increase in rates. I also believe that rising interest rates will benefit from economic activity and repositioning/repurposing of commercial properties across the United States and other countries. A few other reasons why I am interested in BXMT include the following:  Significant ownership from Blackstone and Blackstone employees (and a strong emphasis on restricted stock compensation). Starwood Property Trust (STWD) is an investment that I've held for several years but currently sits at a price to book value of 127%, while BXMT is closer to a price-to-book value of 118%. Unlike STWD, BXMT has continued to grow its dividend for the last three years straight. Although STWD presents a solid value, I think that the internal ownership of Blackstone represents interests that are better aligned with shareholders. 
 What Is LIBOR? For investors unfamiliar with LIBOR, I feel that an overview of it is beneficial in helping us understand one of BXMT's largest income drivers. LIBOR, which stands for London Interbank Offered Rate, is the rate that the world's leading banks charge one another for short-term loans. LIBOR is denominated in five currencies and serves seven different maturities. According to Investopedia, the most commonly quoted rate for LIBOR is the three-month US dollar rate. The primary function of LIBOR is to serve as a benchmark reference rate for various debt instruments, including bonds, mortgages, student loans, and credit cards. BXMT And The LIBOR Impact This may be an area where readers can help me, but I have found it nearly impossible to identify which LIBOR maturity BXMT uses for their loan portfolio. This matters because a shorter LIBOR maturity will likely come with a lower yield but will reset more often. (For example, 1-Month versus 1-Year). Therefore, a shorter reset in a rising interest rate environment has the potential to significantly impact BXMT's interest earnings. In BXMT's June investor presentation, I noticed that it quoted a base rate of .98% for March 2017. Using available LIBOR rates, I have determined that it is most likely that BXMT uses a one-month LIBOR on all floating rate loans (I will continue to use the one-month LIBOR rate for the remainder of this article unless otherwise noted). If we look back to July 2015, the one-month LIBOR rate was approximately .19%. In order to generate reasonable earnings, BXMT will add 3.5% (or more) plus LIBOR depending on the risk associated with the borrower. If we fast-forward to July 2016, the one-month LIBOR rate more than doubled to .47%. If we look at the most current LIBOR rate for July 2017, it has almost tripled year over year to 1.22%. Here is a chart from BXMT's investor presentation that indicates the earnings benefit that comes from rising LIBOR rates: 

Source: Blackstone Investor Presentation - May 2017
 If we compare July's LIBOR rate to March's, we can assume that the increase of close to .25% will add somewhere between $.04 and $.05 of additional earnings per share. The Future Of LIBOR What makes LIBOR tricky to follow is that we are currently operating in an environment of lower-for-longer interest rates. It is only in the last year, we have seen LIBOR rates climb to levels seen in early 2009. With the economy finally beginning to pick up the pace, I believe that we will see a steady increase in LIBOR rates. 

Source: Macrotrends - Historical LIBOR Rates Chart Given the highs and lows, I feel that 4% is a very reasonable and conservative LIBOR rate to expect when the economy is operating normally. Assuming that we get back to 4%, BXMT would benefit tremendously and would be generating an additional $.5225 per share annually more than it currently is if the portfolio remained the same size. I want to be clear that I do not expect a drastic increase in LIBOR in the short term but that the long-term prospects suggest that 4% LIBOR is a reasonable rate. Strong Insider Ownership It's always important to find companies that incentivize its employees to act in the best interest of shareholders, and one way to do that is to provide them with stock or encourage them to purchase stock. There can be many reasons why an employee will sell shares, but the only reason to continually purchase more shares is that it presents a strong investment opportunity. 

Source: Morningstar - BXMT Insiders
 I always find it reassuring when I see total shares held over the last year have increased for all key insiders at BXMT. Key insiders at BXMT own just shy of 1% of all outstanding stock, and the executive chairman of the board has nearly $27 million of his net value tied up in company stock. I think it is also worth noting that three of the four top insiders have increased their ownership in the last year by approximately 25% or more. When it comes to key executive compensation, I am comfortable with top executive pay levels as they appear to be strongly correlated with performance. For key executives, their compensation in 2016 was approximately 37% restricted stock and 63% performance incentive. This incentive plan appears to have been adopted in 2013 and has continued to issue more restricted stock since then. This policy of issuing more restricted stock as a percentage of compensation is a policy that I considered to be very shareholder friendly. Dividend Outlook With quarterly earnings looking fairly tight, I do not expect to see a dividend increase until the third or fourth quarter. Over the last three years, BXMT has generally given its raises in the 3rd quarter of the year. BXMT's management will be presenting the earnings on July 25, 2017. From this presentation, we can expect together a better idea of the sustainability of the dividend for the remainder of 2017. Strong results in 2016 generated earnings per share of $2.65 with dividend payments of $2.44. This gives us a payout ratio for 2016 of approximately 92%. Although first quarter earnings for 2017 were a miss, I am not concerned that the dividend wasn't covered since this difference was $.01. First quarter earnings for BXMT tend to be light, while 2nd quarter earnings have beat expectations in both 2016 and 2015. Conclusion If rising interest rates are a threat to your portfolio, I would encourage you to consider BXMT as a way to diversify your income stream. As rates increase, it will not only increase the cash flow of BXMT but it will also increase the value of shares proportionately. Although I hold a position in STWD, I am considering liquidating it in favor of investment in BXMT because of the potential for growth and a stronger discount to book value. I intend to write an article on STWD in the next day to determine which course of action is most prudent.

Chester Bennington could flat-out wail.US talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, 49, also took to the social networking platform to share a touching message about the star, saying: "Chester was one of the kindest men I've had on my show". Thoughts of you flooded my mind and I wept.
TMZ reported Bennington struggled with drug and alcohol addiction and had previously talked about suicide as the result of childhood trauma and abuse."KROQ, Chester and Linkin Park have been together since day 1, and our long history extends beyond the music", Kevin Weatherly, SVP Programming at CBS Radio and KROQ program director.In addition to his work with Linkin Park, Bennington did a stint as lead vocalist with Stone Temple Pilot.Sad news to report from the music world.Chester Bennington was born in Phoenix on March 20, 1976.Meanwhile, a picture was worth a thousand words for the band's official Twitter account, which tweeted out a simple picture of Bennington performing in front of a sea of fans."I'm still weeping, with sadness, as well as gratitude for having shared some very special moments with you and your beautiful family", the singer wrote. Bennington's death occurred on what would have been Cornell's 53rdbirthday.Members of the group Linkin Park pose at the Los Angeles premiere "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" June 22, 2009.Shinoda, 40, is one of the co-founder's of the rock band. It offers advice and support to musicians of all genres and stature, including those who suffer from long-term problems or have recently hit a crisis in their life.Nobody is an expert, and we will probably never know the full story, but Chester Bennington was dealing with a lot of demons right up until the end of his life. The cause of death is not immediately known."Chester Bennington was an artist of extraordinary talent and charisma, and a human being with a huge heart and a caring soul", Warner Bros.Bennington's death came a week before the band was due to kick off the U.S. leg of its tour on July 27 in Mansfield, Massachusetts. Because how do you replace a voice like Chester Bennington's?

NEW YORK, April 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Blackstone Mortgage Trust, Inc. (NYSE: BXMT) and Walker & Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE: WD) today announced that they have entered into a joint venture to originate, hold and finance multifamily bridge loans. Walker & Dunlop, one of the nation's largest nonbank originators of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development loans, will contribute 15% of the venture's equity capital and BXMT will contribute 85%.  The joint venture's floating rate, first mortgage loan product targets assets prior to their eligibility for permanent agency financing.  This comprises an addressable market estimated to be upwards of $20 billion.
Steve Plavin, BXMT's Chief Executive Officer, said, "Walker & Dunlop's market leading multifamily and agency loan footprint makes it an ideal partner for us as we seek to help borrowers bridge their financing until an agency take out.  We are very excited about the increase in investment volume that the joint venture will provide for BXMT."
Walker & Dunlop Chairman and CEO, Willy Walker, said, "The JV with BXMT will allow us to significantly expand our bridge lending business better serving our client base's vast demand for capital and unlocking growth potential commensurate with the scale of our agency origination business."

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo

                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
