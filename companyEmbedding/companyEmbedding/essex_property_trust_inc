About Us



about exxex 1.jpg



Essex’s beginnings go back to 1971, when real estate entrepreneur, George M. Marcus formed Essex Property Corporation. In 1994, with a portfolio of 16 multifamily communities located on the West Coast, the Company made its public debut as Essex Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE:ESS). Essex is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires, develops, redevelops, and manages multifamily apartment communities located in supply-constrained markets. The portfolio is concentrated in select coastal submarkets along the West Coast, including Southern California, Northern California, and the Seattle metropolitan area.Essex provides quality apartment homes with a commitment to a high standard of service for our residents. We offer a number of programs to enhance your stay at an Essex community. Whether you require a home that is pet friendly, desire flexibility in your lease terms, or seek a home provided by an organization that is dedicated to sustainability, rest assured that Essex will deliver a community that meets your needs.

Essex Announces Second Quarter 2017 Results











Short Interest In Essex Property Trust Declines 14.3%













Essex Announces Release And Conference Call Dates For Its Second Quarter 2017 Earnings
Essex Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE:ESS) announced today that it plans to release its second quarter 2017 earnings after the market closes on Thursday, July 27, 2017.

The New #56 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component: Essex Property Trust
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 06/15/2017 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
