Vornado Closes Urban Edge Properties Spin-Off: Is it a Buy?

Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report)	 has finally accomplished the spin-off of Urban Edge Properties (“UE”). This new, independent, publicly company will start regular trading under the ticker symbol “UE” on the NYSE from today. UE has stake in 79 strip shopping centers, 3 malls and one Warehouse Park that were previously under Vornado’s ownership.
	Shareholders of Vornado received one share of UE for every two units of Vornado held, as on the close of business on Jan 7, 2015. For fractional shares, the distributions would be made in cash. Notably, UE shares have traded on a “when issued” basis on the NYSE under the symbol “UE WI” since Jan 5, 2015, allowing shareholders the right to receive UE shares in this distribution. Vornado will, however, continue to trade under the same ticker symbol VNO.
	The move comes as part of Vornado’s efforts to streamline its business. The company, which has been subject to criticism for venturing into too many sectors, would now be able to focus exclusively on office properties and retail shops in Washington and Manhattan.
	On the other hand, UE is expected to unleash its potential of shopping centers and malls spanning over 15 million square feet across 10 states and Puerto Rico, with concentrations in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.
	 
	The two businesses have been together for legacy reasons but with no real operating synergies. We believe the creation of two focused real estate investment trust (REITs) would help in efficiently leveraging the improving fundamentals of each asset type.
	Vornado currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors interested in the REIT industry may also consider stocks like Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report)	, Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report)	 and Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report)	. All these stocks carry the same Zacks Rank as Vornado.

Urban Edge Properties




Urban Edge Properties is a real estate investment trust, who sought a sleek, elegant, and functional headquarters  in N.Y.C where they could go to market with their concept of “cutting edge” development of commercial retail space. One of the primary challenges in this wrap around site was creating a functional space despite the preponderance of columns. The designers, the Switzer Group, worked closely with Arenson’s Office Furnishings and Architectural Products divisions in creating a coherent visual aesthetic between its parts. The customized Knoll Graham finished in wood veneer used in the private offices mimic the large and elegant mass of the walls selected by Switzer. In contrast to the granular texture and mass of the walls, Arenson’s Architectural Products provided Dorma’s lightweight glass partitions to leave the core and outer offices of this wrap-around site open and visible.
A memorable feature is the custom built and site specific wrap-around executive desk, which was installed and cut-around a column on site. The desk is a 3-section desk with varying surface grade directions and a grain to grain match along the separate parts to create a seamless fit. The brass edge and hardware detail match the custom built coffee table a few feet away.
Additional features include the conference and board rooms furnished with Prismatique conference tables in glacier white corian and brushed stainless steel. The seating used throughout the site are from Knoll’s ergonomic and classic collections.
