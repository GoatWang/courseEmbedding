About Us
Annual Conference





Focused Exclusively on Lower Middle Market and MicroCap Companies since 1991
Investment Banking with Comprehensive Financial Advice & Funding Strategies
Research that Identifies Undiscovered Value in the MicroCap Market
INVESTING IN and Growing AMERICA's Small Businesses



The Standard of Excellence in the Microcap MarketFounded in 1991, Taglich Brothers, Inc. is a full service brokerage firm specializing in the microcap segment of the market for publicly traded securities. We define the microcap market as companies with less than $250 million of stock outstanding.
The firm has selected this unique niche for two reasons. First and foremost, the small cap market has historically outperformed the large cap market over the past 75 years. Second, this area of the market is virtually ignored by the larger institutions and other Wall Street firms because they can not invest enough capital in each situation to justify the expense of investigating these companies.
Our focus and high energy level allow us to exploit these inefficiencies, giving us the added advantage needed to prosper in the microcap market.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?
