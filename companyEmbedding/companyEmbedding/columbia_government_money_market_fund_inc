2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

						Effective August 1, 2016, Prime Reserve Fund, changed to a government mandate and was 
renamed Government Money Fund. The performance for the periods prior to August 1, 2016 
reflects the performance of the fund when it operated as a prime money market fund and 
invested in certain types of securities that it is no longer permitted to hold. 
Performance prior to this conversion may have been different if the current investment 
limitations had been in effect.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance,

You could lose money by investing in the Fund. 
Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee 
it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's 
sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and 
you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the 
Fund at any time.
    
    





^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

				A method of calculating a money fund's yield by annualizing the 
fund's net investment income for the last seven days of each period 
divided by the fund's net asset value at the end of the period. 
				
3
									
					
					In an effort to maintain a zero or positive net yield for the fund, T. Rowe Price has voluntarily waived all or a portion of the management fee it is entitled to receive from the fund. A fee waiver has the effect of increasing the fund's net yield. The 7-day yield without waiver represents what the yield would have been if we were not waiving our management fee. This voluntary waiver is in addition to any contractual expense ratio limitation in effect for the fund and may be amended or terminated at any time without prior notice. Please see the prospectus for more details. 
					
				
				Year-to-date figures are not annualized and represent total return, 
which includes reinvested distributions (income and capital gains) 
and any change in share price for the given period. The yield quotation 
more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market fund than the total return quotation.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.

*144 of our 330 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 122 of these 144 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 204 of 311 (66%), 175 of 213, 140 of 178 (79%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
24 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes). 23 of these 24 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 35 of 36, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 168 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 3/31/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

1 Retail Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. Beginning October 14, 2016, the Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.

2 Government Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.


^ The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund 
(the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). 
The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance 
data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown in the 
performance sub-tab when the fund is hovered over) and the actual performance 
results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have 
lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed

Note:  Federal law limits the number of certain types of withdrawals and transfers from a Money Market Account to a combined total of six per calendar month per account.

Is there a daily limit to the amount of money I can withdraw from an ATM with my debit card? 




Yes. The Discover ATM withdrawal limit is $510 per day. Some ATMs may have lower withdrawal limits, but you may complete multiple transactions until you meet the Discover withdrawal limit of $510 per day.




Debit Card with Chip Technology




What is chip technology? 




Also known as EMV or smart chip technology, it provides added security at chip-enabled store terminals and ATMs. Many countries have already adopted chip technology. And now, U.S. merchants and card issuers are starting to adopt it, too.






How do I use a chip card? 




You can use chip cards in one of two ways. If you are at a merchant location that does not have chip-enabled terminals, you can swipe using the magnetic stripe on the back of your card as usual.
At merchant locations that already accept chip cards, you'll be prompted to insert your card into the chip-enabled terminal. Be sure to leave the card in the terminal until the transaction is completed.






When do I swipe? When do I insert?




When in doubt, swipe your chip debit card. If the terminal is chip enabled, it will recognize that your debit card has a chip and will prompt you to insert it instead.






Where can I use my Discover debit card with chip technology?




Your Discover debit card is accepted everywhere you use it today. When retailers update their terminals to accept chips, just insert your card instead of swiping the magnetic stripe.






Do chip payments require signatures? Or PINs?




Your new Discover debit card with chip technology can be used with a signature or PIN depending on the terminal. At chip-enabled terminals, you will be prompted to provide your signature or PIN. In some situations, you may not need to provide either one.






I currently have a regular Discover debit card. When will I receive a chip card?




You will receive a chip debit card when your current debit card expires, if your card is lost or stolen, or if you experience fraud on your account.






If we have a joint account, will we both get new chip cards?




Each owner who has a debit card will receive a new chip debit card when their current card expires. If your debit card is lost or stolen, only the person with the lost or stolen card will receive a new chip debit card. If you request a new chip card early, only the requester will receive a new card.






If I am a new customer and just signed up for an account, will I get both types of cards? 




No. New customers will only receive a chip debit card.






If I request a chip card, will my debit card information change?




Yes. Your debit card number, security code, expiration date and PIN will change. Because of this, we recommend updating all places where you have previously linked your debit card, including any automatic bill payments. 
Please note, that if you have a joint account and only one person on the account requests a chip card, then only that person will receive a new chip debit card.






How does the chip work?




When you insert your chip debit card at a chip-enabled terminal, the embedded microchip generates unique, dynamic data for each transaction. This makes it difficult for fraudsters to duplicate your account information, which in turn, can reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions on your account.






What are the benefits?




Chip technology provides an additional layer of card security. Chip cards make it difficult for hackers to copy and use your debit card information when used at chip-enabled terminals. Other benefits include:

Ease of Use: It's still a debit card, so just use it like before. Once merchants adopt this technology, the terminals will prompt you to insert your card. 
Added Security: The chip helps protect against fraud because it creates unique transaction data when the card is used at chip-enabled terminals in stores and at ATMs
Fraud Protection: As always, you're never responsible for unauthorized transactions on your Discover debit card.







Are chip payments contactless or a type of Near Field Communication (NFC) payment?




No. Your Discover debit card with chip technology requires contact with the terminal's chip reader. Waving your card in front of the terminal will not work.






Can I keep my old card and have a chip card, too?




No. Your Discover debit card with chip technology replaces your other card. Once you activate your chip card, which also has a magnetic stripe, your old debit card will be deactivated.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Gather your retirement savings into one place.





Rollovers 


Info

When you rollover funds, you receive the funds through a distribution from your IRA. You then have 60 days from receipt of those funds to roll them into another IRA or qualified retirement plan to avoid tax consequences. IRA owners are limited to only one IRA-to-IRA rollover in any 12 month period. Rollovers are not counted toward your annual IRA contribution limits. You may want to contact a financial advisor or tax professional for further information.

Enjoy tax benefits, keep earning interest, and avoid fees
Consolidate investments to make life easier







Transfers


Info

When you transfer an IRA, the funds are moved directly from one financial institution to another. The transfer check is made payable to your financial institution for your benefit. Because you don't handle the funds directly, the transaction is not considered a distribution. There is no limit to the number of transfers you can make.

Opening an Account




How do I decide which IRA CD is the best choice for me?




When choosing which type of IRA to open, you should consider factors such as your taxable income, age, and Tax Filing Status. You may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional to help you determine which type of IRA is best suited to your needs. You can also call our IRA Specialists at  1-800-347-7000 to discuss available products.






What is the difference between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA?




Some contributions to Traditional IRAs are tax deductible and most distributions are taxable. A Roth IRA is a retirement plan for contributions made with after tax dollars. Contributions are nondeductible and all qualified distributions are tax free.






Can a Traditional IRA be converted into a Roth IRA?




Yes. However, a conversion from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA may have tax consequences. Consult a financial adviser or tax professional for guidance. For assistance in completing a conversion, please contact an IRA specialist at 1-800-347-7000.
A Traditional IRA may be converted to a Roth IRA as a direct or indirect conversion. In a direct conversion you never have access to your money. It is sent bank to bank and directly placed into a Roth IRA on your behalf. An indirect conversion is similar to a Rollover. You will receive a check made payable to you that can be deposited into your new Roth IRA account.
Consult a financial advisor or tax professional for guidance. For assistance in completing a conversion, contact an IRA Specialist at 1-800-347-7000 for additional information.






What is the difference between a transfer and a rollover?




When you transfer an IRA, the funds are moved directly from one financial institution to another. The transfer check is made payable to your financial institution for your benefit. Because you don't handle the funds directly, the transaction is not considered a distribution. There is also no limit to the number of transfers you can make.
When you rollover funds, you receive the funds through a distribution from your IRA, and then you have 60 days to deposit the funds into another IRA or other retirement plan in order to avoid tax consequences. IRA owners are limited to only one IRA-to-IRA rollover in any 12 month period.
For both transfers and rollovers, funds need to be moved between the same type of IRA account. For example if you have a Traditional IRA you can only transfer or rollover funds from another Traditional IRA.
Rollovers and transfers are not counted toward your annual IRA contribution limits.






Is there a limit to how often I can rollover funds?




IRA owners are limited to only one IRA-to-IRA rollover in any 12 month period and you can rollover as much money as you want.






Can I have more than one IRA?




Yes, you can have both Traditional and Roth IRA accounts at Discover Bank. Your Traditional IRA accounts will be grouped into and administered under a single Traditional IRA plan, and Roth IRA accounts will be grouped into and administered under a single Roth IRA plan. Additionally, if you maintain Inherited IRA accounts, they will also be in separate plans because they need to be titled separately.
You may not contribute more than the annual allowable maximum across all of your Traditional and Roth IRA accounts at all of your financial institutions.






Can I contribute to both a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA?




Yes, you can contribute to both plan types. Your annual contribution can be divided between both types as long as you meet the eligibility requirements for each IRA type. For advice on the best way to contribute, you may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional. For general questions and information regarding your IRA Accounts, you can call our IRA Specialists at 1-800-347-7000.






Can I designate a beneficiary for my IRA CD?




Yes. We encourage all of our IRA account holders to designate at least one beneficiary by completing a beneficiary form.PDF Document We also suggest updating your beneficiary information on a regular basis. If a beneficiary is not designated, any beneficiary payment will generally go to the IRA owner's estate, which is subject to any applicable community property state law requirements.

What are the rules regarding distribution of assets to my beneficiaries after death?




Traditional and Roth IRA plans offer multiple options for beneficiary distribution. There are several rules concerning required minimum distributions (RMDs) to beneficiaries. The rules apply considerations such as the age at time of death.  Please note that RMD rules in the event of account owner death are different from RMD rules when the account owner turns 701/2. For example, the beneficiary may be required to satisfy the IRA CD owner's RMD prior to making the RMD for the chosen beneficiary option. Consult a financial advisor or tax professional to help you determine the rules concerning distributions to beneficiaries.






How are my IRA CD transactions reported to the IRS?




Any contributions made during the tax year will be reported on form 5498. Additionally, any Rollovers, Conversions, Recharacterizations and the fair market value are also reported on form 5498.

Federal and State withholding will be applied where required by federal and/or state laws. In some cases, you will be able to indicate that you prefer no withholding or more withholding than is required. You will always be responsible for the income tax obligations of distributions from your IRA accounts. You may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional to make sure your withholding elections are right for you. If you fail to waive or designate withholding elections on the distribution form, we will process the minimum required for Federal and State according to the IRS guidelines.






Are there tax consequences if I fail to take an RMD by the December 31st deadline?




If you are required to take an RMD, failing to do so may result in tax consequences from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For more specifics regarding the consequences, you may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional. For general questions and information regarding your IRA, please call our IRA Specialists at 1-800-347-7000.

Where can I use my debit card to make purchases?

If you exceed these limits on more than an occasional basis, we reserve the right to close your account.






Where can I get additional cash over a purchase?

If you exceed these limits on more than an occasional basis, we reserve the right to close your account.






Can I use my debit card outside of the United States? 




You can use your Discover debit card to withdraw cash at ATMs and make purchases at participating merchants in Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean wherever you see the Discover, PULSE®, or Diners Club International® symbols.
Note:  Federal law limits the number of certain types of withdrawals and transfers from a Money Market Account to a combined total of six per calendar month per account. There is no limit on the number of withdrawals by ATM or by Official Check mailed to you.  If you exceed these transaction limitations during any calendar month we may assess an Excessive Withdrawal Fee or refuse to pay each transaction in excess of the limitations. If you exceed these limits on more than an occasional basis, we reserve the right to close your account.






Is there a daily limit to the amount of money I can withdraw from an ATM with my debit card? 




Yes. The Discover ATM withdrawal limit is $510 per day. Some ATMs may have lower withdrawal limits, but you may complete multiple transactions until you meet the Discover withdrawal limit of $510 per day.




Debit Card with Chip Technology




What is chip technology? 




Also known as EMV or smart chip technology, it provides added security at chip-enabled store terminals and ATMs. Many countries have already adopted chip technology. And now, U.S. merchants and card issuers are starting to adopt it, too.






How do I use a chip card? 




You can use chip cards in one of two ways. If you are at a merchant location that does not have chip-enabled terminals, you can swipe using the magnetic stripe on the back of your card as usual.
At merchant locations that already accept chip cards, you'll be prompted to insert your card into the chip-enabled terminal. Be sure to leave the card in the terminal until the transaction is completed.






When do I swipe? When do I insert?




When in doubt, swipe your chip debit card. If the terminal is chip enabled, it will recognize that your debit card has a chip and will prompt you to insert it instead.






Where can I use my Discover debit card with chip technology?




Your Discover debit card is accepted everywhere you use it today. When retailers update their terminals to accept chips, just insert your card instead of swiping the magnetic stripe.






Do chip payments require signatures? Or PINs?




Your new Discover debit card with chip technology can be used with a signature or PIN depending on the terminal. At chip-enabled terminals, you will be prompted to provide your signature or PIN. In some situations, you may not need to provide either one.






I currently have a regular Discover debit card. When will I receive a chip card?




You will receive a chip debit card when your current debit card expires, if your card is lost or stolen, or if you experience fraud on your account.






If we have a joint account, will we both get new chip cards?




Each owner who has a debit card will receive a new chip debit card when their current card expires. If your debit card is lost or stolen, only the person with the lost or stolen card will receive a new chip debit card. If you request a new chip card early, only the requester will receive a new card.






If I am a new customer and just signed up for an account, will I get both types of cards? 




No. New customers will only receive a chip debit card.






If I request a chip card, will my debit card information change?




Yes. Your debit card number, security code, expiration date and PIN will change. Because of this, we recommend updating all places where you have previously linked your debit card, including any automatic bill payments. 
Please note, that if you have a joint account and only one person on the account requests a chip card, then only that person will receive a new chip debit card.






How does the chip work?




When you insert your chip debit card at a chip-enabled terminal, the embedded microchip generates unique, dynamic data for each transaction. This makes it difficult for fraudsters to duplicate your account information, which in turn, can reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions on your account.






What are the benefits?




Chip technology provides an additional layer of card security. Chip cards make it difficult for hackers to copy and use your debit card information when used at chip-enabled terminals. Other benefits include:

Ease of Use: It's still a debit card, so just use it like before. Once merchants adopt this technology, the terminals will prompt you to insert your card. 
Added Security: The chip helps protect against fraud because it creates unique transaction data when the card is used at chip-enabled terminals in stores and at ATMs
Fraud Protection: As always, you're never responsible for unauthorized transactions on your Discover debit card.







Are chip payments contactless or a type of Near Field Communication (NFC) payment?




No. Your Discover debit card with chip technology requires contact with the terminal's chip reader. Waving your card in front of the terminal will not work.






Can I keep my old card and have a chip card, too?




No. Your Discover debit card with chip technology replaces your other card. Once you activate your chip card, which also has a magnetic stripe, your old debit card will be deactivated.

Performance
Performance for different share classes varies based on differences in sales charges and fees associated with each class. Not all Funds offer every class of shares.
Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges or contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class A and T: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class C: Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a CDSC.
Class V: POP returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class R, R4, R5, Y and Z: Shares are sold only at NAV. Only eligible investors may purchase these shares. See the prospectus for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year.
†† For Columbia Adaptive Alternatives Fund, effective March 4, 2015, the investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually agreed (for at least twelve months after the date of the fund prospectus), in addition to an existing arrangement, to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the fund. The capped expense ratio consists of the gross expense ratio, as reflected in the fund's prospectus adjusted to reflect any fee waiver/expense reimbursement and excluding dividends and interest expense on securities sold short at the fund and underlying fund levels.
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund's share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.
**Portfolio characteristics are subject to change periodically and may not be representative of current characteristics.

Morningstar Rating
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).

Morningstar Percentile Rankings are based on the average annual total returns of the funds in the category for the periods stated and do not include any sales charges or redemption fees, but do not include 12b-1 fees and the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. Rankings for each share class will vary due to different expenses. Had sales charges or redemption fees been included, total returns would be lower.
Morningstar Style Box 
The Morningstar Style BoxTM is based on the Fund's portfolio holdings as of period end. The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned, and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Information shown is based on the most recent data provided by Morningstar. The Morningstar style box data is updated on the 10th business day after every month end.
© 2017 Morningstar, Inc. All Rights Reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.
Definitions
Alpha measures the relationship between the Fund's performance and its beta over a three-year period. Alpha greater than 0.0 means an investment has performed better than the compared index given its level of risk. It can be viewed as a measure of the value added by the Fund manager.
Annual Distribution Rate at NAV: is based on the Fund's most recent distribution per share (annualized) divided by the Fund's NAV.
Average effective duration provides a measure of the fund's interest-rate sensitivity.
Beta measures a fund's risk relative to its benchmark The index is equivalent to 1.0. A fund with a beta greater than 1.0 has been more volatile than the index while a fund with a beta less than 1.0 has been less volatile.
Price-to-Book Ratio is a stock's price divided by its book value, and may help determine if the stock is valued fairly.
Price-to-Earnings Ratio is a stock's price divided by after-tax earnings over a trailing 12-month period, which serves as an indicator of value based on earnings.
R-Squared ranges from 0.00 to 100 and measures how closely the Fund's performance matches (or doesn't match) the performance of its benchmark index.
30-day SEC Yield: The SEC yield should be regarded as an estimate of the fund's rate of investment income reflecting an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all current portfolio holdings are held to maturity), and it may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate or the income paid to a shareholder's account. The yield shown reflects fee waivers in effect, if any. In the absence of such waivers, yields would be reduced. The fund may own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. If so, the yield will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these securities. This adjustment and the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown.
Unsubsidized 30-day SEC Yield: The unsubsidized yield shown is the SEC yield adjusted to reflect the gross expense ratio applicable to the class of shares shown and without regard to the contractual reimbursements and fee waivers required of the fund's investment manager and affiliates.
The 30-day yields may appear to be the same due to rounding.
The Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund and certain other funds own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. For a fund that owns TIPS or other inflation indexed securities, the SEC Yield, when shown, will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these types of securities. This adjustment as well as the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown. Absent the inflation adjustment, the yield shown may be materially different and may vary significantly from month to month, especially for a fund such as Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund which invests substantially in TIPS and other inflation indexed securities. In periods when the SEC yield is exceptionally high due to a rise in the inflation rate, it is important to bear in mind that the adjustment in the yield from the inflation rate may not be repeated.
Sharpe Ratio divides a fund's return in excess of the 90-day Treasury bill by the investment's standard deviation to measure risk-adjusted performance.
Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of the degree to which an individual value in a probability distribution tends to vary from the mean of the distribution.
Turnover Rate (fiscal year end%) measures the percentage of holdings that has been "turned over" or replaced, in the past year.
Average Coupon is a calculation of the total interest cost for a bond issue expressed as a percentage. The average coupon is equal to the total interest payments of an issue divided by bond year dollars.
Duration to Worst is the duration of a bond computed using the bond's nearest call date or maturity, whichever comes first. This measure ignores future cash flow fluctuations due to embedded optionality.
It is not possible to invest directly in an index. For index descriptions, click here.


Performance
Returns shown do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges imposed by your Contract or Qualified Plan, or imposed on Accounts that may own shares directly. Inclusion of these charges would reduce total returns for all periods shown.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year. 
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund’s share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.
It is not possible to invest directly in an index. For index descriptions, click here.
The Columbia Variable Portfolios and Wanger Funds (the "Variable Funds") are available only through variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies issued by participating insurance companies or certain eligible retirement plans. The Variable Funds are not offered to the public. Not all Variable Funds and classes are available in all contracts, policies or plans. Please contact your financial advisor or insurance representative for more information.
Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC serves as the investment adviser to the Columbia Variable Portfolios. Columbia Wanger Asset Management, LLC serves as the investment adviser to the Wanger Funds. The variable funds are distributed by Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc., member FINRA.


Performance
Effective 09/01/2016, performance reporting for Class A and Class AG with all sales charges reflects a maximum sales charge of 3.75% , except for the Columbia Conservative 529 Portfolio, FA Strategic Income 529 Portfolio, Columbia Income Opportunities 529 Portfolio, Columbia Total Return Bond 529 Portfolio, JP Morgan Core Bond 529 Portfolio, iShares TIPS Bond ETF 529 Portfolio, Templeton Global Bond 529 Portfolio and Columbia US Government Mortgage 529 Portfolio, which reflect a maximum sales charge of 3%. The Columbia College 529 Portfolio, Columbia Short Term Bond 529 Portfolio, Columbia Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio have no initial sales charges for Pricing Alternative A, but the Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio has a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) for Pricing Alternative C.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. Contact your financial advisor or visit columbiathreadneedle.com/us for a Program Description, which contains this and other important information about the Future Scholar College Savings Plan. Read it carefully before investing. You should also consider, before investing, whether the investor’s or designated beneficiary’s home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state’s qualified tuition program.
Expense ratios are as of the plan's most recent Program Brochure & Tuition Savings Agreement. Performance may reflect waivers or reimbursements of fund expenses by the adviser or its affiliates. Absent these waivers, or reimbursement arrangements, performance results may be lower. The net and gross expense ratios shown are updated on the first day of each month.
Total returns assume the reinvestment of all underlying fund distributions at NAV. Portfolio unit value (PUV) returns do not include sales charges or contingent deferred sales charges (CDSCs). If they were included, returns would have been lower.
Pricing Alternative B: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the applicable CDSC for the holding period after an initial purchase as follows: through the first year, 5%; second year, 4%; third year, 3%; fourth year, 3%; fifth year, 2%; sixth year, 1% and thereafter, 0%. These shares convert to Pricing Alternative A units in the eighth year after purchase. Effective December 1, 2010, Class B of each portfolio was closed to both new accounts and additional contributions to existing accounts.
Pricing Alternative C: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of a 1% CDSC for the first year after purchase except for the Conservative 529 and College 529 Portfolios as well as the single-fund fixed-income portfolios and the Legacy Capital Preservation 529 Portfolio, which have a 0.75% CDSC.
Pricing Alternative E: Units are sold only at portfolio unit value (PUV). Only eligible investors may purchase these units. See the program description for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Pricing Alternative Z: Units are sold only at portfolio unit value (PUV). Only eligible investors may purchase these units. See the program description for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Contributions initially invested directly into the Columbia Bank Deposit 529 Portfolio are not subject to the imposition of an initial or deferred sales charge under any Pricing Alternative.
It is not possible to invest directly in an index. For index descriptions, click here.

Risk
Please see the Fund's prospectus in the Literature section of the page for a description of risks associated with the Fund.

Performance
Performance data shown represents past performance and is not a guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Returns shown assume reinvestment of distributions and do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
Performance for different share classes varies based on differences in sales charges and fees associated with each class. Not all Funds offer every class of shares.
Class A: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges. If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class A and T: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class B: Class B shares are closed to new investors. Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class C: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC). If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class C: Returns W/CDSC are calculated with the effect of a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).
Class V: Net asset value (NAV) returns do not include sales charges. If they were included, returns would be lower.
Class V: Public offering price (POP) returns are calculated with the effect of the maximum initial sales charge.
Class R, R4, R5, Y and Z: Shares are sold only at Net asset value (NAV). Only eligible investors may purchase these shares. See the prospectus for eligibility requirements and other important information.
Gross expense ratio: Fund expense ratios are calculated based on the Fund's average net assets during the Fund's most recently completed fiscal year (or based on estimated amounts for funds that have been in existence less than one year), and have not been adjusted for current asset levels. If adjusted for any decrease or increase in assets, expense ratios would be higher or lower, respectively, than the numbers shown above. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional details.
Net expense ratio: Net expenses are after expense waiver/reimbursement. The investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually (for at least the current fiscal year) agreed to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, as described in the Fund's prospectus, unless sooner terminated at the sole discretion of the Fund's board. Fee waivers/expense caps would limit the impact that any decrease in assets would have on net expense ratios in the current fiscal year.
†† For Columbia Adaptive Alternatives Fund, effective March 4, 2015, the investment manager and certain of its affiliates have contractually agreed (for at least twelve months after the date of the fund prospectus), in addition to an existing arrangement, to waive certain fees and/or to reimburse certain expenses of the fund. The capped expense ratio consists of the gross expense ratio, as reflected in the fund's prospectus adjusted to reflect any fee waiver/expense reimbursement and excluding dividends and interest expense on securities sold short at the fund and underlying fund levels.
*Inception date shown is the share class inception date. The since inception returns shown are since fund inception. Returns shown for periods prior to the fund's share class inception date include the returns of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect higher class-related operating expenses, as applicable. In addition, the returns shown include the returns of any predecessor to the fund. Click here for more information.
**Portfolio characteristics are subject to change periodically and may not be representative of current characteristics.
Morningstar Rating
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
Morningstar Percentile Rankings are based on the average annual total returns of the funds in the category for the periods stated. They do not include sales charges or redemption fees but do include operating expenses and the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. The highest (most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (least favorable) percentile rank is 100. Share class rankings vary due to different expenses. If sales charges or redemption fees were included, total returns would be lower.
Morningstar Style Box 
The Morningstar Style BoxTM is based on the Fund's portfolio holdings as of period end. The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned, and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Information shown is based on the most recent data provided by Morningstar. The Morningstar style box data is updated on the 10th business day after every month end.

Definitions
Alpha measures the relationship between the Fund's performance and its beta over a three-year period. Alpha greater than 0.0 means an investment has performed better than the compared index given its level of risk. It can be viewed as a measure of the value added by the Fund manager.
Average effective duration provides a measure of the fund's interest-rate sensitivity.
Beta measures a fund's risk relative to its benchmark The index is equivalent to 1.0. A fund with a beta greater than 1.0 has been more volatile than the index while a fund with a beta less than 1.0 has been less volatile.
Annual Distribution Rate at NAV: is based on the Fund’s most recent distribution per share (annualized) divided by the Fund’s NAV.
Price-to-Book Ratio is a stock's price divided by its book value, and may help determine if the stock is valued fairly.
Price-to-Earnings Ratio is a stock's price divided by after-tax earnings over a trailing 12-month period, which serves as an indicator of value based on earnings.
R-Squared ranges from 0.00 to 100 and measures how closely the Fund's performance matches (or doesn't match) the performance of its benchmark index.
30-day SEC Yield: The SEC yield should be regarded as an estimate of the fund's rate of investment income reflecting an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all current portfolio holdings are held to maturity), and it may not equal the fund's actual income distribution rate or the income paid to a shareholder's account. The yield shown reflects fee waivers in effect, if any. In the absence of such waivers, yields would be reduced. The fund may own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. If so, the yield will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these securities. This adjustment and the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown.
Unsubsidized 30-day SEC Yield: The unsubsidized yield shown is the SEC yield adjusted to reflect the gross expense ratio applicable to the class of shares shown and without regard to the contractual reimbursements and fee waivers required of the fund's investment manager and affiliates.
The 30-day yields may appear to be the same due to rounding.
The Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund and certain other funds own treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) or other inflation indexed securities. For a fund that owns TIPS or other inflation indexed securities, the SEC Yield, when shown, will reflect an inflation adjustment that is attributable to these types of securities. This adjustment as well as the resulting yield can be positive (in the case of inflation) or negative (in the case of deflation) during the period shown. Absent the inflation adjustment, the yield shown may be materially different and may vary significantly from month to month, especially for a fund such as Columbia Inflation Protection Securities Fund which invests substantially in TIPS and other inflation indexed securities. In periods when the SEC yield is exceptionally high due to a rise in the inflation rate, it is important to bear in mind that the adjustment in the yield from the inflation rate may not be repeated.
Sharpe Ratio divides a fund's return in excess of the 90-day Treasury bill by the investment's standard deviation to measure risk-adjusted performance.
Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of the degree to which an individual value in a probability distribution tends to vary from the mean of the distribution.
Turnover Rate (fiscal year end%) measures the percentage of holdings that has been "turned over" or replaced, in the past year.
Average Coupon is a calculation of the total interest cost for a bond issue expressed as a percentage. The average coupon is equal to the total interest payments of an issue divided by bond year dollars.
Duration to Worst is the duration of a bond computed using the bond's nearest call date or maturity, whichever comes first. This measure ignores future cash flow fluctuations due to embedded optionality.

The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.Prior to October 14, 2016, the Ivy Government Money Market Fund was known as the Ivy Money Market Fund. Effective October 14, 2016, the Fund changed its name and investment strategy to reflect that it is classified as a “government money market fund.” Performance prior to October 14, 2016 reflects the Fund’s former investment strategy as a prime money market fund, which permitted investments in certain types of securities that, as a government money market fund, the Fund is no longer permitted to hold.Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.Daily Net Shareholder Flows: Shows daily net shareholder flows (inflows minus outflows) over the last six months for the fund.Daily Liquid Assets: Regulations require that a money market mutual fund hold at least 10% of its total assets in daily liquid assets that can be readily converted to cash in one business day. The graph shows the percentage of daily liquid assets over the last six months for the fund.Weekly Liquid Assets: Regulations require that a money market mutual fund hold at least 30% of its total assets in weekly liquid assets that can be readily converted to cash in five business days.

The red line in the chart shows where a report would be required, compared with the historical NAV per share of the fund.Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.7-Day Annualized Yield: represents past performance and future yields will vary. Principal is not guaranteed. The annualized 7-day yield is calculated based on the income generated by an investment in the fund over a seven-day period and is expressed as an annual percentage rate. The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the fund than the total return quotation.Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV.

Tighter SEC regulations prompting sponsors to look for other options




    By Robert Steyer



 · January 11, 2016



Consultants expect many defined contribution plans to move away from prime money market funds in the face of a looming October deadline for new SEC regulations that might create complications for sponsors. They say the key issue for DC plans is the Securities and Exchange Commission rule requiring providers of prime money market funds to create redemption gates — or limits — on withdrawals by participants and to establish fees on withdrawals to prevent a run on the funds.  “It would be hard to explain to participants why they can't access their money” if a redemption gate were imposed, said Philip Suess, a Chicago-based partner at investment consulting firm Mercer LLC. “Sponsors have to determine their ability to live with redemption gates.”

Among Mercer's DC clients, “it was very quiet” after the SEC issued its rules in July 2014 until the fourth quarter of 2015, he said. “We've now reached the point where sponsors are paying attention. They are realizing that it takes time to implement changes.” Among Mercer's DC clients that have made a decision, “a lot” have moved to government money market funds, which won't be affected by the new rules, he said. “We haven't seen a lot of interest in ultrashort bond funds or stable value,” said Mr. Suess, adding that a client staying with a prime money market account “is the exception.”  Fee amounts and redemption-gate terms depend on how much a money-market fund's weekly liquid assets fall below the fund's total assets, the SEC said. Fund providers have some leeway in setting the amount of fees and length of redemption-gate limits. Although the prospect of imposing redemption gates and fees might be remote, it “will be so far beyond participants' expectations” if fund providers enforce them, said Christopher Lyon, a partner at Rocaton Investment Advisors LLC, Norwalk, Conn. Such a jolt to participants holding a conservative investment could shake their confidence, he said.  Many Rocaton DC clients already offer government money market funds, and those with prime money market funds likely will switch to a government fund because of the SEC rules, Mr. Lyon said. For plans contemplating a change, Rocaton has been recommending since mid-July that they act quickly to avoid being placed in a queue by their record keepers in case of a last-minute rush of sponsors switching funds.



Complicated new rules
“The fees and gates are too complicated for participants,” said Martha Tejera, president of Tejera & Associates, a DC investment and plan-design consulting firm in Seattle. “Prime money market funds will disappear from 401(k) plans.” When the SEC issued its regulations, it exempted DC plans from the floating net asset value requirement that will apply to prime money market funds held by institutions. The SEC said such funds in qualified DC plans will be classified as “retail” funds because their investors are individuals rather than corporations or institutions. Despite the long lead time from the SEC's announcement to enactment, DC industry members say many sponsors still haven't declared if they will keep a prime money market fund or switch to a government money market fund, stable value fund or ultrashort bond fund. “Our client base has been pretty quiet,” said Lorie Latham, a Chicago-based director at Willis Towers Watson PLC, who directs U.S. strategy for investments for DC plans. “We've done quite a lot of education, but there hasn't been much movement. There's still time for sponsors to act.” In a survey of 70 DC sponsors offering some form of money market fund, 

Callan Associates Inc. found that 58.7% of plan executives were still unsure about what they would do. The survey said 17.4% of plan executives won't change anything because they don't offer a prime money market fund, while 13% said the SEC rules affecting prime money market funds are acceptable. Also, 6.5% said they would switch to a stable value option from a prime money market fund, and 4.3% would move to a government money market fund from the prime money market fund. (These responses are part of a broader survey that Callan will publish later this month.) “There will be an aggressive timeline after the first quarter” for sponsors to meet the SEC deadline, said Lori Lucas, the Chicago-based executive vice president and defined contribution practice leader for Callan.90 days to switch 
Consultants say a money market fund switch by sponsors could take as much as 90 days to complete. The plan's investment policy committee has to make a decision, and executives must find a replacement fund. Record keepers also need time to accommodate the changes, and participants must be informed. Robert Salerno, senior vice president, 
Fidelity Investments, Boston, said he's confident Fidelity's record-keeping business can handle DC clients' money-market fund decisions.  Right now, “not many” clients have changed their money market funds, said Mr. Salerno. “They probably have initial indications what they want to do. We won't see a majority of decisions being made until the second quarter.”  Fidelity has made some changes affecting all clients - not just DC plans. For example, it has converted three prime money market funds to government money market funds, and it merged a prime fund and a government fund to create a new government money market fund.  In a recent survey by Pensions & Investments and Rocaton, DC plan sponsors said they believed their peers most likely would replace the prime money market funds with a government or Treasury money market fund. The second most popular outcome would be moving to a stable value fund, followed by retaining the prime money market fund. Sponsors were not asked what they planned to do themselves. When record keepers and consultants were asked what sponsors might do, the P&I/Rocaton survey said the top three choices were shifting to a government or Treasury money market fund, offering a stable value fund and choosing an ultrashort bond fund. The survey reported that 79% of sponsors and 84% of other DC industry members said there must be a “proactive disclosure” to participants about redemption gates and liquidity fees for those plans retaining prime money market funds. In an interview, Mr. Lyon said he was concerned that some money market providers might not explain these requirements “beyond the bare minimum notice.” 	n

Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
YTD (year-to-date return): the net change in the value of the fund's shares (in percentage terms) from January 1, 2017, to the current date shown above.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Terms and Definitions


Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.

USTREAS T-Bill Auction Ave 3 Mon: USTREAS T-Bill Auction Ave 3 Mon is an index that measures the performance of the average investment rate of U.S. Treasury bills (T-Bills) with a three-month maturity. Three-month T-Bills are short-term securities issued by the U.S. government that are generally considered to be risk-free. In calculating index results, Morningstar, the index provider, determines the arithmetic mean of the investment rates on all three-month T-Bills issued during a given month as reported by the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt. The investment rate is then converted into a price and a monthly return, assuming that the T-Bill is held to maturity.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
You could lose money by investing in American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will do so at any time.
  
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness.
The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds. American Funds Strategic Bond Fund may engage in frequent and active trading of its portfolio securities, which may involve correspondingly greater transaction costs, adversely affecting the fund's results.
Fund shares of U.S. Government Securities Fund are not guaranteed by the U.S. government.
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Diversification does not eliminate the risks of investing; losses are possible in diversified portfolios. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. The value of fixed income securities may be affected by changing interest rates and changes in credit ratings of the securities. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Investments in mortgage-related securities involve additional risks, such as prepayment risk, as more fully described in the prospectus. While not directly correlated to changes in interest rates, the values of inflation-linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates and may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund or underlying fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus. Investment allocations for funds of funds may not achieve fund objectives. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds' risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds, as described herein. Each target date fund is composed of a mix of the American Funds and is subject to the risks and returns of the underlying funds. Underlying funds may be added or removed during the year. Although the target date funds are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. American Funds investment professionals manage the target date fund's portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. Investment professionals continue to manage each fund for 30 years after it reaches its target date. The target allocations are as of January 1, 2017, and are subject to the Portfolio Oversight Committee's discretion. The funds’ investment adviser anticipates that the funds will invest their assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below these allocations. Investment professionals gradually adjust the portfolio over time so that it becomes more preservation-oriented. The funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' education savings goals will be met. The target date is the year in which the beneficiary is expected to begin taking withdrawals. Investors and their advisors should periodically evaluate their investment to determine whether it continues to meet their needs. The Retirement Income Portfolio Series' investment allocations may not achieve fund objectives, and adequate income through retirement is not guaranteed. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds’ risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. Payments consisting of return of capital will result in a decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Higher rates of withdrawal and withdrawals during declining markets may result in a more rapid decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Persistent returns of capital could ultimately result in a zero account balance.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes . Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.

            Investing In The Fund
        

What Are the Risks?

Mutual fund shares are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank, and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other agency of the U.S. government.
Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund’s prospectus.

Important Legal Information

CFA® and Chartered Financial Analyst® are trademarks owned by CFA Institute.
Total Returns include change in share price, assume reinvestment of all distributions, and reflect the deduction of fund expenses and applicable fees. Total Returns With Sales Charge: returns reflect the deduction of the stated sales charge. Total returns, distribution rate, and yields reflect any applicable expense reductions, without which the results for those impacted funds would have been lower.
For more information on any of our funds, contact your financial advisor or download a free prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund's investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information.  Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
Most Franklin Templeton funds offer multiple share classes. Share classes are subject to different fees and expenses, which will affect their performance. In general, Class A shares have a maximum initial sales charge; Class C shares have a 1% contingent deferred sales charge; Class Z, Advisor Class and Class R6 shares have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees; Class R shares have no sales charges, but do have a Rule 12b-1 fee.
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
Performance data represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results. Current performance may differ from figures shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.

Footnotes

A statistical measurement of the range of a fund's total returns. In general, a higher standard deviation means greater volatility. Based on the fund's monthly returns over the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A statistical measurement of a fund's historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by taking a fund's excess return over that of the three-month Treasury bill divided by its standard deviation. Higher values generally indicate better historical risk-adjusted performance. Based on the 3 years ended as of the date of the calculation.
The annualized percentage difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk, as measured by beta.  Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Public Offering Price — Purchase price for each share of the fund on a given day. It includes the maximum initial sales charge, if any.
Net asset value or "NAV" per share is the Fund's total assets minus its total liabilities, divided by the number of shares that are outstanding. The Fund calculates NAV per share using "amortized cost value" rather than market value. Amortized cost value is the acquisition cost of assets, as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount. Using this valuation method typically results in a more stable per share NAV than using market value.
Market NAV per share is calculated by valuing total assets at market value.
Daily Liquid Assets and Weekly Liquid Assets are calculated at the master portfolio level.
Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Franklin Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date.

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

						Effective August 1, 2016, Prime Reserve Fund, changed to a government mandate and was 
renamed Government Money Fund. The performance for the periods prior to August 1, 2016 
reflects the performance of the fund when it operated as a prime money market fund and 
invested in certain types of securities that it is no longer permitted to hold. 
Performance prior to this conversion may have been different if the current investment 
limitations had been in effect.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance,

You could lose money by investing in the Fund. 
Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee 
it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's 
sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and 
you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the 
Fund at any time.
    
    





^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

				A method of calculating a money fund's yield by annualizing the 
fund's net investment income for the last seven days of each period 
divided by the fund's net asset value at the end of the period. 
				
3
									
					
					In an effort to maintain a zero or positive net yield for the fund, T. Rowe Price has voluntarily waived all or a portion of the management fee it is entitled to receive from the fund. A fee waiver has the effect of increasing the fund's net yield. The 7-day yield without waiver represents what the yield would have been if we were not waiving our management fee. This voluntary waiver is in addition to any contractual expense ratio limitation in effect for the fund and may be amended or terminated at any time without prior notice. Please see the prospectus for more details. 
					
				
				Year-to-date figures are not annualized and represent total return, 
which includes reinvested distributions (income and capital gains) 
and any change in share price for the given period. The yield quotation 
more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market fund than the total return quotation.

Many of our mutual funds earn Morningstar’s highest ratings
Morningstar 4- and 5-Star Rated Funds







Because of our disciplined approach to investing, Morningstar, a leader in independent investment research, recognizes many of our mutual funds with its highest ratings in the funds' respective categories.

Over 70 of our funds have earned 4- or 5-star Overall Morningstar Ratings as of 5/31/17.*

Morningstar uses a 5-star system to rate mutual funds based on their risk-adjusted returns. Five stars is the highest while one star is the lowest rating. Only the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) are awarded Morningstar's 4- or 5-star rating. By comparison, as of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor Class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.​ Past performance cannot guarantee future results.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

*144 of our 330 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 122 of these 144 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 204 of 311 (66%), 175 of 213, 140 of 178 (79%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
24 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes). 23 of these 24 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 35 of 36, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 168 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 3/31/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

Note:  Federal law limits the number of certain types of withdrawals and transfers from a Money Market Account to a combined total of six per calendar month per account.

Debit Card with Chip Technology




What is chip technology? 




Also known as EMV or smart chip technology, it provides added security at chip-enabled store terminals and ATMs. Many countries have already adopted chip technology. And now, U.S. merchants and card issuers are starting to adopt it, too.






How do I use a chip card? 




You can use chip cards in one of two ways. If you are at a merchant location that does not have chip-enabled terminals, you can swipe using the magnetic stripe on the back of your card as usual.
At merchant locations that already accept chip cards, you'll be prompted to insert your card into the chip-enabled terminal. Be sure to leave the card in the terminal until the transaction is completed.






When do I swipe? When do I insert?




When in doubt, swipe your chip debit card. If the terminal is chip enabled, it will recognize that your debit card has a chip and will prompt you to insert it instead.






Where can I use my Discover debit card with chip technology?




Your Discover debit card is accepted everywhere you use it today. When retailers update their terminals to accept chips, just insert your card instead of swiping the magnetic stripe.






Do chip payments require signatures? Or PINs?




Your new Discover debit card with chip technology can be used with a signature or PIN depending on the terminal. At chip-enabled terminals, you will be prompted to provide your signature or PIN. In some situations, you may not need to provide either one.






I currently have a regular Discover debit card. When will I receive a chip card?




You will receive a chip debit card when your current debit card expires, if your card is lost or stolen, or if you experience fraud on your account.






If we have a joint account, will we both get new chip cards?




Each owner who has a debit card will receive a new chip debit card when their current card expires. If your debit card is lost or stolen, only the person with the lost or stolen card will receive a new chip debit card. If you request a new chip card early, only the requester will receive a new card.






If I am a new customer and just signed up for an account, will I get both types of cards? 




No. New customers will only receive a chip debit card.






If I request a chip card, will my debit card information change?




Yes. Your debit card number, security code, expiration date and PIN will change. Because of this, we recommend updating all places where you have previously linked your debit card, including any automatic bill payments. 
Please note, that if you have a joint account and only one person on the account requests a chip card, then only that person will receive a new chip debit card.






How does the chip work?




When you insert your chip debit card at a chip-enabled terminal, the embedded microchip generates unique, dynamic data for each transaction. This makes it difficult for fraudsters to duplicate your account information, which in turn, can reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions on your account.






What are the benefits?




Chip technology provides an additional layer of card security. Chip cards make it difficult for hackers to copy and use your debit card information when used at chip-enabled terminals. Other benefits include:

Ease of Use: It's still a debit card, so just use it like before. Once merchants adopt this technology, the terminals will prompt you to insert your card. 
Added Security: The chip helps protect against fraud because it creates unique transaction data when the card is used at chip-enabled terminals in stores and at ATMs
Fraud Protection: As always, you're never responsible for unauthorized transactions on your Discover debit card.







Are chip payments contactless or a type of Near Field Communication (NFC) payment?




No. Your Discover debit card with chip technology requires contact with the terminal's chip reader. Waving your card in front of the terminal will not work.






Can I keep my old card and have a chip card, too?




No. Your Discover debit card with chip technology replaces your other card. Once you activate your chip card, which also has a magnetic stripe, your old debit card will be deactivated.

You can use Online Bill Pay for your utilities, credit card payments, insurance premiums or other companies. You can also pay individuals, such as landlords, contractors, relatives, etc.
Note: Payments to governmental agencies, including but not limited to, the Internal Revenue Service, all state and local tax authorities, collection agencies, as well as recipients of court-ordered payments like child support or alimony are highly discouraged and are not covered by our Bill Pay Protection policy in our Online Security Guarantee.
*Federal law limits the number of certain types of withdrawals and transfers from a Money Market Account to a combined total of six per calendar month per account. There is no limit on the number of withdrawals by ATM or by Official Check mailed to you. If you exceed these transaction limitations during any calendar month we may assess an Excessive Withdrawal Fee or refuse to pay each transaction in excess of the limitations. If you exceed these limits on more than an occasional basis, we reserve the right to close your account.






Are there any bills I cannot pay using the Online Bill Pay service?




Yes, bill payments to individuals or organizations outside of the United States are not eligible for the Online Bill Pay service.
In addition, payments that violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation, and any payments related to illegal gambling, illegal gaming and/or any other illegal activity are prohibited through the service.






How will my bill payment be sent?




Your bill payments may be processed using one of several methods: electronic payment, single check, or laser draft check. Both the single and laser draft checks result in a physical check being mailed to the payee.  Discover Bank guarantees that your bill payment will reach your Payee by the "Deliver By" date. Single checks are only valid for 90 days. 






What is an "electronic payment?"




An "electronic payment" means funds are withdrawn immediately from your account and sent electronically (via the Automated Clearing House (ACH)) to the payee.






What happens if a future bill payment is scheduled for a weekend or holiday?




One-time bill payments cannot be scheduled for delivery on a weekend or holiday. However, if a repeating bill payment is scheduled for a weekend or holiday, the payment will be initiated to the payee on the preceding business day.






What is an eBill?




The term eBill stands for "electronic bill" and is an electronic version of your paper bill delivered to you automatically through the Account Center. Once enrolled for eBills, you will have the ability to view and pay bills online anytime.






How can I enroll to have my bills sent electronically?




To sign up to have your bills sent electronically, you will need to log into your account and select the "eBills" option from the drop down menu under the Payments tab. Once on the bill payment page, select "Manage eBills" and choose the appropriate payee from the Request/Cancel eBills drop down menu.






Can I have all my bills sent to me electronically? 




Each payee determines whether or not they will support eBills. For questions about a particular payee's policy, please contact the payee directly. 






How do I unenroll from an eBill?




To unenroll from an eBill, you will need to log into your account and select the "eBills" option in the drop down menu under the Payments tab. Once on the bill payment page, select "Manage eBills" and select the payee from the Request/Cancel eBills drop down menu.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Gather your retirement savings into one place.





Rollovers 


Info

When you rollover funds, you receive the funds through a distribution from your IRA. You then have 60 days from receipt of those funds to roll them into another IRA or qualified retirement plan to avoid tax consequences. IRA owners are limited to only one IRA-to-IRA rollover in any 12 month period. Rollovers are not counted toward your annual IRA contribution limits. You may want to contact a financial advisor or tax professional for further information.

Consolidate investments to make life easier







Transfers


Info

When you transfer an IRA, the funds are moved directly from one financial institution to another. The transfer check is made payable to your financial institution for your benefit. Because you don't handle the funds directly, the transaction is not considered a distribution. There is no limit to the number of transfers you can make.

Opening an Account




How do I decide which IRA CD is the best choice for me?




When choosing which type of IRA to open, you should consider factors such as your taxable income, age, and Tax Filing Status. You may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional to help you determine which type of IRA is best suited to your needs. You can also call our IRA Specialists at  1-800-347-7000 to discuss available products.






What is the difference between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA?




Some contributions to Traditional IRAs are tax deductible and most distributions are taxable. A Roth IRA is a retirement plan for contributions made with after tax dollars. Contributions are nondeductible and all qualified distributions are tax free.






Can a Traditional IRA be converted into a Roth IRA?




Yes. However, a conversion from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA may have tax consequences. Consult a financial adviser or tax professional for guidance. For assistance in completing a conversion, please contact an IRA specialist at 1-800-347-7000.
A Traditional IRA may be converted to a Roth IRA as a direct or indirect conversion. In a direct conversion you never have access to your money. It is sent bank to bank and directly placed into a Roth IRA on your behalf. An indirect conversion is similar to a Rollover. You will receive a check made payable to you that can be deposited into your new Roth IRA account.
Consult a financial advisor or tax professional for guidance. For assistance in completing a conversion, contact an IRA Specialist at 1-800-347-7000 for additional information.






What is the difference between a transfer and a rollover?




When you transfer an IRA, the funds are moved directly from one financial institution to another. The transfer check is made payable to your financial institution for your benefit. Because you don't handle the funds directly, the transaction is not considered a distribution. There is also no limit to the number of transfers you can make.
When you rollover funds, you receive the funds through a distribution from your IRA, and then you have 60 days to deposit the funds into another IRA or other retirement plan in order to avoid tax consequences. IRA owners are limited to only one IRA-to-IRA rollover in any 12 month period.
For both transfers and rollovers, funds need to be moved between the same type of IRA account. For example if you have a Traditional IRA you can only transfer or rollover funds from another Traditional IRA.
Rollovers and transfers are not counted toward your annual IRA contribution limits.






Is there a limit to how often I can rollover funds?




IRA owners are limited to only one IRA-to-IRA rollover in any 12 month period and you can rollover as much money as you want.






Can I have more than one IRA?




Yes, you can have both Traditional and Roth IRA accounts at Discover Bank. Your Traditional IRA accounts will be grouped into and administered under a single Traditional IRA plan, and Roth IRA accounts will be grouped into and administered under a single Roth IRA plan. Additionally, if you maintain Inherited IRA accounts, they will also be in separate plans because they need to be titled separately.
You may not contribute more than the annual allowable maximum across all of your Traditional and Roth IRA accounts at all of your financial institutions.






Can I contribute to both a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA?




Yes, you can contribute to both plan types. Your annual contribution can be divided between both types as long as you meet the eligibility requirements for each IRA type. For advice on the best way to contribute, you may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional. For general questions and information regarding your IRA Accounts, you can call our IRA Specialists at 1-800-347-7000.






Can I designate a beneficiary for my IRA CD?




Yes. We encourage all of our IRA account holders to designate at least one beneficiary by completing a beneficiary form.PDF Document We also suggest updating your beneficiary information on a regular basis. If a beneficiary is not designated, any beneficiary payment will generally go to the IRA owner's estate, which is subject to any applicable community property state law requirements.

Can I transfer funds from my employer's retirement plan into an IRA CD?




Yes. Funds may be moved into an IRA CD from any qualified retirement account. This transaction is done via a Direct or Indirect Rollover. You may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional. You may also call our IRA Specialists at 1-800-347-7000 for more information.






What happens when my IRA CD matures?




We will send a notification 30 days before your IRA CD matures. When your IRA CD matures, you may make a deposit or withdrawal and change the term of your IRA CD during the grace period. The grace period lasts for 9 days immediately following the maturity date. Your IRA CD will automatically renew if you don't take any action during the grace period. Any term change, deposit, or withdrawal of principal during the grace period will end the grace period. Interest withdrawals will not affect the grace period.
In the event you want to add prior or current year funds to your IRA CD during the grace period, you will need to submit the appropriate contribution form designating the tax year for your deposit. If you are moving IRA funds at other financial institutions to your Discover IRA CD during the grace period, you will need to timely submit the appropriate correctly completed rollover or transfer form. If you decide to close your IRA CD account or take a partial distribution during the grace period, you will need to submit the appropriate correctly completed distribution form.  






Will I receive a confirmation when my IRA CD automatically renews?




Yes. You will receive a confirmation letter when your IRA CD automatically renews.






Will I receive a certificate for my IRA CD?




You will not receive a paper certificate for your IRA CD; however, you will receive a welcome kit when you open your IRA CD. You can access your IRA CD information anytime via the Account Center.






When will I receive my IRA CD statement?




IRA CD statements are sent annually in January. We encourage you to register for access to the Account Center so that you can view your account between statements.






How much of my IRA CD contribution is tax deductible?




Consult a financial advisor or a tax professional to help you determine exactly how much of your IRA contribution is tax deductible.






What are the rules regarding distribution of assets to my beneficiaries after death?




Traditional and Roth IRA plans offer multiple options for beneficiary distribution. There are several rules concerning required minimum distributions (RMDs) to beneficiaries. The rules apply considerations such as the age at time of death.  Please note that RMD rules in the event of account owner death are different from RMD rules when the account owner turns 701/2. For example, the beneficiary may be required to satisfy the IRA CD owner's RMD prior to making the RMD for the chosen beneficiary option. Consult a financial advisor or tax professional to help you determine the rules concerning distributions to beneficiaries.






How are my IRA CD transactions reported to the IRS?




Any contributions made during the tax year will be reported on form 5498. Additionally, any Rollovers, Conversions, Recharacterizations and the fair market value are also reported on form 5498. We will send Form 5498 to you and the IRS by May 31. Any distributions made from your IRA during a tax year will be reported on form 1099-R.We will send Form 1099-R to you by January 31.

If we receive contributions via ACH or wire before receiving the correctly and fully executed Plan Agreement, those contributions will be returned. However, if a check is received prior to the receipt of the Plan Agreement, we will hold it for up to 30 days. If the correctly and fully executed Plan Agreement, Contribution Form, and Signature Card are not received within those 30 days, the check will be returned. Please note that IRA funding checks will not be deposited and no interest will be paid until the IRA CD is opened.

*Please note that Traveler Checks will not be accepted for deposit.






Can I make additional deposits to my IRA CD?




Additional deposits cannot be made during the term of any IRA CD. However, once your IRA CD matures, you can deposit additional funds once during the grace period. In the event you want to add prior or current year funds to your IRA CD at the time of maturity, you will need to submit the appropriate correctly completed contribution form in a timely manner designating the tax year for your deposit. If you are combining other IRA CDs and contributing them to your Discover IRA CD at the time of maturity, you will need to submit the appropriate rollover or transfer form. If you decide to close your account or take a partial distribution at the time of maturity, you will need to submit the appropriate correctly completed distribution form in a timely manner.




Interest/APY




When will I start earning interest on new deposits?




You will start to earn interest on the business day your deposit is received. However, if we receive a check deposit before your account is opened, interest will begin to accrue on the deposit on the business day your account is opened. Please note that an IRA account is not considered open until we receive all required plan documentation.






How is interest on my IRA CD calculated?




Interest is compounded daily, credited to your account monthly, and calculated on a 365-day basis.




Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)




Do I have to submit a form to request my RMD?




Yes. We require that all distributions be requested using the distribution formPDF Document or 70½ election formPDF Document. You should submit your requests for RMDs by December 15 to ensure adequate time for processing by the December 31 deadline.






Where do I find the form for my RMD?




To access the distribution form, click herePDF Document. To access the 70½ election form click herePDF Document.






How do I submit my RMD form?




You can submit the completed form to us by mail, fax, or through our Secure Document Upload when you are logged into the Account Center. Please remember you should mail all forms by December 15 to guarantee processing by the December 31 deadline.Discover Bank PO Box 30418 Salt Lake City, UT 84130Fax: 1-801-996-2683






When should I expect to receive my RMD?




We will process your RMD request upon receipt and you should expect to receive your distribution within 10 business days.






What is the deadline for submitting my RMD request?




The deadline to submit a correct and complete distribution form for RMD is December 15. We cannot guarantee forms received after December 15 will be processed by the December 31 deadline.






Do I have to take my RMD from my Discover IRA CD or can I take it from an IRA I have at another financial institution?




You can fulfill your RMD requirements from a Traditional IRA or combination of Traditional IRAs at any financial institution(s).






How do I find out how much I'm required to take from my IRA CD?




Financial institutions typically send notices early in the year to advise IRA customers of their RMD requirements, including withdrawal amount required. Discover Bank notifies IRA owners of RMD requirements on the IRA annual statement and on form 5498. You can access and view form 5498 as well as your account statement online when you log into the Account Center. 
If you did not receive these forms from us or have misplaced them, please call us at 1-800-347-7000.
                                        






Will Federal and/or State withholding be applied to my RMD?




Federal and State withholding will be applied where required by federal and/or state laws. In some cases, you will be able to indicate that you prefer no withholding or more withholding than is required. You will always be responsible for the income tax obligations of distributions from your IRA accounts. You may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional to make sure your withholding elections are right for you. If you fail to waive or designate withholding elections on the distribution form, we will process the minimum required for Federal and State according to the IRS guidelines.






Are there tax consequences if I fail to take an RMD by the December 31st deadline?




If you are required to take an RMD, failing to do so may result in tax consequences from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). For more specifics regarding the consequences, you may want to consult a financial advisor or tax professional. For general questions and information regarding your IRA, please call our IRA Specialists at 1-800-347-7000.

You can use your Discover debit card to withdraw cash at ATMs and make purchases at participating merchants in Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean wherever you see the Discover, PULSE®, or Diners Club International® symbols.
Note:  Federal law limits the number of certain types of withdrawals and transfers from a Money Market Account to a combined total of six per calendar month per account. There is no limit on the number of withdrawals by ATM or by Official Check mailed to you.

Yes. The Discover ATM withdrawal limit is $510 per day. Some ATMs may have lower withdrawal limits, but you may complete multiple transactions until you meet the Discover withdrawal limit of $510 per day.




Debit Card with Chip Technology




What is chip technology? 




Also known as EMV or smart chip technology, it provides added security at chip-enabled store terminals and ATMs. Many countries have already adopted chip technology. And now, U.S. merchants and card issuers are starting to adopt it, too.






How do I use a chip card? 




You can use chip cards in one of two ways. If you are at a merchant location that does not have chip-enabled terminals, you can swipe using the magnetic stripe on the back of your card as usual.
At merchant locations that already accept chip cards, you'll be prompted to insert your card into the chip-enabled terminal. Be sure to leave the card in the terminal until the transaction is completed.






When do I swipe? When do I insert?




When in doubt, swipe your chip debit card. If the terminal is chip enabled, it will recognize that your debit card has a chip and will prompt you to insert it instead.






Where can I use my Discover debit card with chip technology?




Your Discover debit card is accepted everywhere you use it today. When retailers update their terminals to accept chips, just insert your card instead of swiping the magnetic stripe.






Do chip payments require signatures? Or PINs?




Your new Discover debit card with chip technology can be used with a signature or PIN depending on the terminal. At chip-enabled terminals, you will be prompted to provide your signature or PIN. In some situations, you may not need to provide either one.






I currently have a regular Discover debit card. When will I receive a chip card?




You will receive a chip debit card when your current debit card expires, if your card is lost or stolen, or if you experience fraud on your account.






If we have a joint account, will we both get new chip cards?




Each owner who has a debit card will receive a new chip debit card when their current card expires. If your debit card is lost or stolen, only the person with the lost or stolen card will receive a new chip debit card. If you request a new chip card early, only the requester will receive a new card.






If I am a new customer and just signed up for an account, will I get both types of cards? 




No. New customers will only receive a chip debit card.






If I request a chip card, will my debit card information change?




Yes. Your debit card number, security code, expiration date and PIN will change. Because of this, we recommend updating all places where you have previously linked your debit card, including any automatic bill payments. 
Please note, that if you have a joint account and only one person on the account requests a chip card, then only that person will receive a new chip debit card.






How does the chip work?




When you insert your chip debit card at a chip-enabled terminal, the embedded microchip generates unique, dynamic data for each transaction. This makes it difficult for fraudsters to duplicate your account information, which in turn, can reduce the risk of fraudulent transactions on your account.






What are the benefits?




Chip technology provides an additional layer of card security. Chip cards make it difficult for hackers to copy and use your debit card information when used at chip-enabled terminals. Other benefits include:

Ease of Use: It's still a debit card, so just use it like before. Once merchants adopt this technology, the terminals will prompt you to insert your card. 
Added Security: The chip helps protect against fraud because it creates unique transaction data when the card is used at chip-enabled terminals in stores and at ATMs
Fraud Protection: As always, you're never responsible for unauthorized transactions on your Discover debit card.







Are chip payments contactless or a type of Near Field Communication (NFC) payment?




No. Your Discover debit card with chip technology requires contact with the terminal's chip reader. Waving your card in front of the terminal will not work.






Can I keep my old card and have a chip card, too?




No. Your Discover debit card with chip technology replaces your other card. Once you activate your chip card, which also has a magnetic stripe, your old debit card will be deactivated.

Premier High Yield Savings Account FAQs
I noticed that the APY will be lower if my balance exceeds $100,000.  How can I ensure I get and maintain the top APY offered on my Premier High Yield Savings Account?
The Premier High Yield Savings account features exceptional interest rates, and our top APY is reserved for savers with balances no greater than $100,000.  Once the balance rises above $100,000, the APY will decline.   To get and maintain the top APY offered (currently 1.30%), keep your balance (and this includes deposits AND interest) below $100,000.  If your balance exceeds $100,000 your APY will decline to 1.25%, based on current rates.  The Premier High Yield Savings Account is a variable rate account and the interest rates may change without notice.
What can I do to set an alert on my account to notify me of my balance level?
After you open an account, you'll receive an email with simple instructions on how to create an alert  that will notify you when your balance reaches a set level.  It's fast and easy to set up.




1 APY  -  Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of July 7, 2017: 1.30% APY on balances of $100,000 or less; 1.25% APY on balances greater than $100,000. Interest is paid on the entire account balance based on the interest rate and APY in effect that day for the balance tier associated with the end-of-day account balance. For example: A balance of $95,000 will earn 1.30% APY, and a balance of $105,000 will earn 1.25% APY. Minimum opening deposit is $100. Interest rates for the Premier High Yield Savings account are variable and may change at any time without prior notice.
2 Limited-time bonus offer.  The bonus offer of $100 is valid on Premier High Yield Savings accounts opened using promotional code PREMIER between July 7, 2017 and September 8, 2017, provided that all of the following requirements are met, and subject to the additional limitations shown below:

The account must be funded within 30 calendar days from the account opening date.
A Monthly Balance of at least $15,000 must be maintained for the first three full statement cycles.  A full statement cycle is defined as beginning the first day of a month and ending the last day of that same month.  For example, if an account were opened on July 10, 2017, the first full statement cycle would be for the period of August 1 through August 31, 2017; the July statement cycle would be excluded because it covers only part of the month. For bonus purposes, the Monthly Balance for each full statement cycle is calculated as follows: at the end of each day, the Premier High Yield Savings account balance is recorded.  When the statement cycle ends, these end-of-day balances are added together and then divided by the number of days in the statement cycle to determine the Monthly Balance.  
All funds used to qualify for bonus eligibility must be new funds.  Funds on deposit with CIT Bank, N.A. or its OneWest Bank division at any time during the 90 days preceding account opening are ineligible and will not be included in the calculation of the Monthly Balance.
The account must remain open and in good standing at the time of the bonus payment or the bonus will be forfeited.  

Additional bonus limitations:Limit one Premier High Yield Savings account bonus offer per customer.  If multiple accounts are opened by a customer, only one account will be eligible for the bonus. 
Customers who received a CIT Bank bonus payment or enrolled in another CIT Bank bonus offer between January 1, 2017 and July 14, 2017 (regardless of whether the bonus has yet been paid) are not eligible for this Premier High Yield Savings account bonus offer.
A $100 bonus will be deposited to the Premier High Yield Savings account of the qualified customer within 45 days of the end of the third full statement cycle following account opening.  For example, a customer who qualified for the bonus on a Premier High Yield Savings account opened on July 10, 2017, would receive a statement credit of $100 no later than December 15, 2017.
The bonus payment is reported as interest earned on IRS Form 1099-INT for the calendar year in which it was paid.  Recipient is responsible for any applicable taxes.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
