Ecoglow chick brooders - Safe and efficient

Brinsea® Ecoglow chick brooders are highly efficient low cost brooders ideal for keeping newly hatched chicken, game and waterfowl warm. They are available in 2 sizes: the EcoGlow 20 suitable for up to 15 chicks and the EcoGlow 50 for up to 40 chicks.

These radiant heaters are far more efficient than conventional infra red brooder lamps as well as being much safer since they run from a 12volts transformer. The brooder panel height can be adjusted to match chicks of different sizes from quail to goose.






Products
More Information

The EcoGlow chick brooders are designed to be extremely economical to use, especially for small numbers of birds.  A typical heat lamp runs at 250 watts compared with 14 watts for the EcoGlow 20. Considering the brooder is on 24/7, this is an important saving.
 
To get the best use from this low power unit it is important to understand that there is no big margin of ‘spare’ heat and some precautions need to be taken depending on the ambient temperature in the room, and on the age and number of chicks –and the size or species.
 
First, it is better to have the unit on a lower height setting, if in doubt.  The chicks will move away from the EcoGlow if they are too warm.  If brooding very young quail or very small numbers of any small birds, it is a good idea to confine them in a cardboard box at least twice the size of the EcoGlow, but put the brooder against one side of the box so that the birds can only enter on the other side.  This conserves warmth under the brooder but still allows birds to move freely out into the open as they wish.  Another useful trick is to put the whole box on a slab of 1” Styrofoam to reduce heat loss from the bottom.  
 
In an extreme case, it can be useful to remove one end of the EcoGlow so that it rests directly on the floor.  The other end is best at the middle or higher position.  This gives very small birds to option to touch the warm surface or adjust their position for maximum comfort.
 
Because the heat from the black underside of the EcoGlow is largely radiant, measuring the temperature with a thermometer is of little value.  Radiant heat passes through air without warming it. Only a solid object will absorb and be warmed by Radiant heat. So a thermometer will register the air temperature but not the radiant heat and will usually show some 5 to 10°F lower than the effective temperature felt by the chicks.  Always watch the behavior of the birds.  They will naturally huddle together if they are cool.  The more of them, the less external warmth they need.
 
For larger numbers of birds, two to four EcoGlow 20 can be assembled side by side.  Above four units, it is probably better to leave a gap between units for birds to exit freely. The new larger EcoGlow 50 is now also available.

Mini II and Maxi II Incubators - Clear Winners 

The popular Brinsea® Mini 7 egg incubator has been improved and joined by a 14 egg big brother. The new Mini II and Maxi II are small, high quality, low cost, egg incubators combining ease of use, performance and exceptional value. With three feature levels available in each size there is a model to suit everyone.


















 
The Mini II and Maxi II Eco with proportional electronic temperature control and manual turning are entry level models and ideal hatchers.
The Mini II and Maxi II Advance with Brinsea's fully digital control system include programmable automatic turning with count down to hatch day and autoturn stop, accurate control and display of temperature and alarms.



The Mini II and Maxi II EX include integral automatic humidity control for complete peace of mind.







Products
More Information


The three versions of the Mini II and Maxi II egg incubators give a wide choice of convenience, sophistication and price but all provide the essential environmental control necessary for successful egg hatching.

Cabinet 



The high quality incubator cabinet is entirely injection molded from high grade ABS plastic which makes it durable and easy to clean. The top of the incubator is fantastically clear allowing excellent visibility of the eggs and chicks.

The plastics used incorporate Biomaster™ antimicrobial additives proven to reduce bacterial growth by 99.99% and 100% safe for eggs, chicks and humans. Protecting hatches from microbial transfer by cross contamination helps reduce unexplained hatching failures.


Humidity and Ventilation




Air is circulated by a long life computer grade fan which, coupled with the unique air diffuser leads to extremely even air temperature throughout the egg chamber. Fresh air in the Maxi II is controlled with a vent slider and humidity is provided by central water reservoirs in the base now with convenient external water top-up. 







Advance Digital Controls

The Brinsea® Mini II and Maxi II Advance incorporate digital micro-control which allows the user to manage incubator functions via a simple 3-button menu. 

In normal operation the display shows incubation temperature, days to hatch and turning status. Opening the menu allows the user to adjust incubation temperature, the unit (°C or °F), turning interval, turning angle, number of days your eggs take to hatch and high and low temperature alarm limits. 

Note. The Mini II and Maxi II EX do not have the days to hatch count down feature but instead display and full control of humidity. 



 EX Automatic Humidity Control 

Humidity is a crucial factor in the successful hatching of eggs and the EX version of the Mini II and Maxi II puts accurate control of humidity in the hands of breeder of valuable and hard-to-incubate eggs. 

The Mini II and Maxi II EX integral automatic humidity control effectively maintains the humidity level precisely at the level the user sets irrespective of changes in room humidity and so overcomes problems that can commonly lead to eggs failing to hatch – especially in the latest stages of incubation. 

The use of an external water reservoir (not provided) also eliminates the chances of water in the incubator harboring bacteria.


Egg Handling

In the manual turn Mini II and Maxi II Eco eggs just sit in the base of the incubator. In the automatic Advance and EX versions eggs are turned by rotating egg disks. Two disks are available, one for eggs of all sizes up to duck (supplied as standard) with a second small egg disk holding eggs up to the size of pheasant available as an optional extra. 


Warranty


All Brinsea® egg incubators are fully guaranteed for 3 years and will be repaired or replaced if a fault should arise within the warranty period (See terms of warranty). Brinsea® Products and their agents will not be responsible for loss of eggs in the event of failure, however caused, and the user is advised to arrange his own insurance cover where loss of power, mechanical or electrical failure might result in unacceptable losses. 


The Brinsea® Mini II Eco and Mini II Advance incubators are designed to use for the education of children although they are not toys and should be used only under adult supervision. 

In order that we continue our policy of innovation and improvement we reserve the right to alter the specification without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
