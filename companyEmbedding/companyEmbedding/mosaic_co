Who We Are
The United Nations estimates that world population will climb from 7 billion to 9 billion by 2050, and increasing global prosperity means more demand for meat—and for the grain to feed cattle, pigs and chickens raised for food. For that many human beings to thrive on our planet, the world’s farmers must produce more food, fuel and fiber. And they will need fertilizers to do it.
At Mosaic, our mission is to help the world grow the food it needs. By striving to produce and deliver the highest quality, most innovative crop nutrition products, we help farmers rise to the challenge.
As one of the world’s largest producers and marketers of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients, we deliver value from mine to market: We mine phosphate from Mosaic-owned land in Central Florida, and through our joint venture in Peru. Our joint venture in Saudi Arabia plans to yield 3 million tonnes of phosphate annually when complete, and Mosaic will market 25 percent of that production.
We mine potash in Saskatchewan and New Mexico. With those minerals we produce high-quality fertilizers and animal feed, then market and deliver our finished products—about half to customers in North America, and half to customers around the world, including those in all key agricultural regions.
We conduct this critical work with abiding integrity and excellence, for the benefit of all our stakeholders. It starts with an intense focus on achieving an injury- and incident-free workplace, and extends to agronomic insight and value for our customers, financial reward for our shareholders, good stewardship of natural resources, and a deep understanding of our obligations to our communities.

Overview
The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS) is the world's leading  integrated producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash. We employ nearly 9,000 people in six countries and participate in every aspect of crop nutrition development.
We mine phosphate rock from nearly 200,000 acres of Mosaic-owned land in Central Florida, and we mine potash from four mines in North America, primarily in Saskatchewan. Our products are processed into crop nutrients, and then shipped via rail, barge and ocean-going vessel to our customers in the major agricultural centers of the world.
The work of mining and processing potash and phosphate minerals is an energy- and water-intensive endeavor. We work carefully to maximize efficiencies and minimize our use of energy and natural resources, and have made significant progress in reducing Mosaic’s environmental footprint.
Mosaic is an important driver of economic activity in each of our operating communities. We strive to be a thoughtful and engaged neighbor, using our financial resources, expertise and innovative spirit to demonstrate our shared commitment to good corporate citizenship.




Potash

            Mosaic is a leader in the potash industry with annual capacity of 10.5 million tonnes of product per year, which accounts for approximately 12% of world annual capacity and 40% of North American annual capacity. Production during 2016 totaled 7.6 million tonnes, or approximately 13% of estimated world annual production and 42% of estimated North American annual production.
In 2016, we operated three potash mines in Canada, including two shaft mines with a total of three production shafts and one solution mine, as well as one potash shaft mine in the United States. We also own related refineries at each of the mines. Construction of our new Saskatchewan potash operation, Esterhazy K3, remains on target, with work expected to continue into 2024. Upon completion of K3, Mosaic's Esterhazy operation is expected to be the largest, most competitive underground potash mine in the world. Mosaic is committed to building strong relationships with the communities that surround our operations. First Nations and Métis people are an important part of the community in Saskatchewan, Canada, where we operate. Many Indigenous communities, particularly those in Treaty 4 territory, neighbor our potash facilities.




Phosphate

            With annual capacity greater than the next two largest producers combined, Mosaic is one of the world’s largest producers of finished phosphate products. We own and operate mines and production facilities in Florida which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and phosphate-based animal feed ingredients, and processing plants in Louisiana, which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients.
Our U.S. phosphates operations have capacity to produce approximately 5.3 million tonnes of phosphoric acid, and approximately 17.2 million tonnes of phosphate rock, the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and feed phosphate. Approximately one-third of our phosphate products are shipped within North America, with the remainder exported globally through our own distribution channels.




History
Mosaic is a young company rooted in history and experience. Recognized as innovators in our field, this status owes much to the combined strengths of the crop nutrition business of Cargill, Inc. and IMC Global Inc., our founding companies. Each of these companies has been recognized as worldwide leaders in the crop nutrition industry for decades. In 2014, Mosaic completed its acquisition of the phosphate business of CF Industries, Inc., and Archer Daniels Midland Company's fertilizer distribution business in Brazil and Paraguay.
IMC Global dates back to 1909, when entrepreneur Thomas Meadows became involved in the phosphate mining business. In 1940, the company mined 50,000 tonnes of potash from its Carlsbad, N.M., plant. IMC Global mined approximately 1.7 million tonnes in the same location in 2003, helping the company earn $2.2 billion in revenue.
A grain backhaul opportunity launched the crop nutrition business of Cargill in the 1960s. Product was needed to fill empty barges to make a profitable roundtrip, so Cargill — already a leading agribusiness company — entered the crop nutrition business. From there, the division grew to be one of the world's top producers of phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer.
Today, Mosaic is the world's leading producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash. We employ nearly 9,000 people in six countries and participate in every aspect of crop nutrition development.

Potash[edit]

Mosaic has 9.3 million tonnes of operational capacity (excluding a tolling agreement). Following completion of several expansion projects, Mosaic expects to have an annual operational capacity of approximately 15 million tonnes by 2021. Mosaic operates five potash mines.
Product from its Canadian mines is exported through Canpotex, an export association of Canadian potash producers.
Potash mines are located in:[4]

Phosphate[edit]
Mosaic is the largest producer of finished phosphate products with an annual capacity greater than the next two largest producers combined. It has a global distribution network made up of plants, port facilities, warehouses and sales offices. In 2013 Mosaic produced 7.6 million tons of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and over 15 million tons of phosphate rock production.[5] In October, 2013, Mosaic reached an agreement to purchase the phosphate operations of CF Industries for 1.4 billion dollars, which eliminates the need for Mosaic to spend an additional billion dollars to build a new processing facility in Hardee County, Florida to process the rock from their mines in that area.[6]
Approximately one-third of the company's phosphate product is shipped within North America, with the remainder exported globally through both PhosChem, an export association, and through its own distribution channel.
Phosphate mines are located in the Bone Valley Formation of the Peace River watershed in Central Florida:[4]

Mosaic Stadium[edit]
The company has placed its name on two stadiums in Regina, Saskatchewan. The first, originally called Park Hughes and later as Taylor Field, was built on the site of a sports field that was first used by the Regina Rugby Club in 1921, and became full-time home to the team once a complete stadium was built there in 1936. It remained the team's home through name changes to Regina Roughriders and Saskatchewan Roughriders, and changes in league affiliation from the Western Canada Rugby Football Union to today's Canadian Football League. The Riders continued to play at the stadium through the 2016 CFL season.[7] In 2014, the company signed a naming rights contract to place its name on the first stadium's replacement, located a few blocks west of the original stadium.[8] The new stadium opened in October 2016, with the Riders set to move in for the 2017 season.[9]

Potash[edit]

Mosaic has 9.3 million tonnes of operational capacity (excluding a tolling agreement). Following completion of several expansion projects, Mosaic expects to have an annual operational capacity of approximately 15 million tonnes by 2021. Mosaic operates five potash mines.
Product from its Canadian mines is exported through Canpotex, an export association of Canadian potash producers.
Potash mines are located in:[4]

Carlsbad, New Mexico (32°24′44″N 103°56′20″W﻿ / ﻿32.4122°N 103.939°W﻿ / 32.4122; -103.939)

Potash[edit]




K3 North Shaft headframe. Esterhazy, Saskatchewan


Mosaic has 9.3 million tonnes of operational capacity (excluding a tolling agreement). Following completion of several expansion projects, Mosaic expects to have an annual operational capacity of approximately 15 million tonnes by 2021. Mosaic operates five potash mines.
Product from its Canadian mines is exported through Canpotex, an export association of Canadian potash producers.
Potash mines are located in:[4]

Carlsbad, New Mexico (32°24′44″N 103°56′20″W﻿ / ﻿32.4122°N 103.939°W﻿ / 32.4122; -103.939)

Phosphate[edit]
Mosaic is the largest producer of finished phosphate products with an annual capacity greater than the next two largest producers combined. It has a global distribution network made up of plants, port facilities, warehouses and sales offices. In 2013 Mosaic produced 7.6 million tons of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and over 15 million tons of phosphate rock production.[5] In October, 2013, Mosaic reached an agreement to purchase the phosphate operations of CF Industries for 1.4 billion dollars, which eliminates the need for Mosaic to spend an additional billion dollars to build a new processing facility in Hardee County, Florida to process the rock from their mines in that area.[6]
Approximately one-third of the company's phosphate product is shipped within North America, with the remainder exported globally through both PhosChem, an export association, and through its own distribution channel.
Phosphate mines are located in the Bone Valley Formation of the Peace River watershed in Central Florida:[4]

Fort Meade, Florida (27°38′52″N 81°45′23″W﻿ / ﻿27.6479°N 81.7565°W﻿ / 27.6479; -81.7565)

Mosaic Stadium[edit]
The company has placed its name on two stadiums in Regina, Saskatchewan. The first, originally called Park Hughes and later as Taylor Field, was built on the site of a sports field that was first used by the Regina Rugby Club in 1921, and became full-time home to the team once a complete stadium was built there in 1936. It remained the team's home through name changes to Regina Roughriders and Saskatchewan Roughriders, and changes in league affiliation from the Western Canada Rugby Football Union to today's Canadian Football League. The Riders continued to play at the stadium through the 2016 CFL season.[7] In 2014, the company signed a naming rights contract to place its name on the first stadium's replacement, located a few blocks west of the original stadium.[8] The new stadium opened in October 2016, with the Riders set to move in for the 2017 season.[9]

Headquartered in Plymouth, Minnesota, Mosaic employs approximately 9,000 people in eight countries.[2]

Potash[edit]




K3 North Shaft headframe. Esterhazy, Saskatchewan


Mosaic has 9.3 million tonnes of operational capacity (excluding a tolling agreement). Following completion of several expansion projects, Mosaic expects to have an annual operational capacity of approximately 15 million tonnes by 2021. Mosaic operates five potash mines.
Product from its Canadian mines is exported through Canpotex, an export association of Canadian potash producers.
Potash mines are located in:[4]

Carlsbad, New Mexico (32°24′44″N 103°56′20″W﻿ / ﻿32.4122°N 103.939°W﻿ / 32.4122; -103.939)

Esterhazy, Saskatchewan (50°39′34″N 101°50′32″W﻿ / ﻿50.6595°N 101.8421°W﻿ / 50.6595; -101.8421 and 50°43′46″N 101°56′5″W﻿ / ﻿50.72944°N 101.93472°W﻿ / 50.72944; -101.93472)

Phosphate[edit]
Mosaic is the largest producer of finished phosphate products with an annual capacity greater than the next two largest producers combined. It has a global distribution network made up of plants, port facilities, warehouses and sales offices. In 2013 Mosaic produced 7.6 million tons of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and over 15 million tons of phosphate rock production.[5] In October, 2013, Mosaic reached an agreement to purchase the phosphate operations of CF Industries for 1.4 billion dollars, which eliminates the need for Mosaic to spend an additional billion dollars to build a new processing facility in Hardee County, Florida to process the rock from their mines in that area.[6]
Approximately one-third of the company's phosphate product is shipped within North America, with the remainder exported globally through both PhosChem, an export association, and through its own distribution channel.
Phosphate mines are located in the Bone Valley Formation of the Peace River watershed in Central Florida:[4]

Fort Meade, Florida (27°38′52″N 81°45′23″W﻿ / ﻿27.6479°N 81.7565°W﻿ / 27.6479; -81.7565)

Mosaic Stadium[edit]
The company has placed its name on two stadiums in Regina, Saskatchewan. The first, originally called Park Hughes and later as Taylor Field, was built on the site of a sports field that was first used by the Regina Rugby Club in 1921, and became full-time home to the team once a complete stadium was built there in 1936. It remained the team's home through name changes to Regina Roughriders and Saskatchewan Roughriders, and changes in league affiliation from the Western Canada Rugby Football Union to today's Canadian Football League. The Riders continued to play at the stadium through the 2016 CFL season.[7] In 2014, the company signed a naming rights contract to place its name on the first stadium's replacement, located a few blocks west of the original stadium.[8] The new stadium opened in October 2016, with the Riders set to move in for the 2017 season.[9]

The Mosaic Villages Project: Helping Smallholder Farmers


Play all


        In many areas of the world smallholder farmers, in particular, are trapped in a cycle of insufficient crop yields and poverty. Generally living on one acre of land or less, they often struggle simply to feed themselves—much less generate a surplus of food. With the world's ever-growing population, helping smallholder farmers become more productive is imperative.Since 2008, The Mosaic Company and The Mosaic Company Foundation have invested in programs in Guatemala, India, Mali, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Ethiopia in collaboration with several partner organizations. The average yield across the Mosaic Villages Project has increased three to five times when compared to traditional farming practices.

Marble
Collection


 























































‹›



 From Greek statues to Roman baths, marble has been used for centuries in just about every possible interior and exterior application. Marble is generally thought to be from Italy, but in actuality it is quarried all over the world. The Romans carried marble home from far corners of their empire, giving marble its time honored cache. Marble is a unique natural stone created by limestone deposits. Re-crystallized through the action of heat and pressure, marble literally morphs into its unique patterns, colors, and swirls, with no two pieces ever identical.
Marble has become extremely popular in the United States in the last five years. Marble has the same general properties of limestone, only becomes more beautiful over time and use. Most marble has veining mineral deposits throughout. It is very popular for fireplaces, countertops, bar-tops, backsplash, flooring, and bathrooms, and comes in a wide range of colors.
We import all of our marble slabs directly from the quarries in Italy, Portugal and Spain. This allows us to offer our clients the finest quality marble with the best pricing in Palo Alto, San Jose, San Francisco, Atherton, Sunnyvale, Los Altos, Carmel, Monterey, and Pebble Beach. With its beautiful veining and patterns, marble always adds elegance to any kitchen. It also provides a lush backdrop for your perfect bathroom and is strong, durable, and easy to clean. Let Carmel Stone Imports selection of shades and styles of marble transform your home.

Testimonials
"All Natural Stone has an amazing selection and the best customer service. We worked on our "high end" bathroom with them and came back again for another remodel project. High integrity and commitment to dates. They are also great at helping think through design."
- Ron S., Menlo Park

"So many choices, and amazing  service! When we remodeled our kitchen we checked several places in the city and on the Peninsula. Couldn't find a better selection than here. Got our countertops and backsplash all in one place!"
- Jonathan S., San Francisco

"A fantastic selection. Wow! The most beautiful samples.  The sales person was very helpful but not overly so.  She told us if we made an appointment, she would show us different tile combinations.  We are definitely going back to do that."

Porcelain Tile
Porcelain tile, a sister of ceramic tile, is composed of a much finer clay than ceramic and is fired at higher temperatures. This process makes porcelain tile more homogeneous; achieving through-body coloration, making scratches and nicks less obvious. It also makes porcelain much stronger and less prone to moisture and stain absorption. For those reasons, porcelain can be used in both indoor and outdoor applications.
 
 

Natural Stone Tile
Natural stone tile is available in almost as many styles as clay tile, with polished marble flooring, granite flooring, slate flooring or the very popular travertine, and have become the hallmarks of formal interiors. As with any natural product, you can expect imperfections common to the type of flooring you are purchasing. These imperfections only add to the aesthetic appeal and won’t devalue your new floor. If you’ve ever admired the beauty of a stone fireplace, you can begin to appreciate the beauty this type of look can bring to your entire space.
 
 

Terra Cotta Tile
The earthy look of terra cotta tile brings a traditional European flavor to the design of your home. Used for centuries, the timeless appeal of terra cotta tile makes it’s use as popular today as it was in centuries past. The versatility of terra cotta tile means that it can be used in kitchen backsplashes, counters, floors, and walls; and when installed correctly terra cotta tile should wear beautifully for a lifetime. Made from natural clays, terra cotta ceramic tile varies in size, color, and texture. This material is perfectly suited for any setting which requires a more casual setting or relaxed atmosphere.
 
 

Ceramic Tile
Ceramic tile is generally made with red clay-based materials and other natural materials that are mined buy kamagra 100mg generic viagra from the earth. Traditional ceramic tile can be naturally colored and left unglazed, like terra cotta. It can also feature colored or highly designed surfaces, which can be glazed (finished with a glass surface) from matte to high gloss. It is appropriate for lighter-usage areas such as bathrooms and kitchen backsplashes.
 
 

Glass Tile
Are you looking for that clean contemporary look? Try glass tile. Glass tile looks great with under-cabinet lighting in your kitchen or as an accent liner or dot. The translucent quality of glass tile compliments the elegance of the natural beauty of the surrounding stone. Entire walls have been installed with a retro theme or mosaic pattern. Glass tile is so versatile, their use is virtually unlimited.
 
 

Handmade Tile
Hand Painted Tile can add beauty and elegance to simply any surface, wall or floor in the home. It can also provide a unique look to pools, exterior walls, house numbers, mailboxes and more. Hand painted tile can transform any plain surface into a Designer Showcase, and will give any Home or even Business that Designer Look.
 
 
 

Metal Tile
Metal tile is widely used as accent pieces, mixed in with other types of tile or stone. The metal tiles tend to have a relief or raised pattern set into them. Metal inlays in a kitchen backsplash are a great way to add another design element as well as a unique way to tie in with metal appliances and cabinet hardware. Metal tile works especially well with tumbled and antique stone. Some can be used for floor inlays. A natural pewter or nickel look is the most popular, but finishes range from old world rustic iron to stainless steel contemporary.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
