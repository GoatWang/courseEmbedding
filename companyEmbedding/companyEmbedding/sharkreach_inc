About SharkReach
 






 



A ‘Millennial’ Media Company
Our mission is to create the world’s first Media company built from the ground up to be able to reach the ever elusive millennial demographic. A company that realizes that traditional marketing campaigns alone no longer drive the results that advertisers and big brands expect. Sharkreach understands  that this “trend” will continue to cause traditional  media companies to lose ground with each new generation as they watch less television spend more of their lives on their mobile devices. in essence we are a media company, designed for the new “digital world”, and an audience that no longer trusts a brand’s advertising unless it’s being  influenced by someone that they follow. This is why we are the first-ever Influencer Owned public Media Company and this is what separates us from other media companies and what will ensure our growth for the future. We will accomplish this with a two pronged bottom up and  top down approach to developing and acquiring technology platforms and companies that will allow us to reach this goal. From the bottom up we intend to create a suite of products that will create a path for building better  influencers to be ranked, rated  and rewarded for performance and conversions in order to inspire them to work towards being  offered the opportunity to be an owner of SharkReach and to become part of our networks accumulative reach. Then from the top down we will create a suite of products for BRANDS to monetize the reach of  The Shark Reach Influencer Owned network by allowing them to create better campaigns and track them so that they have a  vehicle for monetizing the engaged audience that  each of our influencers  brings to the network. Platform agnostic and always First with Brand safe social media activations, followed by original IP & ultimately complete monetization of all appropriate talent assets. We will accomplish this through establishing strong authentic talent direct relationships and acquiring best-of-breed companies within the digital media space, in order to execute optimized monetization of these assets.

Straight Outta Compton
Universal Studios
 
Objective
Universal was looking to generate awareness for the Movie and had not had much luck with Social Media Advertising in the past.
Strategy
SharkReach put together a compelling campaign which utilized celebrity Influencers as well as the sons of the actually members of NWA the group the movie is based on. The campaign called for the influencers to post from various locations in the movie as well as the premier and press conferences. SharkReach managed all of the appearances of the talent as well as coaching them for TMZ interviews and other celebrity news outlets. The campaign was the most successful Social Media campaign that Universal has ever run delivering a staggering 1600% over the expected impressions.

of the ways in which I can help the Company is to introduce them to the 
agencies… the agencies need to have the capability to use the latest and 
potentially most effective ways of reaching more people, of creating more 
measurable views for their key clients campaigns. Since most of these large 
multi-national agencies do not have that ability in-house, SharkReach can 
provide those services right now so the agencies can better serve and retain 
their clients”

“This is the second in a line of key strategic Board of Director appointments 
that the Company plans to make in order to help the Company quickly grow in the 
social media influencer market... to help it become the premiere player in the 
space. Getting Kevin, another renown visionary to agree to serve on our board 
is, I believe, the right marriage at the right time. His ability to bring the 
right strategic relationships and his knowledge of utilizing the public company 
to build thru acquisitions, is second to none.” said Steve Smith, SharkReach

“This is a game changer in Influencer Marketing In the past if you were running 
a influencer campaign without real-time sentiment monitoring it could be days 
before you realized that people where posting negative comments when sharing the 
influencer post, now if even one negative comment is made you receive a text 
message telling you it happened when it happens and you can login from your cell 
Android or iOS phone and respond to the post or if needed pause your campaign. 
It’s like running a Superbowl commercial and being able to stop it 3 seconds in 
if people hate it... It interprets the English language and warns you if someone 
says something negative within seconds after they say it across every social 
media site and the web. With this you’re always watching… everywhere… all the 
time… 24/7/365. “ Said Jamie Allen, CTO of the Company.

Forbes Article Says SharkReach, Inc. “Poised To Skyrocket”

 SHRK Guaranteed Universal Pictures 7 
Million Impressions For STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON Social Media Marketing Campaign… 
DELIVERED 131 Million!

 
HERMOSA BEACH, CA – February 3, 2016 – SharkReach, Inc. (OTC Markets:
SHRK)( "SharkReachŽ" or 
the "Company") a millennial influence marketing company today announced that it 
is currently working on a Straight Outta Compton Blu-ray campaign for 
Universal Pictures award winning film as a follow up to its highly successful 
pre-release collaboration with the studio. 

Forbes recently ran an interview with the Founder and newly appointed CEO of the 
Company, Steve Smith, where he elaborated on the effectiveness of the Company’s 
social media campaign to drive awareness and create viewer demand prior to the 
release of the major motion picture.

Due in part to the Company’s results for Universal Pictures, the Forbes 
Contributor of the article said that SharkReach: “… is poised to skyrocket after 
recently going public .” 

For the full article go to:

http://www.forbes.com/sites/mnewlands/2015/12/07/the-brand-influencer-bridge-that-makes-their-talent-into-shareholders-an-interview-with-sharkreach/


SharkReach was tasked by Universal Pictures to activate influencers to drive 
awareness for the film because the studio had only seen modest results in 
working with other influencer marketing companies. 

However, success came when Universal executives chose to give SharkReach 
exclusive access over all other influencer companies.

Doug Neil, of Universal Pictures said the SharkReach “… stand(s) out in the 
‘influencer marketing space… (they) executed a compelling and unique program… 
for the film Straight Outta Compton.”

“Straight Outta Compton really blows away anything else that we’ve done, 
and what anyone else has done in the theatrical space.” Said Steve Smith, 
SharkReach Founder and CEO.

Smith commented on the incredible success in consumer awareness the Company 
created for Universal’s film. “Our commitment to Universal Pictures, in terms of 
the numbers of guaranteed impressions promised, was just under 7 million 
impressions… but what we actually delivered… was right around 131 million… 120 
million more than we had promised them.”

Searching for an answer to explain the overreaching success in the number of 
impressions created, Universal Executive Doug Neil pointed to the Company’s 
masterful cultivation, use of and its handling of relationships with the talent, 
their families and those other significant influencers in their inner circle.


“The authentic relationship they have with their talent makes them stand out in 
the 'influencer marketing' space. That’s the piece that is usually missing in 
other influence marketing programs." added Neil.

Smith said “We want the client to be happy, the brands to be happy, and most of 
all the talent to be excited about what we’re doing which usually leads to an 
over-performance by the talent. Just like all of us, if you like what you are 
doing, agree with it… want to do it… you will usually give it your best!

We were also lucky that we had a number of the sons of founding NWA members go 
to the places in the movie in Compton that only they could access because they 
are family. We took a simple thing where we have hip-hop talent do social posts 
about a hip-hop movie. 

Our process is understanding what the client wants and then leveraging our 
close, direct working relationship with the talent to conceptualize content 
that… will be effective to capture the intended audience.”

This Compton campaign was so effective that Javon Frazier, Professor of 
Strategic Marketing at UCLA, has based an entire semester on this campaign.

As to the Company’s relations with Universal Pictures, Smith said: We’re 
actually working on the campaign for this summer’s upcoming blockbuster 
‘Warcraft’ based on the best-selling videogame right now for the studio, which 
will be the next theatrical to take over the socialsphere!”

Influencer Marketing is changing the face of traditional Online Advertising and Marketing. Social influencers offer a more authentic voice, leading to more engaged audiences. Social media has revolutionized the way we communicate and interact with our world. Consumers expect that their ‘Media’ be ‘Social’ and engaging, coming from credible, trusted sources. This trend is making traditional marketing approaches obsolete, and fast.
 
 



 
 
 





 

Did you know…
Today, Influencer marketing is more relevant than traditional advertising?
According to a McKinsey Study, marketing-inspired word-of-mouth or “influencer” campaigns generate more than twice the sales of paid advertising, and these customers have a 37% higher retention rate.

SharkReach, Inc. Poised For Surge With Leadership Additions And Major Acquisitions; Unique Approach To Influencer Marketing, Worthy Micro Cap MentionsHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets close in 50 mins.S&P 5002,471.29-4.13 (-0.17%)Dow 3021,819.12+22.57 (+0.10%)Nasdaq6,375.87-6.31 (-0.10%)Today's ChartsDon't get blindsided by Tesla's shiny new Model 3SharkReach, Inc. Poised For Surge With Leadership Additions And Major Acquisitions; Unique Approach To Influencer Marketing, Worthy Micro Cap MentionsAccesswireFebruary 16, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareDELRAY BEACH, FL / ACCESSWIRE / February 16, 2016 / In recent years, millennials have begun to enter the marketplace as entrepreneurs, business persons, and investors, and they have quickly discovered that one of the greatest challenges to building a successful brand is marketing. Enter a new, digitally-based approach to reaching consumers, called "influencer marketing," which focuses heavily on social media and other networking channels in the digital landscape to foster what are called, "brand influencers." Influencer marketing uses brand influencers, usually an online celebrity or company with a large amount of sway over its digital followers, to promote particular brands on social media channels like Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter.SharkReach, Inc. (SHRK) established itself last year as a company for investors to watch by becoming one of the leaders in this new field, through its wildly successful campaign for the film Straight Outta Compton. Popular movie studio Universal employed SharkReach with the expectation that the company's efforts would bolster the film's online presence by 7 million impressions. Instead SharkReach exceeded projections by over 1800%, creating over 128 million impressions for the film, which remained the top grossing film at the box office for three weeks.As SharkReach continues to grow thanks to Straight Outta Compton and other successful influencer marketing campaigns, the company's executive board has begun to add relevant new pieces. On Tuesday, they announced that Erik Pilkington has joined the company's Board of Directors. Mr. Pilkington previously served for IBM Watson as Managing Director of Digital Strategy, as well as at McCann as Global Chief Digital officer. In his current position for BCG Digital Ventures, he is leading technologists, designers, and strategists to create revenue for the Fortune 200, demonstrating his strong background connecting digital strategies to the financial sector.Mr. Pilkington adds significant depth to an executive team with an existing reputation for knowledge and experience in the digital marketing sector. CEO Steve Smith possesses over 17 years experience in the media business and over a decade in key VP/Director roles at companies like World Wrestling Entertainment and Discovery Communications. Jamie Allen, CTO, has worked in digital marketing and web development for over 20 years on teams that developed for Sony, Toyota, and other large corporations. Additionally, SVP of Sales, Steve Moriya, brings more than 15 years of media, advertising, and content production experience to the SharkReach team.One of the keys to SharkReach's quick success - the company was founded in 2013 - is that the same talented individuals working as brand influencers for SharkReach also own a stake in the company. SharkReach proudly promotes the fact that it retains an influencer/owner network of over 20,000 individuals, a number that is constantly increasing as exposure to both SharkReach and the concept of influencer marketing grows exponentially.In fact, projected revenues for SharkReach are expected to increase 350% by 2018 to $4.1 million, however, with the potential for more viral influencer marketing campaigns on the company's horizon, that number may very well prove to be a conservative estimate. The vast majority of digitally-based companies engaged in marketing have stated that they currently employ or plan to employ influencer marketing techniques in their campaigns, and as the trend of influencer marketing takes off, SharkReach's potential network of brand influencers should continue to grow, expanding the company's reach, revenues, and overall market share.Most recently SharkReach reached an agreement to acquire The Mobile Media Lab, with estimated revenues of $1.5 Million. Under the terms of the agreement, SharkReach will acquire 100% of The Mobile Media Lab, LLC for cash and stock in the Company. Closing is scheduled to take place on or before February 28, 2016. Details of the transaction will be released in an upcoming 8K filing.With only a handful of companies currently engaged in influencer marketing strategies to the same extent as SharkReach, and none of them approaching the market with the ingenuity and experience that has made SharkReach so successful, investors may want to take a look at SHRK as a new leader in the hot, up-and-coming sector of influencer marketing.Read MoreMicro Cap Worthy Mentions...Ascent Solar Technologies Announced Major Breakthrough in Solar Cell Performance for Space and Near-Space Environments (ASTI), a developer and manufacturer of state-of-the-art, flexible thin-film photovoltaic modules integrated into the Company's EnerPlex(TM) series of consumer products, announced on Feb 8 2016 the Company has achieved a major breakthrough in power-to-weight ratio for its superlight solar module, delivering over 1700 watts of power per kilogram, operating at AM0, technically known as the space environment. At this performance, Ascent's superlight module would weigh 66% less than a comparable PV system using the highest-quality crystalline silicon and with far less design complexity. The elimination of two-thirds of the weight is a critical improvement for satellites, space vehicles and space stations.PCTEL, Inc. (PCTI), a leader in Performance Critical Telecom solutions, unveiled its power line monitoring antenna Feb 9, 2016 at DistribuTECH 2016. PCTEL's power line monitoring antenna was designed specifically to communicate with wireless power line sensors and fault indicator devices typically deployed on power lines. Utilities leverage data collected from these sensors to more precisely calibrate power production to the variable needs of the grid, substantially reducing energy waste. The power line monitoring antenna makes these sensor systems easier to install while improving the range and reliability of data transmissions.JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (JAKK) will announce results for its fourth quarter and full year 2015 on Tuesday, February 23, 2016, before the opening of the stock market. The Company will also hold a teleconference and webcast to discuss the results and may also discuss future plans and prospects.JAKKS Pacific invites all analysts, investors and media to listen to the teleconference scheduled at 9 a.m. ET/6 a.m. PT on February 23, 2016 via the Internet at www.jakks.com/investors.Seraphim Strategies is a third party publisher.
