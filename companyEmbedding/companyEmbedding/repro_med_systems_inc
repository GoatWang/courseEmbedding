(PRWeb) - Repro Med Systems, Inc. dba RMS Medical Products (OTCQX: REPR) today announced the latest financial results for the four-month period ending June 30, 2017.
This report encompasses the period since the Companys fiscal year ending on February 28, 2017. To accommodate the change from fiscal year ending February 28 to a calendar fiscal year ending December 31, this report includes both a four-month period (ended June 30, 2017) and a three-month period (ended May 31, 2017). The Company will report one-time, transitionalfinancial information for the month ofMarch 2017 and the quarter April through June 2017 on Form 10-Q in August 2017.
Highlights March 1June 30, 2017
31.1% Increase in Net Sales
$5,339,076 compared with $4,072,193 for the same period last year
The increase is driven principally by organic growth with our existing customers both domestically and internationally. Part of the increase was the result of the backorders of $0.4 million from the period ended February 28, 2017, which were filled during the four months ended June 30, 2017. Excluding these backorders the net sales increase was 21.6% for the four month period ending June 30. The launch of a new drug generated increased needle sales as customers built inventory, two large pump orders were accelerated forward into this period and last year included a large return of product related to the market withdrawal.
25.0% Increase in Gross Profit
$3,270,095 compared with $2,616,826 for the same period last year
This increase in the quarter was mostly driven by the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher production costs related to increased scrap during quality inspections as we work to implement a nondestructive testing protocol. Additionally, we had higher sterilization costs due to more frequent cycles required to meet demand and backlog and increased shipping costs due to the backlog. We also had higher salary and related benefits costs from overtime and the addition of a second shift to meet increased demand.
Increase in Net Income
$360,833 net income compared to a net loss of $205,882 for the same period last year
5.6% Decrease in Expenses
$2,778,112 as compared with $2,941,717 for the same period last year
Decreases in selling, general and administrative expenses were the result of a significant reduction in legal fees related to our litigation and FDA regulatory efforts. We are making every effort to manage the spend on professional fees while making sure we do whatever is necessary to achieve a positive outcome regarding our litigation and FDA matters. We also had reductions in sales and marketing driven by reduced recruiting, lower consulting fees related to website redesign last year, timing of spend this year on marketing initiatives and lower salary and related costs due to attrition. Offsetting these savings were increased costs in our regulatory department due to headcount to support our regulatory compliance requirements.
March 1May 31, 2017:
The factors contributing to the three month results were substantially the same as those contributing to the four month results.
Net Sales: $3,866,910, an increase of 29.3% compared with $2,990,166 in the same quarter last year
Gross Profit: $2,407,008, an increase of 24.3% compared with $1,936,812 in the same quarter last year
Net Income: $286,995 net income compared to a net loss of $233,314 for the same quarter last year
Expenses: $2,024,056, a decrease of 12.2% compared with $2,306,414 for the same period last year
We continue to work with the FDA to resolve our regulatory matters. Andy Sealfon, RMS Chief Executive Officer commented, The FDA renewed our Certificate to Foreign Government which is used to communicate to foreign governments that the FDA has certified that RMS meets good manufacturing practices and quality system regulations.
Eric Bauer, RMS Chief Operating Officer commented, We delivered sales growth both domestically and internationally, ramped up production to keep pace with demand and found ways to lower costs. We received registrations in new countries, launched our new flow controller in Europe and started several clinical trials with drug companies.
Bauer added, We have launched a new marketing campaign, redesigned our packaging and entered the social media world to help extend our brand awareness. We plan to continue to focus on global sales growth, cost control and new product development.
The Company manufactures medical products used for infusions and suctioning. The Infusion product portfolio currently includes the FREEDOM60 and our latest FreedomEdge Syringe Infusion Pumps, RMS Precision Flow Rate Tubing and RMS HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets. These devices are used for infusions administered in professional healthcare settings as well as at home. The Company`s RES-Q-VAC line of medical suctioning products is used by emergency medical service providers in addition to a variety of other healthcare providers.
This press release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition to statements which explicitly describe such risks and uncertainties, readers are urged to consider statements labeled with the terms "believes", "belief", "expects", "intends", "anticipates", "will", or "plans" to be uncertain and forward looking. The forward-looking statements contained herein are also subject generally to other risks and uncertainties that are described from time to time in the Company`s reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The results of operations for the four months ended June 30, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

Frequently Asked Questions


What needle sizes are available? What length is recommended?   
RMS offers HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets™ in 4mm, 6mm, 9mm, 12mm, and 14mm needle lengths.

Needle length should be selected according to how much sub-q tissue a patient has. 9mm needles tend to work well with average sized patients; while 6mm needles may be needed for very thin people and children. Similarly, larger patients may require 12 or 14mm needles. Patients should work with their health care provider to determine their best length.
Our needles are 26 gauge (a measurement of needle thickness). We make thin-walled 26g needles to minimize pain and still allow high flow rates with viscous drugs. We struck the balance between speed and comfort.
For special applications, we do also offer a 24g needle in 6mm, 9mm and 12mm lengths. Call us to discuss 24g needles.



What are the best infusion sites?   
If you are a patient, your healthcare provider will help you determine the best sites for needle insertion.
The most common infusion site is the abdomen or stomach. The upper buttocks or hips (outside of iliac crest), the outer side of the thighs, and the back of the upper arms are also sometimes used.

These sites are better to use because they have a layer of fat just below the skin to accept drug more easily, but not many nerves - which makes infusing those places more comfortable than other parts of the body.
Whether and when to rotate infusion sites should be a subject for discussion with your healthcare provider. You may achieve better results by periodically returning to sites that have worked well in the past. However, some find that repeated use of the same sites interferes with perfusion of medication.



How do I prime the needles? Should I use the slide clamp?   
We recommend the patient follow the steps in our Patient Information Guide, but be sure to use the complete protocol supplied by the healthcare provider. It may take some practice to master the technique.

Some key points:
• Keep needles dry.
• Use the pump to prime to about two inches short of the needle butterflies.
• Stop flow by turning the pump off and winding the knob back one full turn.
• The slide clamp is intended for emergencies only (not priming).



What do I do if I see red or pink in the tubing lines while checking for blood return?   
Be sure to reference the complete protocol supplied by your healthcare provider or drug product manufacturer.

In our Patient Information Guide we suggest that if you see blood return, clamp the flow to that site. Patients can contact their home healthcare provider to determine if the dose can safely be run using the remaining sites. If so, continue. If not, remove all needles, attach a new needle set, and start over beginning with the priming step.



Why is my infusion time longer than I expected?   
There are a few likely causes:
1) Administration may be slow based on how well medication is absorbed through your tissue. If this is your first time with sub-q, it may take longer than expected because your body may need to create space in the subcutaneous layers in order to infuse in the time desired.
2) If you are using the FreedomEdge™, confirm that you are using the correct size syringe. 30ml syringes flow about 20% slower than 20ml syringes using the same Precision flow rate tubing.
3) It is best to avoid placing needles near areas of scar tissue, or on top of muscle.
4) Slow flow can be a sign of blocked or small diameter needles.
5) It is also possible you may need more sites, longer needles or a faster flow rate tubing set.



What could cause drug to leak at the infusion sites?   
First, patients should contact their home health care provider, and confirm that none of their supplies have changed. Additionally, leaking drug could be caused by:
• excessive movement
• a needle length that is too short
• a site with too little subcutaneous tissue
• too much volume in an individual site
• over-saturation of the sites, due to too fast a flow rate

When in doubt, or to address leaking and irritation, select the next longest needle and a slower flow rate for more positive outcomes. You can also try more sites or different sites if issues continue. More sites and longer needles might also help allow faster infusions in the future.



How do I minimize pain or site reactions during an infusion?   
Many patients successfully infuse using HIgH-Flo needle sets and the following tips:
• Be sure to insert your subcutaneous needles dry. IgG or alcohol on the needles tends to irritate the skin.
• Ensure that the needles you are using are long enough to reach your sub-q layers, but not so long as to hit muscle.
• Ask your provider about trying a slower rate tubing set, especially for your first few infusions.
• Think about site location. If you have been having difficulty with rotating sites, you may want to return to the sites that work best for you. Talk with your provider about your options.
What



What about pain on insertion?   
Under the guidance of their clinical team, patients report the highest success with carefully selected sites. Make sure to match the length of the needle to the depth of the site.
We recommend that you use HIgH-Flo needles and that the tip of the needle does not come in contact with anything before insertion. Needle tip damage can contribute to patient pain and may be invisible to the naked eye.
A high quality needle, which is kept dry during priming and inserted smoothly and quickly at 90°, also helps ensure the best results.




Is longer tubing available? Do you have extension sets?   
For patients who want a longer length between the pump and their sites, we offer a 24” extension set. The extension set uses standard luers, made to fit between the Precision tubing and HIgH-Flo needle set. The extension has a negligible effect on flow performance and residual volume.




What does the F-number on the tubing sets mean? Why is the flow rate faster than the tag when I bench test the pump?   
The tag number on RMS Precision Flow Rate Tubing™ set is an Item Number specific to the RMS infusion pumps. In some cases, when infusing water-consistency fluids at lower rates, it may be equivalent to flow rate. The numbering system originated from the design of our proprietary fluid testing system. Please do not try to correlate the tag numbers to normal bench testing results. If you are using the FREEDOM60® pump and would like more information on the flow tag, flow rate performance or bench test procedures, see page 10 of the FREEDOM60® Instructions For Use. If using the FreedomEdge™, see page 10 of the FreedomEdge™ Instructions For Use or call RMS.

RMS Medical Products Launches New Customer App

OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - CHESTER, NY / ACCESSWIRE / May 22, 2017 / Repro Med Systems, Inc. dba RMS Medical Products (OTCQX: REPR) ("RMS" or the "Company") and ContraCare GmbH are pleased to announce the launch of the RMS Freedom Flow Rate Calculator Smart Phone App (available for Android, and iOS). This App is designed to allow customers to easily configure an RMS infusion system based on the drug being delivered. The App is an easy to use but highly complex calculator which will aid pharmacists, doctors and nurses in determining the proper RMS Precision Flow Rate Tubing™ and RMS HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets™ to be used with either the FREEDOM60® or the FreedomEdge® Syringe Driver Infusion Systems. Nurses and Pharmacists often make critical decisions about flow rates/tubing and needle selections (size and number of needles to be used for infusion) in order to meet drug delivery protocols and patient desires for time of infusions. This new App will make it very easy to help the patient receive the best care possible. This RMS Freedom Flow Rate Calculator Smart Phone App was developed for RMS with resources from ContraCare GmbH, a leader in Germany for Contract Management (reimbursement) Services and Managed Care (homecare) solutions. The App is now available for iOS in the AppleTM Store and Android in the GoogleTM Play store. Just go to your favorite store and type in RMS Freedom and you will be able to find and download this free user friendly app.Dr. Torsten Kühn, Chief Executive Officer of ContraCare, commented, "The RMS Freedom system is easy to configure for doctors, easy to train for nurses and easy to use for patients. We wanted to develop a calculator that makes it even more comfortable to set up a patient's SCIg prescription. By going through an easy 1-2-3 step process (select the pump, the drug and the dose). We enable the healthcare professional to evaluate different combinations of HIghFlo subcutaneous needle sets with Precision flowrate tubing to find the optimum combination for the patient's needs. This is an important step towards customized, patient-centric care in this challenging environment.""The Freedom Flow Rate Calculator app will help many of our customers improve patient care," said Eric Bauer, Chief Operating Officer of RMS. "We are very pleased to have worked with ContraCare in developing this App, they are an amazing distributor. RMS is committed to developing and delivering innovative products and tools to help our customers improve patient care. This App is yet another example of our global leadership, our ability to create exceptional partnerships around the world and our commitment to improving patient quality of life."RMS Medical Products is the leading manufacturer of medical products used for home infusions and suctioning.

Success Stories







Lisa's Story
Patient using RMS Precision Flow Rate Tubing™



I appreciate your products and feel better since receiving infusions again
“I used the RMS Flow Rate Tubing F1200 to replace a competitor’s product, with really no side effects; infusions went smoothly.  I liked the tubing better than the adjustable one I had been previously using.  It seemed just easier and gave me more length, besides the obvious of not having to deal with what rate it should be going at.  I appreciate your products and feel better since receiving infusions again.”
– Lisa C.





Mary-Jane's Story
Patient using FREEDOM60®



I ABSOLUTELY LOVE my FREEDOM60
“I love my FREEDOM60! I have CVID and currently infuse 16g/180ml of Hizentra 2x a week. I began infusing with Hizentra/Vivaglobin in 2010. I received my FREEDOM60 pump a couple of months before that and I have been using the same pump ever since. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE my FREEDOM60 because it is reliable, easy to use, easy to clean and once I start, I don’t have to worry about my infusion. It is very durable and extremely easy to travel with. It’s light weight and the fantastic carrying case/pouch makes it easy for me to move around while I am infusing. Not being tethered to an electrical outlet, like with IV, allows me to infuse when and where I like, while doing things as I infuse. I love that the syringe is protected in the pump, so I don’t have to worry about bumping it and potentially losing a syringe full of Hizentra!”
– Mary-Jane M.





Shirley's Story
Patient using FREEDOM60®



I have used other pumps, but prefer the FREEDOM60
“I was diagnosed 20 years ago.  I do two (2) infusions a week and use the FREEDOM60 pump.  I have used other pumps, but I prefer the FREEDOM60.  It is very reliable, does not break down, withstands occasional dropping, is less expensive than other pumps, and is paid for by Medicare.  I fall asleep occasionally when I have the pump on and have never had any problems.”
– Shirley V.





Richard's Story
Patient using FREEDOM60®



The durability of the FREEDOM60
“The FREEDOM60 pump is durable. We’ve been using this for 5+ years. We’ve accidently dropped it several times with no damage done.”
– Richard W.
 





Sarah's Story
Patient using FREEDOM60®



Thank you for creating such great products!
“I used to use another pump but it was battery operated and the batteries would run out during an infusion, leaving my husband to push in the remainder of the drug. With the FREEDOM60, we truly have been free from worry, our girls used the pump and love it and the “ready, set, go” feel they get when they turn the knob. The tubing has been awesome and helped with speed and safety. Thank you for creating such great products! We can feel safe and proud to use them with our family.”
– Sarah C.





Jennifer's Story
Patient using FREEDOM60®



I can use it anywhere!  It’s lightweight, no batteries, and easy to use.
“I love the flexibility the Freedom system provides.  I can use it anywhere!  It’s lightweight, no batteries, and easy to use.  I’ve done my infusions with the FREEDOM60 pump, Precision Flow Rate Tubing, and HIgH-Flo Needle sets in restaurants, movie theaters, road trips, conferences, at work, walking around the house, and I travel with it all the time.”
– Jennifer S.





Patty's Story
Patient using HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets™



The tubing and needle sets are the VERY BEST in the industry!
“Along with using the FREEDOM60, I also use your (Precision) tubing and HIgH-Flo needle sets. They are the VERY BEST in the industry! I have tried other brands and nothing compares. Love the long tubing – that’s a big plus!”
– Patty P.





Patty's Story
Patient using FREEDOM60®



I love how easy the FREEDOM60 is!
“I have been using the FREEDOM60 since switching to SubQ. I love how easy it is to use, and the pouch that comes with it.
The fact that the pump is easy to clean with alcohol wipes makes me feel secure knowing that it is sterile between infusions. The pouch being washable and having storage is also a very attractive feature – I LOVE THE ZEBRA PRINT!”
-Patty P.





Andy's Story
Patient using FREEDOM60®



It works!
“I love my FREEDOM60 pump!  It’s easy and effective.  It works!  I’ve had it for over 10 years with no problems, no complications… just steady and reliable.  Don’t change it as far as its work-ability…it doesn’t need anything!”
-Andy H.





Marguerite's Story
Patient using FREEDOM60®



These products are so user-friendly
“My name is Marguerite. I am 54 years old, a wife and mother of 2 active girls, ages 12 and 13. I have been diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Fibromyalgia. I have gone to 5 different rheumatologists and other doctors in search for relief from the constant pain in every single joint in my body. I have found nothing that takes away all the pain, but I have found a few medications that help.
During my search, some of the therapies and infusions of strong medicines depleted my immune system. I caught pneumonia, was hospitalized, and almost died twice. I became disabled because the range-of-motion in my joints became limited, preventing me from moving very much. I also could not be around too many people because I could easily catch illnesses. This has been very difficult for me especially since my girls are young. They are involved in Girl Scouts and play in their school orchestra. I have missed many concerts and trips, Christmas parades, etc.
I starting seeing a new doctor a couple of years ago. Once I became strong enough, she started me on Hizentra, which is infused at home with little needles, into the subcutaneous tissue.
I use 3 HIgH-Flo needles and the Freedom60 system. These products are so user-friendly. The nurse trained me, so I can do the infusion according to our family schedule. I even took it on vacation with us this year. I feel much more ‘normal’! This medicine and the way it is administered allows me to accompany my daughters on many of their activities now.”
-Marguerite A.

  Department of Health and Human ServicesPublic Health ServiceFood and Drug Administration New York DistrictFood & Drug Administration158-15 Liberty AvenueJamaica, NY 11433 February 26, 2016 WARNING LETTER NYK-2016-26  VIA UNITED PARCEL SERVICEDELIVERY SIGNATURE REQUESTED Mr. Andrew I. Sealfon, CEORepro-Med Systems, Inc. dba RMS Medical Products24 Carpenter Rd.Chester, New York 10918-1057                    FEI: 1318360 Dear Mr. Sealfon: During an inspection of your firm located in Chester, NY, on June 3, 2015 through June 23, 2015, an investigator from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your firm is a specification developer and manufacturer of Infusion Pumps (i.e., Freedom 60 Syringe Infusion Pump and the Freedom Edge Syringe Infusion Pump) and Intravascular Administration Sets.  Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. We received the responses from Mr. Marc L. Somelofski, Regulatory Affairs Director, dated July 15, 2015, and from Dr. Fred Ma, Chief Medical Officer, dated February 2, 2016, to the observations noted on Form FDA 483, List of Inspectional Observations that was issued to you at the close of our inspection. We address your responses below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following: Adulteration/Misbranding ViolationsOur inspection revealed that the Freedom 60 Syringe and Freedom Edge Infusion Pumps are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because these devices are class III devices under section 513(f) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360c(f), and you do not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect as required by section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g).  The Freedom 60 Syringe and Freedom Edge Infusion Pumps are also misbranded under section 502(o) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because you did not notify the agency of your intent to introduce these devices into commercial distribution in that a notice or other information respecting the significant modifications to these devices and their new intended use was not provided to the FDA as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), and 21 C.F.R. 807.81(a)(3)(i) and (ii). Specifically, you modified the Freedom 60 Syringe Infusion Pump, cleared under K933652, in a manner that could significantly affect safety and effectiveness when your firm: a)    Changed the pressure specification range from 13 psi maximum to 15 psi maximum;b)    Changed the flow rate specification range from 1 – 500 ml/hr. to 0.5 - 2400 ml/hr.; andc)    Developed and marketed a different version of the Freedom 60 Syringe Infusion Pump (i.e., Freedom Edge Infusion pump) that uses a different syringe volume, pumping mechanism and mode of operation. In addition, the Freedom 60 Syringe Infusion Pump was cleared under K933652 with the following indications: “The Freedom 60 Syringe Infusion Pump is intended for use in the home setting or hospital environment using any intravenous fluids recommended for use with such syringes as the Becton Dickinson 309663 or Sherwood Medical 8881-560125. The Freedom 60 Syringe Infusion Pump is not indicated for the delivery of blood or blood products.” However, your firm is promoting the device for indications that would constitute a major change or modification to the device’s intended use, for which your firm lacks clearance or approval. Specifically, you are promoting this device for the infusion of prescribed liquid medicines including Immunoglobulin G (IgG,) antibiotics, Desferal, pain medications, chemotherapeutics and cardiac medications. These indications fall outside the cleared intended use because the Freedom 60 Syringe Infusion Pump is only cleared for IV infusion and not infusion of specific medications or blood or blood products, like IgG.  Indicating the device for a different route of administration or for specific medications or classes of medications raises new scientific review questions, as such changes introduce new risks that are not normally associated with the cleared indication. These changes in the design and intended use may affect the performance of the device and could significantly affect the safety and effectiveness of this device. Your firm has not submitted any correspondence to the FDA regarding this violation to date.  Our inspection also revealed that the RMS HigH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Set is adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because this device is a class III device under section 513(f) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360c(f), and you do not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). This device is also misbranded under section 502(o) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because you did not notify the agency of your intent to introduce this device into commercial distribution in that a notice or other information respecting the new intended use of the device was not provided to the FDA as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), and 21 C.F.R. 807.81(a)(3)(ii). Specifically:The RMS HigH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets were cleared under K122404 with the following indication: “RMS HigH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets are intended for the delivery of medication to the subcutaneous tissue.”  However, your firm is marketing the device for subcutaneous Immunoglobin (SCIg) infusion. Specifically, your consumer brochure explains how to use the Freedom Edge Syringe Infusion Systems, including the RMS HigH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets, for SCIg infusion.   During the review of K122404, the intended use for SCIg infusion was specifically not covered by the cleared intended use because you were unable to supply the requested performance data.  Accordingly, promoting the RMS HigH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets for this indication falls outside the cleared intended use. Indicating the device for a different route of administration raises new questions of safety and effectiveness.   Your firm has not submitted any correspondence to the FDA regarding this violation to date.  For a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency. 21 C.F.R. 807.81(b).  The kind of information you need to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for your device is described on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/3122.html.  The FDA will evaluate the information you submit and decide whether your product may be legally marketed. The FDA requests that your firm immediately cease activities that result in the misbranding or adulteration of the aforementioned Freedom 60 and Freedom Edge Syringe Infusion Pumps and RMS HigH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets, such as the commercial distribution of the devices for the uses discussed above. Quality System Violations This inspection revealed that your Freedom 60 and Freedom Edge Syringe Infusion Pumps and RMS HigH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Set  are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 351(h)), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, its manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following: 1.    Failure to complete design verification activities to confirm that the design output meets the design input requirements, as required by 21 CFR § 820.30(f). Specifically, as it relates to design verification activities for the Freedom Edge Syringe Infusion Pump and accessories (flow rate tubing and needle sets): A.    Your firm failed to conduct a flow profile study or similar study to test different flow rates using various types of Precision Flow Tubing connected to your Freedom Edge Syringe Infusion Pump to verify that device outputs, flow rates, would meet design input requirements listed in your pump’s Instructions For Use (IFU) when using a 20 ml or 30 ml BD Luer Lok syringe. Additionally, you did not conduct a flow profile study or similar study to confirm that design inputs for flow rate requirements could be met with the use of various tubing to administer immunoglobulin drugs or other liquid medications, drugs or substances with variable viscosity.   B.    Your firm failed to conduct adequate design verification activities associated with ensuring average pressure design outputs were achieved to meet input requirements of 13.5 psi (nominal) to 15 psi (peak). Review of your verification test plan allowed for only two infusion pumps to be tested for average pressure output. Your rationale for testing only two pumps, rather than a greater number of pumps from multiple production lots, is not conveyed and does not appear to be based on a sound statistical sampling plan. The two pumps selected do not adequately verify the product’s ability to reproduce similar, acceptable pressure outputs.    C.    Your verification protocol outlined a need to establish a coefficient friction value for the 20 ml syringe used in conjunction with the Freedom Edge Syringe Infusion Pump. However, a coefficient friction value was not established for the 30 ml syringe which is also used with this pump. D.    Your Design Input Checklist for the Freedom Edge Syringe Infusion Pump showed essential input for the pump’s lifecycle was set for 4,000 cycles, however, this design input was later changed to 1,000 cycles as the understanding was that 1,000 cycles closely resembles two years of simulated use to support the product’s warranty. Verification test results did not fully support 1,000 cycles, therefore you reclassified the two year input to 730 cycles. The checklist currently still shows design input for two year life cycling as 4,000 cycles. You either failed to conduct additional design verification testing for life cycling to verify this design input (4,000 cycles) can be met; or, you failed to update design inputs and outputs to reflect 730 cycles and then failed to verify or validate to ensure 730 cycles is adequate to support device design. E.    Your verification protocol for the Freedom Edge Syringe Infusion Pump did not always identify an adequate test method. For example, the Force Gauge Test was briefly described but lacked information concerning type of force gauge test equipment to be used, amount of samples that would be tested, the acceptance criteria for final force output, and what correlation this measurement has on the pump’s average operating pressure.  We reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate. We acknowledge your firm is initiating CAPA 20150625-1 to improve the design control process and eliminate the root cause of the problem, however a copy of this CAPA and its contents were not made available for review. We acknowledge your response states you will take necessary steps to correct lacking verification activities noted in parts A-E above, however your response lacks inclusion of the necessary attachments, references and reports necessary to support the validity of your proposed corrections. Also, your response does not include any information regarding a systemic corrective action that includes a retrospective review of other products to ensure that design controls were documented and completed as required. 2.    Failure to establish and maintain plans that describe or reference the design and development activities and define responsibility for implementation, as required by 21 CFR § 820.30(b). Specifically, your firm does not have a plan that describes the design and development activities for the Freedom Edge Syringe Infusion Pump. In addition, your Design Plan procedure #2015, Rev B is incomplete in that it does not describe all major design phases from market concept to design launch. This design plan, therefore, fails to outline a road map for implementing and handling design and development activities, in order to ensure all design steps are performed, reviewed and documented prior to design release.  We reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate. While you indicate a design plan will be created to outline activities for the Freedom Edge Syringe Infusion Pump, no such plan has been provided for review to date. You provided revised design procedures such as Design Plan procedure #2015, Rev C, however we will need to assess successful training and implementation of this procedure during our next inspection.  Also, your response does not include any information regarding a systemic corrective action to include a retrospective review of other products to ensure that design controls were documented and completed as required. 3.    Failure to establish procedures to ensure that equipment is routinely calibrated, inspected, checked, and maintained, as required by 21 CFR 820.72(a).  Specifically, your procedure, DAS Calibration Procedure #8057, Rev A, containing calibration instructions for the cell load tester Omega Dyne Pressure Transducer, (b)(4), that was used to test Freedom 60 Syringe Infusion Pumps, does not contain sufficient instructions to ensure routine calibration and maintenance, adequate instructions for completing calibration, adequate documentation of calibration results, and provisions for remedial action to correct the fixture if not operating within precision or accuracy limits.  Also, your firm does not have any preventative maintenance schedule or procedure, or similar procedure(s) to check and/or replace sensors and any additional parts or equipment at your firm that may need maintenance.   We reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate. We acknowledge your response indicates you will be developing a calibration manual and master validation plan. We also acknowledge you state you will develop a preventative maintenance procedure for your test fixture and have the load cell calibrated by a supplier of calibration services. However, these activities have not been completed to date and/or documents to support these proposed actions have not been provided. Also, your response does not include any information regarding a systemic corrective action to include a retrospective review of other products and their equipment to ensure all calibration and preventative maintenance activities are controlled as required. 4.    Failure to establish and maintain procedures for rework, to include retesting and revaluation of nonconforming product after rework, to ensure that the product meets its current approved specifications, as required by 21 CFR 820.90(b)(2). Specifically, rework and revaluation activities, including a determination of any adverse effect from the rework upon the product, were not documented in the Device History Records (DHRs) for your Freedom 60 Syringe Infusion Pumps. For example, pump serial (b)(4) was tested on 3/13/2015 four times. Each time the pump was rejected. On the fifth test the pump was released without evidence documented that the pump had been reworked and/or how the pump had been reworked to meet specification(s). We reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate. We acknowledge your procedure Freedom Pump Performance Test (DA) #5013, Rev H allows for replacing of parts and retesting, however the regulations require documentation of such actions in the DHR. We acknowledge you state you will be revising form 05-277 to include a field to specify when the Negator part on the pump is replaced and a field for when additional parts are replaced, however, objective evidence to observe and evaluate the stated correction is still in progress and/or was not provided. Also, your response does not include any information regarding a systemic corrective action to include a retrospective review of other products and their DHRs to ensure all rework and revaluation activities are being documented as required. 5.    Failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a). Supplier Corrective Action Report (SCAR) #2014-003, dated 9/22/2014, documented your supplier of PE bags (b)(4) was supplying packaging with wrinkles in the seal. The root cause was determined to be improper pressure for the rewind belt and the operator using excessive tension settings and the SCAR was closed based on employee retraining on 9/30/2014. However, review of your Material Disposition Log for your High-Flo 4-needle set, 26 gauge 9 mm length needles (b)(4), documented continued problems with seal quality, to include wrinkles in the seal, for additional seals provided by this supplier on 12/2/2014. Your SCAR did not adequately verify or validate the corrective action made by the supplier to ensure the action was effective and did not adversely affect the finished device. The SCAR was closed without requiring or ensuring the root cause of the seal wrinkles was corrected and effective. When continuing issues were identified with package seals from this supplier on 12/2/2014, you did not re-evaluate or re-investigate the SCAR.  We reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate. You indicate you revised the corrective action process, SOP 8034 Revision G. Revised written CAPA procedures, however, have not been provided to date. Your response does not indicate any further corrective action activities will take place with respect to the package issues with your supplier.  6.    Failure to establish and maintain procedures for acceptance activities, as required by 21 CFR 820.80(a). Specifically, your Tubing and Needle Set Flow Test Procedure, #8001, Rev L, does not include test parameters or acceptance criteria for your F8, F20 and F500 Precision Flow Tubing to indicate the acceptable flow rate for these products.  We reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate. You indicate that omission of the F8 and F500 tubing from the procedure is an oversight and does not affect product quality and you state that F20 has never been manufactured or distributed by the organization.  You state you will be revising your Tubing and Needle Set Flow Test Procedure, #8001 to include acceptance criteria for F8 and F500 tubing; however, because you have not yet completed this revision, we are not able to evaluate the stated correction. MDR Violations Our inspection also revealed that the Freedom 60 Syringe Infusion Pump System with Syringe Set & Tubing devices (K935632 Infusion Pump) are misbranded under Section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information regarding the devices that is required by or under Section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 803 - Medical Device Reporting. Significant violations include, but are not limited to: Failure to adequately develop, maintain and implement written MDR procedures, as required by 21 CFR 803.17.  For example, after reviewing your firm’s MDR procedure titled “Adverse Event & Incident Reporting,”Procedure No. SOP 1050, Rev. A, dated 5/28/2015, the following issues were noted: (1)   SOP 1050, Rev. A does not establish internal systems that provide for timely and effective identification, communication, and evaluation of events that may be subject to MDR requirements. For example: a.  The procedure omits definitions for the terms “become aware”, “caused or contributed”, from 21 CFR Part 803.3, and definition for the term “reasonably suggests” from 21 CFR 803.20 (c)(1).  The exclusion of the definitions for these terms from the procedure may lead your firm to make an incorrect reportability decision when evaluating a complaint that may meet the criteria for reporting under 21 CFR 803.50(a). (2)   SOP 1050, Rev. A does not establish internal systems that provide for a standardized review process to determine when an event meets the criteria for reporting under this part.  For example: a.       The procedure does not specify who makes the decision for reporting events to FDA.  b.      There are no instructions for how your firm will evaluate information about an event to make MDR reportability determinations in a timely manner. (3)   SOP 1050, Rev. A does not establish internal systems that provide for timely transmission of complete medical device reports.  Specifically, the following are not addressed: a.       Although the procedure includes references to 30 day and 5 day reports, it does not specify calendar days and work days, respectively.  b.      How your firm will submit all information reasonably known to it for each      event. (4)   SOP 1050, Rev. A does not describe how it will address documentation and record-keeping requirements, including: a.       Documentation of adverse event related information maintained as MDR event files. b.      Information that was evaluated to determine if an event was reportable.  c.       Documentation of the deliberations and decision-making processes used to determine if a device-related death, serious injury, or malfunction was or was not reportable. d.      Systems that ensure access to information that facilitates timely follow-up and inspection by FDA. Your firm should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation violations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected. Requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments will not be granted until the violations related to the subject devices have been corrected. Please notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter. Your written response should be sent the Food and Drug Administration; Attention: LCDR Catherine BeerCompliance OfficerU.
