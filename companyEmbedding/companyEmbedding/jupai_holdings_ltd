        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion.

Jupai Holdings Ltd. Business

	JP is a leading third-party wealth management service provider focusing on distributing wealth management products and providing quality product advisory services to high-net-worth individuals in China.

	JP’s integrated business model featuring an established wealth management product advisory services operation complemented by its growing in-house asset management capabilities.

Jupai Holdings Ltd. Related Party Revenues

	JP's related-party revenues consist primarily of one-time commissions and recurring management fees paid by limited partnership funds where JP serves as general partner or co-general partner or other funds where we serve as managers. 

 

Jupai Holdings Ltd. Asset Management Business

	The asset management business, which JP started in 2013, not only diversifies its wealth management product offerings and increases its competitiveness, but also enhances its overall profitability.

	JP believes that its client-focused service model, alongside its broad range of carefully selected third-party and self-developed products, have made JP a trusted brand among its clients.

	JP aspires to become a leading player in China's fast growing wealth management industry focusing on the high-net-worth population.

	JP provides its wealth management product advisory services mainly to China's high-net-worth individuals who have investable assets in excess of RMB3.0 million (US$0.5 million).

	With its network of 32 client centers in 18 economically vibrant cities as of March 31, 2015, JP strategically brings its services closer to its clients by maintaining a physical presence in key markets in China.

	JP’s network primarily covers the Bohai Rim, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta regions, where over 80% of China's high-net-worth individuals reside or work, according to the Heading Report.

	JP’s high-net-worth client base has grown significantly since its inception. During 2012, 2013, 2014 and the three months ended March 31, 2015, JP had 1,090, 2,122, 4,678 and 1,941 active clients, respectively.

	JP believes that its comprehensive and personalized client service, delivered by experienced service professionals, is key to its success to date.

	JP operates under a proven and cost-efficient client service model, which features a team approach that covers the full service cycle for each client.

	A typical wealth management service team is centered around a seasoned wealth management product advisor who maintains regular contact with and facilitate the execution of transactions for JP’s clients.

	Each wealth management product advisor is supported by an average of five client managers, who are tasked with searching for and making contact with potential clients, and a centralized client care unit that specializes in maintaining client relationships.

	JP’s wealth management product advisors, many of whom possess industry-recognized qualifications, are primarily recruited from reputable institutions in the wealth management industry and have an average of approximately eight years of industry experience.

	JP believes its wide spectrum of value-added services offered, before, during and after distribution of wealth management products have helped JP generate client loyalty.

	Among JP’s active clients in 2012, 2013, 2014 and the three months ended March 31, 2015, approximately 21.4%, 34.4%, 41.8% and 63.8% of them had previously purchased wealth management products that JP distributes at least once before their latest purchase, demonstrating its strong client retention ability despite the fast expansion of its client base.

Jupai Holdings Ltd. Intellectual Property

	JP relies on a combination of trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements and non-compete covenants with its wealth management product advisors and other employees, its third-party wealth management product providers and other contractors.

	JP has one registered trademark in China and four registered domain names, jpinvestment.cn, 51touzi.cn, Jp-fund.com and toushenme18.com.

	The registrants of Jp-fund.com is Yumao and the other three domain names are registered by the Beijing branch of Shanghai Jupai. JP also has three registered copyrights in China.

Jupai Holdings Ltd. Competition

	JP’s principal competitors include:

	Third-party wealth management service providers.  JP’s direct competition comes from other third-party wealth management service providers, some of which are relatively well developed, such as Noah Holdings Limited. JP believes that it can compete effectively due to the quality of its client-oriented and customized services, its product sourcing and development capabilities and its rigorous risk management systems, in light of the great potential of the wealth management services market.

	Commercial banks.  Many commercial banks rely on their own wealth management arms and sales forces to distribute their products. JP believes that it competes effectively with commercial banks due to a number of factors, including its independence, which positions JP as a centralized wealth management product aggregator to provide and recommend suitable wealth management product advice and product combinations that suit its clients' financial objectives.

	Asset management service providers.  A number of mutual fund management companies, trust companies and securities companies have emerged in the asset management business in China in recent years. JP believes that it competes effectively due to the quality of its services, its fund sourcing capabilities from third parties and its in-depth experience in industries such as real estate development.

Jupai Holdings Ltd. Dividends 

	JP’s board of directors has discretion on whether to distribute dividends, subject to certain restrictions under Cayman Islands law, namely that its company may only pay dividends out of profits or share premium account, and provided always that in no circumstances may a dividend be paid if this would result in its company being unable to pay its debts due in the ordinary course of business.

Jupai Holdings Ltd. Use of Proceeds

	JP expects to receive $42 million from its IPO and use it for the following:

	US$12.6 million to set up new client centers and expand its coverage network, including hiring additional wealth management product advisors and client managers;

	US$12.6 million to fund capital expenditures in new office buildings, infrastructure and enhanced information technology system for operational needs; and

	the remaining amount for general corporate purposes, including funding potential acquisitions of complementary business, although JP is not currently negotiating any such transactions, other than its acquisition of Scepter Pacific, the holding company of E-House Capital, the consideration of which will be its equity securities.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.
