$29.95
$24.95 AUD

The preeminent resource guide for more than twenty years, this one-of-a-kind book, now available in paperback, has been updated to include those recently canonized and beatified.Since its original publication in 1980, John J. Delaney’s Dictionary of Saints (more than 200,000 copies sold) has become the leading reference book for the scholar and general reader alike. With more than five thousand biographies of the saints—from the well known to the obscure—this new edition brings to life the inspiring accomplishments of these men and women of God. The martyrs and the monks, the mystics and the virgins, the doctors and the peasants are all contained in this essential volume. To know the saints, how they thrived in their achievements, how they lived in destitution, is to meet a fascinating company of people whose actions have influenced and enriched the history of the world.Reset in an easy-to use-format, it contains substantial listings for the more popular saints, and thumbnail sketches for those less well known. From Aaron to Zosimus, this modern dictionary has been updated with the entries for the newly canonized, including Italian mystic Padre Pio, Mexican Nahuatl Juan Diego, Polish Franciscan Maximilian Kolbe, and Americans Katharine Drexel and Rose Philippine Duchesne. It also contains a complete listing of feast days, an index of patron saints, and several other useful appendixes.

$24.95 AUD

Through the centuries, Our Blessed Lady has appeared frequently on earth with messages of warning, hope, and consolation for humanity--but never more frequently than in the last two centuries. Heralded as the Marian Age, the past two hundred years have been blessed with numerous appearances of Our Lady, each one offering messages of inspiration and hope and urging the world to return to the love of God through prayer, penance, and reparation for sins.A Woman Clothed with the Sun considers the seven most significant apparitions of Our Lady in the past two centuries: that of the Miraculous Medal at Paris, those at La Salette, Lourdes, Knock, Fatima, Beauraing, Banneux--and also the sixteenth-century appearance of Mary at Guadalupe with its profound message for Americans. The historical background of each apparition is given, the vision itself described, and Mary's messages are quoted by writers distinguished for their special knowledge of the apparitions and their literary excellence. In his introductory chapter, editory John J. Delaney traces the relationships between the apparitions and provides a penetrating analysis of their significance.Recipient of the Marian Library Medal, A Woman Clothed with the Sun has been critically acclaimed as the one book on Our Lady that should be read by everyone.

Collected here in A Woman Clothed With the Sun are 8 of the apparitions of Our Lady. The last two centuries have been called the Marian years because of the numerous appearances of Mary with messages of inspiration and hope and "urging the world to return to the love of God through prayer, penance, and reparations for sins". The appearances presented include the Miraculous Medal at Paris, La Salette, Lourdes, Knock, Fatima, Beauraing, Banneux and Guadalupe. For each apparition in A Woman Clothed with the Sun the historical background is given as is a description of the vision itself. Writers distinguished for their special knowledge of the apparitions quote the messages Mary gave at each location. In the Introduction, editor John J. Delaney traces the relationships between the apparitions and gives an analysis of their significance. Many of these apparitions are familiar to most Catholics but the detail given in the writings will make the apparitions exciting and inspirational reading. A Woman clothed With the Sun is the recipient of the Marian Library Medal and is recommended as the one book about Mary that should be read by everyone.A Woman clothed With the Sun Edited by John J. Delaney Paperback 232PGS

About Dictionary of Saints
The preeminent resource guide for more than twenty years, this one-of-a-kind book, now available in paperback, has been updated to include those recently canonized and beatified.Since its original publication in 1980, John J. Delaney’s Dictionary of Saints (more than 200,000 copies sold) has become the leading reference book for the scholar and general reader alike. With more than five thousand biographies of the saints—from the well known to the obscure—this new edition brings to life the inspiring accomplishments of these men and women of God.  The martyrs and the monks, the mystics and the virgins, the doctors and the peasants are all contained in this essential volume. To know the saints, how they thrived in their achievements, how they lived in destitution, is to meet a fascinating company of people whose actions have influenced and enriched the history of the world.Reset in an easy-to use-format, it contains substantial listings for the more popular saints, and thumbnail sketches for those less well known. From Aaron to Zosimus, this modern dictionary has been updated with the entries for the newly canonized,  including Italian mystic Padre Pio, Mexican Nahuatl Juan Diego, Polish Franciscan Maximilian Kolbe, and Americans Katharine Drexel and Rose Philippine Duchesne. It also contains a complete listing of feast days, an index of patron saints, and several other useful appendixes.

Praise

    “A valuable reference book which ought to find a place in every Catholic publication office.”—Catholic Journalist“A masterful compendium which proves that it is possible to be both scholarly and popular.”—U.S. Catholic“It is remarkable how the most significant facts are recorded here, even those of a legendary character.  This makes the volume ideal for ready reference.”—National Catholic Register“Dictionary of Saints has used all the latest critical investigations into the lives of the saints….We have here a fascinating company of men and women who devoted their lives to Christ in widely varied ways…not only a careful and thoughtful presentation of all the saints you would want to know about, but it is delightful reading to dip into.”—America“The author is careful to separate legend from history, but includes as legend most of the popular stories about the saints….A “dictionary of saints” is a sine qua non of a church library’s reference collection.  This one suits the purpose admirably [and] is heartily recommended to the pious amateur.”—Church & Synagogue Libraries“Comprehensive…abounds with interesting tidbits.”—Christianity Today“This readable, up-to-date one-volume compendium…gives more about the saints than similar dictionaries.”—Library Journal“As a reference and resource book this volume contains all the saints the ordinary person will ever seek information about…no matter where you start reading in it, it is interesting and hard to put down.  That’s a compliment to both the saints and the author of the book.”—Spiritual Book News

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREDictionary Of Saintsby Delaney, John J.The preeminent resource guide for more than twenty years, this one-of-a-kind book has been updated to include those recently canonized and beatified.Since its original publication in 1980, John J. Delaney's DICTIONARY OF SAINTS (more than 200,000 copies sold) has become the leading reference book for the scholar and general reader alike. With more than five thousand biographies of the saints from the well known to the obscure this new edition brings to life the inspiring accomplishments of these men and women of God.  The martyrs and the monks, the mystics and the virgins, the doctors and the peasants are all contained in this essential volume. To know the saints, how they thrived in their achievements, how they lived in destitution, is to meet a fascinating company of people whose actions have influenced and enriched the history of the world.Reset in an easy-to use-format, it contains substantial listings for the more popular saints, and thumbnail sketches for those less well known. From Aaron to Zosimus, this modern dictionary has been updated with the entries for the newly canonized,  including Italian mystic Padre Pio, Mexican Nahuatl Juan Diego, Polish Franciscan Maximilian Kolbe, and Americans Katharine Drexel and Rose Philippine Duchesne. It also contains a complete listing of feast days, an index of patron saints, and several other useful appendixes.ReferenceCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

John Joseph Delaney (August 21, 1878 – November 18, 1948) was a United States Representative from New York.
Life and politics[edit]
Delaney was born in Brooklyn, he attended St. Ann's Parochial School and St. James' Academy in Brooklyn and Manhattan College. He engaged in the diamond business in 1897, was graduated from the Brooklyn Law School of St. Lawrence University in 1914, was admitted to the bar in 1915 and commenced practice in New York City.
Delaney was elected as a Democrat to the Sixty-fifth Congress, by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Representative John J. Fitzgerald, and held office from March 5, 1918 to March 3, 1919. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1918 and resumed his former business pursuits. He was a delegate to the Democratic State conventions in 1922 and 1924 and was deputy Commissioner of Public Markets of New York City from 1924 to 1931. He was again elected as a Democrat to the House of Representatives, this time to the Seventy-second Congress, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Representative-elect Matthew V. O'Malley. Delaney was reelected to the eight succeeding Congresses, holding office from November 3, 1931 to November 18, 1948. He was reelected in 1948 to the Eighty-first Congress but died on November 18, 1948, in Brooklyn. Interment was in Holy Cross Cemetery.

Publisher's Description▼▲
The preeminent resource guide for more than twenty years, this one-of-a-kind book, now available in paperback, has been updated to include those recently canonized and beatified.Since its original publication in 1980, John J. Delaney’s Dictionary of Saints (more than 200,000 copies sold) has become the leading reference book for the scholar and general reader alike. With more than five thousand biographies of the saints—from the well known to the obscure—this new edition brings to life the inspiring accomplishments of these men and women of God. The martyrs and the monks, the mystics and the virgins, the doctors and the peasants are all contained in this essential volume. To know the saints, how they thrived in their achievements, how they lived in destitution, is to meet a fascinating company of people whose actions have influenced and enriched the history of the world.Reset in an easy-to use-format, it contains substantial listings for the more popular saints, and thumbnail sketches for those less well known. From Aaron to Zosimus, this modern dictionary has been updated with the entries for the newly canonized, including Italian mystic Padre Pio, Mexican Nahuatl Juan Diego, Polish Franciscan Maximilian Kolbe, and Americans Katharine Drexel and Rose Philippine Duchesne. It also contains a complete listing of feast days, an index of patron saints, and several other useful appendixes.


Author Bio▼▲
JOHN J. DELANEY, the former director of Doubleday Religious Publishing and founder of Image Books, was an active figure in the world of religious publishing for more than forty years. He also authored A Woman Clothed with the Sun, and translated The Practice of the Presence of God.


Editorial Reviews▼▲
“A valuable reference book which ought to find a place in every Catholic publication office.”—Catholic Journalist“A masterful compendium which proves that it is possible to be both scholarly and popular.”—U.S. Catholic“It is remarkable how the most significant facts are recorded here, even those of a legendary character. This makes the volume ideal for ready reference.”—National Catholic Register“Dictionary of Saints has used all the latest critical investigations into the lives of the saints….We have here a fascinating company of men and women who devoted their lives to Christ in widely varied ways…not only a careful and thoughtful presentation of all the saints you would want to know about, but it is delightful reading to dip into.”—America“The author is careful to separate legend from history, but includes as legend most of the popular stories about the saints….A “dictionary of saints” is a sine qua non of a church library’s reference collection. This one suits the purpose admirably [and] is heartily recommended to the pious amateur.”—Church & Synagogue Libraries“Comprehensive...abounds with interesting tidbits.”—Christianity Today“This readable, up-to-date one-volume compendium…gives more about the saints than similar dictionaries.”—Library Journal“As a reference and resource book this volume contains all the saints the ordinary person will ever seek information about...no matter where you start reading in it, it is interesting and hard to put down. That’s a compliment to both the saints and the author of the book.”—Spiritual Book News
