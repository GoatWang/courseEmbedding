WALTHAM, Mass., April 18, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., an oncology company moving into phase 3 having completed randomized, placebo controlled phase 2 studies, announced the appointment of Arlene M. Morris as chief executive officer.  Joanna Horobin, MD will serve as president.  
"Syndax is leading the field of epigenetics—a novel way to control gene regulation—to address unmet needs in cancer due to the problem of resistance," said Dennis Podlesak, chairman of the Syndax board of directors. "With the positive phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled data and the addition of Arlene Morris to our impressive leadership team, Syndax is well positioned to successfully complete the final phase of clinical development to achieve our goal of providing a new treatment option for women with metastatic breast cancer."
During her eight years as president and CEO at Affymax, Ms. Morris led the company through the development of peginesatide (Omontys®), a strategic collaboration with Takeda and an Initial Public Offering. Prior to Affymax Ms. Morris was the president and CEO of Clearview Projects, an advisory firm which counseled biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies on strategic transactions. Before that she was the senior vice president, business development at Coulter, a biotechnology company focused on immunotherapeutic approaches to cancer, autoimmune and infectious diseases, where she completed numerous transactions including a $1.0 billion merger between Corixa and Coulter. Ms. Morris began her career at Johnson & Johnson (J&J) as a sales representative rising to vice president of business development. Ms. Morris received her bachelor's degree in biology and chemistry from Carlow College. In addition to Syndax Ms. Morris serves on the board of directors of Neovacs and MediciNova.
"After working with Syndax as a director over the past nine months, I am excited to take a more active role now as we move entinostat forward and secure the financing and personnel required to take this exciting product candidate for breast cancer through the final phase of testing," said Ms. Morris.  
About Syndax Syndax is a late-stage oncology company supported by top venture capitalists and led by industry experts developing treatments for large markets including metastatic breast and lung cancer. The Company's platform is based on employing epigenetics to overcome the problem of resistance in oncology care. Syndax holds worldwide rights to entinostat, an oral, highly selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, which inhibits cancer-relevant HDAC enzymes which contribute to epigenetic alterations driving cancer growth and drug tolerance. Entinostat's unique pharmacokinetic properties, convenient oral dosing and HDAC selectivity, maximize the opportunity to safely combine with and potentially extend the benefit of proven cancer therapies. Entinostat has demonstrated promising activity in randomized, phase 2 clinical trials in combination with targeted therapies.   For more information please visit www.syndax.com.

    SAN DIEGO, May 11 /PRNewswire/ -- MediciNova, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company that is publicly traded on the Hercules Market of the Osaka Securities Exchange (Code number: 4875), today announced the appointment of Arlene M. Morris and Alan W. Dunton, M.D. to its Board of Directors.  Ms. Morris is currently President and CEO at Affymax, Inc. and Dr. Dunton is currently Chairman of the Board of Directors for ActivBiotics, Inc.
    "We are extremely pleased and fortunate to add two great individuals with such meaningful experience to our Board of Directors," said Yuichi Iwaki, M.D., Ph.D., MediciNova's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
    "MediciNova recently initiated its seventh clinical development program and will be advancing several other projects into late-stage clinical testing. We feel that the addition of Arlene Morris and Alan Dunton to our Board has significantly strengthened our ability to successfully develop our compounds. At the same time, Arlene and Alan bring a wealth of business-specific knowledge to our Board, and we take their decision to join our Board of Directors as a vote of confidence in our Company.  We look forward to adding their expertise to our efforts to develop our products and business relationships."
    Arlene Morris brings significant expertise in the establishment of strategic partnerships, marketing and operations to MediciNova.  She was appointed President and CEO of Affymax, Inc. in June 2003.  She has over 25 years of management experience from Johnson & Johnson, Scios Inc., Coulter Pharmaceutical, Inc. and Clearview Projects.  While at Coulter, she completed numerous transactions, including the $1.0 billion merger between Coulter and Corixa and a contractual joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline for Bexxar(R) valued in excess of $200 million.  Previously, Ms. Morris was the Vice President of Business Development at Scios Inc. where she completed several high profile transactions including one of the first biotech profit-sharing deals for a late-stage product.  From 1977 through 1993, Ms. Morris held various management and executive positions at Johnson & Johnson in sales, marketing, new product development and business development, holding the position of Vice President of Business Development for McNeil Pharmaceutical from 1988 to 1993.  She received her B.A. degree in Biology and Chemistry from Carlow College and studied marketing at Western New England College.  Arlene is also on the Board of BIO, the Biotechnology Industry Organization.
    Dr. Alan W. Dunton is a recognized expert in prescription drug development and clinical research.

Most recently, since February 2003, Dr. Dunton was President and CEO of Metaphore Pharmaceuticals.  Metaphore was acquired by ActivBiotics in December 2005.  Before joining Metaphore, Dr. Dunton was the President and Managing Director of the Janssen Research Foundation, a Johnson & Johnson company.  In this capacity, he was responsible for the research and development of new prescription drug products marketed by the Johnson & Johnson family of companies worldwide.  He was a member of the Group Operating Committee of the J&J Pharmaceutical Group, a member of the Board of Janssen Pharmaceutica, N.V. and Chairman of Janssen-Cilag, International.  His experiences also included positions with Roche, CIBA-GEIGY (now Novartis) and Syntex (now Roche).  Dr. Dunton also developed and implemented an Ethical Code for the Conduct of Clinical Research and was a recipient of the prestigious Nellie Westerman Prize from the American Federation of Clinical Research for his work in medical ethics.
