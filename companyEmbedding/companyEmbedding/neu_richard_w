Overview






Dr. Neu's research involves the understanding and prediction of the fatigue behavior of materials and closely related topics. Specifically, he has published in areas involving thermomechanical fatigue, high-temperature fatigue, fretting fatigue, creep and environmental effects, viscoplastic deformation and damage development, and related constitutive and finite-element modeling with a particular emphasis on the role of the material's microstructure on the deformation and degradation processes. Professor Neu has investigated a broad range of materials including steels, titanium alloys, Ni -base superalloys, metal matrix composites, and solder alloys used in electronic packaging. His research has widespread applications in aerospace, surface transportation, power generation, machinery components, and electronic packaging. His work involves the prediction of the long-term reliability of components focusing on critical locations such as the dovetail connection between the blade and disk in gas turbine engines and solder interconnects in electronic packaging. His research is funded by some of these industries as well as government funding agencies.
