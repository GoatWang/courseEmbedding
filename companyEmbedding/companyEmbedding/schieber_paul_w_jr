What are analysts saying about Sprint Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Sprint Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Over the past six months, Sprint grew 32.9% while the Zacks-classified Wireless National industry gained 5.9%. We believe the efficient use of capital, reduction of cell sites, the elimination of dual networks, backhaul efficiencies, reduced churn, lower roaming charges and energy cost savings bode well for Sprint’s long-term growth. The upcoming launch of 5G technology, promotional plans, tilt toward IP-enabled cloud services, wireless expansion plans, network modernization and integration efforts and sale-leaseback transactions to pay-off its debt are sure to boost its customer base. On the flip side, high cash burn from promotional offers and discounts, debt-laden balance sheet and decreasing cash flow have led to losses for Sprint. Further, the company’s decision to skip the 600 MHz low-band airwaves auction will save cash for the company but will limit its scope for network upgrades." (4/5/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Results were mixed, with financials beating on higher equipment, while handsets were softer given higher churn. Sprint continues to make progress on cost cutting while maintaining share of gross adds. FCF guidance was reiterated, as higher EBITDA and lower capex expectations were offset by MLS1 payments and working capital needs. In our view, Sprint remains overvalued on fundamentals, though supportive M&A commentary likely limits near-term downside risk." (2/1/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Sprint Corporation (NYSE:S) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 6 Sell Ratings, 10 Hold Ratings, 3 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 1.84)Consensus Price Target: $9.54 (16.28% upside)
