Product Details

				The SKILCRAFT® Carpeted Entrance Mat enhances the appearance of your entrance with the rich look of a loop- pile tufted mat. Stops dirt and soils at the door and prevents debris from traveling into the premises. As a scraper mat, it can be used indoor/outdoor and will capture the majority of dirt from the soles of shoes. Can be combined with out mats for a complete 3-mat system and extreme results. Features resilient construction to resist fading and vinyl backing that offers superior floor protection.

This leash is easy to attach and 
easy to wear.  It stays out of 
your way and is comfortable 
enough for you to forget you're 
wearing it.  I'm very pleased 
with my purchase.

SWIN-WAFER: One-stop source for fire and water data in the SouthwestProduct Type: Science FeatureYear: 2005Author(s): Hanson, L. and J. WilsonSuggested Citation: Hanson, L. and J. Wilson. 2005. SWIN-WAFER: One-stop source for fire and water data in the Southwest. 01/01/1901The arid Southwest is home to an incredibly diverse natural environment, a mosaic of land ownership, and a rapidly growing population. Balancing the conflicting demands on natural resources requires access to the best available scientific information. A key objective of the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) Southwest Information Node (SWIN) is to make this information available to natural resource managers, scientists, policymakers, citizens, and other stakeholders in the southwestern states of Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. The NBII is a broad, collaborative program coordinated by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) that provides increased access to data and information on the nation’s biological resources. SWIN is one of several NBII regional information nodes that compiles biological resource datasets for a specific area of the U.S. and develops Web-based tools to support them.
