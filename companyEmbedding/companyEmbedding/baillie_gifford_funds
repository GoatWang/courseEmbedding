            Vanguard Group founder John "Jack" Bogle. About 5300 km from Vanguard's headquarters in Pennsylvania, a Scottish money manager that's been around since 1908 is taking a lesson from the US behemoth to survive as a standalone firm.

For many active stock pickers, low-cost investing pioneer Vanguard Group has come to epitomise the biggest threat to their business since mutual funds were first started almost a century ago.But about 3300 miles (5310 km) from Vanguard's headquarters in Pennsylvania, a Scottish money manager that's been around since 1908 is taking a lesson from the US behemoth to survive as a standalone firm.Baillie Gifford & Co, which oversees about $US202 billion ($259 billion) out of Edinburgh, has been cutting fees to remain competitive in a low-return environment, a strategy that takes a page from Vanguard's. While peers such as cross-town rival Standard Life Investments are turning to mergers and acquisitions to weather the assault from index funds, this firm is betting that performance is still key to attracting clients including Vanguard, for which it oversees more than $US20 billion."We've learned quite a lot from Vanguard," said Charles Plowden, joint senior partner at Baillie Gifford, who's been with the asset manager for more than three decades. Cutting fees "is one part of our defense of active management".

"We're not going to be able to beat them on costs, and we are not going to try, but it's about performance after costs."

Plowden, together with two other Baillie Gifford fund managers, runs about a third of the $US5.1 billion Vanguard Global Equity Fund, which invests in stocks including some of world's largest technology companies. The fund is beating 87 per cent of peers over the past five years. Its expense ratio - the total cost of managing a fund - was 58 per cent below the average of similar money pools as of January, according to Vanguard.That success is also a model for Baillie Gifford. The firm has cut overall fees on some funds and introduced a two-tiered system on others that lowers charges above a certain threshold for assets under management. For the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, the fee falls to 25 basis points from 30 basis points for assets above 4 billion pounds ($6.7 billion).Among their bond funds, fees range from 28 to 78 basis points and for multi-asset products the company charges between 45 and 83 basis points, according to data provided by the company.Spurring imitation

Vanguard last week named Tim Buckley as chief executive officer to succeed Bill McNabb, who has helped the firm more than triple its assets since 2008."I love that everyone is following us," Buckley said Thursday. "We are here to change the way people invest and we are taking that beyond the borders of any one country."UK active stock funds have an average ongoing charge of 1.04 per cent compared with 0.44 per cent for passive, according to Morningstar. Vanguard, the world's second-biggest money manager after BlackRock, in May started an online service to sell its funds directly to UK investors, charging an annual account fee of 15 basis points and an average fund charge of 14 basis points.Active managers "will have to cut costs to compete effectively with passives but that's not sufficient", said Christopher Traulsen, a director of global ratings at Morningstar. "Too many managers launch funds into areas where money starts flowing even when they don't have much expertise in that area. They need to focus on what they do well."

The marginal rate should come down for the largest clients, Plowden said in an interview from Baillie Gifford's headquarters in Edinburgh. Clients "are putting more of their money into passive funds, but for the bit they are keeping in active, they need to get proper value for it".With record-low interest rates making it harder to eke out returns, the growing popularity of cheaper index-tracking funds has led to a wave of consolidation. Standard Life agreed to a $US5.3 billion merger with Aberdeen Asset Management. The combined company's asset-management part of the business will oversee about $US766 billion, more than three times what Baillie Gifford manages.Small packageUnlike Aberdeen, which founder Martin Gilbert built via more than 40 deals over 34 years, Baillie Gifford hasn't done a single deal in its 109-year history. Its senior partners aren't convinced by the industry's rush to create scale.

"We've heard this for years and years now, that you need to get bigger to survive in this industry," said Andrew Telfer, the joint senior partner overseeing operations. "No, you need to get better to survive."There's room in the market for boutiques that manage their costs well, said Morningstar's Traulsen. The most difficult position is being too small to get true economies of scale and too big to be considered a boutique.That doesn't mean that the firm is immune to merger speculation. Telfer says bankers are still pitching ideas in the hope he and his partners will change their minds, though it's a far cry from the 1980s, when Baillie Gifford was receiving calls from potential suitors every month.Gilbert "has been successful with this model and we've been successful with ours", Telfer said in a joint interview with Plowden. "Different business models will work, but we think we need to focus on us and making sure we're doing a good job."

Free SmarterCare


SmarterCare is our free investment risk and performance monitoring service.  
                    Its powerful algorithms will check up on your investment every single day and send you an email if any of its alerts are triggered.  
                

                    It’s completely free to you (we pay for it out of the flat 1.24% pa charge for investing with us) and
                    you can read more about SmarterCare here.  
                    But if you'd prefer not to have SmarterCare you can choose to opt out when you set up your account.
                

                    The daily review covers five key things:
                




 Projected returns:
                                whether other investments in our comparison tables have significantly better projected returns

 Performance:
                                the recent performance of your investment

 Target:
                                whether your investment is on track to meet the targets you've specified

 Risk / return:
                                whether the risk/return profile of your investment has changed because:
                                    
there is now a significant risk of loss between now and your target date
market conditions are unusually volatile
the mix of your investment has drifted over time into a different risk / return category 



 Charges:
                                
                                    whether other investments in our comparison tables have significantly lower charges

                    One thing SmarterCare won’t do is send you junk email.  
                    There are thresholds on each item to make sure we only alert you if it's really worth it.
                

SmarterCare uses the same techniques as big financial services companies use to manage their own money,
                    but it does not provide advice and you still make all your own decisions on what to do.
                    We use sophisticated actuarial technology and we're the only people making this sort of powerful service available directly to consumers.  
                





Charges


                        A full breakdown of all charges for this investment is below.  
                        One of the best things about investing with us is that it's usually cheaper than buying direct!
                    

                    We are completely impartial and are committed to transparency in how we make our money, so below is a breakdown of exactly who gets what.
                    There are no other charges and our only income comes from the charges you pay us - we do not accept commission or any other payments from anyone else.
                

                    And you can switch funds, cash in your investment or transfer it to another provider for free at any time.

                        We make no initial charge on any of our investments.  
                        However, funds do incur dealing costs which they may pass on to you (at cost).
                        Often these are free because funds get big economies of scale and can net trades off against each other, but if they do apply they are typically between 0% and 2% as a one-off cost.
                    

                    The fund managers' charges apply on a fund-by-fund basis.  The total shown is based on the initial proportion invested in each fund.
                



 


Cheaper than buying direct?


                            It’s usually cheaper to buy from us than it is to buy direct from the fund managers.  Weird?!
                        
    
                            It's because we can buy the funds for you from the fund managers at wholesale prices 
                            which are often much lower than the retail prices they charge to the general public.  
                            Usually this more than offsets the charges we and Cofunds make.

Portfolio

                
                                                    This is a single fund and not a portfolio that has been diversified by our algorithms.
                                            

                        Unlike some companies we're very transparent about how we make our money.   
                        We do not accept any commission or other payment from fund managers so you can be confident that our comparison tables are completely objective.  
                    

                        We only work for you and get paid via a 1.24% per annum charge on your investments.  
                        That's why you'll never find any "best buys", "top 150's" or other things like that.
                        You can find out more about how the portfolios in our comparison tables are selected.

Key Investor Info



                                            This is the standard Key Information Document for Baillie Gifford Managed B Fund Acc and is aimed at retail investors.  
                                        

                                            However, we buy funds wholesale on your behalf, which means that we may have negotiated better terms than stated in this document.  In particular:
                                        

The minimum investment is a £100 lump sum or £50 per month, and this can be spread across multiple funds.
There are no initial charges on any funds bought via us.


                                            We do not accept any commission or other payments from fund managers.  Our only income comes from flat 1.24% charge you pay for investing with us.

            What is the Fund’s objective?


        The objective is to produce capital growth over the long term by investing primarily in the shares of companies that are either domiciled, incorporated or conduct a significant portion of their operations in one or more of mainland China, Hong Kong or Taiwan. The ACD will determine what constitutes conducting a significant portion of a company’s operations in a country and in doing so the ACD will consider various factors including whether the majority of the company’s revenues or profits are derived from or the majority of its assets are in that country.  The Fund may also invest in shares of companies that are listed in mainland China, Hong Kong or Taiwan. From time to time the portfolio may be concentrated and contain around only forty stocks.Up to (but no more than) 10% in value of the Fund may be invested in each of the following: collective investment schemes and deposits.

                                                        Baillie Gifford in low volatility  multi-asset growth fund offering
                                                    Be the first to commentFinancial AdviserBy Myron JobsonEdinburgh-based investment management firm Baillie Gifford has launched a new product which aims to achieve lower volatility than traditional equity markets to sit alongside its suite of multi-asset funds.The new fund, called the Baillie Gifford Multi Asset Growth Fund, targets annual returns of 3.5 per cent ahead of UK base rates, net of fees and with annualised volatility of less than 10 per cent over rolling five-year periods.The fund, established as a UK authorised non-Ucits retail scheme, is managed by Baillie Gifford’s multi-asset team, manager of a £5.9bn Diversified Growth Fund which closed to new investors in February 2013.According to FE Analytics statistics, the Diversified Growth Fund returned just over 20 per cent over the past five years.The new product can invest in a range of asset classes including gold, investment grade bonds, developed market government bonds, index-linked bonds and cash.According to the fund’s literature, there is no fixed asset allocation benchmark, but there are limits on the maximum exposure to individual asset classes in order to control risk.The fund house will be hosting a number of roadshows about the new funds from 7 June to 23 June 2016.Provider viewPatrick Edwardson, head of the multi-asset team, says: “Many investors are turning to multi-asset approaches to deliver attractive returns with lower volatility. We do multi-asset investing really well at Baillie Gifford. You can see that with our Diversified Growth Fund and the same people who manage that are applying the same process to our new Multi Asset Growth Fund. We think it’s a really good investment approach and the new fund should be very successful.”Adviser viewRicky Chan, director and IFA at London-based IFS Wealth & Pensions Ltd, said: “I have seen an increase in the number of multi-asset fund launches in recent times. I think these types of funds are targeted to advisers who are seeking to outsource their investment research proposition. For smaller practices it might be more practical to find a fund that suits a client’s attitude to risk by outsourcing the process.”He added: “It is hard not to pay attention when a large investment house like Baillie Gifford announces a new fund. They have obviously done their own research and identified a gap in the market.”ChargesThe ongoing charges figure for B accumulation shares is 0.60 per cent; the annual management charge on B class shares is 0.50 per cent.VerdictRecent history has seen a proliferation of new or ‘new and improved’ multi-asset strategy launches – at a time of heightened market volatility and less than stellar bond returns. The strategy may suit those seeking to invest over the long-term but are unable to stomach the risk associated with a fund with sole exposure to one asset class.It is difficult to ignore Baillie Gifford’s clout in the investment sphere and the new fund is likely to draw attention from intermediaries. The fact that the fund is managed by the same team responsible with a good and recent record of producing good returns – albeit for a different product - will go some way to reassuring investors that their money is in capable hands.Be the first to commentComments

            What is the Fund’s objective?


        Investment Proposition The Fund targets attractive long-term returns with lower volatility than equity markets by investing in a diversified portfolio of assets. The return target is at least 3.5% p.a. ahead of UK base rates (net of fees) over rolling five year periods. We aim to deliver this return whilst limiting volatility to less than 10% p.a. over rolling 5 year periods. Fund AimsTo achieve long-term capital growth at a lower risk than equity markets by investing in a diversified portfolio.The Fund may gain exposure to a broad range of traditional and alternative asset classes which may include but is not limited to equities, investment grade and high yield bonds, property, private equity, infrastructure, commodities and currencies. In order to gain exposure to these asset classes the Fund may invest in transferable securities, money market instruments, collective investment schemes, derivatives and deposits. Up to 100% of the Fund may be invested in other collective investment vehicles and the Fund may use derivatives for both investment purposes and in the management of risk.

Everyone’s investing style is different. Whether you’re in countdown mode to retirement, or you have 20 years or more of work ahead of you, it’s smart to think about investments. Learn how we can help you secure the income you’ll need to enjoy the retirement you want.
