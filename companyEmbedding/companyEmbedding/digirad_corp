Digirad's Second Quarter Revenues Increase by 23%



POWAY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 9, 2004--Digirad Corp.
(Nasdaq NM:DRAD):



--  DIS Mobile Leasing Service Revenues Up 29%





--  Company Provides 2004 Financial Guidance




Digirad Corp. (Nasdaq NM:DRAD), a leader in providing solid-state
medical imaging products and services to physician offices, hospitals
and imaging centers, today reported financial results for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2004. For the second quarter of 2004,
total revenues rose 23% to $17.3 million, compared with total revenues
of $14.0 million in the second quarter of 2003. For the first half of
2004, total revenues rose 23% to $33.2 million, compared to $27.0
million for the first half of 2003.



2004 Financial Results




The Company generates revenue from mobile imaging leasing services
through Digirad Imaging Solutions (DIS) and from the sale of gamma
cameras and associated accessories and maintenance contracts. DIS
revenues rose 29% to $11.3 million in the second quarter of 2004,
compared to $8.8 million in the prior-year period. For the first six
months of 2004, DIS revenues rose 33% to $21.7 million, compared to
$16.3 million in the first six months of 2003. The DIS revenues
increase was driven mainly by additional physicians entering into DIS
service contracts and growth in existing DIS business. DIS added four
imaging systems to its operations during the second quarter of 2004,
taking the total DIS systems to 63 as of June 30, 2004, compared with
51 systems at June 30, 2003. Product revenues increased 14% to $6.0
million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $5.2 million in the
prior-year period; for the first half of 2004, product revenues
increased 7% to $11.5 million, compared to $10.7 million in the
prior-year period. The increase in product revenues was due to
continued demand for our gamma cameras.

"We are extremely pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date
financial performance, in particular revenue growth from our mobile
imaging services," said David Sheehan, President and CEO of Digirad.
"Because Digirad affords physicians an in-office diagnostic solution
that also provides substantial benefits to patients, we believe that
we are well-positioned to respond to the growing demand for mobile and
fixed-site digital cardiac imaging systems."
Total gross margin for the second quarter of 2004 was 33%, up from
27% last year; gross margin for the first half of 2004 increased to
32%, up from 27% for the first half of 2003. Margin improvements were
due primarily to an increase in DIS revenues, lower DIS imaging
service costs and reductions in gamma camera production and per unit
warranty costs.

Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2004 increased
28% to $5.3 million, compared to $4.1 million in the prior-year
period. For the first six months of 2004, operating expenses increased
22% to $10.1 million, compared to $8.2 million for the comparable 2003
period. The increase in total operating expenses resulted from
increases in sales personnel and expanded marketing efforts; higher
general and administrative headcount and recruiting costs; increased
insurance, legal and other costs associated with the Company's initial
public offering and operating as a public company; and increased
billing and collection costs correlated to the increase in DIS
revenues.

Net income for the second quarter of 2004 increased to $0.1
million, compared to a net loss in the second quarter of 2003 of $0.8
million. The net loss for the first six months of 2004 totaled $0.2
million, compared with a net loss of $1.7 million in the prior-year
period. Diluted earnings per share, when calculated on a pro forma
basis to account for the conversion of all our preferred stock into
common stock in Digirad's initial public offering, was $0.01 in the
second quarter of 2004 compared to a loss per share of $0.06 for the
second quarter of 2003. The pro forma net loss per share for the six
months of 2004 was $0.01, compared to a net loss of $0.14 for the
first six months of 2003.

The Company reported cash and cash equivalents of $60 million at
June 30, 2004.

"A highlight of the second quarter was the completion of our
initial public offering of 5.5 million shares of our common stock on
June 15, 2004," said Mr. Sheehan. "Digirad's strengthened cash
position will support our efforts to address a significant market
opportunity by further penetrating the non-hospital market, which
includes both physician offices and outpatient clinics."



Financial Guidance




The following guidance is based on current information and
expectations as of August 9, 2004. These and other statements herein
are forward-looking, and actual results could differ dramatically.
Please see the "Forward-Looking Statements" portion of this press
release for a description of certain risk factors and Digirad's
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more
complete discussion of risks.

Digirad anticipates 2004 total revenues to be between $67 million
and $70 million. Digirad expects quarterly results and growth rates to
continue to fluctuate, based on seasonality stemming from physician
vacations, holidays and inclement weather.

Operating expenses for 2004 will reflect increases in investments
to expand the Company's infrastructure, including a third quarter DIS
sales force expansion, as well as ongoing investments in research and
development and higher general and administrative costs associated
with operating as a public company. The Company anticipates 2004 net
income to range from $0.2 million to $0.5 million, or $0.01 to $0.03
on a per-share diluted basis.

mobile imaging leasing and services program for physicians who wish to

Systems are headquartered in Poway, Calif. For more information,

Forward-Looking Statements




Digirad cautions that statements included in this press release
that are not a description of historical facts are forward-looking
statements. Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts
of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that
they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use
words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend,"
"plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in
connection with a discussion of future operating or financial
performance or events. In particular, these include statements
relating to future actions, prospective products, services or market
opportunities, future performance or results of current and
anticipated products or services, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome
of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and financial results. The
inclusion of forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a
representation by Digirad that any of its plans will be achieved.
Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in this
press release due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in Digirad's
business including, without limitation: the degree to which Digirad's
existing imaging systems and services will be accepted by physicians
and hospitals; Digirad's ability to compete against large,
well-established competitors with significantly greater resources; any
unforeseen changes in domestic and international legislation,
regulation or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party
payors; Digirad's ability to timely develop new products, product
enhancements and services that are accepted by the market; Digirad's
lack of a diversified line of products and services; any technical
problems that may develop with respect to Digirad's imaging systems or
any manufacturing or supply problems or price fluctuations that may
affect Digirad's third-party suppliers; the ability of Digirad to
effectively market, sell and distribute its imaging systems and
services given its limited capabilities in these areas; Digirad's
ability to retain and attract key executives, qualified managers,
engineers and imaging technologists; Digirad's ability to manage risks
relating to product liability, warranty claims, recalls, property
damage and personal injury with respect to its imaging systems;
Digirad's reliance on a limited number of customers for its products
and imaging services; Digirad's compliance with extensive and complex
product service and reimbursement regulations, licensure and reporting
requirements of the Food and Drug Administration and other state and
federal agencies, including with respect to the DIS business, those
that are subject to variable interpretations; Digirad's ability to
protect its intellectual property and proprietary technology through
patents and other means and defend against claims by third parties;
and other risks detailed in Digirad's Securities and Exchange
Commission filings, including its Prospectus filed pursuant to Rule

424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on June 10, 2004.
Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only
as of the date hereof. All forward-looking statements are qualified in
their entirety by this cautionary statement and Digirad undertakes no
obligation to revise or update this press release including the
forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or
circumstances after the date hereof or to update the reasons actual
results could differ materially from those anticipated in these
forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available
in the future.

(1) As a result of the conversion of our preferred stock into 12.4

public offering in June 2004, there is a lack of comparability in the
basic and diluted net income (loss) per share amounts for the periods
presented above.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
