Nick Stavropoulos 




















Nick Stavropoulos
                    President and Chief Operating Officer
					Pacific Gas and Electric Company
Nick Stavropoulos serves as President and Chief Operating Officer of Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and has more than 35 years of experience in the U.S. and international energy industry. He oversees a diverse workforce of more than 23,000 employees across electric, gas, generation and nuclear operations, as well as corporate support functions. He also serves on the utility's Board of Directors. One of his key responsibilities is to serve as the company's lead safety officer. He was drawn to the Bay Area and PG&E in June 2011 to lead the multi-billion dollar recovery and restoration effort to enhance the company's natural gas system after the San Bruno explosion. He was promoted to his current role of leading the utility effective March 1, 2017.
Today, he and his team are responsible for the end-to-end delivery of safe, reliable, affordable and clean electric and gas service to 16 million people across PG&E's 70,000 square mile service area in northern and central California. PG&E's energy portfolio is one of the cleanest in the nation, with more than 60 percent of its portfolio coming from carbon-free energy sources. Based in one of the most innovative and competitive regions in the world, Stavropoulos' teams are constantly engaging with companies from Silicon Valley and around the world to research, develop and deploy new technologies to benefit customers, communities and the environment.
Stavropoulos is a passionate advocate for workplace safety and safety culture. Since joining PG&E, he has championed independent third-party verification of the company's gas system from a number of different global organizations. Under his leadership, PG&E's gas business has earned or qualified for international certifications including ISO 55000, PAS 55001, API RP 1173, and RC 14001. PG&E is the only North American utility to currently hold these third-party certifications.
Prior to joining PG&E, Stavropoulos served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for National Grid, an electricity and natural gas delivery company serving nearly seven million customers in the Northeast United States. As COO, he was responsible for all aspects of its U.S. gas distribution business. Prior to that role, Stavropoulos was President of KeySpan Energy Delivery. Throughout his career, he held a number of senior leadership positions with successive levels of responsibility, including Chief Financial Officer, at Keyspan's predecessor companies - Colonial Gas Company and Boston Gas.
Stavropoulos is an internationally sought-after speaker on the topics of leadership and safety culture. In recent years, he has delivered keynote addresses and speeches at the International Atomic Energy Agency, National Safety Council's Campbell Institute, Institute of Engineering and Technology/The Institute of Asset Management Conference, International Safety Culture Symposium, and Global Safety Culture Conference.
He is a member of the Board of Directors for the American Gas Association and the Gas Technology Institute, as well as a member of the Advisory Board for Underwriters Laboratory's Integrated Health and Safety Institute.
A native New Englander, Stavropoulos holds a bachelor's degree in accounting from Bentley University. He earned his master's degree in business administration from Babson College and has completed executive education programs at Harvard and MIT. He serves on the board of trustees of his alma mater Bentley University and has served on multiple public and not-for-profit boards, including chairing audit committees. He lives in San Francisco and is an avid Soul Cycler.
