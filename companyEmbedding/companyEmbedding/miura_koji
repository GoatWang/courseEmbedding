Copper-Mediated Oxidative Coupling of Benzamides with Maleimides via Directed C–H CleavageWataru Miura, Koji Hirano*, and Masahiro Miura* Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, JapanOrg. Lett., 2015, 17 (16), pp 4034–4037DOI: 10.1021/acs.orglett.5b01940Publication Date (Web): July 30, 2015Copyright © 2015 American Chemical Society*E-mail: k_hirano@chem.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp., *E-mail: miura@chem.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp.AbstractA Cu(OAc)2/Cy2NMe-mediated oxidative direct coupling of benzamides with maleimides has been developed. The aromatic C–H alkenylation with the aid of an 8-aminoquinoline-based bidentate directing group is followed by an intramolecular aza-Michael-type addition to form the isoindolone-incorporated spirosuccinimides, which are of potent interest in medicinal chemistry.

A Concise Access to (Polyfluoroaryl)allenes by Cu-Catalyzed Direct Coupling with Propargyl PhosphatesAkihiro Nakatani, Koji Hirano*, Tetsuya Satoh, and Masahiro Miura* Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, JapanOrg. Lett., 2012, 14 (10), pp 2586–2589DOI: 10.1021/ol300886kPublication Date (Web): May 2, 2012Copyright © 2012 American Chemical Societyk_hirano@chem.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp; miura@chem.eng.osaka-u.ac.jpAbstractA copper-based catalyst system for the direct coupling of polyfluoroarenes with propargyl phosphates has been developed. The catalysis can provide a rapid and concise access to (polyfluoroaryl)allenes, which can be important building blocks for the synthesis of fluorinated functional materials.
