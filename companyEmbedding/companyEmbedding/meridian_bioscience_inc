Corporate Finance is responsible for Meridian's treasury and external
                        financial reporting functions. These include accounting, cash management, debt/equity
                        capital apportioning, and external reporting of financial results to shareholders,
                        the Securities and Exchange Commission and other interested parties. Meridian's
                        Finance Group is also involved in modeling and evaluating return potential for various
                        business investments (e.g., acquisitions, alliances, new products and other transactions).
                        

Regulatory Affairs/Quality
                            Assurance ensures that Meridian complies with all applicable company,
                        state and federal policies and regulations relating to the quality of its products
                        and services. This group facilitates 3rd party audits (including FDA and ISO audits),
                        prepares product registrations for new products or product modifications, and maintains
                        annual registrations with the EPA, ATF, DEA, and USDA.
                        

Research and Development (R&D)
                        leads the company in the development of innovative products to enhance the corporate
                        market position in the biotech industry. The R&D team also strives continually
                        to improve existing products to ensure customer needs are met.
                        

Sales and Marketing is responsible
                        for customer sales in the U.S., Canada, South America, Europe and the Pacific Rim.
                        Its function is to market and sell Meridian's products to customers via direct sales
                        and distribution partners.
                        

Finished Goods Production 
                        manufactures and assembles dependable diagnostic test kits in their proper format
                        for shipment to our customers. This would include all diagnostic products manufactured
                        by Meridian.
                        

Para Pak Production furnishes our
                        customers with a unique product for safely transporting fecal specimens. The agents
                        are formulated, filled, and packaged in this department.
                        

Laboratory Production consists
                        of trained technicians who produce the bulk antigens, antibodies and reagents that
                        are then given to Finished Goods Production for the final part of the manufacturing
                        process. Processes used by Laboratory Production involve formulation, bacterial/fungal
                        growth, tissue culture, protein assay and spectrophotometry.
                        

Materials Management coordinates
                        the planning, ordering and purchasing of raw materials used in the manufacturing
                        of current products and all other materials as needed. In addition, the department
                        develops cost reduction programs in an effort to reduce overall costs to the company.
                        

MIS Information Services and
                            Technology is a support organization. Both internal and external customers
                        benefit from the support of various hardware/software systems.
                        

Operations Control and Support (OCS)
                        consists of scientists and engineers who support manufacturing and R&D. OCS
                        employees perform Investigations, Validations, and Process Improvements. Investigations
                        and Validations develop, write and execute protocols, which enable Manufacturing
                        and R&D to not only problem-solve but also transfer new technology into Manufacturing.
                        Both groups propose and implement process improvements that improve product quality
                        and processing efficiency while reducing the cost of manufacturing.
                        

Purification ensures purity of antibodies
                        and antigens used in Meridian's diagnostic products. The type of purification and
                        the quality of our antibodies and antigens separate our products from those of our
                        competitors.

                        manufactures and assembles dependable diagnostic test kits in their proper format
                        for shipment to our customers. This would include all diagnostic products manufactured
                        by Meridian.

                        the quality of our antibodies and antigens separate our products from those of our
                        competitors.

Meridian Bioscience Comments on Recent FDA Press Statement
 


July 13, 2017 -- 






















CINCINNATI, July  13, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Meridian Bioscience, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIVO). Meridian Bioscience, Inc.�is providing the following comments regarding the FDA press statement and website announcement concerning the posting of the Form FDA-483 issued following the inspection of Magellan Diagnostics, which closed on June 29, 2017.� As FDA noted, this Form represents the investigators observations and is not a final Agency determination.� Consistent with FDA policy, Magellan will promptly submit responses to the Form FDA-483 for the Agencys consideration. Meridian Bioscience, Inc.�and Magellan reiterate their mutual commitment to strengthening Magellans quality system and ensuring all aspects of the system are in full compliance.� Both organizations take this very seriously and Magellan is addressing the observations noted in the Form FDA-483 with the highest sense of urgency. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements.� Except for historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which may be identified by words such as ?estimates, ?anticipates, ?projects, ?plans, ?seeks, ?may, ?will, ?expects, ?intends, ?believes, ?should and similar expressions or the negative versions thereof and which also may be identified by their context.� All statements that address operating performance or events or developments that Meridian expects or anticipates will occur in the future, including, but not limited to, statements relating to per share diluted earnings and revenue, are forward-looking statements.� Such statements, whether expressed or implied, are based upon current expectations of the Company and speak only as of the date made.� Specifically, Meridians forward-looking statements are, and will be, based on managements then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance.� Meridian assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.� These statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, including, without limitation, the following: Meridians continued growth depends, in part, on its ability to introduce into the marketplace enhancements of existing products or new products that incorporate technological advances, meet customer requirements and respond to products developed by Meridians competition, and its ability to effectively sell such products.� While Meridian has introduced a number of internally developed products, there can be no assurance that it will be successful in the future in introducing such products on a timely basis or in protecting its intellectual property.� Meridian relies on proprietary, patented and licensed technologies. As such, the Companys ability to protect its intellectual property rights, as well as the potential for intellectual property litigation, would impact its results.� Ongoing consolidations of reference laboratories and formation of multi-hospital alliances may cause adverse changes to pricing and distribution.� Recessionary pressures on the economy and the markets in which our customers operate, as well as adverse trends in buying patterns from customers, can change expected results.� Costs and difficulties in complying with laws and regulations, including those administered by the United States Food and Drug Administration, can result in unanticipated expenses and delays and interruptions to the sale of new and existing products, as can the uncertainty of regulatory approvals and the regulatory process.� The international scope of Meridians operations, including changes in the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar and general economic conditions in foreign countries, can impact results and make them difficult to predict.� One of Meridians growth strategies is the acquisition of companies and product lines.� There can be no assurance that additional acquisitions will be consummated or that, if consummated, will be successful and the acquired businesses will be successfully integrated into Meridians operations.� There may be risks that acquisitions may disrupt operations and may pose potential difficulties in employee retention and there may be additional risks with respect to Meridians ability to recognize the benefits of acquisitions, including potential synergies and cost savings or the failure of acquisitions to achieve their plans and objectives.� Meridian cannot predict the possible impact of U.S. health care legislation enacted in 2010  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act  and any modification or repeal of any of the provisions thereof, and any similar initiatives in other countries on its results of operations.� Efforts to reduce the U.S. federal deficit, breaches of Meridians information technology systems and natural disasters and other events could have a materially adverse effect on Meridians results of operations and revenues.� In addition to the factors described in this paragraph, Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission contain a list and description of uncertainties, risks and other matters that may affect the Company. Readers should carefully review these forward-looking statements and risk factors and not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. About Meridian Bioscience, Inc.

I make more on unemployment while I prepare for medical school than I did working slave labor at this joint. Avoid this place like the plague that it is. Many review are correct.

Meridian Bioscience, Inc. Enters into Product Development and Distribution Agreement with DiaSorin S.p.A. | Business Wire
























































Meridian Bioscience, Inc. Enters into Product Development and 
      Distribution Agreement with DiaSorin S.p.A.






July 07, 2010 09:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Meridian Bioscience, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio (NASDAQ: VIVO) today 
      announced that it has entered into an exclusive, world-wide product 
      development and distribution agreement with DiaSorin S.p.A. Under terms 
      of the agreement, DiaSorin will utilize key Meridian technology to 
      develop several infectious disease products for use on their LIAISON® 
      systems. LIAISON is a fully automated, random access system based on 
      chemiluminescense detection. There are over 3,000 LIAISON systems placed 
      in laboratories throughout the world. The agreement is royalty-based 
      with the actual royalty amount to be paid to Meridian dependent on type 
      of test and specific geographic market.
    

      DiaSorin has been rapidly expanding the product menu for the LIAISON® 
      system and plans to introduce a new high throughput model, LIAISON XL, 
      later this year. Under the agreement with Meridian, DiaSorin will have 
      exclusive distribution rights for the developed products in every 
      geographic market except the United States and United Kingdom, where 
      Meridian will retain the option for distribution. The first two products 
      to be developed will be for the detection of Clostridium difficile, 
      a leading hospital acquired infection and Helicobacter pylori, 
      the leading cause of stomach ulcers and a recognized contributor to 
      gastric cancer.
    

      John A. Kraeutler, Meridian’s Chief Executive Officer, said, “We value 
      this collaboration with DiaSorin and we are encouraged by the prospect 
      of expanding the reach for Meridian's infectious disease technologies. 
      DiaSorin has a very large base of installed LIAISON systems around the 
      world and this agreement provides Meridian access to new markets and new 
      customers through those placements. We pride ourselves on being able to 
      offer our customer base a variety of platforms to meet their specific 
      needs and now we can provide a fully automated system option through 
      this new partnership with DiaSorin.”
    

      Carlo Rosa, Chief Executive Officer of DiaSorin, stated, “We are 
      sincerely happy with this agreement that will give us the opportunity to 
      partner with Meridian, a leading company in GI tract infections. 3,000 
      LIAISON platforms installed worldwide, covering almost all geographical 
      areas, combined with a menu enriched by high quality tests developed 
      with Meridian will definitely enable our Group to underscore, even more 
      unequivocally, its position as a specialist in the area of infectious 
      diseases.”
    

      Forward Looking Statements
    

      The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe 
      harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements accompanied 
      by meaningful cautionary statements. Except for historical information, 
      this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of 
      Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E 
      of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which may be identified by words 
      such as "estimates", "anticipates", "projects", "plans", "seeks", "may", 
      "will", "expects", "intends", "believes", "should" and similar 
      expressions or the negative versions thereof and which also may be 
      identified by their context. Such statements, whether expressed or 
      implied, are based upon current expectations of the Company and speak 
      only as of the date made. The Company assumes no obligation to publicly 
      update or revise any forward-looking statements even if experience or 
      future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or 
      implied therein will not be realized. These statements are subject to 
      various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual 
      results to differ materially, including, without limitation, the 
      following: Meridian's continued growth depends, in part, on its ability 
      to introduce into the marketplace enhancements of existing products or 
      new products that incorporate technological advances, meet customer 
      requirements and respond to products developed by Meridian's 
      competition. While Meridian has introduced a number of internally 
      developed products, there can be no assurance that it will be successful 
      in the future in introducing such products on a timely basis. Ongoing 
      consolidations of reference laboratories and formation of multi-hospital 
      alliances may cause adverse changes to pricing and distribution. 
      Recessionary pressures on the economy and the markets in which our 
      customers operate, as well as adverse trends in buying patterns from 
      customers can change expected results. Costs and difficulties in 
      complying with laws and regulations administered by the United States 
      Food and Drug Administration can result in unanticipated expenses and 
      delays and interruptions to the sale of new and existing products. 
      Changes in the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar can also 
      change expected results. One of Meridian's main growth strategies is the 
      acquisition of companies and product lines. There can be no assurance 
      that additional acquisitions will be consummated or that, if 
      consummated, will be successful and the acquired businesses successfully 
      integrated into Meridian's operations. The Company cannot predict the 
      possible effects of potential healthcare reform in the United States and 
      similar initiatives in other countries on its results of operations. In 
      addition to the factors described in this paragraph, Part I, Item 1A 
      Risk Factors of our Form 10-K contains a list and description of 
      uncertainties, risks and other matters that may affect the Company.
    

      Meridian is a fully integrated life science company that manufactures, 
      markets and distributes a broad range of innovative diagnostic test 
      kits, purified reagents and related products and offers 
      biopharmaceutical enabling technologies. Utilizing a variety of methods, 
      these products and diagnostic tests provide accuracy, simplicity and 
      speed in the early diagnosis and treatment of common medical conditions, 
      such as gastrointestinal, viral and respiratory infections. Meridian’s 
      diagnostic products are used outside of the human body and require 
      little or no special equipment. The Company's products are designed to 
      enhance patient well-being while reducing the total outcome costs of 
      healthcare. Meridian has strong market positions in the areas of 
      gastrointestinal and upper respiratory infections, serology, 
      parasitology and fungal disease diagnosis. In addition, Meridian is a 
      supplier of rare reagents, specialty biologicals and related 
      technologies used by biopharmaceutical companies engaged in research for 
      new drugs and vaccines. The Company markets its products and 
      technologies to hospitals, reference laboratories, research centers, 
      veterinary testing centers, physician offices, diagnostics manufacturers 
      and biotech companies in more than 60 countries around the world. The 
      Company’s shares are traded through NASDAQ’s Global Select Market,

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
