Three's company in business partners — and socks

By Jayne O'Donnell, USA TODAY
NEW YORK     The founders of LittleMissMatched don't know what happens to perfectly good socks that disappear in the wash. But the mystery of the missing socks led them into a business venture that started small and is growing fast. 
Arielle Eckstut, Jason Dorf and Jonah Staw started selling packs of three or seven mismatched socks in 2003 after Eckstut and Staw came up with the idea as a solution to lost socks. Each sock is different, although the colors or patterns may coordinate.
The three thirtysomethings are unlikely partners. Eckstut is an artsy West Coast literary agent. Staw is an intense branding and marketing guy. Dorf is a slightly conservative New York garment-industry veteran. 
But they clicked because their expertise complements each others' so well and because as fast as they can come up with ideas, Staw sets a strategy and timetable to turn them into reality. 
That's helped LittleMissMatched quickly turn a cute trend in footwear into something with more legs. In just three years, the company's product line has grown to include gloves and mittens (three of course), swimwear, bedding, pajamas and — soon — books and games that tell young girls it's OK to be a little out of step. The company motto: "Nothing matches but anything goes."
LittleMissMatched, which expects $5 million in sales this year, targets girls ages 8 to 12, although it also sells to boys and girls of all ages and adult women. The products are sold in more than 1,000 specialty stores, about 600 department stores, including Nordstrom and Dillard's, and at littlemissmatched.com. The socks cost $8 for a three-pack; $15 for seven. Pajamas, for example, range from $26 for babies to $52 for adults. 
In September, LittleMissMatched opened its own department in the FAO Schwarz store here in Manhattan. David Niggli, president of FAO Schwarz, says LittleMissMatched has the same "breadth of possibilities" for expansion as the American Girl doll brand, but maybe for an artsier clientele. 
"What we loved about it is that it's really about using your imagination," Niggli says. "We thought it was a terrific concept."
Kinda, Sorta and Alota 
The founders mirror the three types of customers described on the company's packaging: Kinda, Sorta and Alota. 
Dorf, who has been wearing the company's socks since a retail buyer asked him why he wasn't, is only a "kinda" mismatcher. He likes to keep his polka dots with other similarly colored polka dots. Says Eckstut: "To say he's mismatching is stretching it." 
Staw is a "sorta" mismatcher, who will wear different shades and patterns but only within the same color family. Eckstut, at least compared with her partners, is an "alota," who will splash two shades of pink with green polka dots on one foot and a pink and green sock with black stripes on the other. 
In his 2006 business book Small Is the New Big, Seth Godin cites LittleMisssMatched as an example of a great business idea that traditional sock companies might have been leery of trying and others might think wasn't serious enough. "Realize how turning socks into a remarkable collectible is both obvious and satisfying and likely to succeed," he wrote. 
Godin wears the company's socks whenever he makes a speech. "It reminds me and the people who notice my socks that everything is fashion," he says. "They've taken a commodity that keeps you from getting blisters and turned it into a fashion statement." 
Seeing the potential 
Dorf, 37, knew the fashion industry long before he knew Staw and Eckstut. His father was in the garment industry — Noel Dorf co-owned a company that made Hanes underwear, among other apparel. And Dorf and his brothers have owned a sleepwear company, Goodnight Family, since 1996. Some of the stylish pajamas and nightgowns, called Chuckie Goodnight, are sold at Target. He's the only one of three partners with children, three girls under age 7. 
"Most of the time Jonah and I are thinking about the products. It's in our own heads," says Eckstut. Dorf just has "to be in his house seeing the girls wearing the socks and the pajamas."
Eckstut, 36, says she was an offbeat trendsetter as a child until the crush of conformity sent her to the Polo and Benetton racks when she was in her teens. She wants the company's young customers to exercise her early freedom of expression. 
"By the time I got to high school, I was more reticent to be funky than when I was in this age group," Eckstut says of the target audience. "Part of the reason I so wanted to focus on this age group is that it is such an exciting and tender time before the pure teenage years."
Staw, 31, was working as a business innovation consultant for a company called frog design with clients including Target and DaimlerChrysler when he met Eckstut through his mother. Jane Staw, a writing coach, had a client represented by Eckstut, who has been a book agent for 14 years. 
Jane Staw also introduced Eckstut and his son to Dorf. Jane Staw's own book agent — and college roommate — is Dorf's aunt. 
Eckstut and Jonah Staw told Dorf their idea, and he decided "in about two seconds" that it was a winner. The three negotiated a licensing deal with a sock manufacturer, who gave them $35,000 for the rights to their concept and brand. A year later, the partners decided not to renew the contract. After one more try at licensing, they became their own sock manufacturers earlier this year.
The $35,000 served as seed money for the young company, bolstering small investments from the founders' families and friends. 
The three are only gradually giving up their day jobs. Staw was the first to make a clean break in September 2004 when he left frog design. Eckstut is an agent-at-large for the Levine Greenberg Literary Agency. 
Dorf is still president of Goodnight Family where he oversees the licensing business, but he spends much of his time working in the LittleMissMatched office in Mamaroneck, N.Y. "After 10 years of being an entrepreneur I've learned how to be efficient and get a lot done at once," he says. 
Eckstut, the company's "creative director" in the rare instances when titles are used, has unyielding passion, especially for color. This company may be about mismatching, but not when it comes to the individual colors in the comforters, leggings or other products. She will pore over colors for hours to ensure the green in the stripes matches the green in the polka dots. "No one wants to deal with us on colors," laughs Dorf. 
Eckstut says there's a method to her matching: "It's about coordinated mismatching — not to be a clown."
Broadening the brand 
Eckstut, the author of three books, including Putting Your Passion into Print, is writing the LittleMissMatched books. 
She says the two-book deal is a big step in the evolution of the brand. The idea is to inspire creativity and provide an alternative to music and apparel that promotes the "sexualizing of girls."
One book will be part of a boxed set of goods on how to throw a pajama party. The other is a series of quizzes to help young girls discover who they really are and why it's OK to be that person. 
"There is a kind of freshness and originality to everything that they're doing, which is visually so appealing," says Susan Bolotin, editor in chief of Workman Publishing, which will publish the books. When she first saw pictures of girls wearing the socks, Bolotin felt, "There was a kind of non-goofy innocence that just lifted the spirits." 
Bolotin says LittleMissMatched's "potential is enormous" in publishing. But as a consumer and mother of a 21-year-old daughter who wears LittleMissMatched socks, she thinks the brand's broader possibilities are also almost limitless. She cites "the care they bring to everything they do."
"They are young and they are moving very quickly, but they are not giving up that attention to detail," Bolotin says. "Everything about it feels successful."

The idea began as a joke: a few
friends amusing themselves one night in 2003 by dreaming up ever more hopeless
startup strategies. But something about the crazy notion stuck with Jonah Staw
long after the chuckles had subsided. Lying awake a few nights later, Staw saw
more than a lonely sock in search of a mate. He saw a character — “LittleMissMatched” — who granted girls permission to express
themselves.


width="140" />
LittleMissMatched Founder Jonah Staw

Fortunately, Staw had learned to
trust his own instincts on branding. He had tested those instincts as director
of corporate development at Frog Design, an innovative Web shop in San
Francisco, while working on creative strategies for companies such as Target
and DaimlerChrysler. Now, as Staw contemplated his own vision of mismatched
socks, his gut kind of took over.
 “I knew it was a good
idea because you can’t not smile when you hear about it,”
says Staw, now 34, the co-founder and CEO of LittleMissMatched Inc. “I
knew that if there’s an emotional reaction, it’s a good
concept.” 
That was back in 2003. A year
later, the first LittleMissMatched merchandise appeared at Linens ‘n
Things and Nordstroms across the country: a pack of six mismatched socks for
eight dollars.  The company’s Web site, 
href="http://www.littlemissmatched.com">littlemissmatched.com, launched a
few months after the socks. The next year, LittleMissMatched was offering
pajamas, pencil pouches, books, bedding, flip-flops, furniture — and, of course, socks — in boutiques and specialty stores, among them
FAO Schwartz. By Christmas 2008, the products were in more than 80 Macy’s
stores nationwide, and retail sales hit $32 million for the year, a 30 percent
increase over the year before. Never mind the Great Recession. 
LittleMissMatched fans parade down New York's Fifth Avenue.
The first of four permanent
LittleMissMatched stores opened in May 2009, in New York’s Grand
Central Terminal. That was followed a month later by outlets in Downtown Disney
in Anaheim and Myrtle Beach, S.C. When the
company opened its store on New York’s Fifth Avenue, in August of
this year, some 500 fans — median
age 10 going on 11 — paraded
down America’s favorite shopping street in gloriously mismatched
attire. 
So what can you learn from an
offbeat retailer born in a late-night bull session? 
Staw says a lot depended on
faith in the fundamental concept. He encouraged potential partners to dream
with him. “We’ve always pretended we’re bigger
than we are,” says Staw. “We were always trying to present
the brand in the best possible light and allow future partners to imagine where
LittleMissMatched could go, rather than where it was at the moment.”
Inside the LittleMissMatched store.
The brand vision was Staw’s
guiding light. As the mismatched socks caught on, the company forged ahead with
new products emphasizing a kind of measured individuality, allowing each girl
to stand out, but not too much. All the company’s products — from the stocks to the flip-flops to the
bedding — are designed to be
fun but not aggressively different. The patterns don’t match, but
they kind of do, too.  And they provide nearly endless opportunity to
customize. There are 384 possible design combinations associated with one
LittleMissMatched bed, so a girl can redecorate her room every day, without
repeating, for more than a year. 
Staw stuck with the vision, even
when outside marketing experts questioned whether it could really be pushed as
far as he wanted.  They wondered whether LittleMissMatched wouldn’t
be better off concentrating on socks. They wondered whether the customer could
be defined a bit more conventionally. After all, the nonconformist might be a
pretty tough customer to target. “I said no,” Staw recalls.
“We’re about inspiring emotion. We’re selling
creativity, fun. And we are reinventing categories.”
The next challenge was the more
daunting. How to get the message — and
the merchandise — to the
masses?
Where Staw had favored
simplicity and daring in the branding scheme, he leaned toward complexity in
marketing and distribution. The result is that LittleMissMatched today has a
presence in five different markets: e-commerce; independent retailers (more
than 2,000 nationwide), established chains (Macy’s and JCPenney),
licensing, and the LittleMissMatched retail stores. “All of our
revenue channels are equal,” says Staw. 
The varied distribution efforts
benefit from a cohesive marketing program, with heavy emphasis on word of
mouth, or word of Web, or both. LittleMissMatched is active on 
href="http://www.myspace.com/littlemissmatchedsocks">MySpace, 
href="http://twitter.com/littlemissmatch">Twitter and 
href="http://www.facebook.com/LittleMissMatched">Facebook, but supplements
those networking efforts with real live promotional stunts, notably ice cream
carts festooned with socks and banners that read “matching is
overrated.”  When a new store opens, the company distributes
"Lost Sock" posters. The posters direct customers to a Web site, 
href="http://www.missmatchedfun.com/lost_my_sock.html">lostmysock.com,
where they get a coupon for free socks that can be redeemed only at the new
LittleMissMatched store.
Staw’s marketing
strategy gets an A-plus from 
href="http://www.bnet.com/2403-13241_23-351380.html">David Bell, an
associate professor of marketing at Wharton. “First and foremost, it’s
a cute brand that flips the conventional on its head, he says. “It’s
quirky and unconventional in a fun way, and it’s highly
differentiating.”
Bell applauds the distribution
strategy, as well. He believes that a variety of distribution channels can
complement each other, and that companies are unwise to rely heavily on just
one. “The way people buy products on the Internet interacts with
their physical location,” Bell suggests. Stores work great in cities,
where the sheer variety of retail outlets ensures that the target customer will
have access to the merchandise. “But if you live in Bakersfield,
California, where you have fewer offline options, then a Web site is more
valuable.”
Bell believes that
brick-and-mortar stores help communicate cultural values, as well. “It’s

has stores; they’re selling a whole experience and lifestyle, and
having a physical retail presence is a big deal.”
LittleMissMatched was a startup
that did a lot of things right, from Bell’s point of view: Be true to your brand. Differentiate your product, then stick with the
brand. 
Know your customer. Know
exactly what the customer wants to buy (in the case of LittleMissMatched,
different but not too different), and make sure your marketing and
design efforts connect with those values.
When it comes to distribution,
be careful about putting all your eggs in one basket.  Recognize that you may
need to reach Customer A with strategy A and Customer B with strategy B.
And finally, never get
complacent. “Customers love our brand, but in this economy, mom will
only spend so much,” Staw says. “Major retailers are
marking down their prices. Our biggest challenge is figuring out the right
product mix.”
Of course, that’s a
challenge for anyone these days. Judging by his track record, though, Staw
should be more than a match for it.

                                                Jonah Staw, co-founder and CEO of LittleMissMatched, heads-up a lifestyle brand that is based on "innovative and creative mixing and mismatching." LittleMissMatched launched in 2004 with a collection of mismatched socks sold in odd numbers to encourage girls of all ages to express themselves. The "nothing matches but anything goes" philosophy knocked people's socks off, and sales jumped from $5 million to $25 million in just three years. Today, the LittleMissMatched product line includes everything from socks, winterwear, and sleepwear to books, bedding, and furniture for mismatched mavens of all ages. LittleMissMatched products range in retail price from $5 to $1,200 and are available at specialty boutiques and department stores nationwide. The company recently announced $17.3 million in private equity funding, expanded distribution, a new flagship store in Manhattan, and a series of new products.
How do you define innovation?


 Innovation is such a broad term. I was recently on a McKinsey panel discussing innovation, and we opened by going around the room. There were more than 25 chief strategy officers from major US corporations. The moderator asked what was the most innovative product, and 90% of the audience said the iPod. I said the Post-It Note. Why? It is so simple it's obvious. It has become a fixture on the physical American desktop. It is useful. It invented a new category...before there were note cards, stationary, thumb tacks and more. Now we have the Post-it. Innovations are simple, elegant solutions that make things better. Better doesn't necessarily mean more efficient...it could be more fun, easier to use, beautiful. You get the point.
What are the most important areas of innovation in your organization?
My company is 100% based on innovation. We created a company that was founded on the premise of selling three-packs of non-matching socks. Talk about a challenge -- we were completely changing the way people got dressed each morning. We set out to tell the world that it was okay to not match your socks and as such, you should buy them in a novel way. Our socks are uniquely paired to look great together. What we discovered is that our socks are something that are simply FUN. They are so fun that people what to tell their friends about them. Our customers lift their pant legs and say, "Hey check out my socks!," this is certainly innovation in the world of socks. Our challenge is to translate this innovation into other product categories so that our brand is cohesive. At LittleMissMatched we believe that simple product innovations make our success. People will talk about our products if we give them unique products that are easy to talk about. We have furniture that you can draw all over with a dry erase pen. Why have you ever done that before? We have bedding that flips and switches to make 192 combos in one bed set. For us, innovation is key to our long term success. The good news is that every product category in the world can be missmatchified.
                                                    Boston.com
                                                
What is your most successful innovation? How did you find it?
It depends on how we define success. I personally love our furniture. Maybe that is because I flew to China to help finalize its development. It was a brutally challenging trip so I am enamored with the end result. If we look at units sold, our socks win the award. If we look at dollars/SKU sold, then our bedding wins. Each of these innovations were found by breaking conventional norms to bring a true value proposition to our customer. Imagine a world where now one bed in a bag we sell gives you 192 combos when all of our competition only gives you one option. When we are at our best, we subvert the marketplace...in other words, we don't talk about thread count, we talk about combos. What this means is that we don't actually have competition. Why? Because of our version of innovation!
Which innovation "failure" did you learn the most from, and why?
I don't ever believe in failure. I believe in learnings. Our first sock package almost disintegrated in your hand, but it was a totally unique package...it failed functionally, but it led us to where we are now. We are only four years old as a company, so each step we take is a learning. Success never happens spontaneously. As they say, "practice makes perfect."
What lessons can you pass on to others from how your organization has changed to make itself more innovation driven?
The kind of people who are innovation seekers are what I call "yes to no" people. They are the type that says, "Hey that is a really great idea, but I think it would be even better if..." They are expansive thinkers. They are not the type that says, "Nope, that idea won't work because xy or z." We have worked as hard as we can to hire "yes to no" people. We want everyone to have an open mind, but ultimately, we want them to be filters/curators at the right time so that they can make the hard decisions that will grow our business. If I can pass one lesson on, it is to hire "yes-to-no" people!
In your opinion what are the biggest barriers and challenges that stand in the way of organizations becoming more innovative?
We are a small company with a short history. Our historical benchmarks are not relevant yet because we are rapidly growing. I think the biggest barriers are companies that say they want to be innovative but they don't truly plan for innovation. They look at their historical benchmarks instead of forward at the possibilities. At the McKinsey panel I described earlier, a chief strategy officer from a Fortune 500 company said, "20% of our new products are now required to be driven by innovation." I asked, "Is the company setting aside 20% of your time to develop innovation?" Of course the answer was no. Innovation doesn't just happen. Organizations must understand that they must change culturally and structurally to enable innovative thinking. Ultimately, I believe the executive office suite must also be populated by innovative thinkers or innovation doesn't have a chance of success.
Beyond your organization, who do you admire for risk-taking innovation and what do you think makes them successful?
I admire everyone trying to think differently. There are so many people innovating there isn't just one person to name. I think ultimately innovators are successful because of their passion for success. Remember Steve Jobs failed his first time at Apple  and was fired by the board. A good idea isn't the key to success. It is execution, timing, market conditions and a whole lot more.
What innovation are you still waiting for?

 
If I had a list, I would be working on those innovations instead of what I am doing at LittleMissMatched! With all seriousness, I am very focused on building a brand based on creativity and innovation. I believe our brand has a broad enough foundation to explore the world!
