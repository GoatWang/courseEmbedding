Assuming the sale of all 3,500,000 shares of common stock we are offering
pursuant to this prospectus, we estimate that we will receive approximately
$298,000 in net proceeds from this offering after deducting estimated expenses
of $52,000.

We expect to use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering to purchase
the rights to and commercialize discontinued consumer product brands and for
general corporate purposes. However, as of the date of this prospectus, we have
no definitive agreement relating to any such acquisition or investment.

The maximum proceeds of this offering shall be $350,000. Depending upon the
number of shares sold in this offering, we shall apply the proceeds
substantially as set forth in the table below within the first 12 months after
successful completion of this offering and receipt of the funds.

As is the case with any business, it should be expected that certain expenses
unforeseeable to our management at this juncture will arise in the future.

Our proposed business is subject to significant competition. The food and
consumer products industry is fragmented, highly competitive and is dominated by
large multinational companies including, but not limited to, Nestle, Kraft
Foods, Mars, Proctor & Gamble and Unilever, as well as smaller competitors, many
of whom have already established their brand name recognition in our proposed
markets. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly larger
marketing personnel and financial resources than we have and competition for
shelf space in grocery stores and other retail outlets is intense, costly and
poses great difficulty for smaller food and consumer product companies and
distributors. 

We intend to offer distinctive products which address specific consumer needs.
We will target the senior population where nostalgia is expected to be a strong
motivator for purchases. However, these efforts will not guarantee that we will
be competitive or that our business plan will be successful. Further, we intend
to compete with other companies that see the value of reintroducing discontinued
product brands. 

We believe that competition is based primarily upon availability, price, quality
and efficacy of products, customer service, brand name recognition and marketing
and trade support, and successful product introductions.


Company Description
We aim to acquire ownership and other rights to discontinued consumer product
brands, with the ultimate goal of reviving these products and commercializing
them, based on an idea that nostalgia for such brands will be a powerful
incentive to purchase among the senior population. We believe that


 many formerly
popular brand names that were discontinued by their parent companies still
resonate with the senior population and if so revived and made available in
supermarkets and other retail establishments, would attract this population and
others as consumers. 
---

Proposed Products

We intend to target for purchase the intellectual property and other rights to
discontinued consumer product brands. We consider a product to be discontinued
if it is no longer available at traditional retail levels such as grocery and
drug stores, or on the internet. 

We do not currently own any brand names or have any products for sale. To date,
we have researched over 100 discontinued products and are focusing upon 20 of
these products in following three categories of consumer products: candy, food
other than candy, and personal products, as follows: 

. Candy. Bit-O-Licorice, Big Yank, Old Nick and Hollywood candy bars.   
                                                                           
. Food Other Than Candy. Amazo Instant Dessert, Ballard Cornbread Mix, Cocomalt,
  Hydrox Cookies, Krumbles Cereal, Ann Page Pork and Beans, Pep Cereal, Puffa
  Puffa Rice Cereal and Van Camp's Chili Con Carne.   
                                                                 
. Personal Products. Calox Tooth Powder, Chipso Laundry Soap, Forhans for the
  Gums, Rapid Shave, Shower Mate, Stopette Deodorant and Sun 'N' Surf.  

We hope to acquire at least one product from each category. Some of the product
brands we intend to target for acquisition are in the public domain while the
rights to others are still owned by companies from whom we would endeavor to
acquire the manufacturing and distribution rights either upon a royalty basis or
outright purchase. 

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring rights to any
of the above targeted products or any other discontinued products. We do not
believe that any of our targeted products are available on the internet or at
the retail level. 
---

We were incorporated on November 5, 2010 under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Our principal executive office is located at 20 Pape Drive, Atlantic
Highlands, New Jersey 07716, and our telephone number at that office is (732)
291-3661. We intend to purchase rights to, and develop, our website at the
following address: www.nostalgiafamilybrands.com.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM







	To the Shareholders and Board of


	Trustees of


	Clough Global Equity Fund





	In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of Clough Global Equity Fund, (the

	“

	Fund

	”

	), as of and for the seven months ended October 31, 2014, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the Fund

	’

	s internal control over financial reporting, including controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund

	’

	s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.





	The management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund

	’

	s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  A fund

	’

	s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the fund; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a fund

	’

	s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  





	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.





	A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Fund

	’

	s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.





	Our consideration of the Fund

	’

	s internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Fund

	’

	s internal control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls over safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2014.





	This report is intended solely for the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees


	of the Fund and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.














	COHEN FUND AUDIT SERVICES, LTD.


	Cleveland, Ohio
