Birth Data
        





Philip Ahn was a male celebrity.
He was born on Wednesday March 29th 1905, in Los Angeles, California, USA,.









9
With a 9 Maturity Number, Philip Ahn does not always have an easy path before him. He must learn to balance his love for humanity with his own needs. Throughout his life Philip will heal and enlighten those around him, and in his later years Ahn will have mastered his healing techniques and learned to apply his compassion for others effectively. Philip Ahn will be able to look upon his life and see that he has been a great benefit to most who have had the good fortune to know him. Philip's concern for the well being of society will grow more powerful as he comes to maturity. Philip Ahn will be drawn to doing much public service, and the long-term good of his community and even the world will occupy his thoughts increasingly. As he matures, his appreciation for the arts and beauty in any form will also increase. It is quite possible that Ahn will be actively involved in the arts, if that is not already the case, often as a benefactor. Service to humanity is fundamental to Ahn's life. Philip will grow in understanding and wisdom as he matures. Involvement with international affairs or humanitarian service offers him much satisfaction. If Philip Ahn already has several 9s in his chart, especially among the core numbers, he will have to guard against arrogance, aloofness, and alienation. But if there are only few 9s or none at all, Philip will gain a sense of his personal place among the human race. He will feel he belongs and that he has provided something of lasting value for the future.
