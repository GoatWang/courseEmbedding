Title: Associate
               Company: Frenkel Lambert Weiss Weisman & Gordon LLP
Job Details
               Frenkel Lambert Weiss Weisman & Gordon, LLP is a law firm steeped in the best traditions of AV rated law firms while at the same time a leader in the legal community in technological advancements. Frenkel Lambert is the product of the merger of two exceptional law firms: Eschen, Frenkel, Weisman, & Gordon and Lambert & Weiss. Together, they have served the insurance and banking industries for over 77 collective years. In 1960 Marvin Eschen founded the firm which evolved into Eschen, Frenkel, Weisman & Gordon, handling general liability and products liability matters on the premise that being an aggressive litigator/trial attorney does not mean sacrificing professionalism and integrity. Since 1960 that tradition has continued. In 1982 Lambert & Weiss was founded in New York, and has since established an impeccable record servicing insurance companies and their insureds in defense of claims, insurance coverage, surety, fidelity, ERISA, subrogation, professional liability and the defense of complex property and personal injury lawsuits. Today, Frenkel Lambert has become a leader in the legal industry not only in terms of the representation it provides, but also in the areas of information security, and legal case management system technology. The firm views technology as a key means in providing efficient, economical services to our clients, however, we have never lost sight of the importance of the personal side of service. With that in mind, our staff always remains available to personally discuss any inquiries and/or issues that may arise throughout the life of your case.

 Educational Background



MBA 


University of Chicago - Booth School of Business

                  The University of Chicago Booth School of Business is a graduate business school located in Chicago, Illinois, at the University of Chicago. Formerly known as the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, Chicago Booth is the second-oldest business school in the U.S., the first such school to offer an Executive MBA program, and the first to initiate a Ph.D. program in business. The school was renamed in 2008 following a $300 million endowment gift to the school by alumnus David G. Booth. The school has the third-largest endowment of any business school.

The school's flagship campus is located in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago on the main campus of the university. The school also maintains additional campuses in London and Asia (originally Singapore, but in July 2013 a move to Hong Kong was announced), as well as in downtown Chicago on the Magnificent Mile. In addition to conducting graduate business programs, the school conducts research in the fields of finance, economics, quantitative marketing research, and accounting. Chicago Booth is currently ranked first in the United States by Bloomberg Businessweek and first globally by the Economist.

He, his Physician Assistant Jennifer Schofield, and his office staff are very friendly and easy to work with.

I developed symptoms of left cubital tunnel syndrome in 2011. The symptoms were misdiagnosed by a general practitioner. When I finally went to an orthopedic surgeon at Kaiser in 2015, he didn't recommend surgery. Thank goodness I knew about Andrew Stein through my mother's workman's comp. He recommended surgery for my left arm in 2015. I ha55-Cherise in castro valley | Apr 18, 2017I'll be honest when I first heard about Dr. Stein I was having doubts because of the bad reviews but I went to see him anyway and I'm glad I did. Dr. Stein is wonderful. I had two surgeries and they both turned out great. Don't let a couple bad reviews scare you. He is very professional he explains everything to you and his staff is friendly and helpful. I would definitely go back to Dr. Stein. Couldn't ask for a better doctor! THANKS Dr. Stein!55-Gene in Fremont, CA | Mar 21, 2017Dr. Stein removed ganglion cyst from my left wrist in the surgical room located ten yards from his office. I recovered very quickly as expected. Thanks to Dr, Stein for his professionalism and kindness.35Castro Valley, CA | Mar 13, 2017My overall experience with Dr. Stein and his staff was good and I would recommend him to my friends.45San Leandro | Mar 02, 2017I broke my pinky at work, and workers comp sent me to a doctor who did surgery which didn't go too well, and after 5 months I was not able to move it,I contacted the insurance and asked to be sent to another doctor for a second opinion I was sent to Dr. Stein,  and he told me I needed another surgery, it took less than a week to schedule appointment for surgery, I wish the workers comp insurance would've sent me here from the beginning 55-Mia Y in Oakland, CA | Jan 19, 2017I was referred to Dr. Stein from the ER with a laceration on the back of my hand, just over the knuckle. Small but with concern for tendon injury. Dr. Stein and his staff explained all of my options. Carefully listened to any and all information I could provide. They asked about and assessed every aspect of my injury and treatment in several different ways. He explained each step and options thoroughly, offering but not pushing for surgery. I'm now all healed up and happy. No surgery required.15Oakland, CA | Jan 07, 2017My appointment with this doctor was very disturbing. Who started the appointment by telling me workers comp horror stories- its unlikely thr surgery is approved, it can take years, you can run out benefits before you're healed, using your own insurance would be faster.
"You are likely pre-diabetic and that's why you have carpal tunnel, not due to repetitive work, that is a myth." "Women are built differently, and that's why women have higher instances of carpal tunnel than men." HORRIFIC55-Christina in Castro Valley, CA | Jan 06, 2017I first saw Dr Stein as a second opinion ten years ago about my carpal tunnel and trigger finger. Since that time I have had multuple procedures done by him including these, cubital tuneel and frozen shoulder.  He is confident, professional, tells you all of your options and explains thouroughly your conditions. His procedures fix what is wrong so that you do not have reoccurances. I would never seen another physician for any hand or arm procedure and always recommend him to others!55Dublin, CA | Nov 28, 2016caring staff - great experience 
got right to the problem and solved it55-ChristineW in San Leandro, CA | Nov 19, 2016Our family has been going to Dr. Stein at East Bay Medical Hand Clinic for years, and we have always received exceptional care and service. Dr Stein has performed numerous surgeries on me and my husband and they have all been very successful. He is down to earth, caring and personable all while being very professional about our care. He explains things thoroughly and involves us in courses of action. From the front office staff to the medical all staff we have always felt like we mattered55-Scott in El Sobrante, CA | Oct 19, 2016Dr. Stein was great. It is great to get to a Doc that has the skills and pays you the attention it takes to get the best result. Thanks Dr. Stein55-Debra Lopez Nacario in San Leandro, CA | Sep 24, 2016Love Dr Stein..and would definitely refer him to family and friends..As a matter of fact my husband goes to him also..We received the best care..Found out what was wrong with my hand.Torn tendon,fixed and I'm happy as can be.Love that he's direct and listens to what I say.He took care of my hand issue ,explained in a way I could understand. 15-Wicked1 in Newark, CA | Apr 17, 2016My first meeting with him was fairly nice. He made me think he could fix my hand with surgery. I was told to get a second opinion which I had forgotten but he sure let me have it when I met with him the second time! He did a complete turn around! He was Rude, Obnoxious, Self righteous! He complained about how his staff had called off sick and left him to take care of checking in patients and he had things to do. He acted like a whiney 2 year old! I dont trust him or his abilities!

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.

Strong Advocate against Fraud, Criminal Conspiracy, and Federal Charges
Simply speaking, fraud is any crime that involves an element of deceit, trickery, or breach of confidence committed in order to gain an unfair and/or dishonest advantage, which is usually financial in nature. From identity theft to money laundering to bankruptcy fraud, most of these charges are serious state offenses that usually have a federal counterpart. A conviction for fraud, such as for mortgage or real estate fraud, in Palm Beach County can come with severe consequences at the state level that include prison time, fines, civil penalties, and civil liability for any damage done.
Though unusual, it is not impossible for a West Palm Beach fraud offense that is also a federal crime to be charged at the state level as well. Federal charges are not necessarily better or worse than state charges, but they are different and often complex. They are governed by different laws, rules, and procedures and federal court has a different environment than state-governed courts. Many federal charges involve some element of criminal conspiracy (also sometimes known as racketeering), which is when a group of alleged offenders work together to commit one or more crimes on a large scale.
With all federal charges, including criminal conspiracy, it?s best to hire a lawyer experienced in these cases rather than a lawyer who has never fought a federal case before. In any major drug case or fraud case, it is also important to consider an experienced federal charge defense attorney for your Florida criminal case, as the federal charges could be pursued in addition to or in lieu of your state case at any point. Andrew Stine is an experienced Palm Beach County federal attorney who knows what it takes to protect you in federal court.
