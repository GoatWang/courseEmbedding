3 Things You Should Know About Cirrus Logic, Inc.
This top Apple supplier is increasing its investments in its future and has several exciting growth opportunities ahead of it. 











                Ashraf Eassa
            

                (TMFChipFool)



            
            Jul 24, 2017 at 10:50AM
            
            





Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) is a well-known vendor of audio chips. Its largest customer is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which made up 78% of the company's revenue in its most recent quarter (no doubt driven by its strong position in the iPhone 7 series of smartphones and related accessories), though it has been aggressively pursuing other customers in the smartphone market while trying to bring its audio products to other markets, as well.
Cirrus Logic has an interesting investor presentation on its website that goes into quite a lot of detail about its business, market opportunities, and relevant industry trends. There are three items from the presentation that I think current and prospective investors in Cirrus Logic should be aware of.

Image source: Cirrus Logic.

Surging research and development spending
Cirrus Logic says that its annual research and development spending has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% beginning in fiscal year 2012. Back then, Cirrus Logic spent just $86 million in research and development, but in its most recent fiscal year -- that's fiscal year 2017 -- the company's research and development spending came in at $304 million.

Image source: Cirrus Logic.

Cirrus says that it has "more than 900 engineers" in R&D working to accelerate product development, find and go after "new market opportunities," and broaden its intellectual property portfolio.
Here's why this is encouraging. First, Cirrus Logic depends on a single customer for most of its revenue, so it needs to innovate at a rapid pace to meet that customer's extreme demands, lest it be designed out of future Apple products, rendering its entire business unviable.
Although Cirrus can reduce its business risk by continuing to invest in building great products for Apple (and this is what the company seems to be doing), it's also smart for it to de-risk its business by expanding both the number of major customers that it serves in its core market (portable audio chips) as well as the end markets it serves.
Cirrus, at least based on its statements, seems to be doing just that.
Beyond flagship smartphones
Cirrus Logic says in its investor presentation that flagship smartphones (e.g., iPhone) are "fueling demand" by requiring "ultra-low power complex signal processing to enable audio and voice use cases" and "increasing channel count for audio and voice [input/output]."
However, the company also claims that its served addressable market is growing as its business grows "beyond flagship."
Cirrus says that it's seeing "increased penetration of new phone platforms," and to capitalize on that opportunity it's building technologies for lower-cost devices that include "optimized feature sets and cost to enable new features on new platforms."
The features that it says it's enabling on those platforms include "always-on control" and "boosted speaker amplifiers with protection."





The "smart accessories" market is growing
Cirrus said in its presentation that it expects the total addressable for smartphones and tablets to enjoy solid growth from 2016 to 2020. However, an area where the company seems to be expecting explosive growth is in the "smart accessories" market (think Apple AirPods).

Image source: Apple.

The company says that the total addressable market for "smart accessories" in units was a little over 500 million in 2016 and expects that figure to approach 1.5 billion by 2020.
Should the market expand as Cirrus Logic expects it to, and should the company capture a significant share of this fast-growing market, its financial performance could benefit substantially over the next several years from the opportunity.

3 Things You Should Know About Cirrus Logic, Inc.
This top Apple supplier is increasing its investments in its future and has several exciting growth opportunities ahead of it. 











                Ashraf Eassa
            

                (TMFChipFool)



            
            Jul 24, 2017 at 10:50AM
            
            





Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) is a well-known vendor of audio chips. Its largest customer is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which made up 78% of the company's revenue in its most recent quarter (no doubt driven by its strong position in the iPhone 7 series of smartphones and related accessories), though it has been aggressively pursuing other customers in the smartphone market while trying to bring its audio products to other markets, as well.
Cirrus Logic has an interesting investor presentation on its website that goes into quite a lot of detail about its business, market opportunities, and relevant industry trends. There are three items from the presentation that I think current and prospective investors in Cirrus Logic should be aware of.

Image source: Cirrus Logic.

Surging research and development spending
Cirrus Logic says that its annual research and development spending has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% beginning in fiscal year 2012. Back then, Cirrus Logic spent just $86 million in research and development, but in its most recent fiscal year -- that's fiscal year 2017 -- the company's research and development spending came in at $304 million.

Image source: Cirrus Logic.

Cirrus says that it has "more than 900 engineers" in R&D working to accelerate product development, find and go after "new market opportunities," and broaden its intellectual property portfolio.
Here's why this is encouraging. First, Cirrus Logic depends on a single customer for most of its revenue, so it needs to innovate at a rapid pace to meet that customer's extreme demands, lest it be designed out of future Apple products, rendering its entire business unviable.
Although Cirrus can reduce its business risk by continuing to invest in building great products for Apple (and this is what the company seems to be doing), it's also smart for it to de-risk its business by expanding both the number of major customers that it serves in its core market (portable audio chips) as well as the end markets it serves.
Cirrus, at least based on its statements, seems to be doing just that.
Beyond flagship smartphones
Cirrus Logic says in its investor presentation that flagship smartphones (e.g., iPhone) are "fueling demand" by requiring "ultra-low power complex signal processing to enable audio and voice use cases" and "increasing channel count for audio and voice [input/output]."
However, the company also claims that its served addressable market is growing as its business grows "beyond flagship."
Cirrus says that it's seeing "increased penetration of new phone platforms," and to capitalize on that opportunity it's building technologies for lower-cost devices that include "optimized feature sets and cost to enable new features on new platforms."
The features that it says it's enabling on those platforms include "always-on control" and "boosted speaker amplifiers with protection."





The "smart accessories" market is growing
Cirrus said in its presentation that it expects the total addressable for smartphones and tablets to enjoy solid growth from 2016 to 2020. However, an area where the company seems to be expecting explosive growth is in the "smart accessories" market (think Apple AirPods).

Image source: Apple.

The company says that the total addressable market for "smart accessories" in units was a little over 500 million in 2016 and expects that figure to approach 1.5 billion by 2020.
Should the market expand as Cirrus Logic expects it to, and should the company capture a significant share of this fast-growing market, its financial performance could benefit substantially over the next several years from the opportunity.

History[edit]
Patil Systems, Inc., was founded in Salt Lake City in 1981 by Dr. Suhas Patil, in 1983 the company was reorganized by Dr. Patil, Kamran Elahian, and venture capitalist Fred Nazem, whose firm, Nazem and Company provided the company's first/start-up round of financing. Later the company was renamed as Cirrus Logic when it moved to Silicon Valley in 1984 to focus on solutions for the growing PC components market. Michael Hackworth was named president and chief executive officer in January 1985, and served as CEO until February 1999. It joined the Nasdaq market listing in 1989 (symbol: CRUS). Cirrus Logic acquired Crystal Semiconductor, a supplier of analog and mixed-signal converter ICs, in 1991. In the early 1990s, Cirrus Logic became a supplier of PC graphics chips, audio converters and chips for magnetic storage products. David D. French joined Cirrus Logic, Inc., as president and chief operating officer in June 1998 and was named chief executive officer in February 1999. Soon after joining the company, through an acquisition strategy Mr. French repositioned the company into a premier supplier of high-performance analog and digital processing chip solutions for consumer entertainment electronics and soon afterwards, Mr. M. Yousuf Palla joined as Vice President of Operations and Manufacturing, contributing further to its success. The company announced in April 2000 that it had completed moving its headquarters to Austin, Texas.[4] In June 2005, Cirrus Logic sold its video products operation to an investment firm, creating privately owned Magnum Semiconductor. After French resigned in March 2007, Jason Rhode, formerly the vice president and general manager of Cirrus Logic's Mixed Signal Audio Division, was named president and CEO in May 2007. Today, Cirrus Logic is focused on its high-precision technologies for digital signal processing components for audio and energy markets. In 2014 Cirrus Logic bought Wolfson Microelectronics for £291 million.

Graphics history[edit]
In the early 1990s, Cirrus Logic was a supplier of low-cost PC graphics chips. Cirrus' Microsoft Windows 2D GUI accelerators (GDI) were among the fastest in the low-end market-segment, outperforming competing VGA-chips from Oak Technologies, Trident Microsystems, and Paradise (Western Digital). For example, the Cirrus GD5422 (1992) supported hardware acceleration for both 8-bit color and 16-bit color. It was one of the lowest-priced SVGA controllers to support both.
By the mid-1990s, when PC's had migrated to the PCI bus, Cirrus had fallen behind S3 and Trident Microsystems. When the announced release date of the GD5470 "Mondello" came and went, Cirrus's reputation in desktop PC-graphics suffered. Mondello development took a back seat to the GD5464 which was near completion and proved to be a much faster design with the use of Rambus. (Because of this Mondello never got off the ground)
The company's final graphics chips, the GD546x "Laguna" series of PCI/AGP 3D-accelerators, were novel in that they were one of the few video cards to use Rambus RDRAM. The patented use of tiled memory used by the GD546x chips is still used by nearly all graphics processors today. However, like many other 2D/3D chips at the time were gate limited by the process technology available at the time, the feature set of perspective-correct texture mapping, bilinear filtering, single-pass lighting, gouraud shading, and alpha blending, was incomplete compared to the next generation of 3D chips. The GD546x family was limited by CPU processing at the time, CPU's could not feed it enough triangles which was the real performance block. The raw processing power of the GD546x was nearly 2.5 million 25 pixel triangles per second, much faster than competitors.
When Intel announced they were entering the 3D market with the i740 Cirrus Logic exited the market, which at the time for Cirrus Logic was worth 500 million dollars annually. (Intel didn't catch up in performance for many years, the i740 was not widely accepted and did not win any major designs).
Emulated Cirrus Logic graphic cards are used in emulators. QEMU emulate the Cirrus CLGD 5446 PCI VGA-card, which is also emulated by Bochs (which in addition also emulates the CL-GD5430 ISA card).

History[edit]
Patil Systems, Inc., was founded in Salt Lake City in 1981 by Dr. Suhas Patil, in 1983 the company was reorganized by Dr. Patil, Kamran Elahian, and venture capitalist Fred Nazem, whose firm, Nazem and Company provided the company's first/start-up round of financing. Later the company was renamed as Cirrus Logic when it moved to Silicon Valley in 1984 to focus on solutions for the growing PC components market. Michael Hackworth was named president and chief executive officer in January 1985, and served as CEO until February 1999. It joined the Nasdaq market listing in 1989 (symbol: CRUS). Cirrus Logic acquired Crystal Semiconductor, a supplier of analog and mixed-signal converter ICs, in 1991. In the early 1990s, Cirrus Logic became a supplier of PC graphics chips, audio converters and chips for magnetic storage products. David D. French joined Cirrus Logic, Inc., as president and chief operating officer in June 1998 and was named chief executive officer in February 1999. Soon after joining the company, through an acquisition strategy Mr. French repositioned the company into a premier supplier of high-performance analog and digital processing chip solutions for consumer entertainment electronics and soon afterwards, Mr. M. Yousuf Palla joined as Vice President of Operations and Manufacturing, contributing further to its success. The company announced in April 2000 that it had completed moving its headquarters to Austin, Texas.[4] In June 2005, Cirrus Logic sold its video products operation to an investment firm, creating privately owned Magnum Semiconductor. After French resigned in March 2007, Jason Rhode, formerly the vice president and general manager of Cirrus Logic's Mixed Signal Audio Division, was named president and CEO in May 2007. Today, Cirrus Logic is focused on its high-precision technologies for digital signal processing components for audio and energy markets. In 2014 Cirrus Logic bought Wolfson Microelectronics for £291 million.

Graphics history[edit]
In the early 1990s, Cirrus Logic was a supplier of low-cost PC graphics chips. Cirrus' Microsoft Windows 2D GUI accelerators (GDI) were among the fastest in the low-end market-segment, outperforming competing VGA-chips from Oak Technologies, Trident Microsystems, and Paradise (Western Digital). For example, the Cirrus GD5422 (1992) supported hardware acceleration for both 8-bit color and 16-bit color. It was one of the lowest-priced SVGA controllers to support both.
By the mid-1990s, when PC's had migrated to the PCI bus, Cirrus had fallen behind S3 and Trident Microsystems. When the announced release date of the GD5470 "Mondello" came and went, Cirrus's reputation in desktop PC-graphics suffered. Mondello development took a back seat to the GD5464 which was near completion and proved to be a much faster design with the use of Rambus. (Because of this Mondello never got off the ground)
The company's final graphics chips, the GD546x "Laguna" series of PCI/AGP 3D-accelerators, were novel in that they were one of the few video cards to use Rambus RDRAM. The patented use of tiled memory used by the GD546x chips is still used by nearly all graphics processors today. However, like many other 2D/3D chips at the time were gate limited by the process technology available at the time, the feature set of perspective-correct texture mapping, bilinear filtering, single-pass lighting, gouraud shading, and alpha blending, was incomplete compared to the next generation of 3D chips. The GD546x family was limited by CPU processing at the time, CPU's could not feed it enough triangles which was the real performance block. The raw processing power of the GD546x was nearly 2.5 million 25 pixel triangles per second, much faster than competitors.
When Intel announced they were entering the 3D market with the i740 Cirrus Logic exited the market, which at the time for Cirrus Logic was worth 500 million dollars annually. (Intel didn't catch up in performance for many years, the i740 was not widely accepted and did not win any major designs).
Emulated Cirrus Logic graphic cards are used in emulators. QEMU emulate the Cirrus CLGD 5446 PCI VGA-card, which is also emulated by Bochs (which in addition also emulates the CL-GD5430 ISA card).

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
