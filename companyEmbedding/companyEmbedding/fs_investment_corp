1Represents the institutional offering price of FSIC III’s common stock. The institutional offering price is subject to offering expenses of up to 1.5%. Expenses and fees are described more fully in FSIC III’s prospectus. Please consult the prospectus and read it carefully. In February 2016, FSIC III closed its public offering to investors who purchase shares of its common stock through the independent broker-dealer channel.
        

2The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by FSIC III’s institutional offering price per share as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSIC III’s shares of common stock is subject to the discretion of FSIC III’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 100% of FSIC III’s distributions were funded through net investment income on a tax basis. No portion of FSIC III’s distributions for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was funded through expense reimbursements from FSIC III’s sponsor. The determination of the tax attributes of FSIC III’s distributions is made annually at the end of FSIC III’s fiscal year, and a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of FSIC III’s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders are reported to stockholders annually on Form 1099-DIV. FSIC III’s total operating expenses and excise taxes as a percentage of average net assets was 7.51% for the year ended December 31, 2016.

1
Institutional Stockholder Returns are the total returns an investor received for the highlighted period taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSIC III's institutional offering price at the beginning of the applicable period and reinvested all cash distributions pursuant to FSIC III's distribution reinvestment plan ("DRP"). Valuation as of the end of each period is the redemption price pursuant to FSIC III’s share repurchase program on such date. Upon liquidation or redemption, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
Although FSIC III closed its offering to new investors investing through independent broker-dealers in February 2016, it continues to offer shares to new investors through the institutional channel at the institutional offering price. FSIC III’s shares are no longer subject to a sales load, but are still subject to offering expenses of up to 1.5% of the gross proceeds received in its offering. FSIC III’s ratio of total operating expenses to average net assets was 7.51% for the year ended December 31, 2016.


2Cumulative cash distributions per share reflect the total regular cash distributions paid since inception on a per share basis as of June 30, 2017. The payment of future distributions on FSIC III’s shares is subject to the sole discretion of FSIC III’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions.

Investing in FSIC III may be considered speculative and involves a high level of risk, including the risk of a substantial loss of investment. The following are some of the risks an investment in FSIC III’s common stock involves; however, you should carefully consider all of the information found in the section of FSIC III’s prospectus entitled “Risk Factors” before deciding to invest in shares of FSIC III’s common stock.Because there is no public trading market for shares of FSIC III’s common stock and FSIC III is not obligated to effectuate a liquidity event by a specified date, if at all, it is unlikely that you will be able to sell your shares. If you are able to sell your shares before FSIC III completes a liquidity event, it is likely that you will receive less than you paid for them. While FSIC III intends to conduct quarterly tender offers for its shares, only a limited number of shares will be eligible for repurchase and FSIC III may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time. In addition, any such repurchases will be at the current institutional offering price on the date of repurchase. FSIC III intends to invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as “junk,” have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They may also be difficult to value and illiquid. FSIC III’s distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available toFSIC III for investment. Any capital returned to stockholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses. An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including lack of available information about these companies.Investing in middle market companies involves a number of significant risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on FSIC III’s operating results.A lack of liquidity in certain of FSIC III’s investments may adversely affect its business.FSIC III is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, which may have a substantial negative impact on its investments.FSIC III has borrowed funds to make investments, which increases the volatility of its investments and may increase the risks of investing in its securities.FSIC III has limited operating history and is subject to the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business.If FSIC III is unable to raise substantial funds in its ongoing, continuous “best efforts” public offering, then FSIC III will be more limited in the number and type of investments it may make.FSIC III is a long-term investment for persons of adequate financial means who have no need for liquidity in their investment. To invest in FSIC III, an investor must have either (i) a net worth of at least $70,000 and an annual gross income of at least $70,000, or (ii) a net worth of at least $250,000. Some states impose higher suitability standards. Please consult the prospectus for a detailed description of the suitability standards imposed on investors, including heightened standards required by certain states. FSIC III’s previous distributions to stockholders were funded in significant part from the reimbursement of certain expenses, including through the waiver of certain investment advisoryfees that are subject to repayment to its affiliate, FS Investments, and FSIC III’s future distributions may be funded from such waivers and reimbursements. Significant portions of thesedistributions may not be based on FSIC III’s investment performance, and such waivers and reimbursements by FS Investments may not continue in the future. If FS Investments were notto reimburse certain of FSIC III’s expenses, including through the waiver of certain of its advisory fees, significant portions of these distributions may come from offering proceeds orborrowings. The repayment of any amount owed to FS Investments will reduce the future distributions to which you would otherwise be entitled. 







To invest in FSIC III, an investor must have either (i) a net worth of at least $70,000 and an annual gross income of at least $70,000, or (ii) a net worth of at least $250,000. Some states impose higher suitability standards. Please consult the prospectus for a detailed description of the suitability standards imposed on investors, including heightened standards required by certain states. An investment in FSIC III’s common stock involves significant costs and investors should review the information in FSIC III’s prospectus regarding fees and expenses. Corporate governanceFS Investment Solutions, LLC | 201 Rouse Boulevard | Philadelphia, PA 19112877-372-9880 | Member FINRA/SIPC

	FSIC Overview



FS Investment Corporation (NYSE: FSIC) is a publicly traded business development company (BDC) focused on providing customized credit solutions to private middle market U.S. companies.  Investment approach  We seek to invest primarily in the senior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, the subordinated debt of private middle market U.S. companies to achieve the best risk-adjusted returns for our investors. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive or purchase equity interests such as common and preferred stock, warrants or options.  FSIC is differentiated by our flexible investment strategy which allows us to invest across the corporate capital structure and provide diversified exposure across multiple industries. Our core investment strategy is focused on direct originations and opportunistic investments, such as event-driven investments and anchor orders, which we believe allow us to take advantage of market inefficiencies. In certain circumstances we may also opportunistically invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield bond markets. Managers  FSIC is advised by FB Income Advisor, LLC, an affiliate of FS Investments, a leading manager of debt-focused alternative investment funds, and sub-advised by GSO / Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC, an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners, the credit platform of Blackstone. With approximately $93 billion in assets under management as of March 31, 2017, GSO Capital Partners is one of the world’s largest credit-oriented alternative asset managers with approximately 345 employees in New York, London, Dublin and Houston. We seek to leverage our size and resources with GSO’s global brand, underwriting capabilities, network of relationships and origination platform to maximize returns and preserve capital.  Since FSIC’s inception in January 2009, it has grown to become one of the largest BDCs in the market. As of March 31, 2017, FSIC had approximately $4.3 billion in assets under management and investments in 108 portfolio companies across 16 industries.  FS Investments is the largest sponsor of BDC assets with approximately $18.3 billion in BDC assets under management as of March 31, 2017.

FSIC Crosses Above Average Analyst Target
In recent trading, shares of FS Investment Corp have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $9.67, changing hands for $9.70/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level.

FS Investment Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 9.76% Yield (FSIC)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.
