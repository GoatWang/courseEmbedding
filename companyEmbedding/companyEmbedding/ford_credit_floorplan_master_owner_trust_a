Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Ladies and
Gentlemen:


     1. 
Introduction . Each of Ford Credit Floorplan Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (“ FCF Corp ” or a “
Depositor ”), and Ford Credit Floorplan LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (“ FCF LLC ”
or a “ Depositor ” and, together with FCF Corp,
the “ Depositors ”), propose to sell the
Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2 Notes and the Class B
Notes (together, the “ Publicly Registered Notes
”) described in the Terms Annex (the “ Terms
Annex ”) that is attached as Annex A and incorporated
into and made part of this agreement (this agreement including the
Terms Annex, this “ Agreement ”). The Publicly
Registered Notes will be registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “ Commission ”) and
will be sold to the applicable underwriters listed in the Terms
Annex through the representatives (the “
Representatives ”) signing this Agreement on behalf of
themselves and such underwriters (the Representatives and the other
underwriters of the Publicly Registered Notes, the “
Underwriters ”). Other capitalized terms used and not
defined in this Agreement will have the meanings given them in
Appendix A to the Sale and Servicing Agreements (defined
below). The rules of usage specified in the Sale and Servicing
Agreements will apply to this Agreement.


     The Publicly
Registered Notes will be issued by a Delaware statutory trust (the
“ Trust ”) identified in the Terms Annex and
established under a trust agreement (the “ Trust
Agreement ”) among the Depositors and an owner trustee
(the “ Owner Trustee ”) identified in the Terms
Annex. Simultaneously with the issuance and sale of the Publicly
Registered Notes as contemplated in this Agreement, the Trust will
issue the Class C Notes (the “ Class C Notes
”) and the Class D Notes (the “ Class D
Notes ”, and collectively with the Publicly Registered
Notes and the Class C Notes, the “ Notes ”)
pursuant to an indenture (the “ Base Indenture
”) and an indenture supplement (the “ Indenture
Supplement ” and, together with the Base Indenture, the
“ Indenture ”) between the Trust and an
indenture trustee (the “ Indenture Trustee ”)
identified in the Terms Annex and will be secured by a revolving
pool of receivables arising in connection with the purchase and
financing by various motor vehicle dealers of their new and used
car, truck and utility vehicle inventory (the “
Receivables ”) and the Related Security and certain
monies due thereunder on or after the Series Cutoff Date
identified in the Terms Annex. The Class C Notes and the
Class D Notes will initially be retained by the
Depositors.

 



 


     The Receivables
arising from the purchase by dealers of Ford-manufactured or
Ford-distributed vehicles (“ In-Transit Receivables
”) will be or have been sold by Ford Motor Company, a
Delaware corporation (“ Ford ”), to Ford Motor
Credit Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“
Ford Credit ”), pursuant to a sale and assignment
agreement (the “ Sale and Assignment Agreement
”) between Ford and Ford Credit. All Receivables have been or
will be sold by Ford Credit to the Depositors pursuant to separate
receivables purchase agreements (each, a “ Receivables
Purchase Agreement ”) between Ford Credit and FCF Corp
and FCF LLC, as applicable, each as further described in the Terms
Annex, and in turn transferred by the related Depositor to the
Trust and serviced for the Trust by Ford Credit (in such capacity,
the “ Servicer ”) pursuant to separate sale and
servicing agreements (each, a “ Sale and Servicing
Agreement ”), each as further described in the Terms
Annex. A back-up servicer will perform back-up servicing functions
pursuant to a back-up servicing agreement (the “ Back-up
Servicing Agreement ”), as described in the Terms Annex.
Ford Credit will also act as administrator for the Trust pursuant
to an administration agreement (the “ Administration
Agreement ”) among Ford Credit, the Trust and the
Indenture Trustee.


     In order to
perfect the security interest of the Indenture Trustee in certain
accounts, the Trust, the Indenture Trustee and the financial
institution acting as the securities intermediary have entered into
an account control agreement (the “ Control Agreement
”) and have or will enter into a series specific account
control agreement (the “ Series 2011-2 Control
Agreement ”).


     The Trust
Agreement, the Sale and Assignment Agreement, the Receivables
Purchase Agreements, the Sale and Servicing Agreements, the Back-up
Servicing Agreement, the Indenture, the Administration Agreement,
the Control Agreement and the Series 2011-2 Control Agreement
are collectively referred to as the “ Basic Documents
.” The Basic Documents and this Agreement are collectively
referred to as the “ Transaction Documents
.”


     The Depositors
have prepared and filed with the Commission under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act
”), and the rules and regulations of the Commission under the
Securities Act (the “ Rules and Regulations ”),
a registration statement on Form S-3 (having the registration
number stated in the Terms Annex), including a form of prospectus
and all amendments that are required as of the date of this
Agreement relating to the Publicly Registered Notes and the
offering of notes from time to time in accordance with
Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The registration statement,
as amended, has been declared effective by the Commission. Such
registration statement, as amended at the time of effectiveness,
including all material incorporated by reference therein, is
referred to in this Agreement as the “ Registration
Statement .” The Depositors also have filed with, or will
file with, the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (“
Rule 424(b) ”) under the Securities Act a
prospectus supplement relating to the Publicly Registered Notes
(the “ Prospectus Supplement ”). The prospectus
relating to the Publicly Registered Notes in the form first
required to be filed to satisfy the condition set forth in Rule
172(c) under the Securities Act is referred to as the “
Base Prospectus ,” and the Base Prospectus as
supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement required to be filed to
satisfy the condition set forth in Rule 172(c) under the Securities
Act is referred to as the “ Prospectus .” Any
reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, any
preliminary prospectus used in connection with the offering of the
Publicly Registered Notes described in the Terms Annex (the “
Preliminary Prospectus ”) or the Prospectus will be
deemed to refer to and include any exhibits thereto and any
documents incorporated by reference therein, as of the effective
date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Preliminary
Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be.


     At or prior to the
time that the Representatives first entered into “contracts
of sale” (within the meaning of Rule 159 under the
Securities Act, the “ Contracts of Sale ”) with
investors in the Publicly Registered Notes, which time will be
specified in the Terms Annex (such time, the “ Time of
Sale ”), the Depositors have prepared the Preliminary
Prospectus and the information (including any
“free-writing

2



 


prospectus,” as defined pursuant to
Rule 405 under the Securities Act (a “ Free Writing
Prospectus ”)) listed in the Terms Annex under
“Time of Sale Information” (collectively, the “
Time of Sale Information ”). If, subsequent to the
initial Time of Sale, the Depositors and the Representatives
determine that the original Time of Sale Information included an
untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading and the Representatives advise the Depositors that
investors in the Publicly Registered Notes have elected to
terminate their initial Contracts of Sale and enter into new
Contracts of Sale, then the “ Time of Sale ”
will refer to the time of entry into the first new Contract of Sale
and the “ Time of Sale Information ” will refer
to the information available to purchasers at the time of entry
(prior to the Closing Date) into the first new Contract of Sale,
including any information that corrects such material misstatements
or omissions (such new information, the “ Corrective
Information ”) and the Terms Annex will be deemed to be
amended to include such Corrective Information in the Time of Sale
Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of
Section 7, in the event that an investor elects not to
terminate its initial Contract of Sale and enter into a new
Contract of Sale, “ Time of Sale ” will refer to
the time of entry into such initial Contract of Sale and “
Time of Sale Information ” with respect to Publicly
Registered Notes to be purchased by such investor will refer to
information available to such purchaser at the time of entry into
such initial Contract of Sale.


     2. 
Representations and Warranties of the Depositors . Each
Depositor (and with respect to Section 2(m) only, Ford Credit)

as of the date of this Agreement:


     (a) 
Registration Statement and Prospectus . The Registration
Statement has been declared effective by the Commission under the
Securities Act; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement has been issued by the Commission and no
proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or, to the
knowledge of such Depositor, threatened by the Commission, and the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any amendment
thereto, at the time the Registration Statement became effective
and as of the Time of Sale complied, and as of the date of the
Prospectus Supplement will comply, in all material respects with
the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations and the
Registration Statement, did not, at the time the Registration
Statement became effective or as of the Time of Sale, and will not,
on the Closing Date, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; and as of the date of the Prospectus and any amendment
or supplement thereto and on the date of this Agreement, the
Prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; provided that such Depositor

Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement and
the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto; and the
conditions to the use by such Depositor of a registration statement
on Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as set forth in the General
Instructions to Form S-3, have been satisfied with respect to the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus. When the Indenture is

omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were

Information will include any Corrective Information provided to the
Representatives or the Underwriters by such Depositor in accordance
with Section 5(c).

Free Writing Prospectus . Other than the Preliminary Prospectus
and the Prospectus, such Depositor (including its agents and
representatives other than the Underwriters in their capacity as

Rule 405 under the Securities Act) that constitutes an offer
to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes other than the
documents, if any, listed as a Trust Free Writing Prospectus (each,
a “ Trust Free Writing Prospectus ”) in the
Terms Annex. Each such Trust Free Writing Prospectus complied in
all material respects with the Securities Act, has been filed in
accordance with Section 8 (to the extent required by
Rule 433 under the Securities Act) and, when taken together
with the Preliminary Prospectus, such Trust Free Writing Prospectus
did not at the Time of Sale, and at the Closing Date will not,

omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished to such Depositor by any Underwriter through the
Representatives expressly for use in such Trust Free Writing
Prospectus.

Exchange Act ”); and any further documents so filed
and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when such
documents are filed with the Commission, will conform in all

rules and regulations thereunder.


     (e)

is duly organized and validly existing as a corporation in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and it is
qualified as a foreign corporation in good standing and has
obtained all necessary licenses and approvals in all jurisdictions
in which the ownership or lease of its properties or the conduct of

approvals would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on its ability to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party. In the case of FCF
LLC, it is duly organized and validly existing as a limited
liability company in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware, and it is qualified as a foreign limited liability

transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which
such Depositor is a party and the fulfillment of the terms of the

Corp, violate its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws and, in
the case of FCF LLC, violate its Certificate of Formation or

or, to such Depositor’s knowledge, any order, rule or
regulation applicable to such Depositor of any court or of any
federal or state regulatory body, administrative agency or other
governmental instrumentality having jurisdiction over such
Depositor or its properties, in each case which conflict, breach,
default, lien, or violation would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on such Depositor’s ability to
perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it
is a party.

Power, Authorization and Enforceability . Such Depositor has
the power and authority to execute, deliver and perform the terms

Depositor has authorized the execution, delivery and performance of
the terms of this Agreement and on the Closing Date, the other
Transaction Documents to which such Depositor will be a party will

the benefits provided by the Indenture.

Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement or any
supplement to the Prospectus, (iii) of any stop order issued
by the Commission suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or the initiation or threat of any proceeding for that

untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, or (ii) for any other reason it is necessary

amended or supplemented, the Depositors agree to notify the
Representatives and to prepare and furnish to the Representatives,

amendment or a supplement to the Prospectus that will correct such
statement or omission or effect such compliance. If an Underwriter
is required by law to deliver a prospectus or other offering
document in connection with sales of any Publicly Registered Notes
at any time six months or more after the Closing Date, the
Representatives will notify the Depositors and inquire if either
clause (i) or (ii) above is applicable and, if so, upon
the Representatives’ request, but at the expense of such
Underwriter, the Depositors will prepare and deliver to such
Underwriter as many copies as the Representatives may reasonably

document complying with the Securities Act.

Noteholders as soon as practicable, but in any event no later than
eighteen months after the Closing Date, an earnings statement for

8



 


     (i) Ford Credit,
in which such officer will state that, to his or her knowledge
after reasonable investigation, the representations and warranties
of the Servicer contained in each Sale and Servicing Agreement and
of Ford Credit contained in each Receivables Purchase Agreement are
true and correct in all material respects and that Ford Credit has
complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions to be
performed by it or satisfied by it under such agreements in all
material respects.


     (ii) Each
Depositor, in which such officer will state that, to his or her
knowledge after reasonable investigation, the representations and
warranties of such Depositor contained in the Trust Agreement, each
Sale and Servicing Agreement and each Receivables Purchase
Agreement are true and correct in all material respects, and that
such Depositor has complied with all agreements and satisfied all
conditions to be performed by it or satisfied by it under such
agreements in all material respects.


     (d) 
Officer’s Certificates as to Conditions Precedent. The
Representatives will have received as of the Closing Date an
officer’s certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board,

Agreement are true and correct in all material respects, and that
such Depositor has complied with all agreements and satisfied all
conditions to be performed by it or satisfied by it under this
Agreement in all material respects.


     (e)  No
Material Adverse Change . Since the dates as of which
information is given in the Preliminary Prospectus, as amended or
supplemented, there has not occurred any material adverse change,
or any development involving a prospective material adverse change,
in or affecting particularly (i) the business or assets of
either Depositor, or any material adverse change in the financial
position or results of operations of either Depositor or
(ii) the business or assets of Ford Credit and its
subsidiaries considered as a whole, or any material adverse change
in the financial position or results of operations of Ford Credit
and its subsidiaries considered as a whole, otherwise than as set
forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, which in any case makes it
impracticable or inadvisable in the Representatives’
reasonable judgment to proceed with the public offering or the
delivery of the Publicly Registered Notes on the terms and in the
manner contemplated in the Prospectus.


     (f)  War
Out; Market Out . Subsequent to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement:


     (i) (A) there
will not have occurred a declaration of a general moratorium on
commercial banking activities by either the Federal or New York
State authorities or a material disruption in the securities
settlement or clearance systems in the United States, which
moratorium or disruption remains in effect and which, in the
Representatives’ reasonable judgment, substantially impairs
the Underwriters’ ability to settle the transaction;
provided that the exercise of such judgment will take into
account the availability of alternative means for settlement and
the likely duration of such moratorium or disruption with the
understanding that if the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission or with respect to a banking moratorium, the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System or New York State banking
authority, as applicable, has unequivocally stated prior to the
Closing Date that the resumption of such systems will occur within
three Business Days of the scheduled Closing Date for the Publicly
Registered Notes, the ability to settle the transaction will not be
deemed to be substantially impaired and (B) the United States
will not have become engaged in hostilities which have resulted in
the declaration of a national emergency or a declaration of war,
which makes it impracticable or inadvisable, in the
Representatives’ reasonable judgment, to proceed with the
public offering or the delivery of the Publicly Registered Notes on
the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented; and

9



 


     (ii) there will
not have occurred (A) any suspension or limitation on trading
in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the
National Association of Securities Dealers National Market system,
or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange or
market system, (B) any suspension of trading of any securities
of Ford Motor Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter
market or (C) any material outbreak or material escalation of
hostilities involving the engagement of armed conflict in which the
United States is involved or (D) any material adverse change
in the general economic, political, legal, tax, regulatory or
financial conditions or currency exchange rates in the United
States (whether resulting from events within or outside the United
States) which, in the Representatives’ view has caused a
substantial deterioration in the price and/or value of the Publicly
Registered Notes, that in the case of clause (A), (B), (C) or
(D), in the mutual reasonable determination of the Representatives
and Ford Credit, the effect of any such event or circumstance makes
it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering
or the delivery of the Publicly Registered Notes on the terms and
in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented.

Credit of the transactions contemplated thereby, will not conflict
with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or

Transaction Documents to which they are parties or have a material
adverse effect on the validity and

11



 


enforceability
of any of the Transaction Documents to which they are parties, or

issuance or sale of the Notes, nor the execution and delivery by
Ford Credit or the Depositors of the Transaction Documents to which
they are parties nor the consummation of any of the other
transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents to which
they are parties will contravene the terms of any material
provision of any United States federal or Michigan State statute,
order or regulation applicable to Ford Credit or the Depositors, or
the Delaware Limited Liability Company or the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as applicable, unless such contravention would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the

Fitch Expects to Rate Ford Credit Floorplan Master Owner Trust A Series 2016-5; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Expects to Rate Ford Credit Floorplan Master Owner Trust A Series 
      2016-5; Presale Issued
    





December 01, 2016 09:11 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to rate Ford Credit Floorplan Master Owner Trust A 
      (FCFMOT) series 2016-5 as follows:
    

      --$750,000,000 class A-1/A-2 at 'AAAsf (EXP)'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$34,314,000 class B at 'AAsf (EXP); Outlook Stable;
    

      --$49,020,000 class C NR;
    

      --$29,412,000 class D NR.
    

      Classes A-1 and A-2 will be sized according to investor demand.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Receivables Quality: Over 90% of the trust receivables are 
      originated from credit lines made by Ford Credit to finance new vehicle 
      inventory. Dealer risk ratings have been stable and trending upward over 
      the past five years. The trust's original equipment manufacturer (OEM), 
      make and geographic concentrations are also consistent with historical 
      levels.
    

      Strong Dealer Network: Based on dealer financial metrics and internal 
      dealer risk ratings, the financial health of Ford Credit's dealer 
      network is currently strong, with healthy absorption rates and high 
      operating income levels. Dealer defaults have been minimal.
    

      Strong Trust Performance: FCFMOT continues to experience stable trends 
      performance thus far in 2016, despite slowing sales and rising inventory 
      levels. The trust's monthly payment rates (MPRs) and aging distributions 
      have both deteriorated slightly but remain at healthy levels.
    

      Limits Mitigate Overexposure: Concentration limits for individual 
      dealers, vehicle types, OEMs and segments help to ensure the trust's 
      receivables remain both consistent and diverse.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Initial credit enhancement (CE) for the 
      class A notes is 24.38% (of the pool), consisting of subordination, an 
      available subordinate amount and a cash reserve. Loss coverage provided 
      by the structure is in excess of Fitch's expected net loss assumptions. 
      Structural features and various triggers also help to mitigate dealer 
      default risk and OEM bankruptcy.
    

      Consistent Origination and Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates adequate 
      abilities as sponsor, originator and servicer as evidenced by the 
      historical performance of FCFMOT. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Wells Fargo) 
      is the backup servicer for this series, consistent with prior series.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction 
      provides that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      To conduct rating sensitivity for the issued notes, under a category B 
      Dealer Floorplan platform, Fitch assumes portfolio default levels at 
      10%, 25%, and 40%, and under two recovery-level scenarios of 50% and 
      30%. Fitch modelled this series with the assumption that the above 
      defaults have occurred and recoveries were stressed accordingly, 
      reflecting asset performance in a stressed environment. Remaining 
      expected loss levels were compared with the stressed loss assumption 
      grid commensurate with various rating levels.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale
