Incorporation of Pemex Industrial Transformation
Newsletters


December 14 2015



Energy & Natural Resources
Mexico



On November 18 2014 the corporate reorganisation of Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) was commenced by means of resolutions adopted by its board of directors. The resolutions approved the merger of three Pemex subsidiaries – Pemex Refinement, Pemex Gas and Basic Petrochemicals and Pemex Petrochemicals – into a single subsidiary productive enterprise called Pemex Industrial Transformation (PTI).
On April 28 2015 the incorporation resolutions of seven subsidiary productive enterprises were published in the Federal Register, including that of the PTI. The PTI incorporation resolution was set to enter into force following publication of a declaration from the Pemex board of directors in the Federal Register which confirmed the completion of all necessary legal, technical and administrative procedures for the PTI to become the universal successor in interest of all of the rights and obligations of the subsidiary entities.
The PTI incorporation resolution accordingly entered into force on November 1 2015. The PTI has thus become the universal successor in interest of all rights and obligations of Pemex's previous subsidiary entities. All contracts and legal acts entered into by the subsidiary entities before this date – as well as the property, liabilities and assets (including all rights and obligations) of these entities – are now deemed to have been transferred to the PTI.
The main purpose of the PTI will be the refinement, transformation, processing, import, export, marketing, retail, manufacture and sale of hydrocarbons, petroleum products, natural gas and petrochemicals. This includes:

the storage, transportation and distribution of these products; and
the incorporation of affiliate companies and participation in joint ventures and partnerships with private parties.

Although it is not entirely clear from the PTI incorporation resolution or that of Pemex Logistics (which became effective on October 1 2015), in principle, the PTI will retain title to all midstream and downstream infrastructure assets held by the subsidiary entities while Pemex Logistics will render logistical services to the PTI and other enterprises and Pemex joint venture companies.

Contenido de la páginaWe are the most important company in Mexico and one of the largest in Latin America, and our success is reflected in our dedication to the future of Mexico. As the largest tax contributor to the Mexican government, the income we generate helps support all three levels of government: federal, state and municipal. We directly and indirectly participate in the economic and social development of our country. Our operations are geographically dispersed throughout Mexico, and we have presence in almost every state.Through its long history, Pemex has become one of the few fully integrated oil companies, developing our entire productive chain: exploration, production, industrial processing/refining, logistics and marketing.We carry out extensive exploration and extraction projects every year, generating approximately 2.5 million barrels of oil daily and more than 6 million of cubic feet of natural gas. We have 6 refineries, 8 petrochemical complexes and 9 gas processing complexes, where we produce multiple refined products in order to attend to our customer’s needs.Logistically, we have 83 land and maritime terminals, as well as oil and gas pipelines, maritime vessels, and varying fleets of ground transportation in order to supply over 10,000 service stations throughout the country.Our business involves a complex myriad of installations and advanced technology, yet the core of the company is its experienced and trained personnel. Pemex is its employees. We recognize the need to protect and invest in our most precious resource that is why we seek to continuously be a socially responsible company that works under stringent safety, job, health and environmental protection standards.As well, the presence of our operations in Mexico is absolute. We understand that our business plays a significant role in the lives of many communities in our country. We actively participate in protecting and contributing to the communities where we operate by making significant donations to public works, environmental protection and community building projects with the goal of improving health and welfare.We look to continuously position ourselves as a competitive oil company worldwide. Our business is fully integrated, and so is our vision for the future of our company and the future of Mexico. We recognize that our potential is intimately linked with that of our people, our industry and our country.

The resolutions approved the merger of three Pemex subsidiaries – Pemex Refinement, Pemex Gas and Basic Petrochemicals and Pemex Petrochemicals – into a single subsidiary productive enterprise called Pemex Industrial Transformation (PTI).
On April 28 2015 the incorporation resolutions of seven subsidiary productive enterprises were published in the Federal Register, including that of the PTI. The PTI incorporation resolution was set to enter into force following publication of a declaration from the Pemex board of directors in the Federal Register which confirmed the completion of all necessary legal, technical and administrative procedures for the PTI to become the universal successor in interest of all of the rights and obligations of the subsidiary entities.
The PTI incorporation resolution accordingly entered into force on November 1 2015. The PTI has thus become the universal successor in interest of all rights and obligations of Pemex's previous subsidiary entities. All contracts and legal acts entered into by the subsidiary entities before this date – as well as the property, liabilities and assets (including all rights and obligations) of these entities – are now deemed to have been transferred to the PTI.
The main purpose of the PTI will be the refinement, transformation, processing, import, export, marketing, retail, manufacture and sale of hydrocarbons, petroleum products, natural gas and petrochemicals. This includes:

the storage, transportation and distribution of these products; and
the incorporation of affiliate companies and participation in joint ventures and partnerships with private parties.

Although it is not entirely clear from the PTI incorporation resolution or that of Pemex Logistics (which became effective on October 1 2015), in principle, the PTI will retain title to all midstream and downstream infrastructure assets held by the subsidiary entities while Pemex Logistics will render logistical services to the PTI and other enterprises and Pemex joint venture companies.

Its products include petrochemicals, natural gas, liquid gas, sulphur, gasoline, kerosene and diesel. According to the company, Pemex operates 454 production fields; more than 9,000 production wells; 254 offshore platforms; six refineries; eight petrochemical complexes; over 7,000km of gas pipelines; more than 4,700km of oil pipelines; and 19 LPG distribution terminals. It also operates more than 10,400 service stations throughout the country. As a result of Mexico's energy reforms, Pemex restructured its operations and formed new subsidiaries. Four of the company's units were transformed into two productive subsidiaries: an E&P unit (formerly Pemex Exploración y Producción) and an industrial transformation unit (formerly Pemex Petroquímica, Pemex Gas y Petroquímica Básica, and Pemex Refinación). In addition, five non-core subsidiaries were also approved to cover the segments of drilling and services, logistics, cogeneration and services, and fertilizers and ethylene. The company was founded in 1938 and is based in Mexico City, Mexico.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018
