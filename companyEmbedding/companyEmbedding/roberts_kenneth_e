FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

After all, your furry friend can't tell you how he or she feels about the doctor. Even though you're not the one treated by the vet, whoever your animal sees is obviously your decision. Since many veterinary diseases and injuries can turn into emergencies very quickly, it's important to have a go-to vet. This way, you can ensure you'll know whom to see when your animal needs care.Speak to your friends and family about vets who've treated their pets. You can even talk to your groomer or an animal shelter worker for referrals. When you visit the clinics you've been referred to, check that the facility is clean, animals are separated and the staff is calm and courteous. Not all clinics are American Animal Hospital Association accredited. This accreditation isn't a legal necessity, though a clinic that's AAHA-accredited is guaranteed to offer high-quality medical care. To receive accreditation, the clinic has to meet the AAHA's standards in the areas of facility, equipment and quality care.If you're looking for a specialist, you want to make sure he or she is board-certified to practice in that specific area of animal medicine. You'll want to make sure your vet is also convenient to visit, so there are factors to take into account.Look for a vet who's close to your house, as many animals don't like being in the car for a long time. If there's an emergency, you want to make sure you can get your pet to the vet as quickly as possible. Though all veterinary clinics must be able to make arrangements to see their clients' pets outside of office hours if there's an emergency, these arrangements may not always be at the facility you're used to. Double check with the office to see where the emergency facility is.Some clinics have longer hours than others. If you work a 9-5 schedule, make sure the office is open on nights and weekends.Whether you have pet health insurance or not, it's still worth checking what the regular costs for typical procedures are at the vet's office. There isn't a set standard when it comes to price, so it's good to know that you're not looking into a clinic that's beyond your means.The type of animal you own should play a part in which vet you choose as well. While your options are vast if you have a dog or cat, you may have to visit an avian clinic for your bird or an exotics clinic for your snake.Types of VetsJust as there are many types of doctors, there are many types of vets. Some focus on livestock or house pets, while others may specialize in dentistry or surgery. They may work in a veterinary clinic or zoo, working specifically with the animals housed there, or travel to farms to work with livestock. Since horse racing and other equestrian activities are so popular, some vets are trained to work just with horses.Diseases, like malaria and yellow fever are also transmitted through animals. Some vets have insight to diseases that affect both humans and animals. Vets have contributed to the treatment and cure of many diseases that plagued both humans and their furry friends.Government agencies employ veterinarians as well. When an animal comes from a foreign land, these vets quarantine them and check for any diseases that may be present in an effort to control new diseases that can be brought into the country. Other Specific types of vets include:Private practice veterinarians: This is the most popular type of veterinarian, and many of these professionals work at clinics. They may also go to farms to care for livestock that can't be transported to the clinic.Teaching and research: These vets work at veterinary schools, training students who are planning on joining the veterinary field. They may also work in college labs conducting research pertaining to animal health.Regulatory medicine: These vets work closely with diseases rather than animals themselves. Their responsibilities include controlling or eliminating illnesses, and protecting the public from diseases in animals. They may also work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Services.Public health: These vets are also known as epidemiologists. They work for cities, counties, states or federal agencies to help control and prevent animal and human disease. Public health vets may work for the FDA to determine the safety of medicines and food additives.Uniformed services: The U.S. Army Veterinary Corps employ these vets. They're responsible for biomedical research and development.Private industry: These vets go to school solely for positions in pharmaceutical and biomedical research. They work in labs that produce chemicals, drugs and vaccines for both humans and animals.What Do Veterinary Assistants Do?A vet assistant works alongside the veterinarian and helps out around the clinic. In some cases, they may assist vets in surgery or restrain struggling animals during tests or lab work. The everyday duties of a veterinary assistant include; monitoring and caring for animals after surgery, keeping medical records, cleaning animals' teeth, feeding and bathing them, cleaning cages, sterilizing surgical equipment, giving animals medication, collecting samples for testing and performing laboratory tests, and offering grief counseling to pet owners.What to Expect at the Vet's OfficeIt's a good idea to bring your pet to the vet regularly. This way, he or she becomes familiar and comfortable with the care providers, and you can stay on top of your pet's preventative care. If the animal is small enough, bring it to the office in a carrier. Just as you visit the doctor for a yearly check up, you should bring in your pet for regular check ups as well. During a routine veterinary visit, the vet will probably begin by asking you if there have been any changes in your pet's behavior or habits. The vet will then take your pet's vitals, like weight, temperature, pulse and respiration rate, and perform a physical examination of the pet. During a physical exam, the vet checks the abdomen for swollen organs, and the legs, feet and joints for any potential problems. Depending on the age, breed or condition of your pet, your veterinarian may also check the eyes, ears and mouth.When your vet conducts a full body examination, he or she will check out your pet's coat and skin, noting any hair loss, itchy spots or lumps. Keep note of your animal's shedding habits so you can let the vet know if anything seems abnormal. The vet will check for parasites, fleas, ticks, mites and heartworms as well.  Vaccinations are also important to your pet, especially if you have a cat or a dog, and your vet will suggest that you make sure they're current. Keeping up to date with vaccinations can prevent your furry friend from getting distemper, rabies, hepatitis and lyme disease. Some vaccinations last longer than others, so speak to your doctor about staying caught up with your animal's shots. Cost and InsuranceJust like your own health insurance, you want to make sure your animal is covered before he or she needs veterinary services. Some common animal surgeries can cost thousands of dollars, and you don't want to end up having to foot a surprise bill that costs more than your paycheck. There's no set price for pet health insurance. Costs can depend on factors such as where you live, the age and breed of your pet, and how much coverage you want. Before you take out a pet insurance policy, you'll want to meet with your vet to go over what he or she thinks your animal should be covered for. Many vets believe that you should make sure cancer, chronic disease, hereditary and congenital disease, and common breed-related medical conditions are all addressed in your policy.Some pet owners can't afford insurance for their pet, so there are other options to make paying for surprise pet visits as easy as possible. Some pet stores have wellness plans - which tend to be much cheaper than an insurance policy - that offer shots, check ups, screenings and discounts on various procedures your pet may need. A lot of veterinary offices offer payment plans for pricey procedures as well, as long as you have decent credit history. For a last-ditch option, there are even privately funded organizations that offer pet owners financial aid for their pet's treatments.

The staff is nice and helpful. I don't know why people complain, they probably have attitudes with the staff or something. Well aside from the staff being nice and helpful, the doctors there are great, IF you know who to choose. I've had the same 2 doctors for years, great amazing people. And they scolded us too about feeding our pets human food. But hey you know what? They are right, human food is very bad for your pets, so if your dog/cat is dying and your too stubborn to stop spoiling it with human food well then its probably your fault its dying in the first place. They saved our 10 year old chihuahua who had failing kidneys, she is still with us thanks to them. And for those who lost pets, do not blame a vet for being terse and uncaring. They are vets, do you want them to lie and say &quot;She'll live.&quot; instead of hurting your feelings by saying &quot;She won't make it.&quot;? Honestly, losing a pet is terrible, but don't say they're &quot;uncaring&quot; just because they won't give a dozen roses and a tearful apology. I would recommend this place. And if your unsure just go and check it out. Its more of a Hispanic place so if people that complained about this place aren't Hispanic then their reviews do not surprise me. Also, my dog got Parvo when he was about a year old. If they had been the terrible uncaring, doctors people said they were, then my dog wouldn't be 5 years old and crazy today. Banfield Pet Hospitalivy76006 ratedFirst off, I had scheduled a s...First off, I had scheduled a same day appointment for Morgan, who is a collie mix,older... Not only did they schedule it for the same day, but they also squeezed in my other dog, Daphne, a Rottweiler/Lab mix. Daphne is not very social but after getting to know you will love you forever. From the moment we walked in the door the receptionist welcomed us, greeted the dogs then went to get them a water bowl. Daphne was comfortable, yet excited. As a matter of fact, other professionals came up to greet us and introduced themselves to all of us. This is one of the few times I haven't had to worry about either dog barking or becoming defensive. The staff was wonderful and worked around my schedule even in such short notice. The girls needed vaccinations and I was up against a time crunch because I was boarding the dogs and needed to take care of this anyway. They're both very spoiled indoor dogs whom I absolutely adore and love with all my heart. For the first time in years I'm going on vacation and cannot bring my babies with me. This will be the first time we've been apart for a day much less a week lol. But just wanted to thank the staff and anyone looking for a affordable yet professional clinic to take your pet I would highly recommend the folks at Banfield. I smiled the whole time I was there. Long Drive Dog & Cat Hospitalslinkiee ratedI have been taking my pets to Dr. Shelby and his staff for over 20 years.  I see some reviews that say that this clinic is uncaring but believe me, this is far from the truth.  I am so sorry that these people had a bad experience but obviously all of the facts are not told in those reviews.  The staff is BUSY since this clinic is always packed but they have always been courteous to me and those that have been in the clinic with me at the time I am there.  I have sat waiting for testing results many times and observed their customer service techniques.  They are sweet, compassionate people who see so much ugliness come off the streets.  Having to deal with people who don't realize that pets are living creatures who deserve good vet treatment. They see neglect, abuse, apathy...  They take all of this in stride and do the best they can to see that every pet is taken care of and every customer is satisfied to the best of their ability.  Dr. Shelby is THE BEST and his staff a close second.  They will not sugar coat things and yes, they tell you like it is.  People need to leave their sensitivity behind when it comes to the well being of their pets.  We need to hear the truth about our pets so that we can be better pet owners.  South Belt Animal Hospitalsarah.marie.travis ratedI LOVE South Belt Animal Hospital!I LOVE South Belt Animal Hospital. I brought 2 dogs I found on the street here to get them checked out in October last year. The staff and vet were all so friendly and explained all the test results, even letting me look through the microscope to see what was going on. I got all vaccines done and prescriptions for medications they needed. They gave all sorts of reccomendations for things I asked about. I have been back twice since then for health concerns with one of the dogs. They got me in ASAP and even sat us in the room early when I arrived earlier than my appointment. It is always in and out but I never leave with a question un answered. They are open Saturdays which works great with my work schedule and always give me a follow up call to make sure my dogs are doing ok. An added bonus is the cream cheese dipped treats they give at the beginning and end of the appointments, they know how to spoil the doggies! I work at a dental office close by and always reccomend my patients here. If you are looking for a clean, nice,  and affordable vet then this is your place! VCA Ashford Animal HospitalKaterina K. ratedSo happy I found this place!After taking my cat to other places and him not getting better after 2 and a half months I decided to try out VCA animal hospital. My cat barely ate and kept vomiting. I couldn't make him eat and he lost over 7 pounds. I was terrified for his life and felt like no one could help me. When Dr. Trlica took a look at him she automatically knew what was wrong. She said we need to do an ultrasound because she thinks that my cat ate something. She was right, there was a foreign object in his intestine. The next morning she preformed the surgery and I got to take him back in 3 days. He is eating now and gaining wait. Slowly he is recovering from everything that happened to him and I couldn't be happier to have my baby at home with me! Thanks to VCA animal hospital my cat is alive ( other people were suggesting to put him down). The staff and veterinarians here are amazing. The communication is great, Dr. T still calls to check up on my kitty to make sure he is doing well. The best vet place I had ever been too! If you love your animals you will take them here! Bellaire Richmond Pet Hospitalacovarrubias ratedI have been taking my dog here for almost a year now and they are wonderful!  The staff and the veterinarians are all friendly and compassionate.  My puppy had 2 sets of shots and needed the 3rd set, so we did not take her outside and she still got Parvo (from our shoes I am sure).  I called and spoke to Dr Kennedy and he said sure bring her on in.  She was very dehydrated and wouldn't eat or drink for 2 days.  Within 3 days of fluids, antibiotics and care my baby girl was almost back to her old self!  The staff and vets here saved her life and no amount of money could ever repay what I owe them.  Dr Kennedy is a very sweet, and understanding doctor.   Wonderful!  Doctor White is the same.  I have had my puppy in the office since then and Dr White does not insist on a bunch of unnecessary test to care for my dog.  The office waiting area and rooms are clean and bright.  They always handle my baby girl with care.  I will never take my dog anywhere else!IClay Road Animal ClinicFredrick W. ratedMy 13 year old cat had pain in his mouth and after reading all the great reviews for this company I decided to take my cat to this facility. They located a lump in his mouth and I was advised it was either feline himotitis or possible cancer. They provided a dose of steroid and a antibiotic. 36 hours later my cat had severe breathing issues due to fluid from the medication filling up his lungs and he very sadly passed away. I then called the clinic and left a voicemail to let them know to cancel the follow up appt due my cat passing away. They never called back with any condolences which I was not shocked as I am sure they knew it was the medication that killed him. I am tremendously dissapointed with all of this as I am sure you know that these animals we own are truly are family.  May you all please be cautious and ask the vets a it all possible risks when they provide medication to your animals. Sadly I learned the hard way.. Take careSouth Belt Animal HospitalMamta Y. ratedI live in Katy and our Caucasian Shepherd, which is a rare breed, got so ill.  and took him to emergency care NHVS in katy.  They gave me a huge bill but, did nothing. and he started to get very ill. and I was helpless. A friend referred me to South Belt Animal Hospital and as soon as I explained the symptoms, Dr. Boppana knew what was going on and he ran proper tests and diagnosed the problem within minutes, gave proper treatment and saved our pets life.  with so much care and love.  Today, our Hannibal (his name) is alive because of Dr. Boppana. Thank you so much. :-) I give up on all the other places. NHVS, Banfield, and few other places.  They all so very commercial and just care for money.   Even though it's an hour drive, I will only trust Dr. Boppana.   Not only quality service but, also extremely reasonable.  I really hope they open another branch in Katy. St. Francis Animal Hospital & Resortjennifer.sturch.1 ratedWhen we moved from Houston a month ago, our biggest concern was about being able to find the kind of veterinarian and boarding care for our dog that we got at St. Francis Animal Hospital. First of all, Dr. Sherry Corona is a fantastic doctor. Our dog, Bella, is aging, and Dr. Corona picked up on some major health issues that no other vet picked up. The care Dr. Corona and her staff gave extended to us, Bella's parents, as well. She would be sure to check in every now and then to make sure Bella was doing okay. Dr. Corona is the rare type of doctor who gets involved in the life of her patient. And the staff is equally as caring. The facilities are top-notch. You won't find anything like it elsewhere, I guarantee it! You will not be disappointed. Oh, one more thing - Dr. Corona will not nickle and dime you. I told you, she's rare.West Oaks Animal HospitalCarlene B. ratedThey were extremely nice and caring, and very well-educated. They examined my new, formerly stray, 7 week old kitten. They tested her for worms, any possible diseases, and helped me learn how to trim her nails. They also laid out a clear development plan for my kitten, explaining how I should expect to see her developing and what to do in each stage of her development. The plan was communicated to me extremely well, and helped me greatly as a first time young kitten owner. The veterinarian was honest and did not try to con me into paying for unnecessary products or treatments, which has happened to me with different vets in the past with different pets. The cost of the visit was very reasonable, and cheaper than other vets would have been.Did You Know?How to Find the Right Vet or Clinic for Your AnimalChoosing the right vet for your pet can be tough. After all, your furry friend can't tell you how he or she feels about the doctor. Even though you're not the one treated by the vet, whoever your animal sees is obviously your decision. Since many veterinary diseases and injuries can turn into emergencies very quickly, it's important to have a go-to vet. This way, you can ensure you'll know whom to see when your animal needs care.Speak to your friends and family about vets who've treated their pets. You can even talk to your groomer or an animal shelter worker for referrals. When you visit the clinics you've been referred to, check that the facility is clean, animals are separated and the staff is calm and courteous. Not all clinics are American Animal Hospital Association accredited. This accreditation isn't a legal necessity, though a clinic that's AAHA-accredited is guaranteed to offer high-quality medical care. To receive accreditation, the clinic has to meet the AAHA's standards in the areas of facility, equipment and quality care.If you're looking for a specialist, you want to make sure he or she is board-certified to practice in that specific area of animal medicine. You'll want to make sure your vet is also convenient to visit, so there are factors to take into account.Look for a vet who's close to your house, as many animals don't like being in the car for a long time. If there's an emergency, you want to make sure you can get your pet to the vet as quickly as possible. Though all veterinary clinics must be able to make arrangements to see their clients' pets outside of office hours if there's an emergency, these arrangements may not always be at the facility you're used to. Double check with the office to see where the emergency facility is.Some clinics have longer hours than others. If you work a 9-5 schedule, make sure the office is open on nights and weekends.Whether you have pet health insurance or not, it's still worth checking what the regular costs for typical procedures are at the vet's office. There isn't a set standard when it comes to price, so it's good to know that you're not looking into a clinic that's beyond your means.The type of animal you own should play a part in which vet you choose as well. While your options are vast if you have a dog or cat, you may have to visit an avian clinic for your bird or an exotics clinic for your snake.Types of VetsJust as there are many types of doctors, there are many types of vets. Some focus on livestock or house pets, while others may specialize in dentistry or surgery. They may work in a veterinary clinic or zoo, working specifically with the animals housed there, or travel to farms to work with livestock. Since horse racing and other equestrian activities are so popular, some vets are trained to work just with horses.Diseases, like malaria and yellow fever are also transmitted through animals. Some vets have insight to diseases that affect both humans and animals. Vets have contributed to the treatment and cure of many diseases that plagued both humans and their furry friends.Government agencies employ veterinarians as well. When an animal comes from a foreign land, these vets quarantine them and check for any diseases that may be present in an effort to control new diseases that can be brought into the country. Other Specific types of vets include:Private practice veterinarians: This is the most popular type of veterinarian, and many of these professionals work at clinics. They may also go to farms to care for livestock that can't be transported to the clinic.Teaching and research: These vets work at veterinary schools, training students who are planning on joining the veterinary field. They may also work in college labs conducting research pertaining to animal health.Regulatory medicine: These vets work closely with diseases rather than animals themselves. Their responsibilities include controlling or eliminating illnesses, and protecting the public from diseases in animals. They may also work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Services.Public health: These vets are also known as epidemiologists. They work for cities, counties, states or federal agencies to help control and prevent animal and human disease. Public health vets may work for the FDA to determine the safety of medicines and food additives.Uniformed services: The U.S. Army Veterinary Corps employ these vets. They're responsible for biomedical research and development.Private industry: These vets go to school solely for positions in pharmaceutical and biomedical research. They work in labs that produce chemicals, drugs and vaccines for both humans and animals.What Do Veterinary Assistants Do?A vet assistant works alongside the veterinarian and helps out around the clinic. In some cases, they may assist vets in surgery or restrain struggling animals during tests or lab work. The everyday duties of a veterinary assistant include; monitoring and caring for animals after surgery, keeping medical records, cleaning animals' teeth, feeding and bathing them, cleaning cages, sterilizing surgical equipment, giving animals medication, collecting samples for testing and performing laboratory tests, and offering grief counseling to pet owners.What to Expect at the Vet's OfficeIt's a good idea to bring your pet to the vet regularly. This way, he or she becomes familiar and comfortable with the care providers, and you can stay on top of your pet's preventative care. If the animal is small enough, bring it to the office in a carrier. Just as you visit the doctor for a yearly check up, you should bring in your pet for regular check ups as well. During a routine veterinary visit, the vet will probably begin by asking you if there have been any changes in your pet's behavior or habits. The vet will then take your pet's vitals, like weight, temperature, pulse and respiration rate, and perform a physical examination of the pet. During a physical exam, the vet checks the abdomen for swollen organs, and the legs, feet and joints for any potential problems. Depending on the age, breed or condition of your pet, your veterinarian may also check the eyes, ears and mouth.When your vet conducts a full body examination, he or she will check out your pet's coat and skin, noting any hair loss, itchy spots or lumps. Keep note of your animal's shedding habits so you can let the vet know if anything seems abnormal. The vet will check for parasites, fleas, ticks, mites and heartworms as well.  Vaccinations are also important to your pet, especially if you have a cat or a dog, and your vet will suggest that you make sure they're current. Keeping up to date with vaccinations can prevent your furry friend from getting distemper, rabies, hepatitis and lyme disease. Some vaccinations last longer than others, so speak to your doctor about staying caught up with your animal's shots. Cost and InsuranceJust like your own health insurance, you want to make sure your animal is covered before he or she needs veterinary services. Some common animal surgeries can cost thousands of dollars, and you don't want to end up having to foot a surprise bill that costs more than your paycheck. There's no set price for pet health insurance. Costs can depend on factors such as where you live, the age and breed of your pet, and how much coverage you want. Before you take out a pet insurance policy, you'll want to meet with your vet to go over what he or she thinks your animal should be covered for. Many vets believe that you should make sure cancer, chronic disease, hereditary and congenital disease, and common breed-related medical conditions are all addressed in your policy.Some pet owners can't afford insurance for their pet, so there are other options to make paying for surprise pet visits as easy as possible. Some pet stores have wellness plans - which tend to be much cheaper than an insurance policy - that offer shots, check ups, screenings and discounts on various procedures your pet may need. A lot of veterinary offices offer payment plans for pricey procedures as well, as long as you have decent credit history. For a last-ditch option, there are even privately funded organizations that offer pet owners financial aid for their pet's treatments.
