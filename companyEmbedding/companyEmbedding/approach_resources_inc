	We’re applying advanced technologies, including pad drilling, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, and as a result, efficiencies are increasing. Bottom line, our drill time and costs are down, while production is increasing.

	The average shale play formation is approximately 300 feet in thickness. In combination, the Wolfcamp A/B/C benches are approximately 1,000 to 1,200 feet in thickness. Our current focus is on the A, B and C benches using pad drilling and stacked wellbores.

	 

	 









	Operating Strategically and Responsibly

	We’ve approached this resource play strategically, and believe the benefits will be long-term:


		With multi-well pad drilling and stacked wellbores, we drill multiple wells from a single pad, target several zones and minimize our land use.

		We built a water infrastructure network and significantly reduced truckloads previously needed for water hauling.

		We are recycling the water we use. It’s environmentally responsible, and it’s helping us reduce our operating costs.

	Approach Resources - Strategy





























































AREX

	A solid foundation for how we work





		Strategy Overview

		Our management team has extensive experience drilling for oil and natural gas in the Permian Basin. They have established a track record that demonstrates financial discipline, innovation and exploratory success. The core strategy behind our success is listed below:







1
Develop our Wolfcamp shale oil resource play
 
We have a large, multi-year inventory of identified drilling locations that provide us the opportunity to continue increasing production and reserves at a competitive cost. Focusing on the Wolfcamp shale oil resource play allows us to use our operating, technical and regional expertise important to interpreting geological and operating trends, enhancing production rates and maximizing well recovery.


2
Operate our properties as a low-cost producer
 
We believe our concentrated acreage position in the Midland Basin enables us to capture economies of scale and operating efficiencies. Through our investment in field infrastructure systems, we have reduced drilling and completion costs, per-unit lease operating expense and our fresh water use. We also drill multiple wells from a single pad, which reduces facilities costs and surface impact. We operate 100% of our reserve base, which allows us to better manage timing and risk.


3
Acquire strategic and complementary assets
 
We continually review opportunities to acquire producing properties, undeveloped acreage and drilling prospects in our existing core area in the Permian Basin. We focus particularly on opportunities where we believe our operational efficiency, reservoir management and geological expertise in unconventional oil and gas properties will enhance value and performance. We remain focused on unconventional resource opportunities, but will also look at conventional opportunities based on individual project economics.


4
Maintain financial flexibility
 
We believe that our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with financial flexibility to pursue our strategic and financial objectives. Also we enter into commodity price swaps and collars from time-to-time to partially mitigate the risk of commodity price volatility.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
