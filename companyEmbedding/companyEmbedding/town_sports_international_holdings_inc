              Company Overview
          














New York based Town Sports International (TSI) is the largest owner and operator of fitness clubs in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and the third largest fitness club operator in the United States, in each case as measured by number of clubs. We operate under the brand names of New York Sports Clubs, Boston Sports Clubs, Washington Sports Clubs and Philadelphia Sports Clubs. In addition, we operate three clubs in Switzerland.
Our goal is to be the most recognized health club network in each of the four major metropolitan regions we serve. We believe that our strategy of clustering clubs provides significant benefits to our members and allows us to achieve strategic operating advantages. In each of our markets, we have developed clusters by initially opening or acquiring clubs located in the more central urban markets of the region and then branching out from these urban centers to suburbs and neighboring communities.
Town Sports was incorporated in 1973. Over our history, we have developed and refined club formats that allow us to cost-effectively construct and efficiently operate our fitness clubs in the different real estate environments in which we operate. Our formats are flexible enough to adapt to the difficult real estate environments in our markets.
No matter what your fitness level, our club locations offer a multitude of options for everyone, including a wide range of group exercise and fitness programs. Select clubs also offer racquet sports, pools, basketball courts and other recreational activities. Our clubs are fully equipped with strength training equipment, cardiovascular machines and other exercise equipment. Additional services such as personal training, massage, steam room and sauna, Sports Clubs for Kids and fitness assessments are also available.

NEW YORK, July 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Town Sports International Holdings Inc., ("TSI' or the "Company") (Nasdaq:   CLUB), the owner and operator of New York Sports Clubs (NYSC), announced today that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Lucille Roberts Health Clubs businesses. The Closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions. The parties expect the transaction to be closed within the next month. The acquisition will add 16 clubs to TSI's portfolio in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.








The 16 locations will continue to operate under the Lucille Roberts brand.  The newly acquired locations are all in the New York City metropolitan area — including Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Long Island and New Jersey — where TSI already has a substantial presence. The acquisition will both enhance and expand the offerings for Lucille Roberts' members. The Company also plans to retain virtually all club employees. 
"This acquisition is a prime example of TSI's targeted growth strategy," said Patrick Walsh, TSI's Chief Executive Officer. "Lucille Roberts has a loyal membership base that loves the women's only membership option. While the acquired locations will continue to operate as women's only gyms, TSI will also offer an option for Lucille Roberts' members to access all the clubs in the diverse TSI portfolio. This acquisition will allow those members to utilize the broad array of fitness options and convenient workout locations that are synonymous with New York Sports Clubs." 
"For more than 4 decades, Lucille Roberts has been providing women with an affordable first-rate fitness experience in a comfortable environment that they can call their own," said Lucille Roberts co-founder, Bob Roberts. "TSI's industry knowledge and strategic expertise make them the ideal company to preserve and foster the Lucille Roberts vision." 
About Town Sports International Holdings, Inc.:Town Sports International Holdings, Inc. is one of the leading owners and operators of fitness clubs in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and, through its subsidiaries, operated 149 fitness clubs as of March 31, 2017, comprising 101 New York Sports Clubs, 28 Boston Sports Clubs, 12 Washington Sports Clubs (one of which is partly-owned), five Philadelphia Sports Clubs, and three clubs located in Switzerland. These clubs collectively served approximately 551,000 members as of March 31, 2017.
