Starrett Tools in Athol, Massachusetts


L. S. Starrett Company (NYSE: SCX) is an American manufacturer of tools and instruments used by machinists and tool and die makers. The company was founded when businessman and inventor Laroy Sunderland Starrett (1836–1922) bought the Athol Machine Company in 1905. The company patented such items as the sliding combination square, bench vises, and a shoe hook fastener. They make precision steel rules and tapes, calipers, micrometers, and dial indicators, among many other things.
Starrett employs about 2,000 people worldwide and the company claims to be the last remaining full-line precision tool company to be manufacturing their products within the United States.[1] However, much of the firm's manufacturing takes place at facilities in the People's Republic of China, Brazil, Germany, and the UK, with 28% of Starrett's worldwide sales being in Brazil in 2013.[2][3]

History[edit]
The history of Starrett has been one of continuous expansion through the patenting of products and takeovers of other manufacturers. In 1878 Laroy S. Starrett invented and patented the first combination square,[4] and in 1880 he founded the L.S. Starrett Company in Athol, MA in order to produce it and other precision tools. In 1882, Starrett traveled to London and Paris to appoint sales representatives, thereby starting up the international marketing of his products.[citation needed] In 1887, Starrett acquired further patents.[citation needed]
In 1890, L.S. Starrett patented a micrometer with other improvements, transforming the rough version of this tool into a modern micrometer.[5] During the same year Starrett began making and refining saw blades, and continues to be a major manufacturer as of 2015.[citation needed] In 1895 Starrett patented the divider with trammel.[6] In 1920, the company added its first gage to the product line and quickly became the world’s largest innovator and maker of precision calibrators.
Between 1941 and 1945, Starrett increased its production by 800%[citation needed] and won the Army- Navy “E” Award.[citation needed] At the same time, more than 400 employees went into the US armed forces. The post-war period was a time of overseas expansion, with Starrett opening a factory in São Paulo, Brazil, in 1956. In the early 1960s, the Brazilian factory was moved to a new location in the city of Itu, 100 km from São Paulo.
In 1958, a plant was opened in Scotland and this plant currently makes products for the European and Asian markets. In 1962, Starrett acquired the Webber Gage Company, adding gage blocks to the Starrett product line.[7] In 1970, Starrett took over the Herman Stone Co., a granite product maker, and in 1985 it relocated production to a new plant in Mount Airy, NC. This plant also makes saws and measuring equipment.
In 1986, Starrett took over the Evans Rule Company, the world's largest tape measure manufacturer, and in 1990 the company bought Sigma Optical, a British manufacturer of optical profile projectors. In 1998, Starrett expanded into China, opening a new plant in Suzhou.[8]
In 2002, a former Starrett subcontractor alerted US Defense Department investigators to an alleged fraud issue with a Starrett RapidCheck Coordinate Measuring Machine that Starrett had to replace free-of-charge to customers because of a fault. Federal agents raided Starrett's North Carolina plant[9] looking for evidence of fraud. The federal investigation was terminated in December 2003 with no charges filed.[10] In 2005, Starrett stopped manufacturing Coordinate Measuring Machines when it sold the CMM product division to the company Sheffield Measurement.[11]
In 2006, L.S. Starrett Co. purchased Tru-Stone Technologies Inc. in Waite Park, Minn., a Minnesota maker of custom-engineered granite machine bases, for $19.8 million in cash.[12]
Currently[edit]
The current President and CEO of the company is Douglas A Starrett.

Big Business: Doug Starrett






by Christina Davis

Douglas A. Starrett, president and CEO of L.S. Starrett Co. of Athol, holds one of the companys electronic micrometers.To Lead With PrecisionDouglas A. Starrett carries on a family traditionClick here to view timeline  Douglas A. Starrett may run a large global business representing more than $220 million in annual sales, but his management style and demeanor is more akin to a manager of a small 20-person office.As he walks the snaking halls of L.S. Starrett Co.'s monstrous 555,000-square-foot headquarters in Athol, he greets employees by name. Many employees - some who've worked at the company producing precision measuring tools for more than 30 years - stop to chat, and to gently chide the boss about his recent decision to shave off his beard. His annual letter to employees and retirees contains as much in the way of business updates as it does down-to-earth charm - including the score from the Thanksgiving Day Athol football game.He's equally at home setting up operations in some far-flung location halfway around the globe as he is approving name tags for a semi-annual employee meeting."We've got a big breadth and scope, but I like to think we operate as a small business," Doug Starrett said.TraditionL.S. Starrett got its start when its founder, Laroy S. Starrett, first produced the now ubiquitous tool known as the combination square in 1877. Today, the company makes in excess of 5,000 items, including everything from tape measures to saw blades to electronic micrometers. Starrett is the fourth member of his family to run the company. He took the helm from his father, Douglas R. Starrett, in 2001."Doug is following in his fathers footsteps," said Richard Kennedy, a member of L.S. Starrett's board of directors and president and CEO of the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce. "He's a fine executive, and really a good friend."Kennedy described Doug Starrett as a "hands-on executive" who learned the business from the ground up. "He knows every aspect of the business."As a teenager, Doug Starrett worked as an "errand boy" in the company's micrometer department. After graduating from Miami University of Ohio with a degree in business administration, he worked in the construction industry in Boston. But he returned to the company in 1976, and more than 30 years later, is still walking the halls of the company's Athol plant between trips to the company's overseas operations. While the company bears his namesake, as a publicly traded firm, Starrett has no birthright to run the company. Instead, he has served for the last six years "at the wishes of the board."Soon after Doug Starrett was named president and CEO in 2001, his father died unexpectedly of a stroke. At almost the same time, the nation spun into a recession in the wake of the terrorist attacks on 9/11."Doug had to take over at a time when the market was changing dramatically, and he responded very effectively," Kennedy said.New AvenuesKennedy said the old way of doing business at L.S. Starrett had been to rely largely on brand loyalty, which meant customers felt okay about paying more for a Starrett product because they knew the product would be of high quality. But over the last several years, pricing pressures have meant L.S. Starrett has to be more creative in the way it markets its products and how it produces them. In some cases that's meant moving production to lower costs, or outsourcing some work. For example, L.S. Starrett had been doing its injection molding in house for some of its products, but it recently began outsourcing plastic work to a company in the Dominican Republic, near the company's plant there.Kennedy also said Doug Starrett has recognized new opportunities in the marketplace, like new channels of distribution that are now available.For fiscal year 2007, which ended June 30, L.S. Starrett reported net sales of more than $222 million, an 11 percent increase over the previous year. The company was also profitable this year, reporting nearly $6.7 million in net earnings. That's welcome news after several tough years between 2001 and 2004.Doug Starrett demurs any credit for the company's success both globally and in Athol, instead crediting "the legions of people that have worked here over the past 128 years."L.S. Starrett has been a global concern since the 1950s when it established operations in Brazil and Scotland. In 1997, the company, with Doug Starrett's help, established both distribution and manufacturing in China. But now, Doug Starrett has his eyes on the Middle East. After recently returning from the oil-rich Middle Eastern nation of Dubai, which is undergoing an astounding amount of growth, the company is poised to benefit from the increase in construction there.Competitive PressuresStarrett isn't shy about his opinions on the difficulties facing American-based manufacturers like L.S. Starrett. He's plainly critical when it comes to Sarbanes-Oxley, the strict accounting rules put into place in the earlier part of the decade in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom scandals. "There's not a customer out there willing to pay a dime more because we're Sarbanes-Oxley compliant," he said.He's equally critical of the mounting costs facing businesses in Massachusetts, including unemployment insurance.While the company's local employment is markedly less then its peak in the 60s and 70s - it hovers today around 650, down from a high of 1,500 - the company is still committed to its home base, despite cost pressures. The company recently invested about $1 million in a new etching facility at its headquarters that will help with efficiency and cut down on hazardous waste. And in a small corner of the building, the company is even creating software and assembling circuit boards for the company's line of digital measuring equipment. In addition, the company is installing a hydroelectric generator in the Millers River that runs by its plant. The cost of that project is deferred by a $538,000 grant from the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative and is expected to be operational in 2009.Despite the drop in employment over the last three decades, L.S. Starrett is still the number one employer in the town of Athol, and the company - and Doug Starrett - plays a central role there."Starrett is Athol and Athol is Starrett," Kennedy said. Even the town's YMCA is intertwined with the company - it's located at the site of the shop where L.S. Starrett tools were first produced.But Doug Starrett has also carried on his family's tradition of community involvement. Most recently, Starrett played a key role in developing a strategic plan for the local public school system, according to David Ames, Athol's town manager."Doug took it upon himself to take a leadership role and worked closely with a lot of the members of the [school] committee," Ames said. "Because of that, everything went very smoothly."Doug Starrett and the company "have done a lot for the schools" and for the town, Ames said. "When he feels it's a good cause he's definitely willing to donate," Ames added.Doug Starrett has also led the company in several acquisitions, the most recent of which was a deal to buy a 10-person California firm called Kinemetric Engineering, which will help bolster L.S. Starrett's "camera-based inspection line," which is a far cry from the more traditional precision measuring instruments that the company is most well-know for.But as Doug Starrett puts it, "We're not in the tool business, we are in the business of providing measuring solutions." And in the 21st Century, that means producing electronic tags that transmit measurements from shop floors to centralized computers as well as calipers and gages.While the variety of products offered by L.S. Starrett has expanded dramatically since the company's founding, one thing has remained consistent, according to Kennedy."They have a very, very excellent reputation and great brand awareness that they've built up through a following that's worldwide," he said. "That's really a credit to the Starrett family, and Doug who's carried that on."

Hexagon Metrology North America’s division, Sheffield Measurement Inc., recently acquired L.S. Starrett Co.’s coordinate measuring machine product division. The acquisition is limited to Starrett’s CMM product line only. No other products are included in the arrangement. Sheffield Measurement will assume customer service and support, and spare parts sales for all Starrett machines currently in use. It will also gain all of Starrett’s CMM designs, and new and used machine inventory.  “Primarily this acquisition is about the service opportunity,” says Bill Gruber, CEO of Hexagon Metrology North America. “Starrett wanted to ensure the customers would have someone to go to for factory parts and service, and Sheffield will supply these services by combining their team with Starrett’s existing CMM-focused employees located in Mt. Airy. We don’t play on continuing manufacture of these machines beyond the remaining inventory of new and used machines that we acquired in the deal. However, we’ll continue to make spares available, and of course, service.”Hexagon Metrology will offer owners of Starrett CMMs a transfer package to Hexagon’s standardized software, PC-DMIS. Additionally, during a transitional period, Hexagon will offer Starrett CMM customers a bundled package consisting of a license, installation, training and a service agreement as a reduced price. “In exploring our options for the coordinate measuring machine business, our focus has been on finding the best way to continue to support our existing CMM customers with the level of service and support they have come to expect from Starrett,” says Douglas A. Starrett, president and CEO of the L.S. Starrett Co. “The acquisition of the coordinate measuring machine line from Hexagon Metrology North America will provide our customers with an excellent support and upgrade path now and in the future.”Hexagon Metrology North America is a subsidiary of Hexagon AG, a worldwide company with dealings in engineering, manufacturing and automation. The L.S. Starrett Co. is a precision-tool designer and manufacturer.For more information, visit www.sheffieldmeasurement.com.

					I sent an email to Starrett exposing my disdain with Chinese made tools .  Here is his reply:

Your email just made it to my desk and I wanted to respond to you on this subject.  

I thoroughly enjoyed reading your letter and I mean that in all sincerity.  I certainly share your sentiments, but, unfortunately, people like you and me are fewer and farther between than ever before.  

There is no one in our industry that is a stronger believer than the Starrett Company on the importance of keeping a manufacturing base in the USA.  We have been fortunate to successfully compete against foreign manufacturers of precision instruments, and to this day still 98% of what we make is made here in the USA.

The reality of the situation is we have seen a steady erosion of our precision tool business over the past three years.  Fewer people in the industry are willing to pay a premium price for American Made, top-quality measuring tools from Starrett and I�m not going to sit here and watch the Company bleed a slow death as the manufacturing base in the US slowly erodes.  

In 1997 we opened a small factory in China to expand our presence in China, and to protect our brand from predatory pricing from China.  As my granddad used to say, �There�s nothing like giving your competitors a little heartburn in their own backyard.�

The Starrett Exact� line of imported precision measuring tools (including dial calipers) are being introduced to the US market to give the end user a choice of high-quality tools from Starrett, made to our standards and backed by our service and support.  The customer still has the choice of purchasing an American Made product if they chose to do so.  This line of tools is a very limited offering at the present time and no one is more concerned than I am about the long-term ramifications of this move.  We are not willing to throw out our reputation of high-quality, made-in-the-USA products.

Now if you can educate me on how we can convert more end users to American Made products with the same enthusiasm as you have, then I�m all ears.  We are always looking for good salesmen who can sell the advantage and the merits of American Made products at premium prices.  Maybe you ought to consider being on the sales side of the equation.  

Douglas A. Starrett

					Quite a rah-rah go USA response.

The fact of the matter is that they are trying to boost profits by making the product in China and selling them here.

A company has to take the direction they feel will ensure their survival and profitability.

It's a good thing that I have freedom of choice as to who I buy my products from.

					Starrett must be getting quite a few letters, the exact same letter was cited in the "Brown & Sharpe is Crap" topic in posting by ztarum on 6-3-03.

					Metaldoctor;

I commend you on your initiative contacting Starrett.   It is easy and we all sit around and grip but only a few of us take the conversation to the right people that should be listening to our (your) feelings.

What I find interesting, the guy at Starrett had the same song and dance as the company president where I work. 

 Jim

					He should have written:
"we have decided to open a factory in China in order to take advantage of the free Slave/Prison labor pool. However, our quality will remain high."

					The USA made wire nuts will be available for a long time.   Forever I hope but go ahead and stock up anyway.   I'm just concerned  over the trend.   We build our own automated equipment and that is what I do.   But, the labor in China is so cheap, they don't need to invest in automated equipment.

I have the October fest poster in my office, isn't that girl "HOT".   By the way, her boobs aren't real.

					Jim:  One of the problems is that they ARE investing in high end CNC equipment.  It will slowly shift their costs to produce but their quality will also continue to climb, as we are seeing on many products.

Those American companies that want to survive should examine those that are already doing so and see what the magic formula is (more efficient production, lower margins, fewer houses on the beach).

					I all ways admire someone {Mr Starrett} who has the balls to answer questions head on honestly with out getting some pr a-h in the middle. Example:  I sent a email to Panasonic last week telling them that one of there phone systems is not compatable with my hearing aids and asked how to remedy that, since it makes it hard to hear anyone over the loud buzz it makes. They responded with a bunch of legal-ez! WHat? last Panosono product I buy!

					surplusjohn:  I had one great experience with Panasonic.  Their AA alkaline batteries had leaked inside an HP thermal printer that went with a scientific calculator.  They cut me a check for $135 to replace it without even a wimper.

E-mail responses are a mixed bag. I've had replies from many companies regarding various technical and other questions that range from useless to absolutely suck    And then they have the audacity to ask "how did we do on this response?" quality assurance BS.

					I think Starrett has Sales Issues.

If I was Head Honcho @ Starrett, I would get drunk with the guys who did Harley Davidson's sales turnaround.

I love motorcycles, but I know I would kill myself on one - I am not a biker.

But I have a great admiration for the way Harley played their Strong Suit  in their advertizing camapaigns.

"An American Legend"  and so it is. We all have brothers or cousins who rode Harleys even if we didn't.

For many of older guys, Motorcycle meant Harley Davidson (or Indian).

So, too wth Starrett (and Brown and Sharpe).

Any of us who take pride in being a machinist or in doing machine work will gladly pay the ilttle bit more for a Starrett.

Where is Starrett's Presence??

You see Harley's logo everywhere.

Where are the Starrtt Coffee cups, the Decimal equivalent charts, the note pads around the shop, the calendars? How about stickers for the window of your vehicle?  And Starrett "T" shirts? (with pockets, Don)

"World's Greatest Toolmakers" should be visible everywhere around any shop where metal is cut and neasured.

I have "The Starrett Book for Student Machinists" in the handbook drawer of my tool chest. (1945 edition)

If they aren't publishing the revised edition, then they should.

Starrett, Brown and Share and Lufkin had their tool board displays in glass cases hanging at all their distributors' shops and in the class rooms of the trade schools.

I don't see them any more - why??

Sales, Sales, Sales!

Starrett not only has to Make the world's greatest tools, they have to SELL the world's greatest tools.

They won't do that by keeping their light under a bushel.

They have one BIG advantage - MEN buy tools.

Harley appeals to men. They are expensive bikes, but they Sell!

Weatherby makes rifles that appeal to men. They are not Wal Mart Specials, but they sell well

Automakers sell Pick 'em Ups to men.
Pick ups are selling better than cars these days.

Starrett's ad campaign should be a No Brainer.

I wouldn't be caught dead making a fine measurement without a Starrett or older Brown and Sharpe tool, It's a man thing, it's  reputation thing.

We are right back to where we always get, If Starrett has problems, the problems aren't with Starrett's foreign competition, the problems are with Starrett.

					Damn Jim,

You have hit that freaking nail right on the head, AGAIN!!! Maybe we should all start bugging Starrett for stickers for our trucks and the wall charts and coffee mugs. I don't know of ANY machinists working in industry or hobbiest machinists (who know what they're doing) who wouldn't buy Starrett.

I'm going to send an email to Starrett this am.

					jim glass:

i figured they werent real, but the meters sure are nice hehe. 

jim k:

way to go. i hadnt thought about it, but you are absolutly right. ive never once seen a guy walkin around with a starrett shirt (or any other machining shirt). if they really want to sell, they need to get their name all over the place. not just machinists use their tools, mecahnics and other small shops have a need for precision measurement.

how about a short run of tv commercials?  you always see those financial companies running ads, they dont even deal with the public! i think starrett needs to wake up a little

everyone:

and on that note, why dont we forward this thread to starrett too, and have them participate. back when i was on moparts we had a mopar representitive there, the response of corperate criticism was over 10 pages. starrett can learn a lot from the collective wisdom and experience here..

					Andy:

Dammit, Doctor, I'm a Jim! 

Merritt:

Good Idea, send this whole shebang up to Starrett, might have to get Don to help.

Maybe the Massachusetts winters are giving our favorite tool makers a brain freeze.

					Jim - All those thing you compared Starrett to are consumer goods. Starrett makes and sells tools for people in industry. Unlike SUV Harley's and guns nobody is going to be impressed by your box of Starrett tools.    
      In this country people buy everything by price. Half the posts on this board are people looking to buy something for nothing As an example a couple of days ago on this board somebody posted that they wanted to make an acme nut but didn't want to spend $60.00 or whatever it cost for a tap so somebody else pointed out that you can get one from ENCO for $12.00 Well guess what that $12.00 tap is made in guess where CHINA.

					SIP, while you are somewhat correct in pointing out the difference between an HD or Hummer type consumer versus an industrial consumer, the industrial folks are sometimes swayed by "gurella" marketing tactics, such as wall charts, mugs and shirts also.  

I think they need to pull a "Cadillac" and become "cool" as well.  Starrett seems a bit "stodgy" to many purchasing managers I suspect, who lean toward the "cool" tools from the likes of Mitutoyo. 

But it has to have substance behind it.  The Cadillac line was recently found to be the most dependable auto last year of all autos.  (Longer term is what really matters though...Lexus was most dependable for 3 year period, but maybe the new Caddies will hold up...too soon to tell)

Perhaps some Led Zepplin tunes while a Starret height gage zooms across the surface plate...?

					Here's a thought.
Every Saturday I see an add for Stanley tools that is tied to Chevrolet on the program "This Old House".
If Starret would make a deal with Harley for the plants to use their tools and advertise it, every biker and wannabe would feel a yearning to have Starret before even any other US made tool. Forget China.
My own personal grudge against Starrett is my own personal experience with their disservice department. They would have to improve that part of their business too.
It could be done.
My two cents - minted in US.

					Regarding Starret Company.....it's interesting that the company is still run by a direct descendent, the grandson.

Now I'm beginning to wonder if the company is being run efficiently.  It's very unusual for follow-on generations to maintain and run a company the way the founder did.

					I emailed Starrett and ticked the reply button. I mentioned this board and hope they actually look at it. I'll post their reply when I get it.

			Since 2001, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company; prior to 2001, President of the Company. Mr. Starrett started his career with the Company in 1976 as an apprentice toolmaker and has been promoted to positions of increasing responsibility in engineering, operations and management. We believe Mr. Starrett's broad exposure to both domestic and international operations and markets provides an in-depth understanding of our business and its culture and qualifies him to serve on the Board.

To make the most of this space, it's helpful to have supplies that make it easy to work in the garage and have plenty of room while you're working on projects. Because we have low prices, every day, on everything, we can help you achieve this for much less than you may think.garage door openersFor easy access to your garage, install a garage door opener. It makes it easy to get into or out of your garage without getting out of your vehicle thanks to an included remote control. You can also go out the garage door from the house with just the touch of a button. These openers are powered by a belt drive and an engine that ranges from 1/2 to 1 horsepower. Most garage door openers have two remotes and allow access via a wireless keypad system. Work benchesBecause you may be working on various projects in your garage, you might want to invest in a workbench too. Many of these workbenches have wood tops with either drawers or open storage space underneath to conveniently house your most used tools. Some workbenches double as sawhorses that have vises attached and allow you to work on projects without holding down the items with your hands. Some workbenches have high backs so you can attach pegboard to hang small tools and other items from it.Garage cabinets and storageIf you need additional storage for items that you want to keep behind closed doors, consider either freestanding cabinets or wall-mounted cabinets. These cabinets can have as many as six shelves and feature one or two sections. Some of the freestanding units have casters on the bottom and allow you to move them about freely. Some units have both drawer and cabinet space if you need to store small tools and larger tools or other items at the same time. The heights on these units range from less than 20 inches to as much as 100 inches or more. The widths range from around 5 inches to more than 45 inches. This variety lets you choose what's best for your needs.Garage shelvingIf enclosed storage isn't what you want, there are several varieties of open shelving units from which you can choose. Most of these feature two to five shelves, with some having a back. Most units stand in one place, but some have casters and allow you to roll them wherever you need them to go. Most are metal with metal shelves or metal with wood composite shelves. Some are plastic for lighter weight or steel for strength, and all shelving comes unassembled.Tool storageSince this is a garage, it's likely that you have several tools lying around. The best way to keep track of your tools is with a tool box to tool chest or by placing them on a pegboard on a wall of the garage. Tool boxes, for the most part, are portable and allow you to carry your essential tools and related items (think nails, screws and other fasteners) to a job site or whenever you might need quick access to them. Tool boxes usually have a top that opens and two or three drawers that slide out. The top is secured with clasps that flip closed. There are also tool bags that work like a tool box but look like a duffel bag. For added portability, we have some tool boxes that resemble luggage and even have wheels that allow you to pull or push them along.For working at home or long term on a job site, a tool chest is more suitable. These have much more space and allow you to store many more tools. These tool boxes have a top that opens, have anywhere from two to eight drawers and sometimes have open storage space on the bottom, ideal for power tools. Although some of these chests are stationary, most of them have casters and allow you to have access to them wherever you're working. Many of these chests are metal, but some are rigid plastic or aluminum too. Red and black are common colors, but there are other colors available, including some that are two-tone. Another feature of tool chests is that they're more secure because you can lock them with a key.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147384878, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-
