O.J. Simpson has provided the blueprint on how to get out of prison early when facing a long sentence. It’s really simple: Keep your nose clean. Considering all the controversy the Juice got himself into prior to his 2008 conviction for strong-armed robbery, that was no easy task. The Hall...

We had to go back to get the equipment, and they gave us nonfunctional equipment. When contacted again, the rep hung up on us. Granted we were upset on the phone, customer service reps should never just simply hang up on a paying customer. We had the reservation for nearly a month before the move date, and they simply failed to provide what we asked for. The experience was very poor, and cost us 2-3 hours of our moving time. My wife and I had to move two apartments that day, and having a dolly was not optional. Since we spent that time finding equipment elsewhere, we had to keep the truck another day and added mileage to our bill since we had to drive around to find a functional dolly. I would not recommend using Aggie Liquidators in the future.

    Firm Profile
     


The relationship between accountant and client isn’t based on money.  It’s based on trust.  There’s an invaluable connection from “Who do you trust with your finances” to Who do you trust with your future? or Who do you trust with your family?
Your trust is not an investment we take for granted at Ingram, Wallis & Company, P.C.  Each day we set out to provide clients a return on the trust they invest in us with insight, counsel, guidance, accuracy, innovative services, and an ever-evolving portfolio of products.
As a leading firm in the region with over 40 years of experience, Ingram, Wallis & Company, P.C. understands that every client’s needs are different.  We center our work on your schedule, your situation and most importantly, on earning your trust.
The firm was founded by James D. Ingram, III.  Prior to forming Ingram, Wallis & Company in 1979, Jim was an accounting instructor at Texas A&M University and a partner in another accounting firm.  His leadership has been recognized locally where he has served as President of the Bryan College Station Chamber of Commerce as well as professionally where he has served as Chairman of the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy and recipient of the highest honor given by The Texas Society of Certified Public Accountants for meritorious service to the state’s accounting profession in 2004. Jim retired from the practice in September 2014. 
Tom Wallis is a founding shareholder of Ingram, Wallis & Company, P.C.  Tom has extensive experience working with governmental units and privately-held enterprises.  In addition, his expertise includes estates, gifts, and trusts.
Prior to founding Ingram, Wallis & Company, P.C., Tom was employed by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. (now KPMG) and Durst, Wood & Ingram through 1979.
