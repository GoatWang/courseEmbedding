	Notes to the Financial Statements




	(Unaudited)



	 



	NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION, OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF ACCOUNTING



	 


	TRON Group Inc. (“the Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 20, 2015, as Plush Corp., and it is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. On November 3, 2016, a majority of stockholders of our company and our board of directors approved a change of name of our company from Plush Corp. to TRON Group Inc. We are a holding company and have no principal business. We are currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for the merger with or acquisition of a target business. To date, the company’s activities have been limited to raising capital, organizational matters, launching the website and the structuring of its business plan. The company has not generated any revenues since inception.


	 


	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the company’s management, the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2017 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on April 17, 2017.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of March 31, 2017, the company has not generated any revenues from operations and has a stockholders’ deficit of $19,687. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the company’s ability to begin operations and to achieve a level of profitability. The company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The financial statements of the company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 


	This summary of significant accounting policies of the Company is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.


	 



	Use of estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. The Company provided a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset.


	 


	The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% to the net loss before provision for income taxes for the following reasons:

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.


	 


	Our unaudited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report.


	 


	In this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to “common shares” refer to the common shares in our capital stock.


	 


	As used in this quarterly report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “our company” mean TRON Group Inc., unless otherwise indicated.


	 



	General Overview



	 


	We were incorporated under the name Plush Corporation on October 20, 2015 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our business consisted of designing, marketing and selling luxury accessories for men online. Management has decided not to pursue this line of products, and has discontinued operations involving luxury accessories.


	 


	November 3, 2016, a majority of stockholders of our company and our board of directors approved a change of name of our company from Plush Corp. to TRON Group Inc., an increase to authorized capital from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 and a forward stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of one (1) old share for twenty (20) new shares of common stock.


	 


	A Certificate of Amendment increasing our authorized capital and changing the name of our company was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State with an effective date of December 6, 2016.


	 


	The name change and forward stock split became effective with the OTC Markets at the opening of trading on December 28, 2016, and our trading symbol was changed to "TGRP". Our new CUSIP number is 897012 100.


	 


	Our principal executive offices are located at K-2-8 2nd Floor, Kuchai Business Park Jalan 1/127 off Jalan Kuchai Lama, Kuala Lumpur 58200. Our telephone number is +603 7987 8688.


	 


	We are a holding company and have no principal business. We are currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for the merger with or acquisition of a target business. In certain instances, a target business may wish to become our subsidiary or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge. We have not yet begun negotiations or entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any negotiations or definitive agreements.

	Any new acquisition or business opportunities that we may acquire will require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation. If our Company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds, our business may fail.


	 


	We have never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding.


	 


	We do not have any subsidiaries.


	 



	Results of Operations



	 


	We have not earned any revenues from our inception on October 20, 2015 through March 31, 2017.

	As at March 31, 2017, our Company had total liabilities of $20,937, compared with total liabilities of $11,597 as at December 31, 2016.


	 


	As at March 31, 2017, our Company had working capital deficiency of $19,687 compared with working capital deficiency of $6,597 as at December 31, 2016. The decrease in working capital was primarily attributed to an increase in liabilities. As at March 31, 2017, accounts payable and due to a related party increased by $4,539 and $4,801, respectively, from December 31, 2016.


	 



	Cash Flow from Operating Activities



	 


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, our Company used $4,801 in cash from operating activities, compared to $7,442 cash used in operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The cash used from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was attributed to a loss of $13,090 and reduced a change in prepaid expenses of $3,750 and an increase in accounts payable of $4,539.


	 



	Cash Flow from Investing Activities



	 


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, our Company did not have any investing activities.


	 



	Cash Flow from Financing Activities



	 


	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, our Company received $4,801 from financing activities compared to $8,839 received from financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The cash flow for financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was a result of proceeds from a related party for payment of operating expenses. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we received $5,000 from the issuance of our common shares, $2,474 from a former officer for payment of operating expenses, and $1,365 for a stock subscription receivable.


	 


	The report of our auditors on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, contains a going concern qualification as we have suffered losses since our inception. We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing.




	 



	Plan of Operation and Funding



	 


	We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.

	Table of Contents






	 


	Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our officers directors, although no future arrangement for additional loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our officers and directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing.




	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, and capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 



	Use of estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2017, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 

	Securities Exchange Act of 1934

	, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of March 31, 2017 that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") reports: (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

	Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and














	 





	·





	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.





	 


	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.


	 


	Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

	Internal Control – Integrated Framework – 2013 (COSO 2013 Framework)

	and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.


	 


	Based upon such evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017, based on the COSO framework criteria, as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.


	 


	The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of majority of independent members; (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives affecting authorization, recordkeeping, custody of assets, and reconciliations; (4) ineffective controls over year-end financial disclosure and reporting processes; and (5) management dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of March 31, 2017.


	 


	Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	 


	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled “Risk Factors” that may cause our or our industry’s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.


	 


	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.


	 


	Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.


	 


	In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to “common shares” refer to the common shares in our capital stock.


	 


	As used in this current report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms “we”, “us” and “our” mean TRON Group Inc., unless otherwise indicated.


	 



	General Overview



	 


	We were incorporated under the name Plush Corporation on October 20, 2015 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our business consisted of designing, marketing and selling luxury accessories for men online. Management has decided not to pursue this line of products, and has discontinued operations involving luxury accessories.


	 


	November 3, 2016, a majority of stockholders of our company and our board of directors approved a change of name of our company from Plush Corp. to TRON Group Inc., an increase to authorized capital from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 and a forward stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a basis of one (1) old share for twenty (20) new shares of common stock.


	 


	A Certificate of Amendment increasing our authorized capital and changing the name of our company was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State with an effective date of December 6, 2016.


	 


	The name change and forward stock split became effective with the OTC Markets at the opening of trading on December 28, 2016 and our trading symbol was changed to "TGRP". Our new CUSIP number is 897012 100.


	 


	Our principal executive offices are located at K-2-8 2nd Floor, Kuchai Business Park Jalan 1/127 off Jalan Kuchai Lama, Kuala Lumpur 58200. Our telephone number is +603 7987 8688.


	 


	We have never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding.

	Our Current Business



	 


	Tron Group Inc., is a holding company and has no principal business. We are currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for the merger with or acquisition of a target business. In certain instances, a target business may wish to become our subsidiary or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge. We have not yet begun negotiations or entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any definitive agreements.


	 


	Any new acquisition or business opportunities that we may acquire will require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation. If our company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds, our business may fail.


	 


	Management of our company believes that there are benefits to being a reporting company with a class of securities quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, such as: (i) the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; (ii) increased visibility in the financial community; (iii) the facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions; (iv) potentially improved trading efficiency; (v) potential stockholder liquidity; (vi) potentially greater ease in raising capital subsequent to an acquisition; (vii) potential compensation of key employees through stock options; (viii) potentially enhanced corporate image; and (ix) a presence in the United States capital market.


	 


	We may seek a business opportunity with entities who have recently commenced operations, or entities who wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand business development activities, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.


	 


	In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is likely that our present management will no longer be in control of our company. In addition, it is likely that our officers and directors will, as part of the terms of the acquisition transaction, resign and be replaced by one or more new officers and directors.


	 


	As of the date hereof, we have not entered into any formal written agreements for a business combination or opportunity. When any such agreement is reached, we intend to disclose such an agreement by filing a current report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	 


	We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success. We believe that there are numerous firms in various industries seeking the perceived benefits of being a publicly registered corporation. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our company may be scarce or we may be unable to obtain the ones that we want. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities.


	 


	Currently, we do not have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. Historically, we have been able to raise a limited amount of capital through private placements of our equity stock, but we are uncertain about our continued ability to raise funds privately. Further, we believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital until we locate a prospective property through which we can pursue our plan of operation. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail.

	Results of Operations



	 


	Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.


	 


	The following comparative analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative audited consolidated financial statements, footnotes and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report.

	We had cash and cash equivalents of $0 as of December 31, 2016 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $3,605 as of December 31, 2015. We had working capital deficit of $6,597 as of December 31, 2016 compared to a working capital deficit of $1,006 as of December 31, 2015. The increase in working capital deficit was primarily due to an increase in due to related parties of $8,775.

	Operating Activities



	 


	Cash flows used in operating activities increased $ 56,166 to $57,307 during the fiscal year 2016, mainly due to an increase in net loss.


	 



	Financing Activities



	 


	Cash flows provided by financing activities increased $48,956 to $53,702 during the fiscal year 2016, mainly due to an increase in contribution from shareholder and proceed from related parties.


	 


	The report of our auditors on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, contains a going concern qualification as we have suffered losses since our inception. We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing.


	 



	Plan of Operation and Funding



	 


	We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.


	 


	Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavours or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our officers directors, although no future arrangement for additional loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our officers and directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing.

	Going Concern



	 


	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain sufficient debt or equity financing to fund our operating expenses. This is because we have no material assets, operations or a source of revenue sufficient to cover our operations.


	 


	The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining financing or acquiring a new business and achieving a break even or profitable level of operations in that new business. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. It is not probable we would be able to obtaining traditional loans from financial institutions because we have no business operations, no assets and no revenues.


	 


	There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing through private placements, bank financing or other loans necessary to support our working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, we will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to us.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, and capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 



	Use of estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	  



	Contractual Obligations



	 


	As a “smaller reporting company”, we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	  


	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of


	Tron Group Inc.


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tron Group Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the period from inception (October 20, 2015) to December 31, 2015.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.   Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tron Group Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for period from inception (October 20, 2015) to December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the company had a net loss of $50,518. As of December 31, 2016, the company has not generated any revenues from operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regards to these matters are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

	TRON Group Inc.




	(Formerly Plush Corporation)







	Notes to the Audited Financial Statements





	December 31, 2016 and 2015



	 



	Note 1. Background information



	 


	TRON Group Inc. (“the Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 20, 2015, as Plush Corp., and it is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. On November 3, 2016, a majority of stockholders of our company and our board of directors approved a change of name of our company from Plush Corp. to TRON Group Inc. The company intends to design, market, and sell luxury accessories for men online through its website. To date, the company’s activities have been limited to raising capital, organizational matters, launching the website and the structuring of its business plan. The company has not generated any revenues since inception.


	 



	Note 2. Going concern



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the company had a net loss of $50,518. As of December 31, 2016, the company has not generated any revenues from operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the company’s ability to begin operations and to achieve a level of profitability. The company intends on financing its future development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The financial statements of the company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	Note 3. Summary of significant accounting policies



	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). 


	 



	Use of estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Start-Up Costs



	 


	In accordance with ASC 720, “

	Start-up Costs”,

	 the company expenses all costs incurred in connection with the start-up and organization of the company.


	 



	Cash



	 


	Cash includes cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant risk of loss in value.

	Fair Value Measurements



	 


	The company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.


	 


	The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.


	 


	ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:


	 


	Level 1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities


	 


	Level 2 — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable


	 


	Level 3 — inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)


	 


	The company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis.


	 



	Concentrations of Credit Risks



	 


	The company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and related party payables it will likely incur in the near future. The company places its cash with financial institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash with a particular financial institution may exceed any applicable government insurance limits. The company’s management plans to assess the financial strength and credit worthiness of any parties to which it extends funds, and as such, it believes that any associated credit risk exposures are limited.


	 



	Loss per Share



	 


	The company has adopted ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share,” (“EPS”) which requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures, and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of the diluted EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.


	 


	The company has no potentially dilutive securities, such as options or warrants, currently issued and outstanding.


	 



	Related party transaction



	 


	The Company follows ASC 850, "Related Party Disclosures," for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. The company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the company’s financial statements.


	 



	Note 4. Prepaid expense



	 


	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had prepaid expense of $5,000 and $0, respectively. Prepaid expense consists of a one year subscription agreement with the transfer agent.


	 





	Note 5. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities



	 


	The Company's accounts payable and accrued liabilities consist of the following:

	Note 6. Income taxes



	 


	The Company provides for income taxes under ASC 740, "Income Taxes." Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and the tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. The Company provided a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset.


	 


	The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts which would be provided by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% to the net loss before provision for income taxes for the following reasons:

	The Company has approximately $55,159 of net operating losses (“NOL”) carried forward to offset taxable income, if any, in future years which begin to expire in fiscal 2035. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

	Item 9A. Controls and Procedures




	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 

	Securities Exchange Act of 1934

	, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of December 31, 2016 that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the information relating to us required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") reports: (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 



	Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:


	 







	 




	·



	Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;





	 




	 




	 






	 




	·



	Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.






	 



	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.

	Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

	Internal Control – Integrated Framework – 2013 (COSO 2013 Framework)

	and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments.


	 


	Based upon such evaluation, our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO framework criteria, as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.


	 


	The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of majority of independent members; (2) lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (3) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives affecting authorization, recordkeeping, custody of assets, and reconciliations; (4) ineffective controls over year-end financial disclosure and reporting processes; and (5) management dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of December 31, 2016.


	 


	Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	 


	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


	 


	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.

	(1)


	Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person’s actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock actually outstanding on April 3, 2017. As of April 3, 2017 there were 160,000,000 shares of our company’s common stock issued and outstanding.

	Changes in Control



	 


	We are unaware of any contract or other arrangement or provisions of our Articles or Bylaws the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change of control of our company. There are not any provisions in our Articles or Bylaws, the operation of which would delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of our company.



	 






	Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence




	 


	Director Eric Yap and Chui Mean Yap are father and daughter. No director, executive officer, shareholder or any family member thereof, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, or proposed transaction since the year ended December 31, 2016, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at the year-end for the last three completed fiscal years.




	 



	Director Independence



	 


	We currently act with two directors, consisting of Eric Yap and Chui Mean Yap.


	 


	We have determined that we do not have an independent director, as that term is used in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the Rules of National Association of Securities Dealers.


	 


	Currently our audit committee consists of our entire board of directors. We currently do not have nominating, compensation committees or committees performing similar functions. There has not been any defined policy or procedure requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nomination for directors.


	 


	From inception to present date, we believe that the members of our audit committee and the board of directors have been and are collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting.



	 






	Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services




	 


	The aggregate fees billed for the most recently completed fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and for fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows:

	Our board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.


	 


	Our board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining our independent auditors’ independence.
