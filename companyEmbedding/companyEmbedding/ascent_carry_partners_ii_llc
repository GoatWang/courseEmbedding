Ascent Solar to Build New Manufacturing Plant in Suqian of Jiangsu Province, China with funding from the Suqian Government in a Joint VentureTHORNTON, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. ("Ascent")  (NAS: ASTI) , a manufacturer of state-of-the-art, flexible thin-film photovoltaic modules, integrated into the company's EnerPlexTM series of consumer products, announced today the signing of a framework agreement for the establishment of a joint venture with the Government of the Municipal City of Suqian in Jiangsu Province, China ("Suqian"). The agreement covers a multi-faceted, three-phase project over the next six years.Suqian, is a prefecture-level city in northern Jiangsu Province with an area of 3,303 square miles and a population over 5 million. Strategically located between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, Suqian is well connected to both Beijing and Shanghai in less than 3 hours by high-speed train. Suqian is one of the fastest growing prefecture-level cities in China, boasting a GDP of $25 billion, in 2012, and growing nearly 13% annually.Under the framework agreement, in the first phase, Ascent and Suqian will form a joint venture entity ("JV") in which Ascent will have majority interest of up to 80%. The JV will build a factory to manufacture Ascent's proprietary Copper-Indium-Gallium-Selenium (CIGS) photovoltaic modules on flexible thin films. Ascent will contribute proprietary technology and intellectual property, approximately $1.6 million in cash and certain equipment from its Colorado facility. Suqian will provide cash of approximately $32.5 million as well as rent-free use of a 270,000 square foot factory that is currently being built in the Suqian Economic and Industrial Development Science Park. This factory is expandable to 1,000,000 square feet for phases two and three of the agreement. The total project size of Phase one of the alliance is expected to be approximately $160 million. Ascent will have the right to purchase the factory anytime within the first 5 years at the initial construction cost, as well as the right to purchase Suqian's ownership interest in the JV for a modest nominal cost above Suqian's cash investment.Suqian will also provide a package of additional incentives including a multi-year corporate tax holiday, coverage of substantial operational costs for scientists, engineers and management personnel, and significant housing subsidies and tax incentives for key employees of the JV. As Phase two and three of this program are implemented, Ascent will have the option to purchase approximately 1.3 million square feet of land zoned for commercial usage at a favorable cost, as well as the right to arrange sale or lease of land and factory rights to suppliers and support industries brought in by Ascent, which may generate additional meaningful cash flow for the JV."This partnership is a strong endorsement of Ascent's industry leading flexible CIGS technology," said Victor Lee, President & CEO of Ascent. "This partnership enables us to accelerate our paradigm shift into consumer electronics and specialty market applications given China's very large and growing consumer base and readily available contract manufacturers for our EnerPlex range of consumer products," continued Lee."We are very excited and honored to be partnering with Ascent Solar," said Mr. Lan Shao Min, Top Leader & Governor of the Municipal City of Suqian. Mr. Lan continued, "The Suqian Government is fully committed to this partnership and shall provide the utmost support and incentives to Ascent. We are convinced that CIGS, and more specifically Ascent's proprietary CIGS technology utilizing a flexible plastic substrate, is the next breakthrough in photovoltaics. The aim of our alliance with Ascent is to build a state of the art industrial park in Suqian for solar and solar-related products, anchored by the Ascent factory, but including equipment suppliers, contract manufacturers and other supporting industries."Amit Kumar, Chairman of Ascent, said, "We are pleased with our alliance with Suqian. The funding and other subsidies will enable Ascent to develop the scale of manufacturing needed to bring the cost of CIGS down substantially. The combination of cost reduction and our higher margin EnerPlex products and other specialty market applications will allow Ascent to carry on to its next stage as a high-growth company. The alliance with Suqian, as it develops over the next six years, will provide a means for Ascent to build positive cash flow from numerous sources, including control of the real-estate rights in the Suqian Economic and Industrial Development Science Park."About Ascent Solar Technologies:Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. is a developer of thin-film photovoltaic modules with substrate materials that can be more flexible and affordable than most traditional solar panels.

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Plains All American Pipeline Announces Changes to Board of Directors
                                In Connection with Ownership Changes in General Partner

(Houston – December 23, 2010) Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NYSE: PAA) today
                              announced changes to the board of directors of its general partner. Such changes are related to
                              the previously announced agreement to transfer 50.1% of its general partner interest that was
                              substantially consummated today. Two new directors were appointed to the board of PAA’s general partner and two existing directors stepped down from the board.
Joining the board are Vicky Sutil and John Raymond. Ms. Sutil was appointed as the
                              board representative for Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) and Mr. Raymond was
                              appointed as the board representative for EMG Investment, LLC. Stepping down from the board
                              are Geoff McKay, the designated director for Vulcan Energy Corporation, an affiliate of Vulcan
                              Capital (“Vulcan”), and Arthur L. Smith, an at large director. The size of the board remains
                              unchanged at eight directors. Vulcan remains PAA’s largest common unit holder and Mr.
                              McKay will act as a board observer for Vulcan. Separately, PAA Natural Gas Storage, L.P.
                              (NYSE:PNG) announced that Mr. Smith has joined the board of PNG’s general partner.
 Ms. Sutil is Senior Manager, Corporate Development, for Occidental Petroleum
                              Corporation (Oxy), where she has led and worked on a variety of international and domestic oil
                              and gas acquisitions. Her prior positions at Oxy have included Manager, Financial Planning and
                              Analysis, and Senior Business Analyst. Before joining Oxy in 2000, Ms. Sutil worked for ARCO
                              Products Company as a Business Analyst for the Refining and Retail Marketing divisions, and
                              Senior Project Manager for the Refining Division. Earlier, she held a variety of engineering
                              positions at Mobil Oil Corporation. Ms. Sutil has been Oxy’s designated board observer since
                              acquiring its initial interest in PAA’s general partner in 2008.
 Mr. Raymond is an owner and founder of The Energy and Minerals Group (EMG), a

                              management, and has been Managing Partner and CEO since EMG’s inception in 2006.
                              Previous to that time, Mr. Raymond held leadership positions with various energy companies,
                              including President and CEO of Plains Resources Inc., the predecessor entity for Vulcan Energy
                              Corporation, President and Chief Operating officer of Plains Exploration and Production
                              Company and Director of Development for Kinder Morgan, Inc. Mr. Raymond has been a direct

                              partner from 2001 to 2005.
 “We welcome John Raymond back to the board and Ms. Sutil as a full participating
                              member of the board,” said Greg L. Armstrong, PAA’s Chairman and CEO. “We want to thank Geoff McKay for his diligent service on PAA’s board and look forward to our continued

                              valuable contributions since joining PAA’s board in 1999 and we are pleased that we will have
                              the continued benefit of Art’s guidance and counsel through his new role as a member of the
                              board of PNG’s general partner.”
