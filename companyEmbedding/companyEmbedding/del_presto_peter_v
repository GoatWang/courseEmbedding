                  He is that absolute worst professor in the business program. How he had a career with PNC is beyond me. I've never felt more disrespected or marginalized than I did in his class. If you want to take a course that is essentially a biopic of his life, success (questionable), and that of his kids then by all means register.

TOUGH GRADER


                  Took him for acqs of privately held companies. Class is unorganized and he doesn't know how to teach. Just gives you an assignment then tells you the answer later. He's  rude to students and doesn't try and help if you are struggling.

TOUGH GRADER


                  This is not a good professor. He does not teach. He gives group homework and teaches after. He is a difficult grader and gives whatever grade he wants at the end. Do not take this professor.

LOTS OF HOMEWORK
PARTICIPATION MATTERS


                  Took him for efficiency of capital markets. It was  my most interesting class of the semester.  Participation does matter so you have to. Group homework once a week and it probably takes about an hour. Overall I would recommend.

CARING

                  Bad Professor. Doesn't teach. Gives bad grades and is totally subjective in how he grades you. Can't justify the grade at the end just says, "well you didn't contribute in class." Worst teacher I've had at the school.

TOUGH GRADER
PARTICIPATION MATTERS


                  This semester was a disaster due to this professor. He doesn't teach you but expects you to complete projects and grades them like you already know how to do things. If you ask for help he will not give it to you. Grades were low at the end. I don't recommend taking him.

                  Peter is a really good teacher that finance majors can't pass up. The class covers a lot of topics, and is really a good follow up to investments/corporate. There is a lot of reading and assignments, but they are never too difficult. Participate in class and you will have a good grade. The final is optional.

                  The class is fairly unorganized. Class is just discussion of readings; Peter hops from one thought to another so quickly that its hard to take notes, especially since he doesn't post the slides until a few lectures later. He's nice enough, but take another professor if you can.
