BlackRock Announces Key Leadership Appointments




Gary S. Shedlin to Join BlackRock, Will Become Chief Financial 
      Officer; Ann Marie Petach Named Senior Managing Director in Client 
      Solutions Business






February 12, 2013 05:55 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) today announced that Gary S. Shedlin, a 
      long-time strategic and financial advisor to BlackRock, will join the 
      Firm as Senior Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. 
      Shedlin will become a member of BlackRock’s Global Executive Committee, 
      reporting to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink.
    


      Mr. Shedlin will succeed Ann Marie Petach, who is joining BlackRock 
      Solutions as Senior Managing Director in the Client Solutions business, 
      where she will help to develop critical client relationships and 
      business initiatives with a special focus on solutions offerings for 
      public and private pension funds. Mr. Shedlin will join the Firm on 
      March 11, 2013 and work closely with Ms. Petach through a transition 
      period until she completes her tenure as CFO following the reporting of 
      BlackRock’s first quarter earnings results. Mr. Shedlin will assume the 
      role of CFO at that time.
    

      “We’re fortunate to have two executives with the depth and breadth of 
      experience of Ann Marie and Gary assuming new roles with BlackRock,” Mr. 
      Fink said. “As a key member of our senior management team, Ann Marie has 
      helped guide the Firm through a number of significant milestones, 
      including our acquisition of BGI and the transformation of our company 
      to one with a broad base of shareholders. In addition, she has helped 
      build our financial infrastructure to support one of the largest 
      financial services companies in the world. We’re extremely pleased that 
      Ann Marie is assuming this important new role with our Client Solutions 
      business consistent with the desire she expressed last year to work 
      directly with clients. This new role leverages her deep knowledge of 
      BlackRock and her prior experience as a client to help build a key 
      strategic area for the Firm.”
    

      Ms. Petach said: “I’m looking forward to working more directly with our 
      clients and assisting in solving some of their most pressing challenges. 
      As a former corporate treasurer at Ford Motor Company who was 
      responsible for pension, banking and risk management issues, and more 
      recently as BlackRock’s CFO, I’m intimately familiar with the challenges 
      facing many of our clients. BlackRock is uniquely positioned to assist 
      these clients in the current environment, and I will be working with our 
      team to offer clients solutions that leverage the full array of 
      resources BlackRock has to offer them.”
    

      Mr. Shedlin joins BlackRock from Morgan Stanley, where he is Vice 
      Chairman, Investment Banking and a Managing Director in the Financial 
      Institutions Group. Mr. Shedlin has spent more than 25 years advising 
      companies in the financial services sector including as Chairman of the 
      Financial Institutions Group at Citigroup and Managing Director and 
      Co-Head of the Financial Institutions Group at Lazard.
    

      Mr. Shedlin has served as a trusted advisor to BlackRock on virtually 
      all of its most significant strategic transactions. As Chief Financial 
      Officer, he will be responsible for all of BlackRock’s Corporate Finance 
      functions including Business Finance; Accounting; Finance Operations; 
      Tax, Treasury and Risk Management; and Investment Products & Controls. 
      He also will be responsible for Investor Relations and Corporate 
      Development as well as Strategy, which has a co-report to Mr. Fink.
    

      “Given his strategic insight and leadership ability, Gary is well 
      positioned to build on the world-class finance organization that Ann 
      Marie has helped to establish, and I am delighted to welcome him to 
      BlackRock. Gary has an intimate knowledge of BlackRock and knows our 
      industry well. I am confident that he will lead our finance operations 
      as a partner in driving our business through our next phase of 
      disciplined growth,” Mr. Fink said.
    

      Mr. Shedlin said: “It has been a privilege to be part of Morgan Stanley 
      and to work closely with Larry and other senior executives at BlackRock 
      as the Firm has evolved to meet the needs of clients. I am tremendously 
      excited to now be a part of this very talented management team and to 
      help contribute to BlackRock’s continued success in leveraging the 
      unique, global asset management platform it has built.”

Forward-looking Statements


      This report, and other statements that BlackRock may make, may contain 
      forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act, with respect to BlackRock’s future financial or 
      business performance, strategies or expectations. Forward-looking 
      statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as “trend,” 
      “potential,” “opportunity,” “pipeline,” “believe,” “comfortable,” 
      “expect,” “anticipate,” “current,” “intention,” “estimate,” “position,” 
      “assume,” “outlook,” “continue,” “remain,” “maintain,” “sustain,” 
      “seek,” “achieve,” and similar expressions, or future or conditional 
      verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “may” and similar 
      expressions.
    

      BlackRock cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to 
      numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. 
      Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and 
      BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update 
      forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from 
      those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could 
      differ materially from historical performance.
    

      In addition to risk factors previously disclosed in BlackRock’s 
      Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports and those identified 
      elsewhere in this report the following factors, among others, could 
      cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking 
      statements or historical performance: (1) the introduction, withdrawal, 
      success and timing of business initiatives and strategies; (2) changes 
      and volatility in political, economic or industry conditions, the 
      interest rate environment, foreign exchange rates or financial and 
      capital markets, which could result in changes in demand for products or 
      services or in the value of assets under management; (3) the relative 
      and absolute investment performance of BlackRock’s investment products; 
      (4) the impact of increased competition; (5) the impact of future 
      acquisitions or divestitures; (6) the unfavorable resolution of legal 
      proceedings; (7) the extent and timing of any share repurchases; (8) the 
      impact, extent and timing of technological changes and the adequacy of 
      intellectual property and information security protection; (9) the 
      impact of legislative and regulatory actions and reforms, including the 
      Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and
