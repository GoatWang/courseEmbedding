Patent number:  6015911
                                            

Abstract:  Herbicidal 1-alkyl-4-(2-chloro-3-alkoxy-4-alkylsulfonylbenzoyl)-5-hydroxypyrazole compounds, as well as 1-halo-2-chloro-3-alkoxy-4-alkylsulfonylbenzene compounds and 2-chloro-3-alkoxy-4-alkylsulfonylbenzoic acid compounds, were prepared in good yield by the reaction of the corresponding 3-chloro compound with an alkali metal alkoxide compound. 1-Halo-2-chloro-3-alkoxy-4-alkylsulfonylbenzene and 1-halo-2,3-dichloro-4-alkylsulfonylbenzene compounds were converted to compounds having hydroxycarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, or 1-alkyl-5-hydroxypyrazole-4-carbonyl substituents in place of the 1-halo substituent by reaction with carbon monoxide and water, an alcohol, or a 1-alkyl-5-hydroxypyrazole compound, respectively, in the presence of a palladium II salt:trihydrocarbylphosphine complex type catalyst.

Solventless process for making 2,6 difluorobenzonitrile



Patent number:  5502235
                                            

Abstract:  A process for making 2,6-difluorobenzonitrile, comprising reacting 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile with a substantially anhydrous metal fluoride at a temperature between about 160.degree. C. and about 300.degree. C. and in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, which is typically a polyether, tetra-substituted phosphonium salt, tetra-substituted ammonium salt, and cryptand, but in the absence of a solvent. After taking off the product the resulting mixture may be recycled into the reactor for the next reaction cycle. Upon build-up of tars in the reaction process, the invention includes the separation of catalyst from the tars and the recycle thereof.
