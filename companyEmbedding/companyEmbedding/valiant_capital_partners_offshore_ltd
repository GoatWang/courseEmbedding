Morgan Stanley Buys Out Valiant Offshore in Jai Corp



By:
P Vinod Kumar
|

									December 31, 2016										
							

 

Dec 30: The US-based Global fund house Morgan Stanley seems to be going for value buying in the Indian stock market with the Mauritius-based fund house, managed by one of the financial US boutique firms, closing the third deal in a row in a short span of a week. The fund house has picked up significant minority stakes in three domestic business firms operating in varied verticals.
The three companies in which Morgan Stanley Mauritius Company picked up stake are Tata Sons time machine-cum-luxury jewelry retailer Titan Company Ltd, the Anil Ambani group firm Reliance Defence and Engineering Ltd (RDEL), which is steadily spreading its wings in the private defence equipment manufacturing space with a host of tie-ups including one with Dassault Aviation of France, the makers of Rafale fighter jets and iron, and steel intermediate product maker Jai Corp Ltd.
Incidentally, Morgan has bought the stakes in all the three companies from a Singapore-based Valiant Mauritius Partners Offshore Ltd, an obscure company whose promoters were not even listed in the Bloomberg data base.
