Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

A life of wealth. A wealth of life.




TRUST. SERVICE. PERFORMANCE.
At First Long Island Investors, we believe that a life of wealth should be a life enjoyed to the fullest, confident in the knowledge that you have made the right financial decisions.

And something more: an unshakeable commitment to our core principles of trust, service, and performance.
For over 30 years, wealthy individuals, families, and select institutions have gained from our unique perspective on wealth, and experience the confidence that comes from having just such a team supporting them. FLI oversees approximately $1.3 billion dollars in assets of clients and philanthropic organizations.

 Investment Committee


The Investment Committee is composed of investment professionals with a breadth of backgrounds and experiences. Each one brings special insights and expertise to the management of client assets. They work in sub-committees to manage each investment strategy we offer and come together to make decisions regarding each investment strategy and each client’s individual asset allocation. And each quarter, the entire committee reviews each client’s asset allocation to ensure their plans reflect the most current economic factors and market environment as well as is properly aligned to the client’s unique situation. As further proof of our commitment to our clients’ success, we invest our own assets alongside theirs. Unlike many firms, at First Long Island Investors, we put our money where our advice is.

 Our Founders


First Long Island Investors was conceived by Robert D. Rosenthal and co-founded by him and Ralph F. Palleschi in 1983. Bob Rosenthal had for a number of years been a key member of the Entemann’s Bakery leadership team (as EVP and COO), where he successfully planned and executed a public offering in 1976, and subsequent sale in 1978, of the firm. After Entenmann’s went through its second acquisition (first to Warner Lambert and then to General Foods), Bob decided to start First Long Island with Ralph, who had been Entenmann’s CFO. The Entenmann families became our first clients. The founders’ proven financial and investment expertise formed the principles of sound, long-term investment strategies which still guide the firm today.

FLI’s web site is limited to the dissemination of general information pertaining to its advisory services, together with access to additional investment-related information, publications, and links. Accordingly, the publication of FLI’s web site on the Internet should not be construed by any prospective client as FLI’s solicitation to effect, or attempt to effect transactions in securities, or the rendering of personalized investment advice for compensation, over the Internet. A copy of FLI’s current written disclosure statement discussing FLI’s business operations, services, and fees is available on the SEC website or from FLI upon written request. FLI does not make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy, timeliness, suitability, completeness, or relevance of any information prepared by any unaffiliated third party, whether linked to FLI’s web site or incorporated herein, and takes no responsibility therefor. All such information is provided solely for the convenience of the user only and all users thereof should be guided accordingly.
Past performance may not be indicative of future results. Therefore, no current or prospective client should assume that future performance of any specific investment, investment strategy (including the investments and/or investment strategies recommended or undertaken by FLI) or product made reference to directly or indirectly on this web site, or indirectly via a link to an unaffiliated third party web site, will be profitable or equal the corresponding indicated performance level(s).
Securities and other investments involve investment risks, including the possible loss of value. Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment or investment strategy (including those recommended or undertaken by FLI) will either be suitable or profitable for a client or prospective client’s investment portfolio or have future performance equal to any historical performance level(s).
Historical performance results for investment indices and/or categories generally do not reflect the deduction of transaction and/or custodial charges, the deduction of an investment management fee, nor the impact of taxes, the incurrence of which would have the effect of decreasing historical performance results. You cannot invest directly in an index.
Our principals invest side-by-side with our clients in every FLI strategy (other than fixed income which is personalized for each client). Where a strategy is offered through different investment vehicles, our principals invest in the vehicle suitable for them, but not in every vehicle available.
Assets under management figures discussed throughout this site are as of 12/31/16.
Rankings by third party rating services should not be construed by any client or prospective client that he/she/it will experience a certain level of results if FLI is retained, or continues to be retained, to provide investment advisory services, nor should they be construed as a current or past endorsement of FLI by any of its clients. It is not known whether any clients listed on this website approve or disapprove of FLI or the advisory services provided.
Certain portions of FLI’s web site (i.e. newsletters, articles, commentaries, etc.) may contain a discussion of, and/or provide access to, FLI’s (and other’s) positions and/or recommendations as of a specific prior date. Due to various factors, including changing market conditions, such discussion may no longer be reflective of our or the others current position(s) and/or recommendation(s). Moreover, no client or prospective client should assume that any such discussion serves as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized advice.

Each client and prospective client agrees, as a condition precedent to his/her/its access to FLI’s web site, to release and hold harmless FLI, its officers, directors, owners, employees and agents from any and all adverse consequences resulting from any of his/her/its actions and/or omissions which are independent of such client or prospective client’s receipt of personalized individual advice from FLI.
Case studies are representative scenarios presented by various clients and may reflect a combination of individual situations. The details have been modified to protect the privacy of our clients.
Your eligibility for particular investment options or services is subject to final FLI determination and acceptance.

Trust. Service. Performance.




TRUST.
Trust is the foundation of all meaningful relationships.
And our clients trust us to help them manage their wealth through a breadth of life experiences and investment environments. In fact, several of our clients have been with us for decades, spanning multiple generations.
We’ve earned our clients’ trust in a unique way:

By investing our own assets alongside theirs.
  So when we say we understand our clients’goals,
  it is because we share them ourselves.
At First Long Island Investors,
  we put our money where our advice is.

SERVICE.
We are an employee-owned, boutique wealth management firm founded on a service ethic that puts our clients at the center of everything we do. You’ll feel that from your first visit to our office.
Each client is made to feel like the newest member of the family, not merely a new set of assets to be managed. Your First Long Island client team will have one goal: to support you with the expertise to responsibly and professionally manage your wealth.
And every client has access to and receives the benefit of our most senior team members.
From sophisticated money management to full family office services, and everything in between, we pride ourselves on being not merely your wealth managers but your partners in achieving a wealth of life.
PERFORMANCE.
To us, performance is a very simple concept: provide every client with the resources, expertise, investment guidance, and confidence to live their life of wealth to the fullest.

Simple to state. Hard to do.

In fact, it requires the knowledge, insight, intelligence, and judgment of experienced financial professionals.
Our process begins with an in-depth analysis of a client’s total holdings and an understanding of his or her goals. Then we build a customized asset allocation recommendation which takes into consideration the client’s risk tolerance, liquidity preferences, current income needs, and time horizon. From here, we make our specific strategic recommendations to each client, who has the ultimate say on the recommended investment plan.
The entire First Long Island Investors Investment Committee reviews each client’s strategy and allocations every quarter to assure ourselves that individual plans are based on current macro-economic factors and market environment, and reflect any recent changes in the client’s personal situation.
If this sounds unusually rigorous, it is.






Trust. Service. Performance.
