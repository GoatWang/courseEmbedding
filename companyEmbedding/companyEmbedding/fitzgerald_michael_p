Research Interests
I am interested in extrasolar planets and their formation.  In order to study these objects and processes, I am seeking to advance astronomical instrumentation and observational technique.  Particularly interesting are indirect and direct techniques for detecting extrasolar planets with adaptive optics, coronagraphy, and interferometry.  I am also studying dust disks around main sequence stars.  High-contrast observations of circumstellar debris can reveal signatures of planet formation.

Now at the age of 36 he takes of my two children. As well as all three of my sister's children. Dr. Fitzgerald is nothing short of excellent! 55-Nidia Harris in Jamaica, NY | Aug 17, 2016I took my 14 year old son for his annual physical.  Dr. Fitzgerald is a very attentive and easy going personality.  My son was a bit nervous, but was at ease with Dr. Fitzgerald.  Dr. Fitzgerald also did a "head to toe" physical and was even talking to my son in regards to taking care of his back, etc.  I cannot express how much great this doctor is.55-Cbaliaj | Apr 02, 2016I had Dr. Michael Fitgerald as a doctor when I was younger (as did my brother). I'm turning 24 now and he was by far the best caring Doctor I've had. I have a hard time finding a doctor as an adult that is a great as he was. 55-Lolita in Kew Gardens, NY | Feb 18, 2016Dr. Fitzgerald is a wonderful doctor. Every time I have seen him whether for minor or major
issues he has taken the time to explain everything, to calm my fears and to make sure my children got the best care.  My son was very upset when he turned eighteen and could no longer see Dr. Fitzgerald. He is professional, caring and engenders trust.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.

Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.

Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her.
