      Fitch Expects to Rate Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2012-B; Presale Issued
    





April 16, 2012 02:37 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings to the Ford Credit 
      Auto Owner Trust 2012-B notes:
    

      --$306,300,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$422,100,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$450,700,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$120,710,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$41,060,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$27,360,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$27,360,000 class D 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Key Rating Drivers
    

      Stable Credit Quality: The 2012-B pool is relatively consistent with 
      prior deals. The WA FICO score is 722. Despite this, there is a slight 
      shift down in the credit/FICO tiers versus recent deals. The pool 
      comprises 87.3% new vehicles, has more 60+ month term loans, and is 
      geographically diverse.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure, consistent with prior transactions. Initial 
      hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A notes totals 5.50%, 
      consisting of 7.00% subordination and a 0.50% non-declining reserve 
      offset by under-collateralization of 2.00%. Initial hard CE is 0.50% 
      lower than recent 2012 and 2011 transactions.
    

      Improved Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on Ford Credit's 
      portfolio and 2009-2011 FCAOT securitizations have declined, supported 
      by the improving U.S. economy albeit volatile, and strong used vehicle 
      values resulting in higher recovery rates.
    

      Positive Corporate Performance: Fitch currently rates the long-term 
      Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of Ford, the parent of Ford Credit, and Ford 
      Credit 'BB+' with a Positive Rating Outlook.
    

      Strong Wholesale Vehicle Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market 
      rebounded considerably during late 2009?2010 and remained strong in 
      2012. However, Fitch remains cautious as to the potential impact of 
      general economic weakness and rising fuel prices on demand for and 
      values of used vehicles.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates 
      good capabilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, evidenced by 
      historical delinquency and loss performance of its managed portfolio and 
      securitizations. Fitch deems Ford Credit capable to adequately service 
      2012-B.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      For more information about Fitch's comprehensive subscription service

      Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

intermediary” as defined in Section 8-102 of the UCC and
a “bank” as defined in Section 9-102 of the UCC
(in such capacities, the “ Financial Institution
”).

 
ARTICLE I
USAGE AND DEFINITIONS
 

Section 1.1.
                                
Usage and Definitions
.  Capitalized terms used but
not otherwise defined in this Agreement are defined in Appendix A
to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, dated as of November 1,
2012, among Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2012-D, as Issuer, Ford
Credit Auto Receivables Two LLC, as Depositor, and Ford Motor
Credit Company LLC, as Servicer.  Appendix A also contains
rules as to usage applicable to this Agreement.  Appendix
A is incorporated by reference into this Agreement.  All
references to the “ UCC ” mean the Uniform
Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York.

 
ARTICLE II
ESTABLISHMENT OF COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS
 

Section 2.1.
                                
Description of Account
.  The Financial Institution
has established the following accounts (each, a “
Collateral Account ”):

 

“Collection Account —
The Bank of New York Mellon as Indenture Trustee, as secured party
for Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2012-D” with account number
879713;

 

“Reserve Account — The
Bank of New York Mellon as Indenture Trustee, as secured party for
Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2012-D” with account number
879714; and

 

“Principal Payment Account
— The Bank of New York Mellon as Indenture Trustee, as
secured party for Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2012-D” with
account number 879715.

 

Section 2.2.
                                
Account Modifications
.  Neither the Financial
Institution nor the Grantor will change the name or account number
of any Collateral Account without the prior written consent of the
Secured Party.

 

Section 2.3.
                                
Type of Account
.  The Financial Institution
agrees that each Collateral Account is, and will be maintained as,
either (a) a “securities account” (as defined in
Section 8-501 of the UCC) or (b) a “deposit
account” (as defined in Section 9-102(a)(29) of the
UCC).

 

Section 2.4.
                                
Securities Account
Provisions .  If and
to the extent any Collateral Account is a securities account
(within the meaning of Section 8-501 of the UCC) the Financial
Institution agrees that:
 





 

(a)                                 
all securities, financial assets or
other investment property (other than cash) credited to each
Collateral Account will be registered in the name of the Financial
Institution, indorsed to the Financial Institution or in blank or
credited to another securities account maintained in the name of
the Financial Institution.  In no case will any financial
asset credited to any Collateral Account be registered in the name
of the Grantor, payable to the order of the Grantor or specially
indorsed to the Grantor unless the foregoing have been specially
indorsed to the Financial Institution or in blank; and

 

(b)                                 
all financial assets delivered to
the Financial Institution pursuant to the Indenture will be
promptly credited to the appropriate Collateral Account; and each
item of property (whether investment property, financial asset,
security or instrument) credited to any Collateral Account will be
treated as a “financial asset” within the meaning of
Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC.

 
ARTICLE III
SECURED PARTY CONTROL
 

Section 3.1.
                                
Control for Purposes of
UCC .  If the
Financial Institution receives any order from the Secured Party or
its authorized agent (a) directing disposition of funds in any
Collateral Account or (b) directing transfer or redemption of
the financial assets relating to the Collateral Accounts (a “
Secured Party Order ”), the Financial Institution will
comply with the Secured Party Order without further consent by the
Grantor or any other person.

 

Section 3.2.
                                
Conflicting Orders or
Instructions . 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if at any time, the Financial Institution receives
conflicting orders or instructions from the Secured Party and the
Grantor, the Financial Institution will follow the orders or
instructions of the Secured Party and not the Grantor.  The
Financial Institution will (a) have no obligation to
investigate or inquire as to whether the Secured Party is entitled
pursuant to the Indenture or otherwise to deliver any Secured Party
Order and (b) be entitled to rely on communications (including
Secured Party Orders) believed by it in good faith to be genuine
and given by the appropriate party.

 
ARTICLE IV
INVESTMENT OF FUNDS IN THE COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS
 

Section 4.1.
                                
Investment of Funds
.  If (a) the Financial
Institution has not otherwise received a Secured Party Order
regarding the investment of funds held in the Collateral Accounts
by 11:00 a.m. New York time (or such other time as may be
agreed between the Financial Institution and the Grantor) on the
Business Day preceding a Payment Date or (b) a Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the
Notes and the Indenture Trustee has provided notice of such
continuing Default or Event of Default to the Financial
Institution, the Financial Institution will, to the fullest extent
practicable, invest and reinvest funds in such Collateral Account
in accordance with the last investment instruction received, which
will be deemed to be effective with respect to such
investment.

ARTICLE V
SUBORDINATION OF LIEN; WAIVER OF SET-OFF
 

Section 5.1.
                                
Subordination
.  If the Financial Institution
has, or subsequently obtains, by agreement, by operation of law or
otherwise a security interest in any Collateral Account (or any
portion thereof), the Financial Institution agrees that such
security interest will be subordinate to the security interest of
the Secured Party.

 

Section 5.2.
                                
Set-off and Recoupment
.  The financial assets, money
and other items credited to each Collateral Account will not be
subject to deduction, set-off, recoupment, banker’s lien, or
any other right in favor of any person other than the Secured
Party.  However, the Financial Institution may set off
(a) all amounts due to the Financial Institution in respect of
customary fees and expenses for the routine maintenance and
operation of each Collateral Account, (b) the face amount of
any checks which have been credited to a Collateral Account but are
subsequently returned unpaid because of uncollected or insufficient
funds and (c) any advances made in connection with the
settlement of any investment made with respect to the Collateral
Accounts.

 
ARTICLE VI
