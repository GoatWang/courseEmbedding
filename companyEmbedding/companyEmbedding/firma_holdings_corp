Firma Holdings Corp (OTCPK:FRMA)
Accounts Receivable
=GURUF("OTCPK:FRMA","Accounts Receivable")

$0.46 Mil (As of Jun. 2015)
Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Firma Holdings Corp's accounts receivables for the quarter that ended in Jun. 2015 was $0.46 Mil.
Accounts receivable can be measured by Days Sales Outstanding. Firma Holdings Corp's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Jun. 2015 was 172.36.
In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value. Firma Holdings Corp's Liquidation Value for the quarter that ended in Jun. 2015 was $-12.16 Mil.

Definition
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.

Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days sales outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.
Firma Holdings Corp's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Jun. 2015 is calculated as:



Days Sales Outstanding


=Account Receivable/Revenue*Days in Period

=0.459/0.243*91


=172.36



2. In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, Firma Holdings Corp's accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value:
Firma Holdings Corp's liquidation value for the quarter that ended in Jun. 2015 is calculated as:



Liquidation value


=Cash and Cash Equivalents-Total Liabilities+(0.75 * Account Receivable)+(0.5 * Inventory)


=0.294-13.032+0.75 * 0.459+0.5 * 0.461


=-12.16



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.

(TSX VENTURE: MXL) (FRANKFURT: ODV) (OTCQX: MXLGF), is pleased to announce that the Magistral project is progressing on schedule. The turn-key build out of the plant includes increasing throughput capacity to 1,000 tonnes per day. The build out is on track to be completed, with the plant operational, by this November. 
Mr. Dan Omeniuk, Chairman and CEO of MX Gold stated, "Despite the rainy season in the region, it is encouraging to see that the project business plan is being executed on schedule, and that our Joint Venture efforts with GracePoint are producing positive outcomes. We are looking forward to the projected cash flow from Magistral, as it will serve as an integral part of building value for MX Gold shareholders with a non-dilutive strategy."
Mr. Bert McPherson, President of MX Gold stated, "Combined efforts with GracePoint have also allowed us to seek out potential new acquisitions in the area. We look forward to updating our shareholders after conducting our due diligence in weeks to come."
The project includes a fully permitted 500 TPD Dynamic Cyanide counter current system plant. Construction of the plant was completed in 2013, for approximately $4.5 million. There is a current build out, underway, to bring the plant to 1,000 tonnes per day capacity. Additionally, the Magistral project includes the exclusive rights to process approximately 1.2 million tonnes of mineralized mill tailings, grading an average of 2.06 gold per tonne (79,000 ounces of gold).
