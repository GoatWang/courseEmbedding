FAQs: Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios


How can this strategy help me meet my goals?  

This professionally managed strategy is tailored to your personal financial situation, enabling you to request exclusion of particular stocks or industries, while seeking to reduce the impact of taxes on your investment returns.



Who manages my money?  

Strategic Advisers, Inc., a Fidelity company, will actively manage your personalized portfolio using their disciplined, research-driven approach, and will apply tax-sensitive investment strategies1, where appropriate, that seek to enhance after-tax investment returns.



What kind of investments can I expect in my account?  

This strategy includes a broad range of investment options including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and separately managed accounts (SMAs) when appropriate.



How are the investments chosen for my account?  

Because we are creating a portfolio that is personalized to your needs and specific goals, our investment team will research and select the mix of investments that is appropriate for your goals.



Can I choose my own investments?  

Our investment professionals will select your investments and build a portfolio tailored to you. We will use in-depth investment research, manage your risk through diversification, and suggest a mix of investments personalized for your goals. We do offer transparency into your holdings and the activity conducted on your behalf.



Can I change my investment strategy?  

You can contact us at any time to discuss changing your investment strategy should your financial situation or goals change. You can feel confident knowing we'll work with you to help ensure you're on track to meet your needs.



Can I add funds to my account?  

Yes, you can add funds at any time.



Can I withdraw funds from my account?  

Yes, there are several ways to access your funds, including scheduled withdrawals.



How much do I need to open an account?  

The minimum funding amount is $200,000. Accounts can be funded with a check, bank wire, an exchange purchase from an existing Fidelity account, or a transfer of eligible assets from an account at another institution.



How much does it cost?  

Gross advisory fees range from 0.55% to 1.50% based on the amount of assets you invest.3



What type of tax strategies do you use?  

While many investment management firms only offer tax-loss harvesting at year's end, Strategic Advisers uses this and a number of other strategies throughout the year designed to help reduce your tax liability and help reach your goals as quickly as possible.1



Will there be tax consequences when I open my account?  

Partnering with you to help manage your money in a tax-efficient way starts with getting your account set up with the right mix of investments. This process may require selling some investments that generate taxable gains. However, the result is an account that we believe will be better positioned to provide opportunities for growth while managing potential investment risks.



Can I choose a different strategy than what is suggested?  

You can opt to select a different strategy than what is suggested during our planning discussions. We will manage your account according to your selected investment strategy.

With this discretionary investment management service, any assets contributed to an investor’s account that Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios do not elect to retain may be sold at any time after contribution. An investor may have a gain or loss when assets are sold.
	
    

          2.

          3. The advisory fee does not cover charges resulting from trades effected with or through broker-dealers other than affiliates of Strategic Advisers, mark-ups or mark-downs by broker-dealers, transfer taxes, exchange fees, regulatory fees, odd-lot differentials, handling charges, electronic fund and wire transfer fees, or any other charges imposed by law or otherwise applicable to your account. You will also incur underlying expenses associated with the investment vehicles selected.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:
Laura J. Riegel, Senior Counsel, at (202) 551-6873 or Dalia Osman Blass, Assistant Director, at (202) 551-6821 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation).
 
 
 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/search/search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. Each Trust is formed as a business trust or limited liability company under the laws of Massachusetts or Delaware, as applicable. Each Trust is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company.[2] 
           FMR Co., SAI or another FMR entity serves as investment adviser or sub-adviser to each of the Funds. FMR Co. and SAI are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). Any investment adviser to the Funds will be registered under the Advisers Act.
2. The Prior Order permits the Funds to participate in a credit facility administered by FMR (the “IFL Program”). The IFL Program enables the Funds to lend money to each other for temporary purposes, such as when redemptions exceed anticipated levels. The IFL Program is designed both to reduce the cost of borrowing for the Funds and enhance the lending Funds' ability to earn higher rates of interest of investment on their short-term balances. The Prior Order requires that the interest rate for loans made through the IFL Program (the “IFL Rate”) be based on the average of: (a) the higher of the overnight time deposit rate (the “OTD Rate”) and the Funds' current overnight repurchase agreement rate (the “FICASH Rate”); [3] 
           and (b) a benchmark rate representing the lowest bank loan rate available for borrowing by the Funds (“Benchmark Rate”). The board of trustees (each, a “Fund Board” and collectively, the “Fund Boards”) of each Fund, including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act, (“Independent Trustees”) establishes the Benchmark Rate, and, reviews, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of the Benchmark Rate. The Benchmark Rate is currently set each day based on the average actual spread between the lowest quoted bank loan rate and the Federal Funds rate over the previous 60 days.
3. Applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the OTD Rate in calculation of the IFL Rate unnecessary. Therefore, applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to eliminate the use of the OTD Rate in the IFL Rate calculation provided in conditions 1 and 2 (“Rate Conditions”). Applicants also request an exemption from section 17(a)(2) of the Act.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(a)(3) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, from borrowing money or other property from the registered investment company. Section 21(b) of the Act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person, directly or indirectly, if that person controls or is under common control with that company. Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person, in part, to be any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person. Section 2(a)(9) of the Act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company,” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company.” Because the Funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser  that is under common control with those of the other Funds, applicants state that each Fund may be deemed to be under common control with all the other Funds, and, therefore, an affiliated person of those Funds.
2. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from selling securities or other property to the investment company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company. Section 12(d)(1) of the Act prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section.
3. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act prohibits registered open-end investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank, if immediately after the borrowing, there is asset coverage of at least 300 per centum for all borrowings of the company. Under section 18(g) of the Act, the term “senior security” generally includes any bond, debenture, note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness.
4. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) provided that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
5. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of an affiliated person, when acting as principal, from effecting any joint transaction in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the Commission. Rule 17d-1(b) provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule, the Commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the company's participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
6. Applicants request an order under (a) section 6(c) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 18(f) and 21(b) of the Act; (b) section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act granting an exemption from section 12(d)(1) of the Act; (c) sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Act; and (d) section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain joint arrangements. The requested order would amend the Rate Conditions in the Prior Order and grant applicants an exemption from section 17(a)(2) of the Act.
7. As noted previously, applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the OTD Rate in calculation of the IFL Rate unnecessary. Applicants state further that the IFL Rate, as amended, would make it more likely that lending Funds would receive a market rate of return in excess of other market alternatives and that borrowing Funds would not be harmed because they would only participate in the IFL Program if the IFL Rate is lower than the lowest quoted bank loan rate. Applicants state that the Rate Conditions will prove to be a more efficient means for achieving savings to the Funds in connection with their routine daily cash management activities and for providing Funds with alternative sources of liquidity in times of substantial net redemption activity.
8. Applicants also state that the IFL Program, as modified by the Rate Conditions, will not involve any potential that one Fund might receive a preferential interest rate to the disadvantage of another Fund. Applicants state that under the IFL Program, as modified by the Rate Conditions, rates will be set under a pre-established formula, approved by the Fund Boards. Applicants state that all Funds participating in the IFL Program, as revised by the Rate Conditions, on any given day will receive the same interest rate.
9. Applicants therefore submit that the modifications to the Rate Conditions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors and the policy and provisions of the Act, and meet the standards set forth in sections 6(c), 12(d)(1)(J), 17(b) and 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act. Applicants represent that the transactions conducted subject to the Rate Conditions would be reasonable and fair, would not involve overreaching, and would be consistent with the investment policies of the Funds and with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants submit further that each Fund's participation in the IFL Program would be consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and would be on a basis which is no different from, or less advantageous than that of any other participant.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The IFL Rate to be charged to the Funds under the IFL Program will be the average of: (a) the FICASH Rate and (b) the Benchmark Rate.
2. On each business day, the Cash Management Services Department (“Cash Management Department”) of Fidelity Service Company, Inc. will compare the IFL Rate calculated as provided in condition 1 with the FICASH Rate that day and all short-term borrowing rates quoted to any of the Funds by any bank with which any Fund has a loan agreement. At least three such quotations will be obtained each day in which any Fund borrows through the IFL Program prior to such borrowing. The Cash Management Department will make cash available for interfund loans only if the IFL Rate is more favorable to the lending Fund than the FICASH Rate and more favorable to the borrowing Fund than the lowest quoted bank loan rate.
3. If a Fund has outstanding borrowings, any interfund loans to the Fund (i) will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan, (ii) will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral, (iii) will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in any event not over seven days), and (iv) will provide that, if an event of default by the Fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the Fund, that event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice by the lending Fund) constitute an immediate event of default under the interfund  loan agreement entitling the lending Fund to call the loan (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral) and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing Fund.
4. A Fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the IFL Program if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total 10% or less of its total assets, provided that if the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender, including but not limited to another Fund, the Fund's interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral. If a Fund's total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than 10% of its total assets, the Fund may borrow through the IFL Program only on a secured basis. A Fund could not borrow through the IFL Program or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after the interfund borrowing would be more than 331/3% of its total assets.
5. Before any Fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may, through additional borrowings, cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund must first secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan. If the total outstanding borrowings of a Fund with outstanding interfund loans exceed 10% of its total assets for any other reason (such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions), the Fund will within one business day thereafter (i) repay all its outstanding interfund loans, (ii) reduce its outstanding indebtedness to 10% or less of its total assets, or (iii) secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, at which time the collateral called for by this condition shall no longer be required. Until each interfund loan that is outstanding at any time that a Fund's total outstanding borrowings exceed 10% is repaid or the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding interfund loan at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the interfund loan.
6. No Fund may lend to another Fund through the IFL Program if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the IFL Program to exceed 15% of the lending Fund's current net assets at the time of the loan.
7. A Fund's interfund loans to any one Fund shall not exceed 5% of the lending Fund's net assets.
8. The duration of interfund loans will be limited to the time required to receive payment for securities sold, but in no event more than seven days. Loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition.
9. Each interfund loan may be called on one business day's notice by a lending Fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing Fund.
10. A Fund's participation in the IFL Program must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents. No Fund may borrow through the IFL Program unless the Fund has a fundamental policy that prevents the Fund from borrowing for other than temporary or emergency purposes (and not for leveraging), except that certain Funds may engage in reverse repurchase agreements for any purpose.
11. The Cash Management Department will calculate total Fund borrowing and lending demand through the IFL Program, and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the Funds, without the intervention of any portfolio manager of the Funds. The Cash Management Department will not solicit cash for the IFL Program from any Fund or prospectively publish or disseminate loan demand data to portfolio managers. Cash amounts remaining after satisfaction of borrowing demand will be invested in FICASH, or in shares of one or more money market funds that are advised by FMR Co. or another FMR entity, or will be returned to be invested directly by the portfolio managers of the Funds.
12. FMR will monitor the IFL Rate and the other terms and conditions of the interfund loans and will make a quarterly report to the Fund Boards concerning the participation of the Funds in the IFL Program and the terms and other conditions of any extensions of credit under the IFL Program.
13. Each Fund Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will: 
(a) Review, no less frequently than quarterly, each Fund's participation in the IFL Program during the preceding quarter for compliance with the conditions of any order permitting such transactions, 
(b) Establish the Benchmark Rate formula used to determine the interest rate on interfund loans, and review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of the Benchmark Rate formula, and 
(c) Review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of each Fund's participation in the IFL Program.
14. In the event an interfund loan is not paid according to its terms and such default is not cured within two business days from its maturity or from the time the lending Fund makes a demand for payment under the provisions of the interfund loan agreement, FMR will promptly refer such loan for arbitration to an independent arbitrator selected by each Fund Board involved in the loan who will serve as arbitrator of disputes concerning interfund loans.[4] 
           The arbitrator will resolve any problem promptly, and the arbitrator's decision will be binding on both Funds. The arbitrator will submit, at least annually, a written report to the Fund Boards setting forth a description of the nature of any dispute and the actions taken by the Funds to resolve the dispute.
15. Each Fund will maintain and preserve, for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transaction by it under the IFL Program occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, written records of all such transactions setting forth a description of the terms of the transactions, including the amount, the maturity and the IFL Rate, the rate of interest available at the time on overnight repurchase agreements and commercial bank borrowings, and such other information presented to the Fund's respective Fund Board in connection with the review required by conditions 12 and 13.
16. Each Fund's independent auditors, in connection with their audit examination of the Fund, will review the operation of the IFL Program for compliance with the conditions of the application and their review will form the basis, in part, of the auditor's report on internal accounting controls in Form N-SAR. Applicants will report on the operations of the IFL Program at the Fund Board meetings on a quarterly basis. 

17. No Fund will be permitted to participate in the IFL Program unless the Fund has fully disclosed in its prospectus and/or statement of additional information all material facts about its intended participation.

 
For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.
Kevin O'Neill,
Deputy Secretary.

			Whether selecting Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB, (FPTC)1 as your trustee or investment manager for assets held in a trust, you put to work a team of professionals who are committed to adding value to your trust.
		








 Help preserve wealth for future generations 
Consider using FPTC if you would like help transferring $200,000 or more to your family or other beneficiary through a trust; or, if you would like to potentially avoid probate—the legal process of distributing wealth after death—to maintain privacy and minimize estate-related costs.
If you decide to name FPTC as your trustee or co-trustee, we offer objectivity, continuity, and experience in trust administration. As part of our fiduciary services, we will:

Administer the trust according to its terms.
Communicate regularly with beneficiaries.
Prepare required records, statements, and tax returns.

Whether you name us as trustee or prefer to name another in this capacity, you’ll also receive the same tax-sensitive investment management2 as with Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios.
A dedicated trust officer will be assigned to all accounts for which FPTC serves as trustee or co-trustee. A dedicated portfolio specialist will be assigned to all other Fidelity® Personalized Portfolio accounts.










Next steps

To open an account, start by telling us your financial needs and goals. We’ll send you a complimentary investment proposal.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 727 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.





3 Yrs





                         Out of
727
 funds

                         Out of
653
 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund's expenses are rated as Low because they are below the 20th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



Seeks high total return over the long term by allocating its assets among stocks, bonds, short-term instruments, and other investments.




Strategy



Maintaining a neutral mix over time of 60% of assets in stocks, 35% of assets in bonds, and 5% of assets in short-term and money market instruments though FMR may overweight or underweight in each asset class. Allocating the fund's assets among stocks, bonds, and short-term and money market instruments, either through direct investment or by investing in Fidelity central funds that hold such investments.


Risk



Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.. Fixed income investments entail interest rate risk (as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall), the risk of issuer or counterparty default, issuer credit risk and inflation risk Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks all of which are magnified in emerging markets. Lower-quality bonds can be more volatile and have greater risk of default than higher-quality bonds. Leverage can increase market exposure and magnify investment risks.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.. Fixed income investments entail interest rate risk (as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall), the risk of issuer or counterparty default, issuer credit risk and inflation risk Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks all of which are magnified in emerging markets. Lower-quality bonds can be more volatile and have greater risk of default than higher-quality bonds. Leverage can increase market exposure and magnify investment risks.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

© 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee Fidelity funds are available without paying a trading fee to Fidelity or a sales load to the fund. However, the fund may charge a short-term trading or redemption fee to protect the interests of long-term shareholders of the fund. Shares are subject to the fund's management and operating expenses. See Expenses & Fees for more information.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. There is no minimum for additional investments in any type of Fidelity fund you already own.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
8. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
9. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
10. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
11. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
12. Credit ratings for a rated issuer or security are categorized using the highest credit rating among the following three Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ("NRSRO"): Moody's Investors Service (Moody's); Standard & Poor's Rating Services (S&P); or Fitch, Inc.  Securities that are not rated by any of these three NRSRO's (e.g. equity securities, if held) are categorized as Not Rated.  All U.S. government securities are included in the U.S. Government category. The table information is based on the combined investments of the fund and its pro rata share of any investments in other Fidelity funds.
13. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
14. Fixed Income StyleMap® StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
15. Fidelity may deduct a small balance maintenance fee of $12.00 from a fund balance with a value less than $2,000.  Fund positions opened after September 30 will not be subject to the fee for that calendar year.  This fee will not be deducted from fund positions opened after January 1 of that calendar year if those positions use regular investment plans.  Refer to the fund prospectus for details.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

	If the funds record votes by telephone or through the internet, they will use procedures designed to authenticate
	shareholders' identities, to allow shareholders to authorize the voting of their shares in accordance with their instructions,
	and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. Proxies voted by telephone or through the internet
	may be revoked at any time before they are voted in the same manner that proxies voted by mail may be revoked.


	The expenses in connection with preparing this Proxy Statement and its enclosures and all solicitations will be paid by
	each class of each fund,


	provided the expenses do not exceed Advisor Asset Manager 20%'s, Advisor Asset Manager

	The funds will reimburse brokerage firms and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation material
	to the beneficial owners of shares. The costs are allocated among the funds based upon the number of shareholder

	The costs are allocated on a pro rata basis to each class of a fund based on the net assets of each
	class relative to the total net assets of the fund.

	If the enclosed proxy is executed and returned, or an internet or telephonic vote is delivered, that vote may
	nevertheless be revoked at any time prior to its use by written notification received by the trust, by the execution of a
	later-dated proxy, by the trust's receipt of a subsequent valid internet or telephonic vote, or by attending the Meeting and
	voting in person.


	All proxies solicited by the Board of Trustees that are properly executed and received by the Secretary prior to the
	Meeting, and are not revoked, will be voted at the Meeting. Shares represented by such proxies will be voted in
	accordance with the instructions thereon. If no specification is made on a properly executed proxy, it will be voted FOR the
	matters specified on the proxy. All shares that are voted and votes to ABSTAIN will be counted towards establishing a
	quorum, as will broker non-votes. (Broker non-votes are shares for which (i) the beneficial owner has not voted and
	(ii) the broker holding the shares does not have discretionary authority to vote on the particular matter.)


	With respect to fund shares held in Fidelity individual retirement accounts (including Traditional, Rollover, SEP,
	SARSEP, Roth and SIMPLE IRAs), the IRA Custodian will vote those shares for which it has received instructions from
	shareholders only in accordance with such instructions. If Fidelity IRA shareholders do not vote their shares, the IRA
	Custodian will vote their shares for them, in the same proportion as other Fidelity IRA shareholders have voted.


	If a quorum is not present at the Meeting, or if a quorum is present at the Meeting but sufficient votes to approve one or
	more of the proposed items are not received, or if other matters arise requiring shareholder attention, the persons named as
	proxy agents may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. Any such
	adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares present at the Meeting or represented by proxy.
	When voting on a proposed adjournment, the persons named as proxy agents will vote FOR the proposed adjournment all
	shares that they are entitled to vote with respect to each item, unless directed to vote AGAINST an item, in which case such
	shares will be voted AGAINST the proposed adjournment with respect to that item. A shareholder vote may be taken on one
	or more of the items in this Proxy Statement prior to such adjournment if sufficient votes have been received and it is
	otherwise appropriate. Please visit www.fidelity.com/proxies to determine the status of this scheduled Meeting.

	<R>

	VOTE REQUIRED: Approval of Proposal 1


	requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of the entire
	trust voted in person or by proxy at the Meeting, and a plurality of such shares is sufficient to elect trustees pursuant to
	Proposal 2.


	With respect to each Proposal, votes to ABSTAIN and broker non-votes, if applicable, will have the same
	effect as votes cast AGAINST the Proposal.

	</R>



	1. TO AMEND THE DECLARATION OF TRUST TO REDUCE THE REQUIRED QUORUM FOR SHAREHOLDER
	MEETINGS.



	The funds' Declaration of Trust currently provides that a majority of the shares entitled to vote shall be a quorum for
	the transaction of business at a shareholders' meeting. As amended, the Declaration of Trust (Article VIII, Section 3)
	would reduce the quorum required to one-third of the shares entitled to vote.


	Lowering the quorum requirement will facilitate holding shareholder meetings to approve important matters
	necessary for the conduct of the trust's business, such as the election of Trustees. When not enough shareholders vote,
	the trust may be forced to adjourn meetings multiple times and incur the expense of additional shareholder solicitations
	and proxy solicitors in order to obtain the shareholder vote necessary to hold a meeting. The reduced quorum
	requirement is not prohibited by Massachusetts or federal law.


	Although the lower quorum requirement will allow for the approval of some matters by shareholders constituting less than
	a majority of the outstanding shares, certain other proposals will still require a higher number of shares to be voted to meet the
	threshold required to approve the proposal. For example, the 1940 Act requires that certain items, such as management
	contracts and 12b-1 plans, be approved by a majority of a fund's outstanding voting securities. Under the 1940 Act, the vote of
	a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" means the affirmative vote of the lesser of (a) 67% or more of the voting
	securities present at a shareholder meeting or represented by proxy if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting
	securities are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities. The reduced quorum
	requirement will not affect such matters.


	Shareholders have the right to vote on any Declaration of Trust amendment affecting their right to vote or on any matter
	submitted to the shareholders by the Trustees. On May 17, 2007, the Trustees approved the proposed amendment and also
	authorized its submission to the trust's shareholders for their approval at this Meeting.


	If approved, Article VIII, Section 3 of the Declaration of Trust will be amended as follows (new language is underlined;
	language to be deleted is [bracketed]):



	ARTICLE VIII

	SHAREHOLDERS' VOTING POWERS AND MEETINGS



	QUORUM AND REQUIRED VOTE



	Section 3.


	Except when a higher quorum is required by any provision of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws,
	one-third

	[A majority] of Shares entitled to vote in person or by proxy shall be a quorum for the transaction of business at a
	Shareholders' meeting, except that where any provision of law or of this Declaration of Trust permits or requires that holders
	of any Series or Class shall vote as a Series or Class then

	one-third

	[a majority] of the aggregate number of Shares of that
	Series or Class entitled to vote shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by that Series or
	Class. Any lesser number shall be sufficient for adjournments. Any adjourned session or sessions may be held, within a
	reasonable time after the date set for the original meeting, without the necessity of further notice. Except when a larger vote is
	required by applicable law or by any provision of this Declaration of Trust or the Bylaws, if any, a majority of the Shares voted in
	person or by proxy shall decide any questions and a plurality shall elect a Trustee, provided that where any provision of law or
	of this Declaration of Trust permits or requires that the holders of any Series or Class shall vote as a Series or Class, then a
	majority of the Shares of that Series or Class voted on the matter shall decide that matter insofar as that Series or Class is
	concerned. Shareholders may act by unanimous written consent. Actions taken by a Series or Class may be consented to
	unanimously in writing by Shareholders of that Series or Class.



	Conclusion.

	The Board of Trustees has concluded that the proposal will benefit the trust and its shareholders. The
	Trustees recommend voting FOR the proposal. The amended Declaration of Trust will become effective upon shareholder
	approval. If the proposal is not approved by shareholders of the trust, Article VIII, Section 3 of the Declaration of Trust will
	remain unchanged.



	2. TO ELECT A BOARD OF TRUSTEES.



	The purpose of this proposal is to elect a Board of Trustees of the trust. Pursuant to the provisions of the Declaration of
	Trust of the trust, the Trustees have determined that the number of Trustees shall be fixed at 11. It is intended that the enclosed
	proxy will be voted for the nominees listed below unless such authority has been withheld in the proxy. A nominee shall be
	elected immediately upon shareholder approval, unless he or she is proposed to begin service at a later date.

	capacity continuously since originally elected or appointed.

	Messrs. Gamper, Keyes, and Wolfe as nominees. Another executive officer of FMR recommended Mr. Curvey as a
	nominee.</R>


	Except for Mr. Curvey, each of the nominees oversees 353 funds advised by FMR or an affiliate. Mr. Curvey is currently a
	Trustee overseeing 314 funds advised by FMR or an affiliate. Mr. Curvey is currently a Member of the Advisory Board of 39
	funds advised by FMR or an affiliate, including the funds in this proxy statement. Mr. Curvey is currently a first-time nominee
	for Trustee for 9


	funds advised by FMR or an affiliate.


	In the election of Trustees, those nominees receiving the highest number of votes cast at the Meeting, provided a
	quorum is present, shall be elected.

	STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE FUNDS' TRUSTEES



	Correspondence intended for each Independent Trustee may be sent to the attention of the individual Trustee or to the
	Board of Trustees at Fidelity Investments, P.O. Box 55235, Boston, Massachusetts 02205-5235. Correspondence
	intended for each Interested Trustee may be sent to the attention of the individual Trustee or to the Board of Trustees at
	Fidelity Investments, 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02109. The current process for collecting and
	organizing shareholder communications requires that the Board of Trustees receive copies of all communications
	addressed to it. All communications addressed to the Board of Trustees or any individual Trustee are logged and sent to
	the Board or individual Trustee. The fund does not hold annual meetings and therefore does not have a policy with regard
	to Trustees' attendance at such meetings. However, as a matter of practice, at least one Trustee attends special meetings.


	The Board of Trustees has established various committees to support the Independent Trustees in acting independently
	in pursuing the best interests of the Fidelity funds and their shareholders. The committees facilitate the timely and efficient
	consideration of all matters of importance to Independent Trustees, each fund, and fund shareholders and to facilitate
	compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Currently, the Board of Trustees has 12 standing committees. The
	members of each committee are Independent Trustees.


	The Operations Committee is composed of all of the Independent Trustees, with Mr. Lautenbach currently serving as
	Chair. The committee normally meets monthly (except August), or more frequently as called by the Chair, and serves as a
	forum for consideration of issues of importance to, or calling for particular determinations by, the Independent Trustees.
	The committee also considers matters involving potential conflicts of interest between the funds and FMR and its affiliates
	and reviews proposed contracts and the proposed continuation of contracts between the Fidelity funds and FMR and its
	affiliates, and annually reviews and makes recommendations regarding contracts with third parties unaffiliated with FMR,
	including insurance coverage and custody agreements. The committee also monitors additional issues including the
	nature, levels and quality of services provided to shareholders, significant litigation, and the voting of proxies of portfolio
	companies. The committee also has oversight of compliance issues not specifically within the scope of any other
	committee. The committee is also responsible for definitive action on all compliance matters involving the potential for
	significant reimbursement by FMR. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006,


	the committee held 13 meetings.
	During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006,


	the committee held 12 meetings.


	The Fair Value Oversight Committee is composed of all of the Independent Trustees, with Mr. Lautenbach currently
	serving as Chair. The committee normally meets quarterly, or more frequently as called by the Chair. The Fair Value
	Oversight Committee monitors and establishes policies concerning procedures and controls regarding the valuation of fund
	investments and monitors matters of disclosure to the extent required to fulfill its statutory responsibilities. The committee
	also reviews actions taken by FMR's Fair Value Committee. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the committee
	held four meetings. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, the committee held three meetings.


	The Board of Trustees has established three Fund Oversight Committees: the Equity Committee (composed of Messrs.
	Stavropoulos (Chair), Gamper, and Lautenbach), the Fixed-Income, International, and Special Committee (composed of
	Ms. Small (Chair), Ms. Knowles, and Mr. Dirks), and the Select and Asset Allocation Committee (composed of Dr. Heilmeier
	(Chair), Messrs. Keyes and Mr. Wolfe). Each committee normally meets in conjunction with in-person meetings of the Board
	of Trustees, or more frequently as called by the Chair of the respective committee. Each committee develops an
	understanding of and reviews the investment objectives, policies, and practices of each fund under its oversight. Each
	committee also monitors investment performance, compliance by each relevant Fidelity fund with its investment policies
	and restrictions and reviews appropriate benchmarks, competitive universes, unusual or exceptional investment matters,
	the personnel and other resources devoted to the management of each fund and all other matters bearing on each fund's
	investment results. The Fixed-Income, International, and Special Committee also receives reports required under Rule 2a-7
	of the 1940 Act and has oversight of research bearing on credit quality, investment structures and other fixed-income
	issues, and of international research. The Select and Asset Allocation Committee has oversight of FMR's equity investment
	research. Each committee will review and recommend any required action to the Board in respect of specific funds,
	including new funds, changes in fundamental and non-fundamental investment policies and restrictions, partial or full
	closing to new investors, fund mergers, fund name changes, and liquidations of funds. The members of each committee
	may organize working groups to make recommendations concerning issues related to funds that are within the scope of the
	committee's review. These working groups report to the committee or to the Independent Trustees, or both, as appropriate.
	Each working group may request from FMR such information from FMR as may be appropriate to the working group's
	deliberations. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the Equity Committee held 11 meetings, the Fixed-Income,
	International, and Special Committee held 12 meetings, and the Select and Asset Allocation Committee held 11 meetings.
	During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, the Equity Committee held 10 meetings, the Fixed-Income, International, and
	Special Committee held 11 meetings, and the Select and Asset Allocation Committee held 10 meetings.


	The Board of Trustees has established two Fund Contract Committees: the Equity Contract Committee (composed of
	Messrs. Stavropoulos (Chair), Gamper, and Lautenbach, Dr. Heilmeir, and Ms. Small) and the Fixed-Income Contract
	Committee (composed of Ms. Small (Chair), Mr. Dirks, and Ms. Knowles). Each committee will ordinarily meet as needed to
	consider matters related to the renewal of fund investment advisory agreements. The committees will assist the
	Independent Trustees in their consideration of investment advisory agreements of each fund. Each committee receives
	information on and makes recommendations concerning the approval of investment advisory agreements between the
	Fidelity funds and FMR and its affiliates and any non-FMR affiliate that serves as a sub-adviser to a Fidelity fund (collectively,
	"investment advisers") and the annual review of these contracts. The Fixed-Income Contract Committee will be responsible
	for investment advisory agreements of the fixed-income funds. The Equity Contract Committee will be responsible for the
	investment advisory agreements of all other funds. With respect to each fund under its purview, each committee: requests
	and receives information on the nature, extent, and quality of services provided to the shareholders of the Fidelity funds by
	the investment advisers and their respective affiliates, fund performance, the investment performance of the investment
	adviser, and such other information as the committee determines to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the
	investment advisory agreements; considers the cost of the services to be provided and the profitability and other benefits
	that the investment advisers and their respective affiliates derive or will derive from their contractual arrangements with each
	of the funds (including tangible and intangible "fall-out benefits"); considers the extent to which economies of scale would
	be realized as the funds grow and whether fee levels reflect those economies of scale for the benefit of fund investors;
	considers methodologies for determining the extent to which the funds benefit from economies of scale and refinements to
	these methodologies; considers information comparing the services to be rendered and the amount to be paid under the
	funds' contracts with those under other investment advisory contracts entered into with FMR and its affiliates and other
	investment advisers, such as contracts with other registered investment companies or other types of clients; considers such
	other matters and information as may be necessary and appropriate to evaluate investment advisory agreements of the
	funds; and makes recommendations to the Board concerning the approval or renewal of investment advisory agreements.
	Each committee will consult with the other committees of the Board of Trustees, and in particular with the Audit Committee
	and the applicable Fund Oversight Committees, in carrying out its responsibilities. Each committee's responsibilities are
	guided by Sections 15(c) and 36(b) of the 1940 Act. While each committee consists solely of Independent Trustees, its
	meetings may, depending upon the subject matter, be attended by one or more senior members of FMR's management or
	representatives of a sub-adviser not affiliated with FMR. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and October 31,
	2006, each Fund Contract Committee held four meetings.


	The Shareholder, Distribution and Brokerage Committee is composed of Messrs. Dirks (Chair), Gamper, and
	Stavropoulos, and Ms. Small. The committee normally meets monthly (except August), or more frequently as called by
	the Chair. Regarding shareholder services, the committee considers the structure and amount of the Fidelity funds'
	transfer agency fees and fees, including direct fees to investors (other than sales loads), such as bookkeeping and
	custodial fees, and the nature and quality of services rendered by FMR and its affiliates or third parties (such as
	custodians) in consideration of these fees. The committee also considers other non-investment management services
	rendered to the Fidelity funds by FMR and its affiliates, including pricing and bookkeeping services. Regarding brokerage,
	the committee monitors and recommends policies concerning the securities transactions of the Fidelity funds. The
	committee periodically reviews the policies and practices with respect to efforts to achieve best execution, commissions
	paid to firms supplying research and brokerage services or paying fund expenses, and policies and procedures designed
	to assure that any allocation of portfolio transactions is not influenced by the sale of Fidelity fund shares. The committee
	also monitors brokerage and other similar relationships between the Fidelity funds and firms affiliated with FMR that
	participate in the execution of securities transactions. Regarding the distribution of fund shares, the committee considers
	issues bearing on the various distribution channels employed by the Fidelity funds, including issues regarding Rule 18f-3
	plans and related consideration of classes of shares, sales load structures (including breakpoints), load waivers, selling
	concessions, and service charges paid to intermediaries, Rule 12b-1 plans, contingent deferred sales charges, and
	finders' fees, and other means by which intermediaries are compensated for selling fund


	shares or providing shareholder
	servicing, including revenue sharing. The committee also considers issues bearing on the preparation and use of
	advertisements and sales literature for the Fidelity funds, policies and procedures regarding frequent purchase of Fidelity
	fund shares, and selective disclosure of portfolio holdings. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and
	October 31, 2006,


	the Shareholder, Distribution and Brokerage Committee held 12 meetings.


	The Audit Committee is composed of Ms. Knowles (Chair), Dr. Heilmeier, and Messrs. Keyes and Wolfe. All committee
	members must be able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company's balance sheet,
	income statement, and cash flow statement. At least one committee member will be an "audit committee financial expert"
	as defined by the SEC. The committee will have at least one committee member in common with the Compliance
	Committee. The committee normally meets monthly (except August), or more frequently as called by the Chair. The
	committee meets separately at least four times a year with the Fidelity funds' Treasurer, with personnel responsible for the
	internal audit function of FMR Corp., and with the Fidelity funds' outside auditors. The committee has direct responsibility
	for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of the outside auditors employed by the Fidelity funds. The
	committee assists the Trustees in overseeing and monitoring: (i) the systems of internal accounting and financial controls
	of the Fidelity funds and the funds' service providers, (ii) the financial reporting processes of the Fidelity funds, (iii) the
	independence, objectivity, and qualification of the auditors to the Fidelity funds, (iv) the annual audits of the Fidelity funds'
	financial statements, and (v) the accounting policies and disclosures of the Fidelity funds. The committee considers and
	acts upon (i) the provision by any outside auditor of any non-audit services for any Fidelity fund, and (ii) the provision by
	any outside auditor of certain non-audit services to Fidelity fund service providers and their affiliates to the extent that
	such approval (in the case of this clause (ii)) is required under applicable regulations of the SEC. In furtherance of the
	foregoing, the committee has adopted (and may from time to time amend or supplement) and provides oversight of
	policies and procedures for non-audit engagements by outside auditors of the Fidelity funds. It is responsible for
	approving all audit engagement fees and terms for the Fidelity funds, resolving disagreements between a fund and any
	outside auditor regarding any fund's financial reporting, and has sole authority to hire and fire any auditor. Auditors of the
	funds report directly to the committee. The committee will obtain assurance of independence and objectivity from the
	outside auditors, including a formal written statement delineating all relationships between the auditor and the Fidelity
	funds and any service providers consistent with Independent Standards Board Standard No. 1. The committee will receive
	reports of compliance with provisions of the Auditor Independence Regulations relating to the hiring of employees or
	former employees of the outside auditors. It oversees and receives reports on the Fidelity funds' service providers'
	internal controls and reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the service providers' accounting and financial controls,
	including: (i) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
	financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Fidelity funds' ability to record, process, summarize,
	and report financial data; (ii) any change in the fund's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected,
	or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the fund's internal control over financial reporting; and (iii) any fraud, whether
	material or not, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Fidelity funds' or service
	providers' internal controls over financial reporting. The committee will review with counsel any legal matters that may
	have a material impact on the Fidelity funds' financial statements and any material reports or inquiries received from
	regulators or governmental agencies. These matters may also be reviewed by the Compliance Committee or the
	Operations Committee. The Chair of the Audit Committee will coordinate with the Chair of the Compliance Committee, as
	appropriate. The committee reviews at least annually a report from each outside auditor describing any material issues
	raised by the most recent internal quality control, peer review, or Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
	examination of the auditing firm and any material issues raised by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or
	professional authorities of the auditing firm and in each case any steps taken to deal with such issues. The committee will
	oversee and receive reports on the Fidelity funds' financial reporting process, will discuss with FMR, the Fidelity funds'
	Treasurer, outside auditors and, if appropriate, internal audit personnel of FMR Corp. their qualitative judgments about the
	appropriateness and acceptability of accounting principles and financial disclosure practices used or proposed for
	adoption by the Fidelity funds, and will review with FMR, the Fidelity funds' Treasurer, outside auditor, and internal auditor
	personnel of FMR Corp. (to the extent relevant) the results of audits of the Fidelity funds' financial statements. The
	committee will review periodically the Fidelity funds' major internal controls exposures and the steps that have been taken
	to monitor and control such exposures. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the committee held 15
	meetings. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, the committee held 14 meetings.




	The Governance and Nominating Committee is composed of Messrs. Lautenbach (Chair), Stavropoulos, and Wolfe. The
	committee meets as called by the Chair. A current copy of the Governance and Nominating Committee Charter With Respect to
	Nominations of Independent Trustees is available on Fidelity's website (www.fidelity.com) and is attached as Exhibit I to the
	trust's September 15, 2004 proxy statement

	.

	With respect to fund governance and board administration matters, the
	committee periodically reviews procedures of the Board of Trustees and its committees (including committee charters)
	and periodically reviews compensation of Independent Trustees. The committee monitors corporate governance matters
	and makes recommendations to the Board of Trustees on the frequency and structure of the Board of Trustee meetings
	and on any other aspect of Board procedures. It acts as the administrative committee under the retirement plan for
	Independent Trustees who retired prior to December 30, 1996 and under the fee deferral plan for Independent Trustees. It
	reviews the performance of legal counsel employed by the Fidelity funds and the Independent Trustees. On behalf of the
	Independent Trustees, the committee will make such findings and determinations as to the independence of counsel for
	the Independent Trustees as may be necessary or appropriate under applicable regulations or otherwise. The committee
	is also responsible for Board administrative matters applicable to Independent Trustees, such as expense reimbursement
	policies and compensation for attendance at meetings, conferences and other events. The committee monitors
	compliance with, acts as the administrator of, and makes determinations in respect of, the provisions of the code of ethics
	and any supplemental policies regarding personal securities transactions applicable to the Independent Trustees. The
	committee monitors the functioning of each Board committee and makes recommendations for any changes, including
	the creation or elimination of standing or ad hoc Board committees. The committee monitors regulatory and other
	developments to determine whether to recommend modifications to the committee's responsibilities or other Trustee
	policies and procedures in light of rule changes, reports concerning "best practices" in corporate governance and other
	developments in mutual fund governance. The committee meets with Independent Trustees at least once a year to discuss
	matters relating to fund governance. The committee recommends that the Board establish such special or ad hoc Board
	committees as may be desirable or necessary from time to time in order to address ethical, legal, or other matters that
	may arise. The committee also oversees the annual self-evaluation of the Board of Trustees and establishes procedures to
	allow it to exercise this oversight function. In conducting this oversight, the committee shall address all matters that it
	considers relevant to the performance of the Board of Trustees and shall report the results of its evaluation to the Board of
	Trustees, including any recommended amendments to the principles of governance, and any recommended changes to
	the Fidelity funds' or the Board of Trustees' policies, procedures, and structures. The committee reviews periodically the
	size and composition of the Board of Trustees as a whole and recommends, if necessary, measures to be taken so that the
	Board of Trustees reflects the appropriate balance of knowledge, experience, skills, expertise, and diversity required for
	the Board as a whole and contains at least the minimum number of Independent Trustees required by law. The committee
	makes nominations for the election or appointment of Independent Trustees and non-management Members of any
	Advisory Board, and for membership on committees. The committee shall have authority to retain and terminate any
	third-party advisers, including authority to approve fees and other retention terms. Such advisers may include search
	firms to identify Independent Trustee candidates and board compensation consultants. The committee recently retained a
	third-party search firm, which received a fee to compile a list of candidates based upon criteria established by the
	Independent Trustees. The committee may conduct or authorize investigations into or studies of matters within the
	committee's scope of responsibilities, and may retain, at the Fidelity funds' expense, such independent counsel or other
	advisers as it deems necessary. The committee will consider nominees to the Board of Trustees recommended by
	shareholders based upon the criteria applied to candidates presented to the committee by a search firm or other source.
	Recommendations, along with appropriate background material concerning the candidate that demonstrates his or her
	ability to serve as an Independent Trustee of the Fidelity funds, should be submitted to the Chair of the committee at the
	address maintained for communications with Independent Trustees. If the committee retains a search firm, the Chair will
	generally forward all such submissions to the search firm for evaluation. With respect to the criteria for selecting
	Independent Trustees, it is expected that all candidates will possess the following minimum qualifications: (i)
	unquestioned personal integrity; (ii) not an interested person of FMR or its affiliates within the meaning of the 1940 Act;
	(iii) does not have a material relationship (e.g., commercial, banking, consulting, legal, or accounting) that could create
	an appearance of lack of independence in respect of FMR and its affiliates; (iv) has the disposition to act independently in
	respect of FMR and its affiliates and others in order to protect the interests of the funds and all shareholders; (v) ability to
	attend 11 meetings per year; (vi) demonstrates sound business judgment gained through broad experience in significant
	positions where the candidate has dealt with management, technical, financial, or regulatory issues; (vii) sufficient
	financial or accounting knowledge to add value in the complex financial environment of the Fidelity funds; (viii) experience
	on corporate or other institutional oversight bodies having similar responsibilities, but which board memberships or
	other relationships could not result in business or regulatory conflicts with the funds; and (ix) capacity for the hard work
	and attention to detail that is required to be an effective Independent Trustee in light of the Fidelity funds' complex
	regulatory, operational, and marketing setting. The Governance and Nominating Committee may determine that a
	candidate who does not have the type of previous experience or knowledge referred to above should nevertheless be
	considered as a nominee if the Governance and Nominating Committee finds that the candidate has additional
	qualifications such that his or her qualifications, taken as a whole, demonstrate the same level of fitness to serve as an
	Independent Trustee. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the committee held 11 meetings. During the fiscal
	year ended October 31, 2006, the committee held 10 meetings.


	The Board of Trustees established the Compliance Committee (composed of Ms. Small (Chair), Ms. Knowles, and
	Messrs. Stavropoulos and Wolfe) in May 2005. The committee normally meets quarterly, or more frequently as called by the
	Chair. The committee oversees the administration and operation of the compliance policies and procedures of the Fidelity
	funds and their service providers as required by Rule 38a-1 of the 1940 Act. The committee is responsible for the review and
	approval of policies and procedures relating to (i) provisions of the Code of Ethics, (ii) anti-money laundering requirements,
	(iii) compliance with investment restrictions and limitations, (iv) privacy, (v) recordkeeping, and (vi) other compliance
	policies and procedures which are not otherwise delegated to another committee. The committee has responsibility for
	recommending to the Board the designation of a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) of the Fidelity funds. The committee serves
	as the primary point of contact between the CCO and the Board, it oversees the annual performance review and
	compensation of the CCO, and if required, makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the removal of the
	appointed CCO. The committee receives reports of significant correspondence with regulators or governmental agencies,
	employee complaints or published reports which raise concerns regarding compliance matters, and copies of significant
	non-routine correspondence with the SEC. The committee receives reports from the CCO including the annual report
	concerning the funds' compliance policies as required by Rule 38a-1, quarterly reports in respect of any breaches of
	fiduciary duty or violations of federal securities laws, and reports on any other compliance or related matters that may have
	a significant impact on the funds. The committee will recommend to the Board what actions, if any, should be taken with
	respect to such reports. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the committee held 22 meetings. During the
	fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, the committee held 21 meetings.


	The Proxy Voting Committee is composed of Messrs. Gamper (Chair), Dirks, and


	Keyes. The committee will meet as
	needed to review the fund's proxy voting policies, consider changes to the policies, and review the manner in which the
	policies have been applied. The committee will receive reports on the manner in which proxy votes have been cast under
	the proxy voting policies and reports on consultations between the fund's investment advisers and portfolio companies
	concerning matters presented to shareholders for approval. The committee will address issues relating to the fund's
	annual voting report filed with the SEC. The committee will receive reports concerning the implementation of procedures
	and controls designed to ensure that the proxy voting policies are implemented in accordance with their terms. The
	committee will consider FMR's recommendations concerning certain non-routine proposals not covered by the proxy
	voting policies. The committee will receive reports with respect to steps taken by FMR to assure that proxy voting has
	been done without regard to any other FMR relationships, business or otherwise, with that portfolio company. The
	committee will make recommendations to the Board concerning the casting of proxy votes in circumstances where FMR
	has determined that, because of a conflict of interest, the proposal to be voted on should be reviewed by the Board. The
	Board of Trustees established the Proxy Voting Committee in January 2006. During the fiscal years ended September 30,
	2006 and October 31, 2006, the committee held two meetings.



	INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS



	The firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) has been selected as the independent registered public accounting
	firm for Fidelity Advisor Asset Manager 70% and Fidelity Global Balanced Fund. The firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the
	member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and their respective affiliates (collectively, "Deloitte Entities"), has been
	selected as the independent registered public accounting firm for Fidelity Asset Manager 20%, Fidelity Asset Manager
	50%, Fidelity Asset Manager 70%, and Fidelity Asset Manager 85%. PwC and Deloitte Entities, in accordance with
	Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (ISB No.1), have confirmed to the trust's Audit Committee that they are
	the independent registered public accounting firms with respect to the funds.


	The independent registered public accounting firm examines annual financial statements for the funds and provides
	other audit-related, non-audit, and tax-related services to the funds. Representatives of PwC and Deloitte Entities


	are not
	expected to be present at the Meeting, but have been given the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be
	available should any matter arise requiring their presence.


	The trust's Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent
	registered public accounting firms relating to the operations or financial reporting of Fidelity Asset Manager 20%, Fidelity
	Asset Manager 50%, Fidelity Asset Manager 70%, Fidelity Asset Manager 85%, Fidelity Advisor Asset Manager 70%, and
	Fidelity Global Balanced Fund. Prior to the commencement of any audit or non-audit services to a fund, the Audit
	Committee reviews the services to determine whether they are appropriate and permissible under applicable law.


	The trust's Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures to, among other purposes, provide a framework for
	the Audit Committee's consideration of non-audit services by the audit firms that audit the Fidelity funds. The policies and
	procedures require that any non-audit service provided by a fund audit firm to a Fidelity fund and any non-audit service
	provided by a fund auditor to FMR and entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with FMR (not
	including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
	another investment adviser) that provide ongoing services to the funds ("Fund Service Providers") that relates directly to
	the operations and financial reporting of a Fidelity fund (Covered Service) are subject to approval by the Audit Committee
	before such service is provided. Non-audit services provided by a fund audit firm for a Fund Service Provider that do not
	relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of a Fidelity fund (Non-Covered Service)


	but that are expected to
	exceed $50,000 are also subject to pre-approval by the Audit Committee.


	All Covered Services, as well as Non-Covered Services that are expected to exceed $50,000, must be approved in
	advance of provision of the service either: (i) by formal resolution of the Audit Committee, or (ii) by oral or written approval
	of the service by the Chair of the Audit Committee (or if the Chair is unavailable, such other member of the Audit Committee
	as may be designated by the Chair to act in the Chair's absence). The approval contemplated by (ii) above is permitted where
	the Treasurer determines that action on such an engagement is necessary before the next meeting of the Audit Committee.
	Neither pre-approval nor advance notice of Non-Covered Service engagements for which fees are not expected to exceed
	$50,000 is required; such engagements are to be reported to the Audit Committee monthly.


	The trust's Audit Committee has considered Non-Covered Services that were not pre-approved that were provided by
	PwC and Deloitte Entities to Fund Service Providers to be compatible with maintaining the independence of PwC and
	Deloitte Entities in their audit of the funds, taking into account representations from PwC and Deloitte Entities, in
	accordance with ISB No.1, regarding their independence from the funds and their related entities.



	Audit Fees.

	and for the ten month period ended September 30,

	aggregate Audit Fees billed by PwC and Deloitte Entities for professional services rendered for the audits of the financial
