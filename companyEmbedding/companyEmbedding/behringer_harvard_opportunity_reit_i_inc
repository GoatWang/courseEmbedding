ADDISON, Texas, Dec. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Behringer announced today that the board of directors of Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT II, Inc. has authorized a $38.4 million, or $1.50 per share, special cash distribution. The special cash distribution is payable on January 5, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2015.
"Once again, we are very pleased to announce this special cash distribution and we intend to make additional special distributions as the company's assets are fully cycled," said Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT II Chairman, Bob Aisner.

Therefore, the ESV will be adjusted to $7.69 on the December 31, 2015 record date. Since inception through the payment date, the company will have paid to shareholders an aggregate of $120.4 million in regular and special distributions.
Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT II holds interests in six multifamily/student housing investments, one office investment, one hospitality investment, and one mezzanine loan.

Behringer Harvard client wants answers after seeing fund drop by 96%
Fires off letter to Finra over real estate losses

      It's more bad news for Behringer Harvard Holdings LLC, as an investor who saw the value of her real estate fund drop to $2,000, from an original investment of $50,000, has begun to complain to regulators. On Friday, D. Gayle Salyer fired a letter to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. to complain about the real estate firm, which has seen the estimated valuations of some its real estate investment trusts and funds slashed recently. “What is going on with the Behringer Harvard Short-Term Opportunity Fund?” Ms. Salyer wrote. “In a six-year period, BH has blown away $48,000 of my money. I would like to know how much of my money has been taken by Mr. Behringer as salary, benefits and expenses, as well as the management team.”
				



At the end of December, investors in the Behringer Harvard Short-Term Opportunity Fund I LP, which had about $130 million in total assets, saw its valuation drop to 40 cents a share, down drastically from $6.48 a share Dec. 31, 2010. In an interview, Ms. Salyer, 70, said she had not filed an arbitration complaint against her broker, Dennis Freeman, who is affiliated with Capital Financial Services Inc. She also said she wrote the letter to Finra with the assistance of Mr. Freeman, who said that she also sent a letter to the Texas State Securities Board. Behringer Harvard is based in Addison, Texas.  Particularly distressing is the lack of direct communication from Behringer Harvard explaining what happened to wipe almost all of the fund's value, said Ms. Salyer, who also lost $32,000 of a $50,000 investment in Provident Royalties LLC, a series of private placements that the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2009 charged with fraud. Behringer Harvard “keeps sending me stuff that shows my money is gone,” she said. “The only communication is the [account] statement. They sent nothing to say we're in trouble. Nothing.” The Securities and Exchange Commission has jurisdiction over funds and REITs, while Finra has jurisdiction over broker-dealers that sell those products, industry observers noted. Finra has recently drawn attention to the issue of how the valuation of illiquid investments — including non-traded REITs — are shown on client account statements. In September, Finra issued for comment a proposed amendment to the current rule, and the proposal would limit the time period that the initial, estimated value would be used on the client account statement. The rule change would also require broker-dealers to deduct costs of the offering, such as commissions to brokers, from that initial valuation. “We are looking into the areas over which we have jurisdiction, including sales to investors by broker-dealers,” said Finra spokeswoman Nancy Condon. “But we can't comment about ongoing investigations.” “Client-specific information is confidential and Behringer Harvard does not comment publicly about specific clients,” Behringer CEO Bob Aisner said in a statement. “Our investment services team is available to speak with investors and their financial representatives about specific account questions.” He noted that the Short-Term Opportunity Fund makes information public through regular reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the statement, Mr. Aisner also said: “Behringer Harvard has been very committed to the success of the fund, as evidenced by $40 million of support from Behringer Harvard which will not be recouped.” That support included waived fees and cash support from the sponsor for the fund, he wrote in the statement. “Since the inception of the fund, investors have received $2.12 per unit in total distributions, which includes both recurring monthly distributions and special distributions,” Mr. Aisner wrote. “Condominium projects and single-family lot developments, which usually depend on redevelopment, repositioning or recapitalization, were especially hard-hit, and the fund invested in these asset types before the great recession. In addition, the fund was significantly negatively impacted by the lack of availability of financing for opportunistic assets over the last several years.”Mr. Freeman, the broker, said that Capital Financial Services stopped selling Behringer Harvard products within the last year. Meanwhile, Behringer Harvard continues to see a reshuffling of its management team. This morning, it said that Michael J. O'Hanlon has joined the firm as executive vice president and that he will be the chief executive of Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT I Inc., which saw its estimated value decline to $4.12 per share at the end of last year, from $7.66 a year earlier. He will also be the CEO of Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT II. He replaces Mr. Aisner, who will be vice chairman for both those REITs. Mr. O'Hanlon has worked for several real estate investment firms, including most recently Billingsley Co. From 2005 to 2009, he was CEO of Inland Western Retail Real Estate Trust Inc., and before that, he was an executive vice president and managing director of the Midwestern region of Grubb & Ellis Co.

Behringer: Roots in Music and Engineering
With over two decades in the music retail industry, Behringer is best known for producing a wide range of musical tools at affordable prices. What is less well known is the passion for music that drives the founder, Uli Behringer. Born into a musical household, Uli learned to play piano at the age of four. By the age of 16, he had designed and built his first synthesizer keyboard (the UB-1). Later Uli would go on to study both classical piano and audio engineering, setting the foundation for his namesake company in 1989.
Products Anyone Can Afford
Being a musician and an engineer, Uli Behringer's philosophy is to provide tools any musician or engineer could afford. Behringer equipment quickly became known as a cost-effective alternative to well-known industry-standard equipment. From effects processors, equalizers, and compressors to microphone preamplifiers, direct boxes, and mixing consoles, it was clear that Behringer aimed to become a permanent player in the music retail industry. It's even arguable that the affordability and variety of Behringer products played a huge role in the hobbyist recording market as we know it today.
From Studio to Stage and Beyond
In 1996, Behringer made big waves in the audio industry with the EURODESK MX8000 mixing console, delivering features of boards costing almost twice as much. That would mark Behringer's dedication to producing live sound equipment for practically any application. Beyond mixers and speakers, Behringer would also go on to develop a wide range of feedback elimination solutions, rackmount digital processors, analog crossovers, microphones, DJ mixers, and much more. By the early 2000s, many aspiring musicians and engineers had Behringer to thank for creating gear they could afford and grow with.
Recognized by Musicians and Engineers Worldwide
In 2002, Behringer consolidated 10 separate production facilities into one single factory in China, dubbed Behringer City. Since then, they have continued to expand their product range while maintaining affordable prices. Products such as the X32 series of digital mixers, the Bugera family of tube guitar amplifiers, and the Eurolive series of powered PA speakers offer powerful yet affordable tools for musicians, live sound mixers, studio engineers and broadcast audio.
