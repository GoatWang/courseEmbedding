History[edit]
1970's[edit]
In 1971, Gerald Shreiber, a father of three at the time, was shopping for a waterbed for his daughter. Shreiber struck up a conversation with the store’s owner who was discussing his investment loss in a soft pretzel company called J&J Soft Pretzel which went bankrupt. On September 27, 1971 Shreiber attended the Camden, NJ District Court’s bankruptcy auction and purchased J&J Soft Pretzel with a bid of $72,100.[3] The company at the time had 8 employees and $400,000 of sales.[1] In 1972, a West coast office opened up in Los Angeles, CA thus opening the company up to business across the United States. A year later SUPERPRETZEL Soft Pretzel is registered as a trademark and becomes the first official brand of JJSF.[4] In 1978 JJSF sought out to expand its presence in the soft pretzel market through the acquisitions of Frampton Corp located in St. Louis, MO and Pretzel Man Corp located in Los Angeles, CA. The King sized pretzel was also introduced and began being sold in foodservice locations.[5]
1980's[edit]
In 1981, Shreiber sought new possibilities for JJSF. He found what he was looking for in a canceled supply agreement with Whimsy Stores who at the time was selling churros. JJSF acquired some product inventory as a result of this and began the foundation of the churros segment of the company starting the brand TIO PEPE’s Churros.[1] A year later, JJSF acquired exclusive rights to the AMF pretzel twister machines making the company a leader in the efficiency of soft pretzel manufacturing.[6] In 1983, the acquisition of Bachman Soft Pretzel Co. added another manufacturing plant to JJSF’s list of facilities.[5]
By 1986 JJSF extended its product line to frozen fruit juice bars with the addition of SUPER JUICE and to baked goods with the acquisition of Southern Food Products. SUPERPRETZEL enters the grocery store arena for the first time expanding JJSF’s business outside the foodservice segment.[5] As sales exceed the $25 million mark the company went public offering 600,000 shares and traded on NASDAQ as “JJSF”.[7] In the same year, Shreiber was introduced to the frozen beverage industry through a chance meeting with the, then owner of ICEE, Omar Knedlik.[1] One year later JJSF acquires ICEE-USA extending its product offering to frozen carbonated beverages.[8] Through the late 1980s JJSF continues its success through a number of acquisitions and technological development. From 1988-1989 JJSF acquired 5 more companies. Two most notably LUIGI’S Real Italian Ice and MIA Products Co.[5] The acquisition of MIA Products brought JJSF their current frozen novelty manufacturing plant. By 1989 LUIGI’S is successfully introduced to super markets and sales for the entire company reach $86 million.[9]
1990’s[edit]
In the early 1990s JJSF continues to further develop its soft pretzel line by introducing bite sized snacks. SUPERPRETZEL SOFT PRETZEL BITES are introduced to food service arenas in 1990 and a partnership with KRAFT helps add the cheese filled soft pretzel brand, SUPERPRETZEL SOFTSTIX to the grocery store shelves in 1992. Additionally, JJSF renovates their Pennsauken, NJ soft pretzel facility to a 104,000 square foot distribution center in 1993.[5] The 1990s brought in another stretch of acquisitions of JJSF further extending the company into new markets and developing its presence in its current markets. In 1994 the company acquired The Funnel Cake Factory making JJSF a dominant force in the fried desserts category.[10] The frozen beverage category was further developed with the 1992 acquisition of ARTIC BLAST and 1995 acquisition of international rights for the ICEE brand.[5] The soft pretzel category grew with the 1994 acquisition of Bavarian Soft Pretzels, Inc., the 1996 acquisitions of Pretzel Gourmet Corp and Bakers Best Snack Food Corp., and the 1997 acquisition of TEXAS TWIST Soft Pretzels.[5][10] In an effort to extend its frozen novelty category JJSF acquired Mazzone Enterprises, Inc. in 1996 and Mama Tish’s International Foods in 1997.[11] The acquisitions of MRS. GOODCOOKIE in 1998 and CAMDEN CREEK BAKERY in 1999 extended the company’s presence in the baked goods category.[12]
Among these acquisitions JJSF made its largest acquisition in 1998 of the National ICEE Corp. through the ICEE-USA subsidiary. At the time, National ICEE Corp. had about $40 million in annual sales distributing mainly to the Eastern USA. The acquisition has significantly increased the JJSF frozen beverage category’s success and it continues to be its largest acquisition to date.[10] Additionally, a year later JJSF established a long-term partnership with The Minute Maid Company. The partnership provides JJSF with exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute frozen juice products under the MINUTE MAID name.[13] This partnership opened JJSF to the development of its frozen novelty category in frozen juice and soft frozen lemonades.
2000-present day[edit]
At the turn of the century, JJSF has reached $328 million in sales.[5] From 2001 to 2003 JJSF worked to further develop its soft pretzel category with the launch of cheese filled PRETZEL FILLERS, the SUPERPRETZEL line extension of specialty cheese filled pretzel sticks SUPERPRETZEL PRETZELFILS and a more traditional tasting Gourmet Twists Topped Soft Pretzels.[14] Throughout the next decade JJSF saw a major increase in development to its in store bakery category. Due mainly from the 2001 acquisition of Uptown Bakeries, the WaWa baked goods manufacturer, the 2004 acquisition of Country Home Bakers which supply frozen dough to supermarkets, and the 2008 Jana’s IndulgenceCookies acquisition.[15][16][17] Additionally, in 2007 JJSF acquired Hom/Ade Foods Inc. and Radar, Inc. introducing Mary B’s Biscuits and Daddy Ray’s Fig and Fruit Bars to its family of baked goods brands respectively.[18][19] In 2006 JJSF acquired ICEE of Hawaii and Slush Puppie. Slush Puppie introduced JJSF to the non-carbonated beverage arena making JJSF a leader in the frozen beverage category.[20] Furthermore, JJSF extended its frozen novelty brands with the acquisition of Whole Fruit Sorbet, Fruit-a-Freeze Fruit Bars, and Dogsters Treats for Dogs in 2007.[21]
By 2010, sales for JJSF has surpassed $600 million.[5] In recent years the company has extended its churro product line with the 2010 acquisition of California Churro.[22] A licensing deal with Mondelez International gave JJSF the right to manufacture, market and distribute churros under the OREO brand name branding it as OREO Churros.[23] In 2011, the company introduced handheld sandwiches and pies to its product line with the acquisition of ConAgra Foods.[24] In 2012, JJSF acquired Kim & Scott’s Gourmet Pretzel adding “gourmet” stuffed soft pretzels to its soft pretzel product line and acquired New York Pretzel in 2013.[25][26] In 2014, JJSF acquired Philly Famous Water Ice, Inc. otherwise known as Philly Swirl.[27] This introduced the unique line of SwirlStix, Candy Spoonz, Popperz, and Fruit Dips to the JJSF frozen novelty segment. By 2014 JJSF reached $800 million sales and 25 brands.[5]
Products[1][edit]
Soft Pretzels[edit]
JJSF soft pretzels are sold under many brand names; some of which are: SUPERPRETZEL, PRETZELFILLERS, PRETZELFILS, GOURMET TWISTS, MR. TWISTER, SOFT PRETZEL BITES, SOFTSTIX, SOFT PRETZELBUNS, TEXAS TWIST, BAVARIAN BAKERY,SUPERPRETZEL BAVARIAN, NEW YORK PRETZEL, KIM & SCOTT’S GOURMET PRETZELS and SERIOUSLY TWISTED!; and, to a lesser extent, under private labels. All soft pretzels are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
Certain soft pretzels qualify under USDA regulations as the nutritional equivalent of bread for purposes of the USDA school lunch program, thereby enabling participating schools to obtain partial reimbursement of the cost of aforementioned soft pretzels from the USDA.
All of JJSF’s soft pretzels are manufactured according to a proprietary formula. The soft pretzels, ranging in size from one to ten ounces in weight, are shaped and formed by patented twister machines. These soft pretzel tying machines are automated, high-speed machines for twisting dough into the traditional pretzel shape. Additionally, some soft pretzels are extruded or shaped by hand. Soft pretzels, after processing, are primarily flash frozen in either raw or baked form and packaged for delivery.
In the Food Service segment JJSF supplies ovens, mobile merchandisers, display cases, warmers and similar merchandising equipment to the retailer to prepare and promote the sale of the soft pretzels. Some of this equipment is proprietary, including combination warmer and display cases that reconstitute frozen soft pretzels while displaying them, thus eliminating the need for an oven.
Frozen Juice Treats and Desserts[edit]
JJSF’s frozen juice treats and desserts are branded primarily under the LUIGI’S, WHOLE FRUIT, PHILLY SWIRL, ICEE and MINUTE MAID brand names. All of these products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
MINUTE MAID and WHOLE FRUIT frozen juice bars and cups for school food service contain three to four ounces of 100% apple or pineapple juice with no added sugar and 100% of the daily US FDA value of vitamin C. The juice bars are produced in various flavors and are packaged in a sealed push-up paper container referred to as the Milliken M-pak, which is believed to have certain sanitary and safety advantages.
The majority of these products are manufactured from water, sweeteners and fruit juice concentrates in various flavors and packaging including cups, tubes, sticks, M-paks and pints. Someof the products contain ice cream, while WHOLE FRUIT contains pieces of fruit.
Churros[edit]
JJSF’s churros are sold primarily under the TIO PEPE’S, CALIFORNIA CHURROS and OREO brand names. These products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarkets segments. Churros are Hispanic pastries in stick form which JJSF produces in several sizes according to a proprietary formula. The churros are deep fried, frozen and packaged. At food service point-of-sale they are reheated and topped with a cinnamon sugar mixture. Churros also come in fruit and crème-filled varieties. Similar to the soft pretzel equipment program, JJSF supplies all churro merchandising equipment to its food service customers.
Handheld Products[edit]
JJSF’s dough enrobed handheld products are marketed under the PATIO, Pillsbury, SUPREME STUFFERS and SWEET STUFFERS brand names and under private labels. The handheld products consist of an outer shell of varying dough consistencies anything from burrito shell to pastry/pie shells with a variety of fillings. Handheld products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
Bakery Products[edit]
JJSF’s bakery products can be found under the MRS. GOODCOOKIE, READI-BAKE, COUNTRYHOME, MARY B’S and DADDY RAY’S brand names, and under private labels. Bakery products include primarily biscuits, fig and fruit bars, cookies, breads, rolls, crumb, muffins and donuts. Products are sold either in raw or pre-baked/thaw and serve forms in the foodservice and retail supermarket segments.
Frozen Beverages[edit]
JJSF markets frozen beverages primarily under the names ICEE, SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Frozen beverages are sold in the Frozen Beverages segment found in foodservice and retail sectors. Similar to that of the soft pretzel and churro equipment programs, JJSF installs frozen beverage dispensers for its ICEE brand at customer locations and thereafter services the machines. JJSF supplies customers with ingredients required for production of the frozen beverages, and supports retail sales efforts with in-store promotions and point-of-sale materials. JJSF also sells frozen non-carbonated beverages under the SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE brands through a distributor network and through its own distribution network. JJSF provides managed service and/or products to approximately 111,000 Company-owned and customer-owned dispensers. JJSF also has the rights to market and distribute frozen beverages under the name ICEE to the entire continental United States (except for portions of nine states) as well as internationally.

History[edit]
1970's[edit]
In 1971, Gerald Shreiber, a father of three at the time, was shopping for a waterbed for his daughter. Shreiber struck up a conversation with the store’s owner who was discussing his investment loss in a soft pretzel company called J&J Soft Pretzel which went bankrupt. On September 27, 1971 Shreiber attended the Camden, NJ District Court’s bankruptcy auction and purchased J&J Soft Pretzel with a bid of $72,100.[3] The company at the time had 8 employees and $400,000 of sales.[1] In 1972, a West coast office opened up in Los Angeles, CA thus opening the company up to business across the United States. A year later SUPERPRETZEL Soft Pretzel is registered as a trademark and becomes the first official brand of JJSF.[4] In 1978 JJSF sought out to expand its presence in the soft pretzel market through the acquisitions of Frampton Corp located in St. Louis, MO and Pretzel Man Corp located in Los Angeles, CA. The King sized pretzel was also introduced and began being sold in foodservice locations.[5]
1980's[edit]
In 1981, Shreiber sought new possibilities for JJSF. He found what he was looking for in a canceled supply agreement with Whimsy Stores who at the time was selling churros. JJSF acquired some product inventory as a result of this and began the foundation of the churros segment of the company starting the brand TIO PEPE’s Churros.[1] A year later, JJSF acquired exclusive rights to the AMF pretzel twister machines making the company a leader in the efficiency of soft pretzel manufacturing.[6] In 1983, the acquisition of Bachman Soft Pretzel Co. added another manufacturing plant to JJSF’s list of facilities.[5]
By 1986 JJSF extended its product line to frozen fruit juice bars with the addition of SUPER JUICE and to baked goods with the acquisition of Southern Food Products. SUPERPRETZEL enters the grocery store arena for the first time expanding JJSF’s business outside the foodservice segment.[5] As sales exceed the $25 million mark the company went public offering 600,000 shares and traded on NASDAQ as “JJSF”.[7] In the same year, Shreiber was introduced to the frozen beverage industry through a chance meeting with the, then owner of ICEE, Omar Knedlik.[1] One year later JJSF acquires ICEE-USA extending its product offering to frozen carbonated beverages.[8] Through the late 1980s JJSF continues its success through a number of acquisitions and technological development. From 1988-1989 JJSF acquired 5 more companies. Two most notably LUIGI’S Real Italian Ice and MIA Products Co.[5] The acquisition of MIA Products brought JJSF their current frozen novelty manufacturing plant. By 1989 LUIGI’S is successfully introduced to super markets and sales for the entire company reach $86 million.[9]
1990’s[edit]
In the early 1990s JJSF continues to further develop its soft pretzel line by introducing bite sized snacks. SUPERPRETZEL SOFT PRETZEL BITES are introduced to food service arenas in 1990 and a partnership with KRAFT helps add the cheese filled soft pretzel brand, SUPERPRETZEL SOFTSTIX to the grocery store shelves in 1992. Additionally, JJSF renovates their Pennsauken, NJ soft pretzel facility to a 104,000 square foot distribution center in 1993.[5] The 1990s brought in another stretch of acquisitions of JJSF further extending the company into new markets and developing its presence in its current markets. In 1994 the company acquired The Funnel Cake Factory making JJSF a dominant force in the fried desserts category.[10] The frozen beverage category was further developed with the 1992 acquisition of ARTIC BLAST and 1995 acquisition of international rights for the ICEE brand.[5] The soft pretzel category grew with the 1994 acquisition of Bavarian Soft Pretzels, Inc., the 1996 acquisitions of Pretzel Gourmet Corp and Bakers Best Snack Food Corp., and the 1997 acquisition of TEXAS TWIST Soft Pretzels.[5][10] In an effort to extend its frozen novelty category JJSF acquired Mazzone Enterprises, Inc. in 1996 and Mama Tish’s International Foods in 1997.[11] The acquisitions of MRS. GOODCOOKIE in 1998 and CAMDEN CREEK BAKERY in 1999 extended the company’s presence in the baked goods category.[12]
Among these acquisitions JJSF made its largest acquisition in 1998 of the National ICEE Corp. through the ICEE-USA subsidiary. At the time, National ICEE Corp. had about $40 million in annual sales distributing mainly to the Eastern USA. The acquisition has significantly increased the JJSF frozen beverage category’s success and it continues to be its largest acquisition to date.[10] Additionally, a year later JJSF established a long-term partnership with The Minute Maid Company. The partnership provides JJSF with exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute frozen juice products under the MINUTE MAID name.[13] This partnership opened JJSF to the development of its frozen novelty category in frozen juice and soft frozen lemonades.
2000-present day[edit]
At the turn of the century, JJSF has reached $328 million in sales.[5] From 2001 to 2003 JJSF worked to further develop its soft pretzel category with the launch of cheese filled PRETZEL FILLERS, the SUPERPRETZEL line extension of specialty cheese filled pretzel sticks SUPERPRETZEL PRETZELFILS and a more traditional tasting Gourmet Twists Topped Soft Pretzels.[14] Throughout the next decade JJSF saw a major increase in development to its in store bakery category. Due mainly from the 2001 acquisition of Uptown Bakeries, the WaWa baked goods manufacturer, the 2004 acquisition of Country Home Bakers which supply frozen dough to supermarkets, and the 2008 Jana’s IndulgenceCookies acquisition.[15][16][17] Additionally, in 2007 JJSF acquired Hom/Ade Foods Inc. and Radar, Inc. introducing Mary B’s Biscuits and Daddy Ray’s Fig and Fruit Bars to its family of baked goods brands respectively.[18][19] In 2006 JJSF acquired ICEE of Hawaii and Slush Puppie. Slush Puppie introduced JJSF to the non-carbonated beverage arena making JJSF a leader in the frozen beverage category.[20] Furthermore, JJSF extended its frozen novelty brands with the acquisition of Whole Fruit Sorbet, Fruit-a-Freeze Fruit Bars, and Dogsters Treats for Dogs in 2007.[21]
By 2010, sales for JJSF has surpassed $600 million.[5] In recent years the company has extended its churro product line with the 2010 acquisition of California Churro.[22] A licensing deal with Mondelez International gave JJSF the right to manufacture, market and distribute churros under the OREO brand name branding it as OREO Churros.[23] In 2011, the company introduced handheld sandwiches and pies to its product line with the acquisition of ConAgra Foods.[24] In 2012, JJSF acquired Kim & Scott’s Gourmet Pretzel adding “gourmet” stuffed soft pretzels to its soft pretzel product line and acquired New York Pretzel in 2013.[25][26] In 2014, JJSF acquired Philly Famous Water Ice, Inc. otherwise known as Philly Swirl.[27] This introduced the unique line of SwirlStix, Candy Spoonz, Popperz, and Fruit Dips to the JJSF frozen novelty segment. By 2014 JJSF reached $800 million sales and 25 brands.[5]

History[edit]
1970's[edit]
In 1971, Gerald Shreiber, a father of three at the time, was shopping for a waterbed for his daughter. Shreiber struck up a conversation with the store’s owner who was discussing his investment loss in a soft pretzel company called J&J Soft Pretzel which went bankrupt. On September 27, 1971 Shreiber attended the Camden, NJ District Court’s bankruptcy auction and purchased J&J Soft Pretzel with a bid of $72,100.[3] The company at the time had 8 employees and $400,000 of sales.[1] In 1972, a West coast office opened up in Los Angeles, CA thus opening the company up to business across the United States. A year later SUPERPRETZEL Soft Pretzel is registered as a trademark and becomes the first official brand of JJSF.[4] In 1978 JJSF sought out to expand its presence in the soft pretzel market through the acquisitions of Frampton Corp located in St. Louis, MO and Pretzel Man Corp located in Los Angeles, CA. The King sized pretzel was also introduced and began being sold in foodservice locations.[5]
1980's[edit]
In 1981, Shreiber sought new possibilities for JJSF. He found what he was looking for in a canceled supply agreement with Whimsy Stores who at the time was selling churros. JJSF acquired some product inventory as a result of this and began the foundation of the churros segment of the company starting the brand TIO PEPE’s Churros.[1] A year later, JJSF acquired exclusive rights to the AMF pretzel twister machines making the company a leader in the efficiency of soft pretzel manufacturing.[6] In 1983, the acquisition of Bachman Soft Pretzel Co. added another manufacturing plant to JJSF’s list of facilities.[5]
By 1986 JJSF extended its product line to frozen fruit juice bars with the addition of SUPER JUICE and to baked goods with the acquisition of Southern Food Products. SUPERPRETZEL enters the grocery store arena for the first time expanding JJSF’s business outside the foodservice segment.[5] As sales exceed the $25 million mark the company went public offering 600,000 shares and traded on NASDAQ as “JJSF”.[7] In the same year, Shreiber was introduced to the frozen beverage industry through a chance meeting with the, then owner of ICEE, Omar Knedlik.[1] One year later JJSF acquires ICEE-USA extending its product offering to frozen carbonated beverages.[8] Through the late 1980s JJSF continues its success through a number of acquisitions and technological development. From 1988-1989 JJSF acquired 5 more companies. Two most notably LUIGI’S Real Italian Ice and MIA Products Co.[5] The acquisition of MIA Products brought JJSF their current frozen novelty manufacturing plant. By 1989 LUIGI’S is successfully introduced to super markets and sales for the entire company reach $86 million.[9]
1990’s[edit]
In the early 1990s JJSF continues to further develop its soft pretzel line by introducing bite sized snacks. SUPERPRETZEL SOFT PRETZEL BITES are introduced to food service arenas in 1990 and a partnership with KRAFT helps add the cheese filled soft pretzel brand, SUPERPRETZEL SOFTSTIX to the grocery store shelves in 1992. Additionally, JJSF renovates their Pennsauken, NJ soft pretzel facility to a 104,000 square foot distribution center in 1993.[5] The 1990s brought in another stretch of acquisitions of JJSF further extending the company into new markets and developing its presence in its current markets. In 1994 the company acquired The Funnel Cake Factory making JJSF a dominant force in the fried desserts category.[10] The frozen beverage category was further developed with the 1992 acquisition of ARTIC BLAST and 1995 acquisition of international rights for the ICEE brand.[5] The soft pretzel category grew with the 1994 acquisition of Bavarian Soft Pretzels, Inc., the 1996 acquisitions of Pretzel Gourmet Corp and Bakers Best Snack Food Corp., and the 1997 acquisition of TEXAS TWIST Soft Pretzels.[5][10] In an effort to extend its frozen novelty category JJSF acquired Mazzone Enterprises, Inc. in 1996 and Mama Tish’s International Foods in 1997.[11] The acquisitions of MRS. GOODCOOKIE in 1998 and CAMDEN CREEK BAKERY in 1999 extended the company’s presence in the baked goods category.[12]
Among these acquisitions JJSF made its largest acquisition in 1998 of the National ICEE Corp. through the ICEE-USA subsidiary. At the time, National ICEE Corp. had about $40 million in annual sales distributing mainly to the Eastern USA. The acquisition has significantly increased the JJSF frozen beverage category’s success and it continues to be its largest acquisition to date.[10] Additionally, a year later JJSF established a long-term partnership with The Minute Maid Company. The partnership provides JJSF with exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute frozen juice products under the MINUTE MAID name.[13] This partnership opened JJSF to the development of its frozen novelty category in frozen juice and soft frozen lemonades.
2000-present day[edit]
At the turn of the century, JJSF has reached $328 million in sales.[5] From 2001 to 2003 JJSF worked to further develop its soft pretzel category with the launch of cheese filled PRETZEL FILLERS, the SUPERPRETZEL line extension of specialty cheese filled pretzel sticks SUPERPRETZEL PRETZELFILS and a more traditional tasting Gourmet Twists Topped Soft Pretzels.[14] Throughout the next decade JJSF saw a major increase in development to its in store bakery category. Due mainly from the 2001 acquisition of Uptown Bakeries, the WaWa baked goods manufacturer, the 2004 acquisition of Country Home Bakers which supply frozen dough to supermarkets, and the 2008 Jana’s IndulgenceCookies acquisition.[15][16][17] Additionally, in 2007 JJSF acquired Hom/Ade Foods Inc. and Radar, Inc. introducing Mary B’s Biscuits and Daddy Ray’s Fig and Fruit Bars to its family of baked goods brands respectively.[18][19] In 2006 JJSF acquired ICEE of Hawaii and Slush Puppie. Slush Puppie introduced JJSF to the non-carbonated beverage arena making JJSF a leader in the frozen beverage category.[20] Furthermore, JJSF extended its frozen novelty brands with the acquisition of Whole Fruit Sorbet, Fruit-a-Freeze Fruit Bars, and Dogsters Treats for Dogs in 2007.[21]
By 2010, sales for JJSF has surpassed $600 million.[5] In recent years the company has extended its churro product line with the 2010 acquisition of California Churro.[22] A licensing deal with Mondelez International gave JJSF the right to manufacture, market and distribute churros under the OREO brand name branding it as OREO Churros.[23] In 2011, the company introduced handheld sandwiches and pies to its product line with the acquisition of ConAgra Foods.[24] In 2012, JJSF acquired Kim & Scott’s Gourmet Pretzel adding “gourmet” stuffed soft pretzels to its soft pretzel product line and acquired New York Pretzel in 2013.[25][26] In 2014, JJSF acquired Philly Famous Water Ice, Inc. otherwise known as Philly Swirl.[27] This introduced the unique line of SwirlStix, Candy Spoonz, Popperz, and Fruit Dips to the JJSF frozen novelty segment. By 2014 JJSF reached $800 million sales and 25 brands.[5]
Products[1][edit]
Soft Pretzels[edit]
JJSF soft pretzels are sold under many brand names; some of which are: SUPERPRETZEL, PRETZELFILLERS, PRETZELFILS, GOURMET TWISTS, MR. TWISTER, SOFT PRETZEL BITES, SOFTSTIX, SOFT PRETZELBUNS, TEXAS TWIST, BAVARIAN BAKERY,SUPERPRETZEL BAVARIAN, NEW YORK PRETZEL, KIM & SCOTT’S GOURMET PRETZELS and SERIOUSLY TWISTED!; and, to a lesser extent, under private labels. All soft pretzels are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
Certain soft pretzels qualify under USDA regulations as the nutritional equivalent of bread for purposes of the USDA school lunch program, thereby enabling participating schools to obtain partial reimbursement of the cost of aforementioned soft pretzels from the USDA.
All of JJSF’s soft pretzels are manufactured according to a proprietary formula. The soft pretzels, ranging in size from one to ten ounces in weight, are shaped and formed by patented twister machines. These soft pretzel tying machines are automated, high-speed machines for twisting dough into the traditional pretzel shape. Additionally, some soft pretzels are extruded or shaped by hand. Soft pretzels, after processing, are primarily flash frozen in either raw or baked form and packaged for delivery.
In the Food Service segment JJSF supplies ovens, mobile merchandisers, display cases, warmers and similar merchandising equipment to the retailer to prepare and promote the sale of the soft pretzels. Some of this equipment is proprietary, including combination warmer and display cases that reconstitute frozen soft pretzels while displaying them, thus eliminating the need for an oven.
Frozen Juice Treats and Desserts[edit]
JJSF’s frozen juice treats and desserts are branded primarily under the LUIGI’S, WHOLE FRUIT, PHILLY SWIRL, ICEE and MINUTE MAID brand names. All of these products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
MINUTE MAID and WHOLE FRUIT frozen juice bars and cups for school food service contain three to four ounces of 100% apple or pineapple juice with no added sugar and 100% of the daily US FDA value of vitamin C. The juice bars are produced in various flavors and are packaged in a sealed push-up paper container referred to as the Milliken M-pak, which is believed to have certain sanitary and safety advantages.
The majority of these products are manufactured from water, sweeteners and fruit juice concentrates in various flavors and packaging including cups, tubes, sticks, M-paks and pints. Someof the products contain ice cream, while WHOLE FRUIT contains pieces of fruit.
Churros[edit]
JJSF’s churros are sold primarily under the TIO PEPE’S, CALIFORNIA CHURROS and OREO brand names. These products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarkets segments. Churros are Hispanic pastries in stick form which JJSF produces in several sizes according to a proprietary formula. The churros are deep fried, frozen and packaged. At food service point-of-sale they are reheated and topped with a cinnamon sugar mixture. Churros also come in fruit and crème-filled varieties. Similar to the soft pretzel equipment program, JJSF supplies all churro merchandising equipment to its food service customers.
Handheld Products[edit]
JJSF’s dough enrobed handheld products are marketed under the PATIO, Pillsbury, SUPREME STUFFERS and SWEET STUFFERS brand names and under private labels. The handheld products consist of an outer shell of varying dough consistencies anything from burrito shell to pastry/pie shells with a variety of fillings. Handheld products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
Bakery Products[edit]
JJSF’s bakery products can be found under the MRS. GOODCOOKIE, READI-BAKE, COUNTRYHOME, MARY B’S and DADDY RAY’S brand names, and under private labels. Bakery products include primarily biscuits, fig and fruit bars, cookies, breads, rolls, crumb, muffins and donuts. Products are sold either in raw or pre-baked/thaw and serve forms in the foodservice and retail supermarket segments.
Frozen Beverages[edit]
JJSF markets frozen beverages primarily under the names ICEE, SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Frozen beverages are sold in the Frozen Beverages segment found in foodservice and retail sectors. Similar to that of the soft pretzel and churro equipment programs, JJSF installs frozen beverage dispensers for its ICEE brand at customer locations and thereafter services the machines. JJSF supplies customers with ingredients required for production of the frozen beverages, and supports retail sales efforts with in-store promotions and point-of-sale materials. JJSF also sells frozen non-carbonated beverages under the SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE brands through a distributor network and through its own distribution network. JJSF provides managed service and/or products to approximately 111,000 Company-owned and customer-owned dispensers. JJSF also has the rights to market and distribute frozen beverages under the name ICEE to the entire continental United States (except for portions of nine states) as well as internationally.

JJSF acquired some product inventory as a result of this and began the foundation of the churros segment of the company starting the brand TIO PEPE’s Churros.[1] A year later, JJSF acquired exclusive rights to the AMF pretzel twister machines making the company a leader in the efficiency of soft pretzel manufacturing.[6] In 1983, the acquisition of Bachman Soft Pretzel Co. added another manufacturing plant to JJSF’s list of facilities.[5]
By 1986 JJSF extended its product line to frozen fruit juice bars with the addition of SUPER JUICE and to baked goods with the acquisition of Southern Food Products. SUPERPRETZEL enters the grocery store arena for the first time expanding JJSF’s business outside the foodservice segment.[5] As sales exceed the $25 million mark the company went public offering 600,000 shares and traded on NASDAQ as “JJSF”.[7] In the same year, Shreiber was introduced to the frozen beverage industry through a chance meeting with the, then owner of ICEE, Omar Knedlik.[1] One year later JJSF acquires ICEE-USA extending its product offering to frozen carbonated beverages.[8] Through the late 1980s JJSF continues its success through a number of acquisitions and technological development. From 1988-1989 JJSF acquired 5 more companies. Two most notably LUIGI’S Real Italian Ice and MIA Products Co.[5] The acquisition of MIA Products brought JJSF their current frozen novelty manufacturing plant. By 1989 LUIGI’S is successfully introduced to super markets and sales for the entire company reach $86 million.[9]
1990’s[edit]
In the early 1990s JJSF continues to further develop its soft pretzel line by introducing bite sized snacks. SUPERPRETZEL SOFT PRETZEL BITES are introduced to food service arenas in 1990 and a partnership with KRAFT helps add the cheese filled soft pretzel brand, SUPERPRETZEL SOFTSTIX to the grocery store shelves in 1992. Additionally, JJSF renovates their Pennsauken, NJ soft pretzel facility to a 104,000 square foot distribution center in 1993.[5] The 1990s brought in another stretch of acquisitions of JJSF further extending the company into new markets and developing its presence in its current markets. In 1994 the company acquired The Funnel Cake Factory making JJSF a dominant force in the fried desserts category.[10] The frozen beverage category was further developed with the 1992 acquisition of ARTIC BLAST and 1995 acquisition of international rights for the ICEE brand.[5] The soft pretzel category grew with the 1994 acquisition of Bavarian Soft Pretzels, Inc., the 1996 acquisitions of Pretzel Gourmet Corp and Bakers Best Snack Food Corp., and the 1997 acquisition of TEXAS TWIST Soft Pretzels.[5][10] In an effort to extend its frozen novelty category JJSF acquired Mazzone Enterprises, Inc. in 1996 and Mama Tish’s International Foods in 1997.[11] The acquisitions of MRS. GOODCOOKIE in 1998 and CAMDEN CREEK BAKERY in 1999 extended the company’s presence in the baked goods category.[12]
Among these acquisitions JJSF made its largest acquisition in 1998 of the National ICEE Corp. through the ICEE-USA subsidiary. At the time, National ICEE Corp. had about $40 million in annual sales distributing mainly to the Eastern USA. The acquisition has significantly increased the JJSF frozen beverage category’s success and it continues to be its largest acquisition to date.[10] Additionally, a year later JJSF established a long-term partnership with The Minute Maid Company. The partnership provides JJSF with exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute frozen juice products under the MINUTE MAID name.[13] This partnership opened JJSF to the development of its frozen novelty category in frozen juice and soft frozen lemonades.
2000-present day[edit]
At the turn of the century, JJSF has reached $328 million in sales.[5] From 2001 to 2003 JJSF worked to further develop its soft pretzel category with the launch of cheese filled PRETZEL FILLERS, the SUPERPRETZEL line extension of specialty cheese filled pretzel sticks SUPERPRETZEL PRETZELFILS and a more traditional tasting Gourmet Twists Topped Soft Pretzels.[14] Throughout the next decade JJSF saw a major increase in development to its in store bakery category. Due mainly from the 2001 acquisition of Uptown Bakeries, the WaWa baked goods manufacturer, the 2004 acquisition of Country Home Bakers which supply frozen dough to supermarkets, and the 2008 Jana’s IndulgenceCookies acquisition.[15][16][17] Additionally, in 2007 JJSF acquired Hom/Ade Foods Inc. and Radar, Inc. introducing Mary B’s Biscuits and Daddy Ray’s Fig and Fruit Bars to its family of baked goods brands respectively.[18][19] In 2006 JJSF acquired ICEE of Hawaii and Slush Puppie. Slush Puppie introduced JJSF to the non-carbonated beverage arena making JJSF a leader in the frozen beverage category.[20] Furthermore, JJSF extended its frozen novelty brands with the acquisition of Whole Fruit Sorbet, Fruit-a-Freeze Fruit Bars, and Dogsters Treats for Dogs in 2007.[21]
By 2010, sales for JJSF has surpassed $600 million.[5] In recent years the company has extended its churro product line with the 2010 acquisition of California Churro.[22] A licensing deal with Mondelez International gave JJSF the right to manufacture, market and distribute churros under the OREO brand name branding it as OREO Churros.[23] In 2011, the company introduced handheld sandwiches and pies to its product line with the acquisition of ConAgra Foods.[24] In 2012, JJSF acquired Kim & Scott’s Gourmet Pretzel adding “gourmet” stuffed soft pretzels to its soft pretzel product line and acquired New York Pretzel in 2013.[25][26] In 2014, JJSF acquired Philly Famous Water Ice, Inc. otherwise known as Philly Swirl.[27] This introduced the unique line of SwirlStix, Candy Spoonz, Popperz, and Fruit Dips to the JJSF frozen novelty segment. By 2014 JJSF reached $800 million sales and 25 brands.[5]
Products[1][edit]
Soft Pretzels[edit]
JJSF soft pretzels are sold under many brand names; some of which are: SUPERPRETZEL, PRETZELFILLERS, PRETZELFILS, GOURMET TWISTS, MR. TWISTER, SOFT PRETZEL BITES, SOFTSTIX, SOFT PRETZELBUNS, TEXAS TWIST, BAVARIAN BAKERY,SUPERPRETZEL BAVARIAN, NEW YORK PRETZEL, KIM & SCOTT’S GOURMET PRETZELS and SERIOUSLY TWISTED!; and, to a lesser extent, under private labels. All soft pretzels are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
Certain soft pretzels qualify under USDA regulations as the nutritional equivalent of bread for purposes of the USDA school lunch program, thereby enabling participating schools to obtain partial reimbursement of the cost of aforementioned soft pretzels from the USDA.
All of JJSF’s soft pretzels are manufactured according to a proprietary formula. The soft pretzels, ranging in size from one to ten ounces in weight, are shaped and formed by patented twister machines. These soft pretzel tying machines are automated, high-speed machines for twisting dough into the traditional pretzel shape. Additionally, some soft pretzels are extruded or shaped by hand. Soft pretzels, after processing, are primarily flash frozen in either raw or baked form and packaged for delivery.
In the Food Service segment JJSF supplies ovens, mobile merchandisers, display cases, warmers and similar merchandising equipment to the retailer to prepare and promote the sale of the soft pretzels. Some of this equipment is proprietary, including combination warmer and display cases that reconstitute frozen soft pretzels while displaying them, thus eliminating the need for an oven.
Frozen Juice Treats and Desserts[edit]
JJSF’s frozen juice treats and desserts are branded primarily under the LUIGI’S, WHOLE FRUIT, PHILLY SWIRL, ICEE and MINUTE MAID brand names. All of these products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
MINUTE MAID and WHOLE FRUIT frozen juice bars and cups for school food service contain three to four ounces of 100% apple or pineapple juice with no added sugar and 100% of the daily US FDA value of vitamin C. The juice bars are produced in various flavors and are packaged in a sealed push-up paper container referred to as the Milliken M-pak, which is believed to have certain sanitary and safety advantages.
The majority of these products are manufactured from water, sweeteners and fruit juice concentrates in various flavors and packaging including cups, tubes, sticks, M-paks and pints. Someof the products contain ice cream, while WHOLE FRUIT contains pieces of fruit.
Churros[edit]
JJSF’s churros are sold primarily under the TIO PEPE’S, CALIFORNIA CHURROS and OREO brand names. These products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarkets segments. Churros are Hispanic pastries in stick form which JJSF produces in several sizes according to a proprietary formula. The churros are deep fried, frozen and packaged. At food service point-of-sale they are reheated and topped with a cinnamon sugar mixture. Churros also come in fruit and crème-filled varieties. Similar to the soft pretzel equipment program, JJSF supplies all churro merchandising equipment to its food service customers.
Handheld Products[edit]
JJSF’s dough enrobed handheld products are marketed under the PATIO, Pillsbury, SUPREME STUFFERS and SWEET STUFFERS brand names and under private labels. The handheld products consist of an outer shell of varying dough consistencies anything from burrito shell to pastry/pie shells with a variety of fillings. Handheld products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
Bakery Products[edit]
JJSF’s bakery products can be found under the MRS. GOODCOOKIE, READI-BAKE, COUNTRYHOME, MARY B’S and DADDY RAY’S brand names, and under private labels. Bakery products include primarily biscuits, fig and fruit bars, cookies, breads, rolls, crumb, muffins and donuts. Products are sold either in raw or pre-baked/thaw and serve forms in the foodservice and retail supermarket segments.
Frozen Beverages[edit]
JJSF markets frozen beverages primarily under the names ICEE, SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Frozen beverages are sold in the Frozen Beverages segment found in foodservice and retail sectors. Similar to that of the soft pretzel and churro equipment programs, JJSF installs frozen beverage dispensers for its ICEE brand at customer locations and thereafter services the machines. JJSF supplies customers with ingredients required for production of the frozen beverages, and supports retail sales efforts with in-store promotions and point-of-sale materials. JJSF also sells frozen non-carbonated beverages under the SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE brands through a distributor network and through its own distribution network. JJSF provides managed service and/or products to approximately 111,000 Company-owned and customer-owned dispensers. JJSF also has the rights to market and distribute frozen beverages under the name ICEE to the entire continental United States (except for portions of nine states) as well as internationally.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

History[edit]
1970's[edit]
In 1971, Gerald Shreiber, a father of three at the time, was shopping for a waterbed for his daughter. Shreiber struck up a conversation with the store’s owner who was discussing his investment loss in a soft pretzel company called J&J Soft Pretzel which went bankrupt. On September 27, 1971 Shreiber attended the Camden, NJ District Court’s bankruptcy auction and purchased J&J Soft Pretzel with a bid of $72,100.[3] The company at the time had 8 employees and $400,000 of sales.[1] In 1972, a West coast office opened up in Los Angeles, CA thus opening the company up to business across the United States. A year later SUPERPRETZEL Soft Pretzel is registered as a trademark and becomes the first official brand of JJSF.[4] In 1978 JJSF sought out to expand its presence in the soft pretzel market through the acquisitions of Frampton Corp located in St. Louis, MO and Pretzel Man Corp located in Los Angeles, CA. The King sized pretzel was also introduced and began being sold in foodservice locations.[5]
1980's[edit]
In 1981, Shreiber sought new possibilities for JJSF. He found what he was looking for in a canceled supply agreement with Whimsy Stores who at the time was selling churros. JJSF acquired some product inventory as a result of this and began the foundation of the churros segment of the company starting the brand TIO PEPE’s Churros.[1] A year later, JJSF acquired exclusive rights to the AMF pretzel twister machines making the company a leader in the efficiency of soft pretzel manufacturing.[6] In 1983, the acquisition of Bachman Soft Pretzel Co. added another manufacturing plant to JJSF’s list of facilities.[5]
By 1986 JJSF extended its product line to frozen fruit juice bars with the addition of SUPER JUICE and to baked goods with the acquisition of Southern Food Products. SUPERPRETZEL enters the grocery store arena for the first time expanding JJSF’s business outside the foodservice segment.[5] As sales exceed the $25 million mark the company went public offering 600,000 shares and traded on NASDAQ as “JJSF”.[7] In the same year, Shreiber was introduced to the frozen beverage industry through a chance meeting with the, then owner of ICEE, Omar Knedlik.[1] One year later JJSF acquires ICEE-USA extending its product offering to frozen carbonated beverages.[8] Through the late 1980s JJSF continues its success through a number of acquisitions and technological development. From 1988-1989 JJSF acquired 5 more companies. Two most notably LUIGI’S Real Italian Ice and MIA Products Co.[5] The acquisition of MIA Products brought JJSF their current frozen novelty manufacturing plant. By 1989 LUIGI’S is successfully introduced to super markets and sales for the entire company reach $86 million.[9]
1990’s[edit]
In the early 1990s JJSF continues to further develop its soft pretzel line by introducing bite sized snacks. SUPERPRETZEL SOFT PRETZEL BITES are introduced to food service arenas in 1990 and a partnership with KRAFT helps add the cheese filled soft pretzel brand, SUPERPRETZEL SOFTSTIX to the grocery store shelves in 1992. Additionally, JJSF renovates their Pennsauken, NJ soft pretzel facility to a 104,000 square foot distribution center in 1993.[5] The 1990s brought in another stretch of acquisitions of JJSF further extending the company into new markets and developing its presence in its current markets. In 1994 the company acquired The Funnel Cake Factory making JJSF a dominant force in the fried desserts category.[10] The frozen beverage category was further developed with the 1992 acquisition of ARTIC BLAST and 1995 acquisition of international rights for the ICEE brand.[5] The soft pretzel category grew with the 1994 acquisition of Bavarian Soft Pretzels, Inc., the 1996 acquisitions of Pretzel Gourmet Corp and Bakers Best Snack Food Corp., and the 1997 acquisition of TEXAS TWIST Soft Pretzels.[5][10] In an effort to extend its frozen novelty category JJSF acquired Mazzone Enterprises, Inc. in 1996 and Mama Tish’s International Foods in 1997.[11] The acquisitions of MRS. GOODCOOKIE in 1998 and CAMDEN CREEK BAKERY in 1999 extended the company’s presence in the baked goods category.[12]
Among these acquisitions JJSF made its largest acquisition in 1998 of the National ICEE Corp. through the ICEE-USA subsidiary. At the time, National ICEE Corp. had about $40 million in annual sales distributing mainly to the Eastern USA. The acquisition has significantly increased the JJSF frozen beverage category’s success and it continues to be its largest acquisition to date.[10] Additionally, a year later JJSF established a long-term partnership with The Minute Maid Company. The partnership provides JJSF with exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute frozen juice products under the MINUTE MAID name.[13] This partnership opened JJSF to the development of its frozen novelty category in frozen juice and soft frozen lemonades.
2000-present day[edit]
At the turn of the century, JJSF has reached $328 million in sales.[5] From 2001 to 2003 JJSF worked to further develop its soft pretzel category with the launch of cheese filled PRETZEL FILLERS, the SUPERPRETZEL line extension of specialty cheese filled pretzel sticks SUPERPRETZEL PRETZELFILS and a more traditional tasting Gourmet Twists Topped Soft Pretzels.[14] Throughout the next decade JJSF saw a major increase in development to its in store bakery category. Due mainly from the 2001 acquisition of Uptown Bakeries, the WaWa baked goods manufacturer, the 2004 acquisition of Country Home Bakers which supply frozen dough to supermarkets, and the 2008 Jana’s IndulgenceCookies acquisition.[15][16][17] Additionally, in 2007 JJSF acquired Hom/Ade Foods Inc. and Radar, Inc. introducing Mary B’s Biscuits and Daddy Ray’s Fig and Fruit Bars to its family of baked goods brands respectively.[18][19] In 2006 JJSF acquired ICEE of Hawaii and Slush Puppie. Slush Puppie introduced JJSF to the non-carbonated beverage arena making JJSF a leader in the frozen beverage category.[20] Furthermore, JJSF extended its frozen novelty brands with the acquisition of Whole Fruit Sorbet, Fruit-a-Freeze Fruit Bars, and Dogsters Treats for Dogs in 2007.[21]
By 2010, sales for JJSF has surpassed $600 million.[5] In recent years the company has extended its churro product line with the 2010 acquisition of California Churro.[22] A licensing deal with Mondelez International gave JJSF the right to manufacture, market and distribute churros under the OREO brand name branding it as OREO Churros.[23] In 2011, the company introduced handheld sandwiches and pies to its product line with the acquisition of ConAgra Foods.[24] In 2012, JJSF acquired Kim & Scott’s Gourmet Pretzel adding “gourmet” stuffed soft pretzels to its soft pretzel product line and acquired New York Pretzel in 2013.[25][26] In 2014, JJSF acquired Philly Famous Water Ice, Inc. otherwise known as Philly Swirl.[27] This introduced the unique line of SwirlStix, Candy Spoonz, Popperz, and Fruit Dips to the JJSF frozen novelty segment. By 2014 JJSF reached $800 million sales and 25 brands.[5]
Products[1][edit]
Soft Pretzels[edit]
JJSF soft pretzels are sold under many brand names; some of which are: SUPERPRETZEL, PRETZELFILLERS, PRETZELFILS, GOURMET TWISTS, MR. TWISTER, SOFT PRETZEL BITES, SOFTSTIX, SOFT PRETZELBUNS, TEXAS TWIST, BAVARIAN BAKERY,SUPERPRETZEL BAVARIAN, NEW YORK PRETZEL, KIM & SCOTT’S GOURMET PRETZELS and SERIOUSLY TWISTED!; and, to a lesser extent, under private labels. All soft pretzels are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
Certain soft pretzels qualify under USDA regulations as the nutritional equivalent of bread for purposes of the USDA school lunch program, thereby enabling participating schools to obtain partial reimbursement of the cost of aforementioned soft pretzels from the USDA.
All of JJSF’s soft pretzels are manufactured according to a proprietary formula. The soft pretzels, ranging in size from one to ten ounces in weight, are shaped and formed by patented twister machines. These soft pretzel tying machines are automated, high-speed machines for twisting dough into the traditional pretzel shape. Additionally, some soft pretzels are extruded or shaped by hand. Soft pretzels, after processing, are primarily flash frozen in either raw or baked form and packaged for delivery.
In the Food Service segment JJSF supplies ovens, mobile merchandisers, display cases, warmers and similar merchandising equipment to the retailer to prepare and promote the sale of the soft pretzels. Some of this equipment is proprietary, including combination warmer and display cases that reconstitute frozen soft pretzels while displaying them, thus eliminating the need for an oven.
Frozen Juice Treats and Desserts[edit]
JJSF’s frozen juice treats and desserts are branded primarily under the LUIGI’S, WHOLE FRUIT, PHILLY SWIRL, ICEE and MINUTE MAID brand names. All of these products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
MINUTE MAID and WHOLE FRUIT frozen juice bars and cups for school food service contain three to four ounces of 100% apple or pineapple juice with no added sugar and 100% of the daily US FDA value of vitamin C. The juice bars are produced in various flavors and are packaged in a sealed push-up paper container referred to as the Milliken M-pak, which is believed to have certain sanitary and safety advantages.
The majority of these products are manufactured from water, sweeteners and fruit juice concentrates in various flavors and packaging including cups, tubes, sticks, M-paks and pints. Someof the products contain ice cream, while WHOLE FRUIT contains pieces of fruit.
Churros[edit]
JJSF’s churros are sold primarily under the TIO PEPE’S, CALIFORNIA CHURROS and OREO brand names. These products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarkets segments. Churros are Hispanic pastries in stick form which JJSF produces in several sizes according to a proprietary formula. The churros are deep fried, frozen and packaged. At food service point-of-sale they are reheated and topped with a cinnamon sugar mixture. Churros also come in fruit and crème-filled varieties. Similar to the soft pretzel equipment program, JJSF supplies all churro merchandising equipment to its food service customers.
Handheld Products[edit]
JJSF’s dough enrobed handheld products are marketed under the PATIO, Pillsbury, SUPREME STUFFERS and SWEET STUFFERS brand names and under private labels. The handheld products consist of an outer shell of varying dough consistencies anything from burrito shell to pastry/pie shells with a variety of fillings. Handheld products are sold in the Food Service and Retail Supermarket segments.
Bakery Products[edit]
JJSF’s bakery products can be found under the MRS. GOODCOOKIE, READI-BAKE, COUNTRYHOME, MARY B’S and DADDY RAY’S brand names, and under private labels. Bakery products include primarily biscuits, fig and fruit bars, cookies, breads, rolls, crumb, muffins and donuts. Products are sold either in raw or pre-baked/thaw and serve forms in the foodservice and retail supermarket segments.
Frozen Beverages[edit]
JJSF markets frozen beverages primarily under the names ICEE, SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Frozen beverages are sold in the Frozen Beverages segment found in foodservice and retail sectors. Similar to that of the soft pretzel and churro equipment programs, JJSF installs frozen beverage dispensers for its ICEE brand at customer locations and thereafter services the machines. JJSF supplies customers with ingredients required for production of the frozen beverages, and supports retail sales efforts with in-store promotions and point-of-sale materials. JJSF also sells frozen non-carbonated beverages under the SLUSH PUPPIE and PARROT ICE brands through a distributor network and through its own distribution network. JJSF provides managed service and/or products to approximately 111,000 Company-owned and customer-owned dispensers. JJSF also has the rights to market and distribute frozen beverages under the name ICEE to the entire continental United States (except for portions of nine states) as well as internationally.

At age 30, Gerald B. Shreiber was working at a factory job to make ends meet for his young family- until a “twist” of fate changed his life forever. It all began in 1971 when he struck up a conversation with a salesman in a mattress store who told him about an auction for a failing soft pretzel company. Shreiber decided to attend the auction and ended up purchasing the assets of J&J Pretzel Co. for $72,100. He left court on September 27, 1971, as a new business owner with eight employees, decrepit baking equipment and a poor-selling product.
Following the auction, Shreiber immediately set to work coming up with creative ways to market the soft pretzel as the next big snack item. Before he knew it, the SUPERPRETZEL® Soft Pretzel was born. The rest is history. Over the course of the next four decades, he would go on to turn the weakened manufacturer with less than $400,000 in sales into a publicly traded snack food and beverage powerhouse approaching $1 billion in annual revenue.
 
Our Products
The story of J&J Snack Foods Corp. began- and continues today- with the soft pretzel. The company is the largest manufacturer of soft pretzels in the world with a wide range of delicious varieties sold under a number of recognizable brand names, including SUPERPRETZEL® Soft Pretzels, Federal Pretzel, Bavarian Bakery, Pretzel Fillers® and Kim & Scott’s® Gourmet Soft Pretzels.
Success in the soft pretzel business has also given way to the expansion of products in other sectors, such as snack foods, baked goods, frozen novelties and frozen beverages. The company’s evolving portfolio includes the iconic ICEE® and SLUSH PUPPIE frozen beverages, LUIGI’S® Real Italian Ice, MINUTE MAID frozen juice bars and ices, WHOLE FRUIT sorbet and frozen fruit bars, THE FUNNEL CAKE FACTORY funnel cakes, TIO PEPE’S CHURROS, CALIFORNIA CHURROS, OREO® Churros, Mary B’s Biscuits, Country Home Bakers, Readi-Bake Cookies and Breads and a bountiful family of other tasty treats, such as stuffed sandwiches, fruit pies, cookies, bars and biscuits.
