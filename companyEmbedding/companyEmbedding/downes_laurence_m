New Jersey Resources' CEO Testifies before U.S. Senate on Benefits of Distributed Generation


Laurence M. Downes — Chairman and CEO of New Jersey Resources Corp. and Chairman of the Distributed Power Coalition of America (DPCA) — testified at a U.S. Senate hearing addressing the impact of distributed generation on natural gas demand. 

"Few innovations offer as much promise for American consumers as distributed generation," said Mr. Downes. "The benefits of employing small, dispersed generation units throughout the electric grid include
more choices for consumers
increased reliability
improved power quality
additional capacity to support the nation's power grid
fewer harmful air emissions.

In my opinion, distributed generation has the potential to change the electric industry in much the same way as PCs changed the computer business."

Distributed generation technologies provide consumers with an alternative to traditional electric power. The equipment can be installed at a customer's home or business and electricity is produced "on-site." Since many of the distributed generation technologies use natural gas to fuel the power generation process, natural gas distribution companies have the opportunity to expand their natural gas sales.
About DCPA
The Distributed Power Coalition of America is a national group comprised of over 50 organizations dedicated to the development of a vibrant market for distributed generation and has been actively involved in both federal and state initiatives that address distributed generation technology.
Editor's Note:
It amazes me that for the past thirty years or so, large electric utility companies spent millions of dollars convincing federal, state and local governments that economy of scale was the correct way to save millions of dollars — a small number of large output generation.  Distributed generation is almost the exact opposite of this philosophy — more and more small capacity generation plants.

 Downes And Reader Hardwood Acquires Marine Coast Lumber, Moves Milling Operations To GorhamThe move allows the miller and lumber distributor to expand their delivery area and meet rising demand in the Gorham area.
 
Online PR News – 24-February-2017 – GORHAM, ME – Downes and Reader Hardwood has expanded by acquiring Maine Coast Lumber (MCL).

The newly merged businesses have reopened as Downes and Reader Hardwood at 9 Laurence Drive in Gorham, ME. Click here for NEW Location Directions.
"The location change was a strategic choice. It more than doubled the size of their largest facility, expanded our Delivery capability and service to our current customers in the area, and allowed us to bring in a larger mix and volume of hardwoods to the current Maine Coast Lumber customers," said Jim Reader, Owner and General Manager of Downes and Reader Hardwood (www.downesandreader.com)“The location change was a strategic choice.”
The company was able to retain several MCL employees from both the York and Westbrook facilities and now inventories over 5 million board feet of lumber in their combined yards in MA, PA, CT, and ME.
"We were very happy to be able to retain these MCL employees. Not only do they bring excellent skills to Downes and Reader, they are a familiar face to MCL customers who may not be as knowledgeable about our company as they were MCL," explained Reader.

The company is unique in the sheer variety of woods that they sell ranging from cabinet grade plywoods to Marine Plywood. Woods include many Northern and Appalachian species, including: Red Oak, Poplar, Cherry, and Hard and Soft Maple.
