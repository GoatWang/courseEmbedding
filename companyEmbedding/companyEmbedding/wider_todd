About


Todd and Jedd Wider founded Wider Film Projects to create documentary films that are socially and politically significant. Through strong artistry and investigative storytelling, the multiple award-winning team has a successful track record of bringing awareness to critically important issues. Their documentaries have helped spotlight social injustice, enact new legislation, promote social activism and build enormous audience power through partnerships with HBO, A&E, MSNBC, POV, BBC, and other leading networks. Their Academy Award and Emmy Award winning, and nominated films Taxi to the Dark Side, Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God, Client 9, Semper Fi: Always Faithful, King's Point and others have captured the public imagination and become unforgettable historic documents in their own right.
