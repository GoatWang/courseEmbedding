The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

PRODUCTS

 

Ruby Cannabis Sugar™  is DeepCell’s flagship brand built on Crystal Fusion technology, enabling users to accurately dose in beverages and food. Ruby is made from only high quality ingredients: certified organic cane sugar and cannabis extract.
  Ruby is truly the world’s premier Flexible Edible™ 
Premium features: only 15 calories, fat free, gluten free, and non-GMO.  Ruby is portable, discrete, and tastes great. 


Water Solubility
Ruby is soluble in liquids such as water, coffee, tea, smoothies, etc. This differentiates Ruby from other oil and butter based cannabis products that are not soluble in liquids without the addition of artificial mixing agents.


Low Flavor
Cannabis edibles traditionally have a strong flavor profile: grassy and bitter. Ruby has a subtle nutty flavor, and to some no flavor at all. Edibles made with Ruby taste like the food or drink they’re mixed with.


Shelf Stability
The infused cannabis sugar does not oxidize like raw plant material, oils, or extracts, due to its crystal form. Chlorophyll, air, light, and bacteria all oxidize cannabinoids, effect which are greatly diminished in crystal form.






Sapphire Cannabis Salt™
(COMING SOON)

Emerald Cannabis Sweetener™
(COMING SOON)

*No cannabis products are manufactured and/or distributed by DeepCell. DeepCell licensed cannabis products are manufactured and distributed by DeepCell licensees with the appropriate state license(s).
