Randy Ramlo
Thanks Randy good morning everyone and welcome to UFG Insurance fourth quarter and year end 2016 conference call. Earlier this morning we reported net income and operating income of $0.46 per diluted share. And a GAAP combined ratio of 102.6% for the fourth quarter 2016. This compares with net income and operating income of $1.21 per diluted share. And a GAAP combined ratio of 86.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
For the year 2016, net income was $1.93 per diluted share operating income $1.78 per diluted share. And our GAAP combined ratio was 100.3%. This compares to prior year net income of $3.50 per diluted share. Operating income of $3.46 per diluted share. And a GAAP combined ratio of 92%. 
Don will address the quarterly and full-year financial results in a few minutes. The full-year of 2016 were primarily impacted by two items. First, an increase in catastrophe losses as compared to 2015. 2015 was a quiet year for catastrophe losses only adding 3.8 percentage points to the combined ratio as compared to 2016, when catastrophe losses added 6.5 percentage points to the combined ratio. 
The level catastrophe losses in 2016 is within our expectations. And is normally what we would expect in a given year. Aligning closely with our 10 year historical average of 6.7 percentage points on the combined ratio. The second item impacted our 2016 results was a deterioration in our core loss ratio. A portion of this deterioration was driven by an increase of large losses which we defined as losses greater than $500,000. The large losses were primarily in our commercial automobile and commercial property lines. 
In a few moments, Mike will go over into more detail regarding these losses. And the strategies we have put in place or will be put in place to adjust this deterioration. Last year at this time, we announced a milestone of $1 billion in total revenue in the first time in Company history. Again in 2016, we achieved another milestone. Earning $1 billion in net premiums. This milestone included a 9.9 % increase in net premiums earned in 2016 as compared to 2015. 

Although we're proud of this milestone, looking ahead to 2017 and where we're in the current softening market cycle, we believe that the pace of our premium growth will slow moderately compared to the level of growth we have experienced since the beginning of 2014. As we have discussed all year, 2016 was a challenging year for our life segment. For the year 2016, we had a net income of $786,000 as compared to $3.8 million in 2015. 
As we mentioned in our third quarter call, beginning on January 1, 2017 we implemented a number of strategies to improve the profitability of the life segment. The changes are already implemented include product pricing adjustments and restructuring of our commissions. We're also looking at our current product mix and exploring opportunities to expand our product offerings in a state we currently write business. 
We believe these strategies are positive steps to approve profitability our life insurance segment. Since the second quarter of 2016, our expense ratio has been at or below 30.3 percentage points. We're satisfied with the progress we have made this year to reduce our expenses and maintain an expense ratio near 30 percentage points. We will always continue to look for efficiencies, but we believe we have achieved an acceptable operating expense level. 2016 proved to be another year of milestone and accomplishments for UFG. In addition to the premium milestone we accomplished this year we also recognized our 70th year in business our 45th year as a publicly held company and our 30th year will be listed on the NASDAQ. Which we celebrated by bring ringing the NASDAQ opening bell in April. 
Besides these milestones UFG also received several outstanding recognitions. Including being named to Forbes America's Topmost Trustworthy Financial Companies list for the third year in a row. And being selected as a top workplace by the Des Moines Register. While we're proud of the accomplishments in 2016, we're disappointed with the deterioration in our core loss ratio. In response to this, we're reviewing and working on implementing more rigorous loss control efforts, stricter underwriting guidelines, rate increases and new analytics tools. Which Mike Wilkins will now discuss in more detail. Mike? 
Michael Wilkins
Thanks Randy. Good morning everyone. As Randy indicated, one of the items impacting our results in 2016 was an increase in catastrophe losses as compared to an exceptionally low cat year in 2015. This is catastrophe losses are in line with our expectations for any given year. Adding 6.5 points to the combined ratio. Which aligns with our 10 year historical average of 6.7 of the combined ratio. The majority of this year's catastrophe losses occurred in the second and third quarters primarily due to related to weather-related events. 
The second item which was impacted our results in 2016 was a deterioration in our core loss ratio. Impacted by an increase in large losses, primarily in our commercial automobile and commercial property lines. During 2016, large losses totaled $108 million compared to $86 million in 2015. As we discussed during last quarter's call, the majority of large commercial property losses occurred in the third quarter. When we incurred five large commercial fire losses, for a total of $9.6 million. 
His spies were geographically spread out with no recurring patterns. However, we have implemented many loss control initiatives to reduce commercial fire losses. Including more emphasis on electrical systems, HVAC and other systems especially in older buildings. And buildings in unprotected area. Strict compliance loss control recommendation and expanded use of technologies such as infrared thermography. 
For commercial auto, losses continue to deteriorate in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to an increase in the severity of claims. We're currently asking for and receiving rate increases between 3% and 10% depending on the region for new business and renewal premiums. Along with implementing these rate increases, we have already implemented many loss control initiatives to reduce commercial auto losses. Including enforcement of vehicle use policies, required driver training, vehicle maintenance programs and reducing umbrella and excess limits in certain regions. 

Further loss control initiatives, including implementing predicting analytics in our underwriting process in mid-2017. For personal auto we're achieving rate increases the mid to upper single digit range and we continue to expand the use of telematics in the use of analytics. As compared to exceptional results in 2015, our loss ratio on workers' compensation deteriorated in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, our loss ratio on workers' compensations increased to 35 points over the fourth quarter of 2015. 
We attribute this change to increase in severity of claims over $100,000. Workers' compensation losses can be volatile quarter over quarter. Therefore, we will continue to monitor this line of business. During the fourth quarter, we saw an increase in competition and a further softening of the market. Which was most evident in our Midwest region. Overall, commercial lines renewal pricing for the group was flat to a slight increase. 
Pricing varied by region and size of account. Commercial auto and commercial property rate increases continue to be in the mid to upper single digits. Other casualty lines and workers' compensation rate increases are flat or slightly negative. We believe that loss cost trends are approximately 3%. Personal lines renewal pricing increase with average percentage increases in the low to mid-single digits primarily in homeowners and personal auto. 
Premium and policy retention remains strong at 84% and 82% respectively. With changes from prior quarter of approximately 1%. Our success ratio on quoted accounts was up 4% from the prior quarter remaining at an acceptable level. During the fourth quarter, property and casualty premiums written increased 4% as compared fourth quarter of 2015. 2% is attributed to new business and 4% is attributable to endorsement and audits. 
Both of these are partially offset by a 2% decline and rate and exposure changes. For the year 2016, property casually written premiums increase 9% as compared to 2015. 3% is attributable to new business and the remaining increase is due to rate changes, endorsements, audits and exposure increases. With that I will turn financial discussion over to Dawn Jaffray. 
Dawn Jaffray
Thanks Mike and good morning. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we reported consolidated net income of $12 million or $0.46 and per diluted share. Compared to $30.9 million or $1.21 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year 2016, consolidated net income was $49.9 million and $1.93 per diluted share. Compared to $89.1 million and $3.53 per diluted share in 2015. 
The decrease in net income in the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 as compared to 2015, is primarily due to an increase of in catastrophe losses and a deterioration in our core loss ratio. A portion of which was due to an increase in large losses. Previously discussed by Randy and Mike. Our shareholders equity increased 7% to $942 million at December 31, 2016 from $879 million as December 31, 2015. Book value increased $2.10 to $37.04 at December 31 2016 from $34.94 at December 31, 2015. 
The increases in shareholders' equity and book value are primarily due to net income of $49.9 million. An increase in unrealized investment gains of $5.5 million to $134 million. A change benefits and valuation of our post retirement obligations. Which contributed $23 million all partially offset by a payment of shareholders dividends of $24.6 million. On a positive note, the changes we implemented to take effect at the beginning of 2017 will result in an estimated $5 million net decrease in future expense for our postretirement benefit plan. 
Return on equity was 5.5% for 2016 compared to 10.5% for 2015. The decrease in ROE, as compared to the same quarter last year, was primarily due to combination of decrease in net income and increase in shareholders' equity. Our return on equity excluding unrealized investment gains was 6.4% for 2016. Losses and loss settlement expenses increased by $57 million. Or 45% during the fourth quarter 2016, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year 2016 losses and loss settlement expenses increased by $135 million or 25% when compared to 2015. 

Again, the primary driver of the increases in 2016 were large losses and catastrophe losses. As we discussed. Favorable reserve development for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $4.2 million compared to $16.3 million in fourth quarter 2015. The impact on net income for the fourth quarter in 2016 was $0.10 per diluted share. Compared to $0.41 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
For the 2016 year favorable reserve development totaled $31.2 million, compared to $40.4 million in 2015. The impact on net income in 2016 was $0.79 per diluted share. Compared to $1.04 per diluted share in 2015. For the fourth quarter 2016, the majority of the favorable development came from two lines. Commercial liability with $9 million unfavorable development. And personal fire with $2.3 million. The favorable development was offset by reserver strengthening in commercial auto with $6.7 million in assumed reinsurance with $2.9 million of adverse development. 
For the year 2016, the majority of favorable development came from two lines. Commercial liability with $25.4 million and workers' compensation with $12.2 million. The favorable development was offset by a reserve strengthening in commercial property lines was $6.4 million and commercial auto with $5.5 million of adverse development. The combined ratio the fourth quarter of 2016 was 102.6% and a 100.3% for the year 2016. 2016 comparatives were 86.8% for the fourth quarter and 92% for the year. Removing the impact of catastrophe losses and reserved development, our core loss ratio deteriorated 11.7 points in the fourth quarter and 4.6 points for the year. When compared with 2015. 
The primary drivers of the deterioration in the core loss ratio are an increase in large commercial property and commercial auto losses. As well as workers' compensation losses. Referring to slide nine in our slide deck, on our website, we have provided a detailed reconciliation of the impact of catastrophes and development on the combined ratio. 
Now moving to investments, consolidated net investment income was $33.4 million for the fourth quarter 2016. Or a 26% increase as compared to $26.6 million in the fourth quarter 2015. Year-to-date 2016 consolidated net investment income was $106.8 million. Which represented a 6% increase when compared to 2015. 
The increase in net investment income for the fourth quarter and full year was primarily driven by the change in value of our investments limited liability partnerships. As compared to the same period in 2015 and not due to a change in our investment philosophy. This resulted in an increase of $7.1 million and $7.5 million respectively. In investment income during the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 as compared to the same periods of 2015. With respect to capital management activity, during the fourth quarter, we declared and paid a $0.25 per share cash dividend to stockholders of record on December 1st 2016. We have paid a quarterly dividend every quarters since March 1968. Under our share repurchase program, we may purchase United Fire Common Stock from time to time on the open market or through private re-negotiated transactions. 
The amount and timing of any purchases will be at Management's discretion and will depend upon a number of factors. Including the share price, general economic and market conditions and corporate and regulatory requirements. 
During the fourth quarter, we purchased 22,923 shares of our common stock at an average price of $38.32 for total cost of $0.9 million. For the year 2016 we purchased 90,450 shares of our common stock at an average price of $41.43 with a total cost of $3.8 million. We're authorized by the Board of Directors to purchase an additional 2,938,471 shares of common stock under our share repurchase program which expires in August 2018. And with that I will now open the line for questions. Operator? 

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. 
Paul Newsome
Could you talk perhaps just a little bit more about what the results would have been if you pulled out the large losses themselves? Was are also deterioration in the underwriting if you just pull out those large losses? 
Michael Wilkins
Paul this is Mike Wilkins answer would be yes. There was deterioration if you pull out the large losses. The large losses probably if you look at that quarter deterioration made up a little over a third of the deterioration. The rest of the deterioration was just you know core deterioration. 
Paul Newsome
Any notable patterns in that core deterioration? 
Michael Wilkins
Well, I would say it was in auto and property lines that we have talked about and also work comp. The issue with work comp is the results we had in 2016 we still are pleased with. It was just 2015 was such a good year that the difference between the two led to some of the deterioration in the difference between our loss ratio numbers between the two years. 
Paul Newsome
The non-workers' comp, what's going on with that deterioration? Ex the big cat, the big losses. 
Michael Wilkins
I'm not sure I understand your question. 
Randy Ramlo
I think he's just probably this is Randy. Paul we have probably been talking about commercial auto for a while. And we all know the usual suspects mileages is up qualified drivers are difficult to find. We see a lot of evidence of distracted driving. We're going to be as we mentioned, raising rates fairly aggressively on this line. And walking away from business if we have to. The commercial auto line rates will help that for us. But that can not be the only answer. We have a lot of loss control initiatives trying to help our insured people to just to be better drivers. And then on the property, if I had to characterize anything it is probably having to do with a little bit older properties.
And then the catastrophic losses that we did have in 2016 was another area where some of those property lines came from. We had some notable activity in the Gatlinburg, Tennessee wildfires. We normally don't have a lot of exposure to wildfires as we don't write a lot of property out west. That happened in the fourth quarter. Which normally our fourth quarter is a pretty quiet cat quarter. But this time that contributed a little bit to that as well. Those are the main areas we're seeing. Commercial auto on the severity side and on the property side as well. 
Paul Newsome
Two quick ones. I think you said that I missed the cost savings from the pension change, what would that be in 2017? 
Dawn Jaffray
It will be $5 million per year. 
Paul Newsome
And then it looked like there was a very good quarter for investment income, anything that was unusual in the quarter? 
Barrie Ernst
Well, the financials were up strong in the fourth quarter and we have some large investments in the financial areas in our LLCs. This is Barrie. So I think that was the cause of most of the increase in investment income and that flows through to the investment income. 
Operator
The next question comes from Quentin McMillan of KBW. 
Quentin McMillan
I just wanted to talk about the growth initiatives that you guys have in their in the press release for 2017. You said that the growth was slow moderately. Could you give a little more color? You have grown double digits consistently over the past couple years, so obviously it's pretty impressive what is moderate mean? Are we still looking for growth and any kind of range would be helpful. 
Randy Ramlo
This is Randy. We're still looking to grow in 2017. The past, as you said, we probably been growing around 10% or a hair more. And I would say we hope to be able to grow at about half pace. So we the 4% to 6% range will be pretty satisfactory in this market cycle I think. 

Quentin McMillan
Okay great. And then you talked about the profitability initiatives in there in the life insurance operation. Previously also dividend some of the capital from the life back to the PMC. Did you do any of that this year? And would that also be part of a plan of the PMC operations are earning a little bit better than what the life are currently? 
Randy Ramlo
A we did not dividend this year Quinton. Our plans are sometime in the very new features of to continue that 
Quentin McMillan
And then I just Dawn, a numbers question. I think that you said in your remarks AOCI finished the year at $134 million. I do not have the number in the press release but that would be flat with the third quarter. Is that actually right? Because that would indicate unrealized losses in the quarter? 
Dawn Jaffray
It down slightly. 
Quentin McMillan
Okay. So there was some degree of book value hit associated with a loss in AOCI as everybody else saw obviously right? 
Dawn Jaffray
Year over year it was less. There was a significant drop in the quarter to fourth quarter. But year-over-year it was down about I believe it was $5 million. 
Quentin McMillan
Okay. Thanks very much and then just one last quick question. In terms of the commercial auto book, obviously you have talked about some the initiatives that you're taking and obviously getting a lot of price and a lot of rate is going to be a good thing that will earn in over time. But do you have an indication as to what you target the loss ratio of that book to be or qualitatively where you need it to be to make sense for you to write that? 
Michael Wilkins
Quentin, this is Mike. We will probably look at account loss ratio more than individual lines. But we expect all the lines to stand on their own as well. So we look at an overall basis by line. But an individual account, sometimes the auto pricing we can have some flexibility with. We're probably 10 points from where we'd like that line to be on a loss ratio basis. 
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Randy Patten for any closing remarks.

Good morning. My name is Nan and I’ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the United Fire Group third quarter 2016 financial results conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode today. [Operator Instructions] And please note this event is being recorded.
Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Randy Patten, Assistant Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Randy Patten
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining this call. Earlier today, we issued a news release on our results. To find a copy of this document, please visit our website ufcinsurance.com. Press releases and slides are located under the Investor Relations tab.

The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements includes risks and uncertainties that are not a guaranty of future performance. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and we assume no obligation to update them.

At this time, I'm pleased to present Mr. Randy Ramlo, Chief Executive Officer of United Fire Group.
Randy Ramlo
Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to UFG Insurance third quarter 2016 conference call.
Earlier this morning, we reported net income of $0.48 per diluted share, operating income of $0.41 per diluted share and a GAAP combined ratio of 100.9% for the third quarter. This compares with net income of $0.77 per diluted share, operating income of $0.75 per diluted share and a GAAP combined ratio of 94.1% in the third quarter of 2015. Dawn will address the quarterly and year-to-date financial results later in a few minutes.
The third quarter results were within our expectations and were highlighted by continued organic premium growth, increased investment income, and catastrophe losses below our ten-year historical average for third quarters.
On a less positive note, our quarterly results were impacted by an increase in large commercial fire losses and an increase in commercial auto losses. I will let Mike discuss losses and the impact of our loss ratio in a few moments.
In the property and casualty segment, we continue to meet our organic growth objectives, with expansion in targeted geographical locations. Net premiums earned increased 9% during the third quarter and 11% year-to-date in 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015. We anticipate continued momentum from our expansion initiatives for the remainder of 2016 and remain focused on maintaining underwriting discipline as we grow the top line.
As a reminder, some of our growth initiatives, our targeted geographic expansion include expanding into the State of Ohio in the fourth quarter of 2015 and recently the State of Kentucky in the third quarter of 2016, along with adding our workers’ compensation product in the State of Texas in the fourth quarter of 2016.

I'm pleased to report that with the State of Ohio, we're off to a good start, with written premium within our expectations. In the State of Kentucky, we began selling our commercial lines and products in the third quarter of 2016, which will be followed with personal lines in 2017. In the State of Texas, we added our workers’ compensation line, with the first premium received in October 2016.
Renewal rate increases for both commercial lines and personal lines averaged in the low single digits in the third quarter. This is our 20th consecutive quarter of renewal pricing increases in our commercial auto and commercial property lines of business. However, the rate increases are not matching the increase in loss cost.
For new business, the rate increases for commercial lines of business were in commercial auto and commercial property lines of business. We did not seek any rate increases on new business for personal lines in the third quarter. Mike will provide more specifics with respect to the P&C market conditions and performance in a few moments.
As we discussed in prior quarters, the current interest rate environment has presented challenges during 2016 in our life segment. Although we had net income in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to a net loss in the second quarter of 2016, our expectation is that profitability in this segment will be difficult the remainder of the year. We are aggressively making changes to our strategy in the life segment, with life product pricing adjustments and restructuring our commission structure in 2017.
We're also working on creating efficiencies in our life segment, such as our recent automation of our deferred annuity application process, by implementing e-application and e-signature in the third quarter. We believe these actions will result in reductions in operating expenses and an increase in profitability in our life insurance.
Our expense ratio for the third quarter was 30.2 percentage points of the combined ratio compared to 31.2 percentage points in the same period in 2015. We're pleased with the progress we're making in reducing our expense ratio. We’re continually looking for efficiencies to manage our expenses as we strive to reach our ultimate goal of an annual expense ratio of 30.0 percentage points.
I'm pleased to report that, on September 15, 2016, A.M. Best affirmed our financial strength, A, excellent rating, for the property and casualty subsidiaries of United Fire Group, collectively known as United Fire & Casualty Group, and also affirmed the financial strength rating of A-, or excellent, for United Life Insurance Company, both with a stable outlook.
Finally, I’ll end this morning with an update on UFG’s exposure to Hurricane Mathew. Today, we have only received a few claims related to this catastrophe, with an estimated loss that’s lesser than $100,000. We have contacted the majority of our policyholders that are not yet expecting any further material developments from this event.
With that, I’ll turn the discussion over to Mike Wilkins, our Chief Operating Officer.
Michael Wilkins
Thanks, Randy. And good morning, everyone. As Randy indicated, our catastrophe losses impacted the combined ratio and the third quarter was 5.2 percentage points as compared to our ten-year historical average for third quarters of 7.8 percentage points. While the impact is below our ten-year historical average, we believe further geographical diversification will contribute to lowering our catastrophe loss impact in the future.
On a year-to-date basis, for the first nine months of 2016, catastrophe losses impact to the combined ratio was 7.6 percentage points compared to our ten-year historical average for the first nine months at 7.0 percentage point. The increase is primarily due to weather-related catastrophe losses incurred during the second quarter of this year.

As a reminder, our expectation for catastrophe losses in any given year is 6 percentage points for the combined ratio, with the second and third quarters being the most significant quarters with storm and catastrophe events in geographic areas where we conduct much of our business.
In the third quarter of 2016, we experienced an increase in large losses, which we define as losses greater than $500,000. Large losses totaled $30 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $19 million in the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date, large losses totaled $67 million in 2016 compared to $62 million in 2015. The increase in large losses is primarily due to an increase in commercial fire losses.
During the third quarter, we incurred five large commercial property losses for a total of $9.6 million. These fires were geographically spread out, with no recurring patterns. However, we are in the process of completing audits and identifying changes that are needed to reduce commercial property losses.
Commercial auto losses continued to deteriorate in the third quarter of 2016 due to an increase in frequency and severity of claims. Our experience is similar to what we're seeing throughout the industry right now, which we believe is attributable to an increase in miles driven, a reduction in the unemployment rate, and distracted driving.
We’re currently asking for and receiving rate increases on our commercial auto new business and renewal premiums. We are currently asking for and receiving rate increases between 5% and 10% depending on the region.
Along with implementing these rate increases in many of the states we write, we’ve also taken several initiatives to reduce commercial auto losses, including underwriting several of our accounts, lowering some of the limits we offer, and expanding into new initiatives in the areas of predictive analytics and telematics. 
Similar to the second quarter, our loss ratio on workers’ compensation deteriorated in the third quarter. In the third quarter, our loss ratio on workers’ compensation increased 22 points over an unusually low loss ratio in the third quarter of 2015. We attribute this change to an increase in severity of claims over $100,000. Despite the increase, the loss ratio continues to be within our expectations for this line of business. Our workers’ compensation losses can be volatile quarter-over-quarter. Therefore, we will continue to monitor this line of business.
During the third quarter, we continued to see competitive market conditions for both renewals and new business. Renewal pricing for both commercial lines and personal lines averaged in the low single digits. We had the most successful increases in commercial auto and commercial property lines of business, offset by a decrease in workers’ compensation rates. This is the 20th consecutive quarter of commercial lines pricing increases on our overall book of business. The increases in our personal lines continue to be in homeowners and personal auto lines of business.
Premium and policy retention remained strong at 85% and 83% respectively, with changes from the prior quarter of less than 1% respectively. Our success ratio on quoted accounts was down 1% from the prior three quarters, but remains at an acceptable level. We continue to be more successful on accounts with premiums less than $25,000.
During the third quarter, property and casualty premiums written increased 8% as compared to the third quarter of 2015. 3% is attributed to new business and the remaining increase is due to rate changes, endorsements, audits and exposure increases.
Year-to-date, property and casualty written increased 10% as compared to the same period of 2015. 3% is attributable to new business. The remaining increased is due to rate changes, endorsements, audits, and exposure increases.

With that, I’ll turn the financial discussion over to Dawn Jaffray.
Dawn Jaffray
Thanks, Mike. And good morning. For the third quarter of 2016, we reported consolidated net income of $12.4 million or $0.48 per diluted share compared to $19.5 million or $0.77 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015.
Through nine months 2016, year-to-date, consolidated net income was $37.9 million and $1.47 per diluted share as compared to $58.2 million and $2.31 per diluted share in 2015. 
The decrease in net income in the third quarter and year-to-date as compared to 2015 is primarily due to an increase in large losses and an increase in catastrophe losses previously discussed by Randy and Mike.
Our shareholders’ equity increased 9% to $959 million at September 30, 2016 from $879 million at December 31, 2015. Book value increased $2.89 to $37.83 at September 30, 2016 from $34.94 at December 31, 2015. The increase in shareholders’ equity and book value are primarily due to net income of $37.9 million and an increase in unrealized investment gains of $51 million.
Consolidated unrealized investment gains were $179.8 million at September 30, 2016. 
Return on equity was 5.5% in the first nine months of 2016 compared to 9.3% in the first nine months of 2015. The decrease in ROE as compared to the same quarter last year was primarily due to a combination of decrease in net income and increase in shareholders’ equity.
Losses and loss settlement expenses increased by $32 million or 22% during the third quarter 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015. On a year-to-date basis, losses and loss settlement expenses increased $78 million or 18% compared to the same period of 2015. The primary driver of the increase in third quarter is large losses and catastrophe losses as we previously mentioned.
As has been historical reserving practice at UFG, we set initial reserves conservatively. As a result, we often have favorable reserve adjustments that vary from year-to-year across our book of business.
Favorable reserve development for the third quarter 2016 was $0.7 million, which was flat as compared to the third quarter of 2015. The impact on net income for the third quarter in 2016 was $0.02 per share, which is flat as compared to the third quarter of 2015.
On a year-to-date basis, favorable reserve development for 2016 totaled $27.1 million compared to $24.1 million in 2015. The impact on net income in 2016 was $0.58 per share compared to $0.62 per share in 2015. 
Two line together provide the majority of the favorable reserve development in the first nine months of 2016. The largest contributors to our favorable development were commercial liability, with $16.4 million, and workers’ compensation with $11.5 million. All of these lines benefited from successful claims management and continued successful management of litigation expenses. The favorable development is attributable to reductions in reserves for loss adjustment expenses which continue to benefit from continued management in our litigation area. These lines were slightly offset by $6.9 million of adverse development in the commercial fire line of business which experienced an increased in paid claims.
The combined ratio in the third quarter 2016 was 100.9% and 99.5% year-to-date. 2015, compared, were 94.1% for the third quarter and 93.9% year-to-date. Removing the impact of catastrophe losses in reserve development, our core loss ratio deteriorated 5.8 percentage points in the third quarter and 1.9 percentage points year-to-date when compared with 2015 results.
The primary drivers of this deterioration in the core loss ratio are an increase in the large commercial fire losses, increase in commercial auto and workers’ compensation losses, as previously mentioned.

Referring to slide nine in our slide deck on our website, we’ve provided a detailed reconciliation of the impact of catastrophes and the development on the combined ratio.
Moving on to investments, consolidated net investment income was $26.7 million for the third quarter of 2016 or an 11% increase as compared to $24.1 million in the third quarter 2015. Year-to-date 2016 consolidated net investment income was $73.4 million, which represents a 1% decrease when compared to 2015.
The increase in net investment income for the quarter was primarily driven by the change in value of investments in limited liability partnerships as compared to the same period of 2015, and not due to a change in our investment philosophy. This resulted in $3.8 million increase in investment income during the third quarter 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. Year-to-date, the decrease in investment income is primarily due to a declining reinvestment interest rate in our life portfolio.
With respect to capital management activity, during the third quarter, we declared and paid a $0.25 per share cash dividend to stockholders of record on September 1, 2016. I emphasize that we have consistently paid a quarterly dividend every quarter since March of 1968.
Under our share repurchase program, we made – purchased United Fire common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The amount and timing of any purchases will be at management’s discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including its share price, general economics and market conditions, and corporate and regulatory requirements. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased 67,492 shares of our common stock at an average price of $42.48 and a total cost of $2.9 million. We are authorized by the Board of Directors to purchase an additional 2,961,394 shares of common stock under our share repurchase program, which expires in August 2018.
And with that, I'll now open the line for questions. Operator? 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Newsome of Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead.
Paul Newsome
Good morning. Could you walk through the loss ratio deteriorations for, I guess, property, auto and workers’ comp and talk about the prospects of whether or not those loss ratios will improve prospectively, given what you're doing at the moment, and how quickly you think that could change?
Randy Ramlo
Well, the tough part of that question is how quickly that can change.
On the workers’ compensation part, we had some deterioration, but we’re kind of far from a disaster. That line was pretty good last year, better than – I think we said better than we probably expected it to be. I think the good news there is – it’s kind of an industry problem. So, I think a problem is always easier to cure if everybody’s kind of feeling the same pain.
So far, I think this is still kind of something we can cure through rate increases and we’ve filed for rate increases already and those rate increases are going in fairly successfully. We also have had a lot of really large losses and have had to change our stance on providing large umbrellas on some heavier fleets on commercial auto. I think that will help very quickly because I think we’re pretty much around the horn on reducing the umbrella coverage on a lot of the auto fleets.
Mike mentioned that we have some analytics projects underway, specifically a pilot program. And I think that will have some pay off, certainly within 12 months. And then the commercial fire, kind of the couple areas there that we did an audit and took a look at our property book. Couple of things that we found is not always having diligent implementation of loss control recommendation, and not on large accounts, but more on medium-size accounts. So, a lot of times, small insureds aren’t able to implement loss control recommendation. So, we have to do a better job of making sure that if we have loss control recommendations, we get them implemented or get off the account.

And then the last thing we found is that we probably have to do a little bit better job of underwriting older buildings. Specifically, we have a church program that inherently – churches are often very old. So, we have to, again, make sure loss control reccs implemented. But, hopefully, we can see some improvement in these loss ratios certainly by the first part or the second quarter of next year.
Paul Newsome
And then maybe kind of a broad question here. Your slides that came out about the same time of the call talked about a 2020 goal of increasing return on equity. Maybe you could just walk through what the levers you’re going to pull to achieve that goal?
Randy Ramlo
First of all, we’ve got to get three lines we talked about earlier under some better control. We probably have some branches that we need to become a little bit more profitable. We’re having good success with growth. And kind of interestingly, the branches that are growing the least actually have some of the more elevated loss ratios. So, we’ll continue to be diligent on rate. We think that’s always a way to kind of help things. We think property diversification, which part of our Mercer acquisition, we hope that we can continue to see the contribution of cat losses kind of slowly coming down in years to come. So, hopefully, growing property in especially the western states and parts of the northeast can help with those things. Those are kind of some of the levers that we will continue to pull.
Paul Newsome
Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.
Randy Ramlo
Thank you, Paul.
