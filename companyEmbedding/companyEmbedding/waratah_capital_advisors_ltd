			Our Funds
			




We manage three core funds: Waratah Performance, Waratah One and Waratah Income. While each fund is formed and positioned to meet the various needs of our investors, they all aim to compound wealth at targeted return levels while experiencing less risk than the market.










Waratah One is a highly diversified, low net exposure long short portfolio of North American equity securities. Research driven stock selection, dynamic portfolio construction and active factor management combine to produce compounded returns with significantly lower volatility and drawdowns than North American equity markets. Waratah manages this strategy to isolate investment opportunities while hedging out market and factor exposures. This strategy has consistently demonstrated a very low beta to North American equity indices.












Waratah One X is a highly diversified, low net long/short portfolio of North American equity securities that is an automated scaling of the Waratah One fund.  As such, the fund employs the same research driven stock selection, dynamic portfolio construction and active factor management as Waratah One.  Although the fund will be more volatile than Waratah One, its objective is to compound returns with significantly lower volatility and drawdowns than North American equity markets.












Waratah Energy is a low net exposure, long/short equity portfolio of North American energy securities. Fundamental research, dynamic portfolio construction and active factor management combine to produce compounded returns with significantly lower volatility and drawdowns than the S&P 500 Energy and S&P/TSX Energy Indices ("North American Energy Indices"). Waratah manages this strategy to go long higher quality securities and short lower quality securities while hedging out commodity, sub-sector and other factor exposures. This strategy has demonstrated a very low beta to North American Energy Indices.
















Waratah Income is long short portfolio of North American dividend paying equities, fixed income and preferred share securities. The Fund seeks to identify growing companies that can increase earnings and dividends, while also looking for companies with stressed balance sheets and high payout ratios to short. Research driven stock selection, interest rate hedging and active portfolio construction combine to produce compounded returns with significantly lower volatility and drawdowns than North American equity markets.
















Waratah Performance is a directional long/short portfolio of North American equities. This strategy matches conviction with position size and can build up to 10% of the portfolio in a single security. Detailed researched driven stock selection combined with active portfolio construction combine to target double digit compounded returns with lower volatility and drawdowns than North American equity markets.
