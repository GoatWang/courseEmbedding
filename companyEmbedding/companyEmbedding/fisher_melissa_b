The Way of Hope 
A Fresh Perspective on Sexual Identity, Same-Sex Marriage, and the Church


Fisher, Melissa (Author)	
									        	
									           			,  
									        		
									        		Burke, John (Foreword by)	
									        	
									           			,  
									        		
									        		Fisher, Melissa (Preface by)	
									        	
									




As a Christian who has struggled with same-sex attraction herself, Melissa Fisher shares her story of sexual brokenness and her journey to healing, showing others that freedom is possible for them as they step toward the God of second chances.




Description


Most churches today struggle to answer the same-sex relationship debate that is quickly transforming our culture, our kids, and our churches. As a result, Christians struggle to demonstrate love and grace to those with same-sex attraction. That means that more and more people who are looking for truth and a place where they belong are deciding that the church is either indifferent to their struggle or outright hostile to "people like them."There's a better way--the way of hope. With deep understanding born from her own painful experiences, Melissa Fisher shows that somewhere between the extremes of condemning and condoning is compassion. In The Way of Hope, she aims to equip the church to make a positive difference in the lives of those hurting from relational or sexual brokenness. Perfect for pastors, parents, siblings, and friends of the ten million people in America who identify as LGBTQ, who long to love them well.
