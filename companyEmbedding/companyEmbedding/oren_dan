Description

Description
MoldMaker RTV Silicone Rubber is an easy and fast way to make flexible and sustainable molds.
RTV stands for Room Temperature Vulcanising which means the silicone will cure at room temperature, it doesn’t require any additional heat to cure.
Silicone rubber will cure to a soft, strong and flexible rubber that is tear resistant and good for many uses.
These molds is suitable for casting liquid plastic, epoxy resins, concrete, soaps, candles and others.
Moldmaker RTV Silicone Rubber comes with a 50ml Hardener (Catalyst)
Instructions:

Give the liquid silicone rubber a good stir before measuring.
Pour it into a mixing container. Note the weight of the silicone alone while using the scale.
Give the hardener a good shake before measuring.
Measure 3-4% of the hardener to the total weight of the silicone. Example 100g of silicone to 3-4g of hardener. The hardener is orange and will turn the silicone rubber to white in color.
Mix the hardener with silicone. Stir slowly and carefully to avoid bubbles.
Once mixture is of a unified light orange color, pour slowly over the master object.
*Optional to spray master object with silicone mold release agent beforehand

*Please note that the stiring and measurements of this silicone rubber must be precise. Read product warranty below*
NOTE:

3% of hardener provides a more fluid mix with a longer worktime.
4% hardens faster with a shorter work time.
When using any clay or release agents, please ensure the items contain NO SULFUR as sulfur will inhibit the curing the silicone rubber.

For 2 part silicone-to-silicone molds, you will need to apply a generous layer of mold release agent, otherwise the mold will not separate.
Cured Silicone Rubber can withstand casting heat up to 100 °C.
More craft materials available online and at our craft shop at Craftiviti Sdn. Bhd. (Petaling Jaya, Malaysia).
 
***
There is no warranty with this product and it is up to the end user to determine the suitability and the end result. Please read the instructions above clearly before starting. When making a 2-part mold always use a generous amount of non-sulphur mold release agent as silicone will fuse to silicone. Always conduct a small scale test before attempting on a larger scale.
——
Moldmaker RTV Silicone Rubber merupakan cara yang senang dan cepat bagi menghasilkan acuan yang fleksibel dan tahan lama. RTV membawa maksud Room Temperature Vulcanising yang bermaksud silicon akan terawet pada suhu bilik, ianya tidak memerlukan sebarang pemanasan tambahan.
Getah silikon akan menjadi getah yang lembut, kuat dan fleksibel di mana ianya tidak mampu dikoyak dan sesuai untuk pelbagai kegunaan.
Acuan ini sesuai diguna untuk penuangan cecair plastik, resin epoksi, konkrit, sabun, lilin dan lain-lain.
Moldmaker RTV Silicone Rubber ini lengkap dengan Hardener (Catalyst) 50ml.
Arahan:

Cecair getah silikon itu harus dikacau dengan baik sebelum disukat.
Tuangkan ke dalam bekas pemutar. Catat berat silikon ketika menggunakan skala.
Goncang pengeras (green hardener) sebelum menyukat.
Suka pengeras dalam 3-4% jumlah berat silikon. Contohnya, 100g silikon dengan nisbah 3-4g pengeras. Pengeras tersebut berwarna oren dan akan menghasilkan getah silikon yang berwarna putih.
Campurkan pengeras dan silikon. Kacau dengan perlahan bagi mengelakkan buih.
Setelah campuran itu berwarna oren cair dengan rata, tuangkan ke atas objek.
*Semburan agen pelepas acuan silikon terhadap objek master terlebih dahulu adalah pilihan.

*Pastikan bahawa gaulan dan sukatan getah silikon dilakukan dengan teliti. Baca waranti produk dibawah*
NOTA:

3% pengeras menghasilkan campuran cecair banyak yang memerlukan lebih masa.
4% mengeras dengan cepat yang mempercepatkan masa bekerja.
Ketika menggunakan sebarang tanah liat atau agen pelepas, sila pastikan item tidak mengandungi SULFUR kerana sulfur mengundang kepada pengawetan getak silikon.

Bagi 2 bahagian silikon kepada acuan silikon, anda perlu menyembur agen pelepas acuan yang banyak agar acuan itu terurai. Silikon getah yang diawet boleh mencecah takat didih 100°C.
Pelbagai barangan kraf boleh didapati menerusi talian dan kedai kami di Craftiviti Sdn. Bhd. (Petaling Jaya, Malaysia).
***
Produk ini tidak mempunyai sebarang waranti dan ianya tertakluk kepada pengguna untuk menentukan kesesuian dan hasil akhir. Sila baca arahan diatas dengan jelas sebelum bermula. Apabila membuat 2 bahagian acuan, agen pelepas acuan yang bebas sulfur harus digunakan dengan banyak kerana jika tidak, silikon tidak akan terurai. Sentiasa uji dengan skala kecil sebelum memulakan dengan skala yang lebih besar.
