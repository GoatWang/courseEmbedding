INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 24, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:   LLY) today announced that Alfonso "Chito" Zulueta will be promoted to senior vice president and president of the Emerging Markets business effective Jan. 1, 2014. Zulueta will replace Jacques Tapiero who will retire Jan. 31, 2014, after 31 years of service to the company. 
Zulueta has been president and general manager of Lilly Japan since 2008. In his new role, he will lead the company's efforts in many of the world's fastest-growing markets in Asia, Latin America, Middle East and Africa, plus Russia and Turkey.  Zulueta will report to John Lechleiter, Ph.D., chairman, president, and CEO, and will serve on the company's executive committee. 
Tapiero joined Lilly in 1983 as a financial analyst. He became president of Emerging Markets in 2009. Prior to that, he had served as president of the intercontinental region for Lilly, which comprised offices in Asia, Australia, Africa, the Middle East, Canada, Latin America, and Russia, and had been general manager of several affiliates.
"Jacques Tapiero has made extraordinary contributions to our company throughout his 31-year career with Lilly, culminating in 2009 with his appointment to lead our important Emerging Markets business," Lechleiter said. "Jacques' leadership has been characterized by strong operational skills and a keen focus on the development of Lilly people around the world. Jacques has been an exemplar of our values of integrity, excellence, and respect for people."
Born in the Philippines, Zulueta received a bachelor's degree in economics from De La Salle University in the Philippines in 1982 and an MBA from the University of Virginia in 1987. In his 25 year career with Lilly, Zulueta has held several sales and marketing leadership positions in the United States before becoming general manager for the Philippines affiliate in 1995. He served as president of Asian operations prior to being promoted in 2008 to his current role as president and general manager of Lilly Japan, the company's second largest market and affiliate behind only the U.S.
"I am delighted to welcome Chito Zulueta to the company's top management team," said Lechleiter. "Chito's previous Lilly assignments have provided him with the global experience necessary for his new role as head of our Emerging Markets business. Chito's business savvy, his insights into diverse markets and cultures, and his passion for the patients whom we serve have enabled him to deliver outstanding results throughout his career. He is the ideal candidate to assume this important position."
