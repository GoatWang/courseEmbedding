David E. Pace, Picante Sauce Producer, 79
Published: December 30, 1993




SAN ANTONIO, Dec. 29— 
                    David E. Pace, creator of a popular picante sauce, died of heart failure on Monday. He was 79.        

                    In 1947 he created Pace Picante Sauce, a spicy, tongue-biting product that led to the formation of Pace Foods.        

                    Mr. Pace, a Louisianian, earned a football scholarship to Tulane University and played in the first Sugar Bowl. After coaching football and serving as an Army pilot, Mr. Pace entered the syrup business and with his wife, Margaret, formed Pace Foods. For his sauce he used a family recipe of jalapenos, onions and garlic, to which he added tomatoes.        

                    Mr. Pace also patented an executive chair in 1967 that could be opened flat for taking a nap.

Pace Foods is a producer of a variety of salsas located in Paris, Texas. The company was founded in 1947 by David Pace when he developed a recipe for a salsa he called "Picante" sauce, "made with the freshest ingredients, harvested and hand-selected in peak season to achieve the best flavor and quality".[1] In 1995, the company was acquired by Campbell Soup Company for $1.115 billion.[2][3]

History[edit]
David Pace grew up in Louisiana, learning the operations of his family's syrup business. He earned a football scholarship to Tulane University, where he played in the first Sugar Bowl in 1937 and earned his undergraduate degree in science. During World War II pilot training school brought him to San Antonio, Texas, where he returned after his discharge in 1945 and began a career in the food industry.[citation needed]
Pace began his own food business of bottled syrups, as well as jellies and jams. All of these products were made, packed and shipped out of a small space in the back of a liquor store that he and his wife, Margaret, rented. Over time, he expanded the business to a variety of other condiments. In 1947 he decided the real “syrup of the Southwest” was Mexican picante sauce—which is now known as salsa or picante sause.[citation needed]
Starting with a basic recipe, he experimented with different blends of ingredients. He tested the results on his golf buddies, before settling on one mix of jalapeños, onions and tomatoes. He named his creation “picante” sauce—Spanish for “piquant”, meaning “flavorful” or “spicy”.
While continuing to sell some 58 assorted condiments, he continued modifying his picante sauce formula for the better part of a decade. As demand grew, Pace dropped the rest of the company’s lines and focused on Picante sauce.
He marketed Picante sauce to restaurants, using it during his meals, and leaving it behind on the table for other patrons and the restaurant owners to try when he was done.[citation needed]
Ingredients[edit]
When he started selling his salsa, Pace looked for a supplier for peppers. He even tried growing his own jalapeños — but the local deer were so fond of his peppers that he had a hard time maintaining a supply.[citation needed]
Eventually, he began buying his peppers directly from local farmers. Later, the company began following the “jalapeño trail”, buying from different regions according to the harvest season. In recent years, the Pace brand has developed its own pepper seeds. Today it uses more than 25 million pounds of jalapeños every year – more than anyone else in the country.[4]
Varieties[edit]
In 1981, the company introduced “mild” and “hot” varieties to accompany the original “medium” Picante sauce.[citation needed] In 1989, Pace Foods added Thick & Chunky salsa to their product line. It is a thicker salsa with large chunks of vegetables.[citation needed]
The growing demand for picante sauce and salsa reflected the changing demographics of America as well as the increasing popularity of Mexican restaurants and cuisine. Over time, consumers preferences turned toward Mexican foods, such as salsas, and in 1991, Mexican sauces overtook ketchup as the top-selling condiment in the United States in total dollar sales, with Pace Picante sauce and salsa taking the lion's share of the market.[4]
Lines[edit]
Pace Foods introduced a new line of specialty salsas in 2008. The specialty salsas include:[5]

Salsa Verde: Jalapeños and chunks of tomatillos, seasoned with a lime and smoked Spanish paprika.
Pico De Gallo: Like traditional pico de gallo, with jalapeños, onions, diced tomatoes and cilantro.
Mexican Four Cheese Salsa Con Queso: With four cheeses – Monterey Jack, Cheddar, Asadero and Queso Blanco, plus jalapeños, red peppers and onion.
Pineapple Mango Chipotle Salsa: Medium-heat salsa with pineapple and mango. In a chipotle adobo - a tomato sauce made with garlic, onion and smoked jalapeños.
Black Bean & Roasted Corn Salsa: A blend of black beans with fire-roasted corn and red peppers. With lime and chipotle spice.
New for 2014: Pace Fire Mango & Habanero Salsa and Pace Fire Chipotle & Jalapeno Salsa

Awards[edit]
Pace Picante Sauce and Salsas took top honors for their categories in Chile Pepper magazine’s 2009 Fiery Food Challenge and the 2009 Fiery Foods & BBQ Show’s Scovie Awards Competition. Pace took a total of 12 awards, including first-place awards for Pace Picante sauce - Hot and Pace Salsa Verde.[6]

Comments:
This guitar has certain upgrades to her, including the Graf tuning machines, snakewood bindings, raised fingerboard.  She is a beautiful sounding and looking guitar, with a deep impacting voice, superb projection, and musical voice.  She’s been slightly scratched here and there on the top, with some nail dings, but nothing structural.  I say 80% + condition, but really, this is all superficial stuff on her face.  Back and sides are in excellent shape.  She is priced accordingly.  But, make no mistake, the voice on her is superb.  Plays with moderate action, with the ability to drive her where the rest of the world is drowned out.  Love this guitar.

MP3 Audio – 150220-david-pace-20135 – wonderful guitar.  Powerful voices with piercing trebles.  3 sketches and short discussion.  Great guitar.  Best heard with headphones, if you can click the above, download it and listen to it thru your own EQ’d player.  I record them flat and listen to them on my headphones or thru the studio monitors we have set up here in the shop.

Richard Sayage – May 20, 2015:
	
Dear Mister Savage,
The guitar is safely in its new home.
I want to thank you for your kind attention, and also for all the hard work you’ve put into your business. Your website is in my opinion the standard toward which your competitors should strive.
It surely comes as no surprise to you that the instrument far exceeds my expectations. Pieces I’ve struggled with for years are now within easy reach (I’m accustomed to a stubborn 660+ scale Kazuo Yairi c. 1970), and the wide spectrum of tone colours offered by this guitar makes the effort infinitely more rewarding.
At 59, it’s a distinct pleasure to feel that inviting new roads can present themselves, and I’m grateful for the part you’ve played.
By the way, the U.S. destination we used (CBI) was very helpful. I recommend it to any of your Canadian customers who find themselves in similar circumstances.
Thank you for the bag of goodies as well, it is most thoughtful.
Yours fondly,
Andre J.

Dr. David Pace





























































































































































David Pace is a life-long resident of Shreveport.  He has always had a love for construction and spent his first ten years after high school working as a trim carpenter and licensed contractor.  Regrets for never furthering his education led to  his decision to pursue a career in medicine.  He did his pre-medical work at LSU Shreveport and received his medical degree from LSUHSC in Shreveport in 1996.   He remained in Shreveport to complete his residency in pediatrics and served as chief resident in his final year.  He joined Mid City Pediatrics in 1999.  Dr. Pace is certified by the American Board of Pediatrics and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
David was introduced to Isabelle, a French teacher from Belgium, by mutual friends in 1992.  They were married the next year and have one daughter, Melanie, who gives them many reasons to be proud.  The Paces have a large extended family in Shreveport and spend as much time with them as possible.  Each summer they visit Isabelle's family in Belgium and France.  Rest and relaxation come in the form of yard work,  staying at their camp house on Lake Bisteneau, or in planning some new project. . . .



















 

 













































































Pace® Salsa & Sauce - Campbell's What's In My Food?





































flag-canadaflag-united-states













Pace® salsas were born in the Southwest in the kitchen of David Pace. David was obsessive about salsa. He grew special jalapenos and tomatoes to create the ultimate ‘Picante’ sauce. His vision for the best tasting salsa lives on today. Pace’s family-friendly sauces use the best quality ingredients to create authentic flavors – perfect for adding a kick to any meal.




KEY INGREDIENTS










Tomatoes
The tomatoes we use are mainly grown in California by family farmers, many of whom have grown tomatoes for us for generations. The ripe tomatoes are harvested and transported directly to our nearby plants to be washed, peeled, crushed and diced. Tomatoes make up about 70% of the Pace Picante sauce recipe.














Jalapeno peppers
We use jalapeno peppers grown in Texas, California, Florida and Mexico. The jalapeno used in our salsas is a special variety which adds flavor, but not heat.  














Southwest flavors
We add a range of ingredients to create authentic Southwest flavors. These include distilled vinegar, dried onions, garlic and herbs and spices such as cilantro, adobo and cumin depending on the variety.



 



ADDITIONAL INGREDIENTSWe make nearly 20 different varieties of Pace sauces and salsas. Each recipe contains unique ingredients which deliver delicious flavors. Many are familiar, but others aren’t so common. We’ve explained some of those here.
INGREDIENTS FOR FLAVORChipotle adobo pureeA spice mix which includes adobo peppers, tomatoes and flavoring used in the Chipotle variety.  
Enzyme modified butterfatButter that has been specially processed using enzymes to increase the flavor.
Lime juice concentrateFresh juice is pasteurized and evaporated to create a frozen concentrate that simplifies transport and storage.  We buy our lime juice from Mexico.
Natural flavorsThe natural flavors we use in Pace salsas and Picante sauces are from fruit, vegetables, herbs and spices. 
Yeast extractA natural flavor derived from yeast which adds a savory taste.
INGREDIENTS FOR TEXTURESoy lecithinHelps smoothly blend or emulsify ingredients together.
Xanthan gumA thickener used to blend our spices and ingredients to give a consistent flavor and appearance. It’s made by fermenting corn sugar, wheat or soy.
INGREDIENTS FOR COLORCaramel colorA widely-used food color made by heating sugar. We use it in two salsas: Chipotle and  Bourbon & Apple. 









GENETICALLY MODIFIED INGREDIENTSIn America, approximately 90% of all canola, corn, soy, and sugar beet crops are grown from genetically modified seeds. Farmers have been using these seeds for more than 20 years as they are safe, reduce costs and improve yields.
Pace salsas and sauces contain a handful of ingredients that may be made from these crops. They are listed here. Not all of these ingredients are used in all varieties.
Canola- canola oil
Corn- distilled vinegar
Soybean- soy lecithin, soybean oil
Sugar beet-  brown sugar, caramel color, citric acid, sugar
Non-GMO IngredientsAll other ingredients including tomatoes and onions are not genetically modified.






THE DAVID PACE STORY
In the 1940s, war hero David Pace moved to Texas, and southwestern food became his passion. For years he worked to develop the perfect sauce…a delicious blend of tomatoes, jalapeno peppers and onion. Finally, he created a recipe he felt worthy of his name and Pace Picante sauce was born. Over the years, the Pace range of sauces, salsas and dips has grown. But they remain true to David’s vision – authentic, ‘no bull’ flavors with the soul of Texas.







WHO GROWS & MAKES PACE
Pace Salsa and Sauces are made using mainly ingredients grown or produced in North America.
We still make Pace products in Texas, as well as in Napoleon, Ohio.
 



PACKAGING
Pace salsas and dips are packaged in glass and plastic bottles. The glass jars are 100% recyclable and may contain up to 30% recycled glass. The PET plastic bottles are 100% recyclable and can be made into new plastic PET bottles.
The metal lids currently use a coating which contains BPA. This coating helps keep the food safe. We are currently in the process of transitioning away from using BPA, and by mid-2017 our metal lids will use an acrylic coating.
