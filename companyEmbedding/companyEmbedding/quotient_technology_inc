Leaving Paper and Scissors Behind
Early one Sunday morning, Steven Boal watched his father-in-law descend the stairs, trudge out the front door to grab the newspaper and then, scissors in hand, set up camp at the kitchen table, where he busily clipped coupons.
Boal knew there had to be a better way. He researched the industry and found that the multibillion-dollar coupon business hadn’t changed in three decades. The Internet was beginning to chip away at all sorts of industries—music, news, finance—improving and revolutionizing each one. Boal set his sights on coupons.
In 1998, shortly after watching his father-in-law’s Sunday trudge, Boal, a finance executive who specialized in developing technologies, pulled in two people he knew could help him change the future of couponing. Michele Boal, his wife, had years of marketing and communications experience and understood the family shopper on many levels. It helped that she was raised in a home where saving was critical to making ends meet.
Next, Steven recruited former colleague Mike Walsh. Over a coffee, with pencil and napkin in hand, the two mapped out a technology strategy that would become the foundation for what Quotient is today. (Walsh remains the company’s chief security officer and head of research and development; Michele leads our Coupons for Change initiatives, which you can read about here).
The hurdles weren’t small. The company spent three years developing the technology that enabled digital coupons to work for manufacturers, which issue the coupons, and for retailers, which redeem them. Since coupons are a form of currency, manufacturers required strict security and print limits before they would recognize digital coupons as an alternative to paper.
Once the security and print controls were in place, Boal’s company faced the next challenge: persuading providers of consumer packaged goods (CPGs)—the companies that make and distribute much of the world’s food, personal-care and household-cleaning products—to shift their promotional budgets from paper to digital.
In April 2001, almost three years after the company’s launch, the Coupons.com team issued its first digital coupon, on a client’s website. A couple of months later came the company’s consumer website—now Coupons.com—where shoppers could peruse a collection of offers.
Constantly Innovating
Since those early days, Quotient has pioneered the digital transformation of the promotions industry, beginning with coupons that shoppers print at home. That business continues strong—an easier, far more efficient alternative to the paper coupons stuffed into mailboxes across the country. In 2014 alone, shoppers printed hundreds of millions of offers in this form from Coupons.com.
But Quotient, continually innovating, now does much more. The company delivers purely digital coupons directly to shoppers through mobile apps; automatically loads offers onto shoppers’ credit cards, store loyalty cards and cardless-shopping accounts; and delivers brand messages to shoppers across all devices through Coupons’ online network of approximately 30,000 publishers, which include the websites of retailers as well as lifestyle sites and popular blogger sites. In 2014, Coupons.com began running entire digital-coupon programs—and in some cases, becoming the loyalty program—for major retailers. (Read about all our Solutions, a complete tool kit for deploying offers and messaging, here.)
Along with Coupons’ wide-ranging delivery capabilities are the platform’s deep data assets. Quotient is one of the few marketing data providers that can link in-store purchase data to data about online behavior. This enables us to target offers, digital advertising and messages to the shoppers who are most valuable to a brand. Marrying online and in-store data provides Quotient’s clients with unprecedented intelligence about each consumer’s past purchases and future-purchase intent, since we are able to read purchase intent in a consumer’s online behavior. All this intelligence on our proprietary platform can further optimize returns on each promotional campaign.
Growing Market Opportunity
The reach of our industry-leading network is unparalleled. Last year alone we powered more than 1.6 billion digital-coupon transactions. And we’re just getting started.
The opportunity is vast. CPGs alone distributed 310 billion coupons, representing a total discount value of $533 billion, in the United States last year, according to the annual industry report (PDF) by NCH Marketing Services. Most of those coupons were distributed on paper, in circulars or newspaper inserts, even though the bulk of them ended up in the trash as a result.
Of those 310 billion coupons, digital (including printable and paperless) represented less than 2 percent. Digital accounted for more than 10 percent of total redemptions, however, demonstrating the effectiveness of digital promotions over paper.
That’s not surprising, especially considering the sophistication that Quotient brings to the industry, delivering offers and messages that are personalized to be relevant, informed by countless data points from shopper behavior online and off. In short, Quotient’s communications reach the right shoppers with the right offers at the right time.
The rapid rise of smartphones is broadening the demographic reach and increasing the use of digital promotions. For instance, more than 132 million adults in the United States will use digital coupons in 2017, a jump of more than 17 percent from last year, the research firm eMarketer projects. Even better, our own data shows that people who use digital coupons use more coupons and spend more in general than those paper-clippers of yesteryear.
What our clients are saying about us
Nsight Connect
“One of Quotient’s biggest points of differentiation is their operations team. They are proactive, dependable and flexible, providing industry-leading support that sets them apart. This is a tremendous value to Hormel and our marketing team, Nsight Connect.”

Digital Coupons
Our coupon technology helped launch the new era of personalized offers that are delivered across the web—including mobile and social.
Some of these offers are printed by individual consumers in their homes. Others are purely digital and saved directly to the shopper’s loyalty card or store account. Either way, each offer is both a secure form of currency and a source of invaluable data about the shoppers who are accepting and using them.
Because all offers are delivered online, each carries a unique digital stamp that reports such things as the website where the offer was found, the site that referred the consumer to the offer and the time of the coupon’s selection. We also know where the coupon was redeemed and what was purchased.
Our reach is expansive, with most offers running on Coupons.com, a Nielsen Top 100 web property, and our roughly 30,000 partner publisher sites. Those include the websites of leading grocery, drug, mass and dollar retailers, as well as premier lifestyle sites and popular blogs. The people who see your campaigns on our network are shoppers who make 25 percent more trips, and spend 12 percent more on each trip and 40 percent more overall, than the average shopper. [1]
In addition, our technology lets you easily include coupons across your marketing channels, whether in emails, on websites or on social networks, such as Facebook. You can also target coupons according to geography and in–store buying behavior.
In fact, Quotient is one of the few marketing-data providers that can link online behavior to in-store purchase data. This perfect marriage of online and in-store data provides our clients with unprecedented intelligence about purchase intent and their consumers’ shopping patterns—intelligence that can further optimize returns on each promotional campaign.
Capturing and aggregating this kind of end-to-end, cross-platform information across all devices, all channels and thousands of retail outlets has been the goal of marketers since the advent of the digital age. Quotient makes it easy for you to make all your promotions smarter.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/01/2006
            

                BBB has determined that Quotient Technology Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Quotient Technology Inc. has received 3.85 out of 5 stars based on 4 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

2016 Business Highlights
Accelerated scale through Retailer iQ 

At the end of 2016, 21 major retailer banners and distributors were live on Retailer iQ, 16 of which have started digital marketing programs to engage shoppers, increase frequency of shopping trips and boost sales. 
Digital paperless transactions for the year grew 92% over 2015, representing 68% of all transactions in the year with growing mobile usage. 
The number of shoppers registered on programs powered by Retailer iQ grew to approximately 40 million, reaching approximately 30% of U.S. households, as brands and retailers use our platform to drive sales through promotions and media. 

New partnerships expand network    

Signed new retailer partners onto Retailer iQ in the club and drug channels. Additionally, we began a distribution partner program to address the fragmented long tail within the large grocery channel and already have over 200 retailer banners implemented under this program. In total, our retailer partners represent approximately $400 billion of annual CPG sales, over two thirds of the estimated $600 billion of CPG sales in the U.S. 
Launched partnership with Samsung Pay to distribute digital coupons, making it easy for shoppers to link loyalty cards, clip savings and automatically redeem at checkout through their mobile payment solution. 
Distributed our first digital coupon on TV through a partnership with interactive TV company Ensequence, with distribution to more than 15 million Comcast customers as well as through 62 network affiliates

Quotient Insights drives opportunity across the business

Further developed our Quotient Insights platform, combining exclusive shopper data from select retailers with unique shopper insights and behaviors from Coupons.com and thousands of publishing partners within our network. Through this platform, we will be able to bring to market enhanced targeting and measurement capabilities across promotions and media. 
Launched over 175 targeted promotional offers. Targeted promotions enable CPGs to digitally market offers with greater precision. 

Company launched QMX, Quotient Media Exchange
The Company also announced today the launch of the Quotient Media Exchange (QMX), a data-driven solution where advertisers can leverage Quotient's reach and exclusive data to serve targeted media across the web and mobile. It combines in-store transaction data with online behavior and purchase intent data from Quotient's flagship brand, Coupons.com, and its thousands of publisher partners. 
QMX is the first product launched using our Quotient Insights Platform, serving our CPG partners and other advertisers with better ways to target consumer segments with effective digital advertising. Through QMX, advertisers can run digital media campaigns targeted at consumer segments based on category purchase, brand or store affinity, geolocations, or other custom criteria that serve brand objectives. As of today, QMX has a potential audience reach of about 55 million in the U.S., enabling advertisers to reach a national audience or a single retailer's customers.
Business Outlook
As of today, Quotient is providing the following business outlook.
For the first quarter 2017, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $70.0 million to $73.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2017 is expected to be in the range of $6.5 million to $7.5 million.  
For the full year 2017, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $307.0 million to $317.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 is expected to be in the range of $40.0 million to $45.0 million.
A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to a corresponding GAAP measure is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and low visibility of certain (income) expense items that are excluded in calculating Adjusted EBITDA.
Company Adds Scott Raskin and Mir Aamir to its Board of Directors
The Company appointed two new members to the Board of Directors, effective February 7, 2017: Scott Raskin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Spigit, and Mir Aamir, President and COO of Quotient. Raskin will also serve as a member of the Compensation Committee.

Prior to working at Spigit, he was President and CEO of Mindjet, purchased in 2016 by Corel and President and Chief Operating Officer of Telelogic. He currently serves as Chairman of the Board for Spigit and MariaDB Corporation, and is a member of the Board of Directors for Temporary Housing, Inc. Raskin is a charter member of the San Francisco Bay Chapter of the Young Presidents Organization and graduated from the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, Austin. 
Aamir joined Quotient in 2013 as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. He was promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer in 2015. He brings more than 18 years of finance, strategy and operating experience, primarily in the retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) industries.

A replay of the webcast will be available on the website following the conference call.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Quotient has presented Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, in this press release, because it is a key measure used by Quotient's management and board of directors to understand and evaluate core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve its annual budget, to develop short and long-term operational plans, and to determine bonus payouts and executive officer compensation. In particular, the Company believes that the exclusion of the income (expenses) eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of its core business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure used by the compensation committee of the board of directors in connection with the determination of compensation for its executive officers. Accordingly, Quotient believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company's operating results in the same manner as the Company's management and board of directors. Quotient defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income/(loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other income (expense) – net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, net change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, one-time charge associated with certain distribution fees, gain on sale of right to use a web domain name and charges related to: Enterprise Resource Planning software implementation costs.
Quotient's use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Quotient's financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; and 
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (i) changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (ii) the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; (iii) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to Quotient; (iv) the effects of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other income (expense) – net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, net change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration,  one time charge for certain distribution fees, gain on sale of right to use a web domain name and charges related to Enterprise Resource Planning software implementation costs; and (v) other companies, including companies in its industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.

This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because of these and other limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss, and the Company's other GAAP financial results.
For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest comparable GAAP financial measure, see "Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA" included in this press release.
