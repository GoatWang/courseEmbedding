If you reside in one of those countries, then where California law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, you agree that this EULA, and any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, issue, or request for relief relating to this EULA, will be governed by the laws of California, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction. Any action or proceeding relating to this EULA must be brought in a federal or state court located in San Mateo County, California and each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such claim or dispute, except that Verkada may seek injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property or Confidential Information. 14.
