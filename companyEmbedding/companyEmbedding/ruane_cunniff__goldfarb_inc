 About Us
                    Sequoia Fund is a mutual fund advised by Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb Inc since its founding in 1969. In managing the Fund, Ruane, Cunniff pursues a value-oriented approach, seeking to outperform over the long-term by purchasing shares, at prices below our estimated range of their intrinsic values, in high-quality businesses that have significant and durable competitive advantages and that we believe can compound the Fund's capital at attractive rates over the long-term.

We invest with the mindset of a business owner, because we believe that the only reliable way to value stocks and invest in them successfully is to think of them as interests in the long-term profits of a business.

The long-term perspective we take informs how we think, what we do, and how we construct our portfolios. We focus exclusively on things we can understand, like the quality of a business franchise, the competence of a management team, and the structure of an industry, rather than factors we consider inherently unpredictable, like the direction of the economy or the sentiment of the stock market.

We spend virtually all of our time researching the strengths, weaknesses and prospects of individual companies. Because this work is painstaking and difficult, we focus our holdings on a small group of businesses. This focus allows us to know what we own, and should also allow us to outperform if we use our research to make thoughtful judgments.

 About Us
                    Sequoia Fund is a mutual fund advised by Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb Inc since its founding in 1969. In managing the Fund, Ruane, Cunniff pursues a value-oriented approach, seeking to outperform over the long-term by purchasing shares, at prices below our estimated range of their intrinsic values, in high-quality businesses that have significant and durable competitive advantages and that we believe can compound the Fund's capital at attractive rates over the long-term.

We invest with the mindset of a business owner, because we believe that the only reliable way to value stocks and invest in them successfully is to think of them as interests in the long-term profits of a business.

The long-term perspective we take informs how we think, what we do, and how we construct our portfolios. We focus exclusively on things we can understand, like the quality of a business franchise, the competence of a management team, and the structure of an industry, rather than factors we consider inherently unpredictable, like the direction of the economy or the sentiment of the stock market.

We spend virtually all of our time researching the strengths, weaknesses and prospects of individual companies. Because this work is painstaking and difficult, we focus our holdings on a small group of businesses. This focus allows us to know what we own, and should also allow us to outperform if we use our research to make thoughtful judgments.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
