Lilly Endowment, Inc. - Religion











  

		
 

		












































RELIGION
The ultimate aim of Lilly Endowment's religion grantmaking is to deepen and enrich the religious lives of American Christians, primarily by helping to strengthen their congregations. To that end, our religion grantmaking in recent years has consisted largely of a series of major, interlocking initiatives aimed at enhancing and sustaining the quality of ministry in American congregations and parishes.
The Endowment has focused on supporting programs and projects that address three broad questions: How do we identify, recruit and call forth a new generation of talented Christian pastors? How do we best prepare and train new ministers for effective and faithful pastoral leadership? How do we improve the skills and sustain the excellence of pastors currently serving congregations? We also fund efforts that enhance the vitality of local congregations and that enable ordinary church members to mine the deep wisdom of the Christian faith and to take up their vocations in the life of the world as people of faith.
Convictions
Our efforts are premised on the conviction that the local congregation is the primary place where most Christians gather in community to worship God, to learn what it means to be people of faith, to teach the beliefs and practices of Christian faith to each new generation, and to reach out to others in service and witness. Strong, vital congregations play powerful roles in the lives of those who participate in them as well as to the larger civic communities of which they are a part.
Several additional convictions also shape the Endowment's religion funding. First, we believe that the quality of pastoral leadership is critical to the health and vitality of congregations. When well-prepared, thoughtful, imaginative, able and caring pastors lead congregations, they tend to thrive. Second, theological schools play a critical role in preparing pastors for their leadership responsibilities in congregations. They are uniquely equipped to provide the deep and sustained exploration of the wisdom of the Christian tradition and the practical training pastors need in order to lead their congregations and serve their people well. Third, there is a still wider ecology of institutions (including colleges and universities, publishers and communications media, denominational judicatories and independent agencies) that support congregations and their pastoral leaders as well as conduct other crucial ministries. The Endowment seeks both to support them directly and to enable them to work collaboratively to address key challenges facing local congregations and pastoral leaders. Finally, ongoing research and other forms of sustained intellectual inquiry are necessary to help all these institutions and leaders understand and address the fundamental issues facing the church and religious life in our society today.
Initiatives
In light of these convictions, the Endowment's religion initiatives have been designed: to identify, recruit and call forth a new generation of talented Christian pastors; to enhance the capacities of theological schools to prepare and sustain ministers in effective and faithful pastoral leadership; to assist new pastors as they make their transition from theological seminary into the first several years of the actual practice of congregational ministry; and to provide opportunities for established pastors to renew and sustain their commitments to and excellence in pastoral ministry over the course of their careers. In addition, the Endowment has launched a relatively new initiative that is supporting regional denominational judicatories serving congregations in Indiana to identify and address critical economic challenges faced by their pastors and families.


Most of the Endowmen's religion grants are made in the context of large-scale programmatic
initiatives like those described above. In launching and sustaining these initiatives, the
Endowment prepares requests for proposals on specific themes or issues that it then sends
out to selected institutions that it believes may be well-suited to mount programs of the kind
the Endowment seeks to support. While most of these programs are currently closed to new
grantees, two of them - the National Clergy Renewal Program and the Clergy Renewal Program
for Indiana Congregations - are open to applications on an annual basis from congregations
that meet each program's selection criteria. (The clergy renewal programs are administered by
Christian Theological Seminary, and more information may be obtained from the CTS website
(www.cts.edu) or by contacting Robert C. Saler at 317/931-4225). In addition to its major initiatives,
the Endowment also provides significant financial support to a number of key institutions that
advance the central purposes of its religion grantmaking.

For more information
For detailed information about the major initiatives the Endowment has previously launched and the work of key institutions it has funded, please visit:

Insights Into Religion: A Gateway to Resources and Institutions (www.religioninsights.org)
This website, funded by Lilly Endowment, is a portal that provides direct access to the websites of many of the organizations that the Endowment has funded to support, connect and resource the broad "ecology" of institutions that together work to enrich and enhance pastoral ministry, congregational vitality and the religious lives of American Christians.
A second website, Resources for American Christianity: Information and Reflection on Selected Projects funded by Lilly Endowment (http://www.resourcingChristianity.org ), provides (1) a comprehensive overview of the Religion Division's five major program areas and the "orienting questions" each seeks to encourage grantees to address, (2) a listing of and information about many of the specific religion grants made over the past 20 years and more, and (3) a variety of essays, interviews and study guides on various projects, programs and initiatives the Endowment has funded.
While these two websites provide the best information available regarding grants, projects and initiatives the Endowment has already funded, information about current grantmaking priorities in religion is available only from the Endowment itself. To inquire, please follow the general instructions for contacting the Endowment available on this website. Institutions that seek funding in the field of religion should know, however, that the Endowment rarely makes grants in response to unsolicited proposals.

Lilly Endowment, Inc. - Guidelines & Procedures











  

		
 

		
























































Grant Guidelines & Procedures
Lilly Endowment receives a few thousand grant requests each year, but we can fund only a small percentage of many worthwhile proposals. These guidelines, formulated over the years by our founders and the Endowment's Board of Directors, govern our grantmaking decisions. 
Areas of interest
We consider proposals in three program areas: community development, education and religion. We also are interested in initiatives that benefit youth and that promote the causes of philanthropy and volunteerism. [return to top]
Community Development
Our community development grantmaking focuses primarily on enhancing the quality of life in Indianapolis and Indiana.  We grant funds for human and social needs, central-city and neighborhood revitalization, low-income housing, and arts and culture in Indianapolis.
On a statewide level, we routinely offer initiatives to support community foundations and United Ways. [return to top] 
Education
Our education grantmaking revolves primarily around our interest in improving education in Indiana, with special emphasis on higher education and on programs designed to increase the percentage of Indiana residents with bachelor's degrees. We support a number of invitational grant programs, many of which are aimed at the abilities of Indiana's colleges and universities to increase the state's educational attainment level. 
We also support on an invitational basis programs that enhance higher education opportunities for African-Americans, Native Americans and Latino Americans throughout the country. [return to top] 
Religion
Our primary aim in this field is to deepen and enrich the religious lives of American Christians, principally by funding efforts to encourage, support and educate a new generation of talented pastors and to strengthen current pastors in their capacities for excellence in ministry. 
We seek to help congregations be vibrant, healthy communities of faith, and we encourage efforts that make accessible the wisdom of the Christian tradition for contemporary life. We support projects that strengthen the contributions that religious ideas, practices, values and institutions make to the common good of our society. We support theological schools and other educational and religious institutions that share these aims.
Our work in religion is national in scope.
[return to top]

Youth and Philanthropy
Besides grantmaking in our three principal areas of community development, education and religion, the Endowment also awards grants in support of youth development and to advance and study philanthropy and the nonprofit sector.
Our youth grants support direct-service organizations in Marion County, Ind., build the capacity of intermediary organizations throughout the state, and provide professional development for the staffs and volunteer leadership of these organizations.
Regarding philanthropy, we seek to support and nurture good stewardship among the trustees and executives of charitable organizations by providing occasional funding for research on the governance and effectiveness of nonprofit organizations.  We also support efforts to advance philanthropy by supporting selective research projects and educational programs focused on charitable giving and fundraising. [return to top] 
Geographic priorities
In keeping with the founders' wishes, the Endowment gives priority to efforts that improve the quality of life in Indianapolis and Indiana. 
This priority applies to grants for community development and elementary/secondary education.  Exceptions include occasional funding for national programs that complement or relate to our work in Indiana. 
The Endowment's interest in higher education extends to Indiana colleges and universities and nationwide to historically black colleges, Native American colleges and programs to increase access to college by Hispanic Americans.  Grants to institutions of higher learning outside Indiana generally are restricted to programs offered by the Endowment on an invitational basis.
Our work in religion is national in scope, as is our support relating to philanthropy and the nonprofit sector. 
Grants for international purposes are limited to a few United States-based economics and public policy programs affecting North and South American countries. [return to top] 
Limitations
The Endowment generally does not support the following:

Loans or cash grants to private individuals. Most grant money is awarded to charitable entities. We do not assist individuals with personal or business-related finances.
Requests to discharge preexisting debts of individuals or organizations.
Healthcare projects.
Mass media projects. The Endowment does not typically fund mass media projects and limits consideration to projects that fall squarely within our specific program areas.
Endowments or endowed chairs. The Endowment targets its grants for specific purposes. Except in unusual cases involving longstanding grantees or special initiatives, we do not contribute to endowments or endowed chairs.
Libraries. Except for special initiatives, the Endowment regularly declines grants to public libraries outside Marion County, Ind.
Outside Indianapolis. Requests usually are declined for building campaigns, elementary/secondary education, arts and culture, human service projects, general operating funds and neighborhood projects (except as part of invitational grant programs).[return to top]
Application process
If you believe your charitable organization has a request that fits within our guidelines, we suggest that you write us a preliminary letter of no more than two pages. The letter proposals tell us about your organization, the project you have in mind and the amount of support you will need from us. We respond in writing to all preliminary inquiries. In cases that warrant further consideration, we may ask you to furnish a full proposal. E-mailed or faxed requests will not be considered.
For arts and cultural organizations in Marion County, Ind. -- Several local grantmaking foundations have collaborated on the development of a shared grant application form. This form was developed in consultation with leaders of local arts and cultural organizations with a goal of making fundraising efforts more efficient. The Shared Grant Application Form may be used to apply for general operating support. For specific project requests, the Project Grant Attachment Form may be completed along with the Shared Grant Application Form. While Lilly Endowment will accept these shared forms from local arts and cultural organizations, applicants are not required to use them, and the Endowment reserves the right to request additional information. Applications may be submitted in hard copy to the attention of Ms. Ronni Kloth, program director. Links to the forms are below.

Approval process
A program director generally reviews grant proposals. Those that meet the criteria for consideration proceed to the appropriate division for review, then to the corporate officers, and finally to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors considers grants in March, June, September, November and December. The grant review process takes three to six months. All grantseekers receive written notification of our decisions.

Lilly Endowment, Inc. - The Endowment










  

		
 

		















































About Lilly EndowmentLilly Endowment Inc. is an Indianapolis-based, private philanthropic foundation created in 1937 by three members of the Lilly family -- J.K. Lilly Sr. and sons J.K. Jr. and Eli -- through gifts of stock in their pharmaceutical business, Eli Lilly and Company. 
Gifts of stock in Eli Lilly and Company remain the financial bedrock of the Endowment. We are, however, a separate entity from the company, with a distinct governing board, staff and location. 
In keeping with the wishes of the three founders, Lilly Endowment exists to support the causes of religion, education and community development. The Endowment affords special emphasis to projects that benefit young people and promote leadership education and financial self-sufficiency in the nonprofit, charitable sector. 
The foremost priority of the Endowment�s founders was to help the people of their city and state build a better life. Although the Endowment also supports efforts of national significance and an occasional international project, we remain primarily committed to our hometown, Indianapolis, and home state, Indiana.

Lilly Endowment, Inc. - Education











  

		
 

		





















































Lilly Endowment views education at all levels as indispensable to personal, civic and economic success. It remains alarmed, therefore, about Indiana's ranking as one of the lowest states in the nation in the percentage of adults, age 25 and over, with a bachelor's degree. Accordingly, raising the educational attainment level of Indiana citizens has been the overriding objective of the Endowment's education grantmaking for the last several years.  In pursuit of this objective, the Endowment has supported research into the factors underlying this low ranking.� Although Indiana's rich agricultural and manufacturing heritage served it well for decades, its economy is now in transition and increasingly more affected by global economic forces.� More Indiana residents and communities must appreciate that higher educational attainment is now essential to foster the quality of life they desire.  Through its education grantmaking, the Endowment is interested in and supports a variety of programs and initiatives that enhance the quality of educational experiences for Indiana residents and help them find meaningful and rewarding employment in the state.� Its grants benefit a range of students, from those in K-12 schools and Indiana colleges and universities to adult students in community college settings.� It funds efforts to strengthen educational institutions and their educational and research programs, enhance the effectiveness and morale of Indiana teachers, provide resources for students to pay for college educations, expand college internship and placement programs,�and engage community residents in supporting improvements in the quality of education.� For additional information about�specific grants, please see the Endowment's press releases and annual reports under the Communications link.�  The Endowment is confident Indiana will meet its educational challenges because of the creativity, resourcefulness and spirit of its residents.� It is heartened by the educational common�ground that is being built through connections among Indiana colleges and universities, their constituents, business organizations, community foundations, K-12 educational organizations, and other progressive programs and organizations in Indiana.

Lilly Endowment, Inc. - Community development











  
    		

 
    		






























































































































As desired by its founders, Lilly Endowment concentrates its philanthropic efforts in community development in its home territory of Indianapolis and Indiana.  
                  
                    For the past few years, the Endowment has focused especially on how its grants promote a "virtuous circle" of community development.��A virtuous circle has been defined as "a condition in which a favorable circumstance or result gives rise to another that subsequently supports the first."� (The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition)
                  

                    The dynamics in the business sector have significant effects on whether there is a virtuous circle of community.� Whether through making cars, developing and selling pharmaceuticals, managing a huge chain store or a small boutique, making art, developing new medical devices or information technology applications, or building engines - the success of such enterprises is absolutely critical for a lively and growing community.
                  

                    Successful businesses give rise to a healthy nonprofit sector.� Caring and concerned citizens are the volunteers and board members of the community's arts and human service organizations, local school corporations, and colleges and universities.� They are the parishioners of the community's congregations.� Their ability to donate funds and share expertise depends on the prosperity of their employers.� Without profitable, vibrant businesses, the community's nonprofit sector would be seriously undermined, and a virtuous circle could be diminished. 
                  

                    In community development, the Endowment finds appealing programs and initiatives that build or enhance the quality of life in Indiana so that vibrant businesses and their employees will want to remain or locate here.� In Indianapolis the Endowment, for example, believes that its grants to the United Way of Central Indiana, Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership, and a range of arts and cultural organizations help these organizations foster a more humane and attractive community.� Its grants for charitable and educational initiatives of the Central Indiana Corporate Partnership and the CICP Foundation also help create the conditions and intellectual capital that are essential for a prosperous economy and help make the community a place that businesses want to call home. 
                  

                    Around the state of Indiana, the Endowment continues its interest in and support of efforts to build the quality of life and civic vitality of Indiana communities.� It does this in two principal ways.� The first is through its support of Indiana's impressive array of community foundations.� Through its Giving Indiana Funds for Tomorrow (GIFT) initiative, which began in 1990, the Endowment has supported the development and flourishing of community foundations in every one of Indiana's 92 counties.� The second is through its support of the Indiana Association of United Ways and its programs to help more than 60 United Ways throughout the state.� In the phrase popularized by Harvard University's Robert Putnam, it is "social capital" that the community foundations and United Ways�are building and sustaining, the capital that is a vital ingredient of a healthy community.

Website

Lilly Endowment Inc., headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, is one of the world's largest private philanthropic foundations and among the largest endowments in the United States. It was founded in 1937 by Josiah K. (J. K.) Lilly Sr. and his sons, Eli Jr. and Josiah Jr. (Joe), with an initial gift of Eli Lilly and Company stock valued at $280,000 USD ($4,616,759 in 2015 chained dollars).[2] As of 2014 its total assets are worth $9.96 billion.[1]
J. K. Lilly Sr. initially served on the foundation's board and became its largest contributor. Over time he donated Eli Lilly and Company stock worth a total of $86.8 million to the foundation, including a $30 million bequest following his death in 1948. J. K's sons, Eli and Joe, contributed additional Eli Lilly and Company stock that had a combined value of $6.8 million. Eli also managed the foundation in its early years.[2][3] The Lilly Endowment's first full-time staff members, Josiah K. Lilly III and G. Harold Duling, were hired in 1951.[4] By the mid-1970s the foundation's staff had increased to seventy-five and it had moved to larger headquarters at 2801 North Meridian Street in Indianapolis.[5]
As required under the Tax Reform Act of 1969, the Lilly Endowment diversified its holdings, but its assets consist primarily of Eli Lilly and Company stock.[3] In 1998 the Lilly Endowment became the wealthiest philanthropic endowment in the world in terms of assets (estimated value of $15.4 billion) and charitable giving. As of 2014 it remains among the top five in terms of total assets ($9.96 billion).[1][3]
The private family foundation is a separate entity from the Eli Lilly and Company pharmaceutical firm, and maintains its headquarters in a different location. With the exception of the Eli Lilly and Company stock that the foundation holds in its portfolio, the Lilly Endowment is not linked to the Lilly pharmaceutical company. The non-profit foundation has its own board of directors to manage its affairs and an executive committee (trustees) that reviews grant requests.[3]
The Lilly Endowment has historically focused on three primary grant areas: community development, education and Christianity. It is the largest private foundation in the United States that funds almost exclusively in its home city and state, and is one of few major foundations to fund religion.[citation needed]

Recipients[edit]
Although it has provided gifts with a national and global reach, the Lilly Endowment's primary geographic focus has been in Indianapolis and in Indiana.[6] Early recipients included the Indianapolis Community Chest, a forerunner of the United Way, the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, Christ Church Cathedral, among other Protestant and, later, Catholic institutions in the state, and several Indiana colleges and universities, such as Wabash College and Earlham College.[7] Other major gifts helped to fund construction projects in downtown Indianapolis, including the Indiana Convention Center, the Hoosier Dome (the city's first, domed stadium), and restoration of several of the city's historic buildings, including the Hilbert Circle Theater, the Indiana Theater, and grants to construct the Indianapolis Zoo, Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, and sports facilities on the Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis campus and elsewhere in the city.[8]
One of the Lilly Endowment's most remarkable achievements is its Giving Indiana Funds for Tomorrow (GIFT) initiative. Since 1987 the initiative has been responsible for starting and growing Indiana community foundations. Today, Indiana has more community foundations than any other state, with combined assets of nearly $1.5 billion.[citation needed]
From its inception the Lilly Endowment has supported numerous religious endeavors. These include Indianapolis's Christ Church Cathedral. J. K. Lilly Sr. was involved with the church throughout his life, beginning as a choirboy. Upon Lilly's death, a stipulation of his bequest to the church was that it remain in the heart of downtown Indianapolis. Lilly supported a wide variety of religious endeavors, which he considered an important means of promoting character development.[citation needed]
Institutions and programs funded by Lilly grants have included:

1966: The Youth Ministry project ($50,000)
1974: Readiness for Ministry for the Association of Theological Schools
1976–82: The introduction of the Readiness for Ministry program to Association of Theological Schools seminaries
1981: Study of Early Adolescents and Their Parents ($273,000)
1988: Effective Christian Education: A National Study of Protestant Congregations
1999–2002: Programs for the Theological Exploration of Vocation. Eighty-eight colleges and universities received a total of $136.5 million to establish or strengthen programs that assisted students in examining the relationship between faith and vocational choices, provided opportunities for gifted young people to explore Christian ministry, and enhanced the capacity of school faculty and staff to effectively teach and mentor students.
2003: Emory University's Youth Theological Initiative (under the university's Candler School of Theology), a center for research and theological youth education that has become a model for such programs across the nation ($2,182,200 over four years)
2010: Manchester University (formerly Manchester College) received $35 million from the Lilly Endowment to establish its College of Pharmacy at the school's Fort Wayne, Indiana, campus.[9] It is the state's third school of pharmacy. The inaugural class, enrolled in the fall of 2012, will graduate in the spring of 2016.[citation needed]

Other Lilly Endowments beneficiaries have included:

The Rockefeller-funded and ecumenical Association of Theological Schools
Search Institute, a psychology-based, not-for-profit, ecumenical youth research organization supported by grants and contracts from foundations, corporations and government agencies, proceeds from the sales of products and services, and tax-deductible contributions from individuals and organizations.[10]
The ecumenical Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) congregations, whose Bethany Project was formed to revitalize congregations by patterning its ministry after Charles E. Fuller, the father of New Evangelicalism.
The Hudson Institute, a conservative nonprofit think tank

Art collection[edit]
Over the years the Lilly Endowment has acquired a collection of important Indiana paintings that were in danger of leaving the state, including works by William Merritt Chase, John Elwood Bundy, and members of the Hoosier Group. The works of art are generally displayed at the foundation's offices on North Meridian Street in Indianapolis. In 2003-05, a number of the paintings appeared in museums around Indiana as part of a special exhibition.[citation needed]

Lilly Endowment Inc., headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, is one of the world's largest private philanthropic foundations and among the largest endowments in the United States. It was founded in 1937 by Josiah K. (J. K.) Lilly Sr. and his sons, Eli Jr. and Josiah Jr. (Joe), with an initial gift of Eli Lilly and Company stock valued at $280,000 USD ($4,616,759 in 2015 chained dollars).[2] As of 2014 its total assets are worth $9.96 billion.[1]
J. K. Lilly Sr. initially served on the foundation's board and became its largest contributor. Over time he donated Eli Lilly and Company stock worth a total of $86.8 million to the foundation, including a $30 million bequest following his death in 1948. J. K's sons, Eli and Joe, contributed additional Eli Lilly and Company stock that had a combined value of $6.8 million. Eli also managed the foundation in its early years.[2][3] The Lilly Endowment's first full-time staff members, Josiah K. Lilly III and G. Harold Duling, were hired in 1951.[4] By the mid-1970s the foundation's staff had increased to seventy-five and it had moved to larger headquarters at 2801 North Meridian Street in Indianapolis.[5]
As required under the Tax Reform Act of 1969, the Lilly Endowment diversified its holdings, but its assets consist primarily of Eli Lilly and Company stock.[3] In 1998 the Lilly Endowment became the wealthiest philanthropic endowment in the world in terms of assets (estimated value of $15.4 billion) and charitable giving. As of 2014 it remains among the top five in terms of total assets ($9.96 billion).[1][3]
The private family foundation is a separate entity from the Eli Lilly and Company pharmaceutical firm, and maintains its headquarters in a different location. With the exception of the Eli Lilly and Company stock that the foundation holds in its portfolio, the Lilly Endowment is not linked to the Lilly pharmaceutical company. The non-profit foundation has its own board of directors to manage its affairs and an executive committee (trustees) that reviews grant requests.[3]
The Lilly Endowment has historically focused on three primary grant areas: community development, education and Christianity. It is the largest private foundation in the United States that funds almost exclusively in its home city and state, and is one of few major foundations to fund religion.[citation needed]

Recipients[edit]
Although it has provided gifts with a national and global reach, the Lilly Endowment's primary geographic focus has been in Indianapolis and in Indiana.[6] Early recipients included the Indianapolis Community Chest, a forerunner of the United Way, the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, Christ Church Cathedral, among other Protestant and, later, Catholic institutions in the state, and several Indiana colleges and universities, such as Wabash College and Earlham College.[7] Other major gifts helped to fund construction projects in downtown Indianapolis, including the Indiana Convention Center, the Hoosier Dome (the city's first, domed stadium), and restoration of several of the city's historic buildings, including the Hilbert Circle Theater, the Indiana Theater, and grants to construct the Indianapolis Zoo, Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, and sports facilities on the Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis campus and elsewhere in the city.[8]
One of the Lilly Endowment's most remarkable achievements is its Giving Indiana Funds for Tomorrow (GIFT) initiative. Since 1987 the initiative has been responsible for starting and growing Indiana community foundations. Today, Indiana has more community foundations than any other state, with combined assets of nearly $1.5 billion.[citation needed]
From its inception the Lilly Endowment has supported numerous religious endeavors. These include Indianapolis's Christ Church Cathedral. J. K. Lilly Sr. was involved with the church throughout his life, beginning as a choirboy. Upon Lilly's death, a stipulation of his bequest to the church was that it remain in the heart of downtown Indianapolis. Lilly supported a wide variety of religious endeavors, which he considered an important means of promoting character development.[citation needed]
Institutions and programs funded by Lilly grants have included:

1966: The Youth Ministry project ($50,000)
1974: Readiness for Ministry for the Association of Theological Schools
1976–82: The introduction of the Readiness for Ministry program to Association of Theological Schools seminaries
1981: Study of Early Adolescents and Their Parents ($273,000)
1988: Effective Christian Education: A National Study of Protestant Congregations
1999–2002: Programs for the Theological Exploration of Vocation. Eighty-eight colleges and universities received a total of $136.5 million to establish or strengthen programs that assisted students in examining the relationship between faith and vocational choices, provided opportunities for gifted young people to explore Christian ministry, and enhanced the capacity of school faculty and staff to effectively teach and mentor students.

Wallace Yakey, Lilly Endowment Inc. — Inside Philanthropy






























































































The Gatekeepers























































May 23, 2014

Wallace Yakey, Lilly Endowment Inc.

May 23, 2014/


Jack Grauer



TITLE: Vice President, Community Development
FUNDING AREAS: Housing and economic development
CONTACT: yakeyw@lei.org, 317-916-7307
IP TAKE: The jump from the Indianapolis Economic Development Corp. to Lilly Endowment Inc. must have been an exciting one for Wallace Yakey. It gave him the opportunity to switch hats from the guy responsible for garnering funds for development projects in the state of Indiana to the guy in charge of providing that same money for other people's projects.
PROFILE: After 15 years as Program Director of Community Development at Lilly Endowment Inc., Wallace R. ("Ace" to his friends) Yakey, Jr. was promoted to Vice President in December 2012. Lilly's community development program "finds appealing programs and initiatives that build or enhance the quality of life in Indiana so that vibrant businesses and their employees will want to remain or locate here." The endeavor takes a variety of forms, including investments in the United Way of Central Indiana (for which Yakey previously worked) and Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership, in addition to a variety of arts and culture initiatives.
Yakey's responsibilities at Lilly differ from his previous work in real estate and economic development by only a hair's width. As president of the non-profit Indianapolis Economic Development Corp. (IEDC), a position he left in 1997 to join Lilly, Yakey oversaw studies that examined which "types of business are likely to be attracted to the region given its existing labor force and business climates." Another study he oversaw looked at "suppliers of major Indianapolis corporations who might be wooed to move here." IEDC works closely with the office of the mayor in Indianapolis. More recently, it led a trade commission through Europe, with dates in Germany, Italy, and the UK, to stimulate interest in investors from these areas to outsource jobs to Indiana.
Yakey is an educational product of Indiana as well, receiving his bachelor's degree from Hanover  College and master's in social work from Indiana University. He spent  much of his early career as a marketing director at Browning Investments Inc., as a real estate broker with Thomas & Associates, and as an assistant campaign director for United Way of Central Indiana. He is a Trustee for St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Indianapolis, and according to Lilly Endowment's press release at the time of his promotion, Yakey has served as a board member for many Indianapolis area community and civic organizations. According to Indiana Business Journal, he has a love for mountaineering, including success at scaling Alaska's Mount McKinley.
