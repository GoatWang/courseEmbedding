					Full Description



Emisphere Technologies, Inc. (Emisphere), incorporated on July 21, 1986, is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical and drug delivery company. The Company, in partnership with pharmaceutical companies, develops new formulations of existing products, as well as new chemical entities, using its Eligen Technology. The Company's prescription medical food product is oral Eligen B12. The Company utilizes its Eligen Technology to create new oral formulations of therapeutic agents. The Company's product pipeline includes prescription drug and medical food product candidates that are being developed in partnership or internally. The Company's preclinical programs focus on the development of oral formulations of new treatments for diabetes and products in the areas of cardiovascular, appetite suppression and pain, and on the development and expansion of nutritional supplement products.The Eligen Technology is an applicable oral drug delivery technology based on the use of synthetic chemical compounds known as Eligen delivery agents or carriers. These carriers facilitate and enable the transport of therapeutic macromolecules (such as proteins, peptides and polysaccharides) and poorly absorbed small molecules across biological membranes. The Eligen Technology not only facilitates absorption, but also acts in the upper sections of the gastrointestinal tract where absorption is thought to occur. Furthermore, Eligen Technology carriers are absorbed, distributed, metabolized and eliminated from the body, and they do not accumulate in the organs and tissues and are considered safe at anticipated doses and dosing regimens. The Company's development partner, Novo Nordisk A/S, has begun Phase IIIa testing of OG217SC with Emisphere's Sodium N-(8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl) Amino) Caprylate (SNAC) carrier. Its Oral Eligen B12 Rx is a once-daily oral prescription medical food tablet shown to normalize B12 levels without the need for an injection. Eligen B12 meets unmet patient and medical needs by combining vitamin B12 with its Eligen technology. Eligen B12 Rx is indicated for the dietary management of patients having a medically-diagnosed vitamin B12 deficiency, associated with a disease or condition that cannot be managed by a modification of the normal diet alone.

Utilizing our experience in researching, developing and manufacturing a number of fully characterized carriers in our extensive library, our partners leverage our expertise to employ our unique intracellular delivery mechanism to advance their portfolio and create differentiated line extensions.

Cubist Pharmaceuticals and Emisphere Technologies Announce Research Collaboration for Oral Delivery of Daptomycin
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBST) and Emisphere Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: EMIS) today announced a research and development collaboration to utilize Emisphere's oral drug delivery technology for Cubist's late-stage development product Cidecin (daptomycin for injection) and other lipopeptides. This agreement follows successful completion of proof-of-principle feasibility studies using Emisphere carrier molecules and daptomycin.  
Cidecin is the first in a new class of antibiotics that has demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to current therapies. Multiple, global Phase III EDGE (Evaluation of Daptomycin in Gram-positive Entities) trials are currently underway investigating Cidecin's efficacy in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (EDGESST), community-acquired pneumonia (EDGECAP) and complicated urinary tract infection (EDGEUTI). Cidecin is also involved in two, open-label Phase II studies-one for the treatment of bacteremia and another for the treatment of bacterial infections, including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, complicated UTI, intra-abdominal infection and pneumonia, in patients who are resistant, refractory or contraindicated (RRC) to other therapies. 
Scott M. Rocklage, Ph.D., Chairman, President and CEO of Cubist commented, "This collaboration is the first of what we hope will be a series of announcements realizing Cubist's new initiative to expand our antiinfective portfolio, initially focusing on oral formulations of our lead molecule daptomycin. We are extremely encouraged to have achieved the desired therapeutic effect in an infected animal model. We are hopeful that together, Cubist and Emisphere will be able to provide Cidecin to the medical community in both oral and IV formulations." 
"We are delighted to add Cubist to our growing list of biotechnology and pharmaceutical partners," said Dr. Michael M. Goldberg, Emisphere's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Due to daptomycin's inherent low oral bioavailability, we are particularly pleased to have identified carrier molecules capable of facilitating transport of the drug across the intestinal lining. We believe the success to date here further demonstrates the robustness of Emisphere's oral drug delivery technology and we anticipate being able to assist with additional programs utilizing other lipopeptide antibiotics from Cubist. Further, the ability to treat infectious disease patients with Cidecin on an out-patient basis could be an important contributor to a reduction in healthcare costs." 
Under the terms of the agreement, Emisphere could receive fees, research funding and milestone payments totaling $30 million should a product be successfully commercialized. Emisphere would also receive a royalty on sales of any product resulting from the collaboration, while Cubist would be responsible for drug development and would receive exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to any oral products. 
Cubist Pharmaceuticals is focused on becoming a global leader in the research, development and commercialization of novel antimicrobial drugs to combat serious and life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections. Cubist is evaluating the safety and efficacy of Cidecin (daptomycin for injection) in the EDGE (Evaluation of Daptomycin in Gram-positive Entities) clinical trial program and is engaged in multiple, strategic partnerships, including Novartis Pharma AG, Merck & Co. and the Schering- Plough Research Institute for the discovery and development of novel antiinfectives. Cubist recently completed the acquisition of TerraGen Discovery Inc., a private, natural products discovery company with operations in Vancouver, BC, Canada and Slough, UK. 
Emisphere Technologies, Inc., is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the oral delivery of otherwise injectable drugs. By applying its unique carrier technology, the Company has taken a leadership position in solving the oral delivery of proteins, peptides and other marcromolecules produced by both pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Three Emisphere formulations, including a solid oral dosage formulation of heparin, are in human clinical trials being conducted by Emisphere and its partners. Emisphere develops pharmaceutical products for its own portfolio and has several strategic alliances and ongoing feasibility studies with many of the world's leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Novartis Pharma AG, Eli Lilly and Company, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
