my husband and I both agreed that this stuff was a mood killer! Felt nothing! It's so sticky and creates more friction than eliminating it like a lubricant is supposed to do. We will not be using this again!

Q
 How do I apply lubricant and how much do I need?


A
There are really no rules here. The best thing to do is just relax, enjoy and experiment. If trying it for the first time, simply squeeze a little lubricant onto your fingertips and gently apply to your intimate areas. Lubricant can be used with or without a condom, either when it is already on or before. Take care not to use too much before you put the condom on, otherwise it may slip off during sex. You can always apply more if you need it.

A
 KY lubes are safe to use all over the body.






Q

Beyond Intercourse: A Recipe for Her Orgasm



Featured







When it comes to the female orgasm; women want them, men want to provide them and yet surprisingly, few are sure on how to achieve them. Although technique is part of it, there are many other factors that come into play when it comes to achieving an orgasm. Find out how you and your partner can get the most out of your intimate moments, as you both relax and ease your way into orgasmic bliss.  It all starts with pre-sex:Contrary to popular belief, the female orgasm isn’t mechanical, able to be programmed at the drop of a dime. While sex for men are usually able to disassociate sexual desires from their feelings, whereas most women are more likely to be aroused by her partner’s desire for her, surroundings, and a relaxing atmosphere that encourages affection.  For most women, feeling wanted and appreciated by their partners can have a positive reaction on their sex life and allow them to become more respondent to their partner’s advances. Some experts also suggest that the pre-sex preparation can begin long before the clothes come off. Taking her on a date, cooking her dinner, or helping her around the house for example all help her unwind and feel cared for, which will then spill over in to the bedroom. Think of it as ‘subconscious foreplay’. Add foreplayMany women like much longer foreplay than their partners realize. This may, therefore, be linked to a subconscious feeling by the woman that she wants to feel affection and pleasure by her partner, rather than just feeling that he is in a hurry to reach his own climax. Women like to experience different things when it comes to foreplay, so try to mix it up with your partner, and don’t be afraid to ask her what she wants and what feels good for her. Many studies suggest that oral sex is the most effective for women to climax, so perhaps start with your fingers and then move down with your lips the closer you think she is getting to orgasm. Do try other things too if oral sex doesn’t do it for her. Gently touching and kissing all the female erogenous zones – legs, breasts, neck and ears – can really heat things up too. Be sensitive and responsive when you get a good reaction to something - keep going. Go Longer According to the Kinsey Institute, while 85% of men believe that their partners had an orgasm during their last sexual encounter, only 64% women reported actually experiencing one. To combat this, when you are having sex, opt for positions that are less stimulating for him and more effective for her. Spooning, for example, is a very romantic position, meaning that the woman can feel her partner’s arms around her, feeling safe and comfortable, which should help her relax into it and bring her closer to orgasm. This position also has a far gentler pace and shallower penetration, than say the missionary, which means he is less likely to get aroused too quickly – so will hopefully be more in sync with her. In addition to incorporating sex positions that help focus on slowing things down, add K-Y Duration™ lubricant to help prolong the time until ejaculation while giving you the control to stay in the moment longer. Mix it upA lot of couples tend to have the same routine when it comes to foreplay and sex, therefore, sometimes orgasms are harder to achieve as the woman generally knows what’s going to happen next. If, however, you try to vary from your routine, perhaps trying a new position or introducing a sex toy, then both partners will feel a heightened sense of excitement, thus making climax easier. Also, switching the location of your embrace can be helpful too - if you normally only have sex in the bedroom, try moving to the kitchen or the bathroom for a change and enjoy the sensation of doing something a little different together.



 

















Sexual Performance Anxiety: How to Overcome in the Bedroom



Featured







Sexual performance anxiety affects almost all men at some point in their sex lives; however, that should come as no surprise. For most, sex is both an emotional and physical act. However, stress on the body can heavily impact the way the body responds to intimacy. With the help of 5 tips, you can learn how to reduce performance anxieties for a calmer, more fulfilling sex life. Stop thinking of sex as a ‘performance’Some men view sex as a demonstration of their manhood - they think it's all about how ‘big’ they should be and how well they perform. This preoccupation with performance can be a problem when it comes to anxiety. Rather than a romantic encounter, sex becomes goal orientated. By changing the psyche, you can improve the situation and reduce the need to panic. Sex should be based on connecting with your partner and providing an atmosphere where you two can physically and mentally connect. Address any anxietiesWhen experiencing anxiety, the body goes into a heightened state of alert- causing difficulty for your partner to maintain an erection. However, sexual anxiety can be addressed through a number of relaxation techniques. Whether you decide to partake in regular workouts or want to improve your breathing through yoga; these activities can help decrease blood pressure and muscle tension in the body, making for a better and more improved performance in the bedroom. CommunicationCommunication is vital in any relationship, but all the more so to address sexual anxieties. Talking with your partner can improve your connection while allowing you both the opportunity to discuss your fears and concerns. Don't be afraid to reveal your desires and fantasies, while remaining open to your partner's feedback and suggestions. Being clear on what you both need, want and expect can prevent you from making it a bigger issue than it needs to be. Clear your mindSex is undoubtedly important in a loving relationship; however, worrying or over thinking about outside problems can inhibit your performance. Instead, focus on kissing, cuddling, and holding your partner. By relaxing and staying in the moment, you are able to enjoy each more making it a more pleasurable experience. For a better time with your partner; let sex happen spontaneously, preferably without any forward planning as this can help clear your mind and increase passion. K-Y ® Duration  is another great addition to add to your bedroom routine for a longer, more pleasurable connection with your partner.  Lifestyle changesCertain lifestyle changes can help to address anxiety issues. For example, eating a balanced diet, getting more sleep, and partaking in regular exercise, can help to combat sexual concerns. However, the abuse of drugs and alcohol can also have long-term detrimental physiological impacts on performance and should be avoided. For some, these can be a short term fix for relaxation; but over time, they can in fact lead to greater anxiety and further complicate problems. By eliminating these substances, it can help improve your general health for a more substantial and better sex life.



 

















5 Ways to Get More Sleep 



Featured







Researchers have uncovered that inefficient sleep quantity is associated with increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. To help maximize the amount of sleep you get each night, incorporate a healthy sleep routine. This can make the difference between a restlessness night and a peaceful slumber. Here are 5 simple tips to get the most out of your sleep routine. Remove any distractionsA study published in the journal Nature revealed that artificial blue light emitted from electronic devices such as your smart phone or tablet can activate neurons within the brain that can prevent you from feeling tired. Light can trigger an increase in heart rate, body temperature and brain activity level; therefore, blue light that is emitted by electronic gadgets can disrupt your melatonin levels. To get the most restful sleep, shut off your devices an hour before sleep. If you are not tired or struggle with sleeping, read a book or spend time with your partner. Avoid caffeineWhile caffeine cannot replace sleep, it can temporarily make one feel more alert by blocking sleep-inducing chemicals in the brain and increasing adrenaline production. Most people consume coffee or soda during the day, and caffeine can stay in the body for several hours, long after a drink was had. Therefore, it is best to limit the amount of caffeine you drink for a minimum of six hours prior to bedtime. Create a sleep-inducing environmentIf you toss and turn most nights, a dark, quiet, and cool environment can help improve sleep. Any source of light, be it an overhead lamp or something as small as a digital clock, can inhibit the secretion of melatonin, which is the hormone that promotes sleep. Your body temperature naturally drops while you sleep, so cooling down your bedroom can help speed up the process and allow you to doze off quicker. However, as your body transitions through different stages of sleep, any unexpected noise can disrupt your sleep causing you to have more shallow cycles. To prevent this, limit any outside noises by playing soft, calming music. Have a patternKeep your mealtime and bedtime consistent even on the weekends as your body establishes a routine. Whether it’s getting to bed at 10 PM or listening to relaxing music before you fall asleep, keeping a regular schedule not only increases the amount of sleep you can receive each night, it can also improve the quality, ensuring you feel alert and refreshed the next morning. Become more activeExercising three times a week for 20-30 minutes can have a noticeable impact on the quality of your sleep while also improving your overall fitness. Exercise is a great way to get your heart pumping while arousing the nervous system to help achieve and maintain sleep. However, try to avoid strenuous exercise in the evening and before bedtime as this can disrupt your sleep.

History[edit]




Lexmark Headquarters, Lexington, KY


Lexmark was formed on March 27, 1991 when IBM divested a number of its hardware manufacturing operations, including printer and printer supply operations, to the investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc. in a leveraged buyout.[2][3][4][5] Lexmark became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange on November 15, 1995.[6]
It was reported in April 2016 that Lexmark would be acquired by Apex Technology and PAG Asia Capital for $3.6 billion USD. Lexmark was set to be acquired at $40.50 per share in the transaction.[7] Initial talks for the acquisition were begun at the Remax World Expo in 2015.[8] The deal was closed on November 29, 2016. Lexmark stated that its headquarters would remain in Lexington, and that its enterprise software line of business would be spun off and "rebranded" to Kofax.[9]
Operations[edit]
The firm's corporate headquarters is located in Lexington and research and development (R&D) offices are distributed globally with additional R&D facilities located in Boulder, Colorado; Lenexa, Kansas; Cebu, Philippines; Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Berlin, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden[10] and Irvine, California.[11] Lexmark has offices throughout North and South America, Asia, Africa and Europe. The company has more than 12,000 employees worldwide.
Acquisitions[edit]

In May 2010, Lexmark acquired Perceptive Software for $280 million to build upon its software offerings.[12] Perceptive Software was a software firm that developed enterprise content management (ECM) and document output management (DOM) applications.
In 2011, Lexmark International purchased Netherlands-based Pallas Athena in a cash transaction valued at approximately $50.2 million.[13] The purchase of Pallas Athena added business process management (BPM), document output management (DOM) and process mining software capabilities to Lexmark's services.
In March 2012, Lexmark announced the acquisition of Luxembourg-based BDGB Enterprise, including its U.S. subsidiary Brainware, Inc., for a cash purchase price of approximately $148 million.[14] Brainware's intelligent data capture platform extracted critical information from paper and electronic documents, validated the extracted data and passed it to customers' data management systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and/or financial management systems.
In March 2012, Lexmark acquired Australia-based ISYS Search Software and U.S.-based Nolij Corporation, both for $32 million.[15] ISYS built enterprise search solutions and Nolij developed Web-based document imaging and workflow software.
In January 2013, Lexmark acquired Minnesota-based Acuo Technologies for $45 million. Acuo Technologies developed medical imaging document management software.[16]
In March 2013, Lexmark announced acquisitions of AccessVia and Twistage for a combined purchase price of approximately $31.5 million.[17]
In late August 2013, Lexmark signed an agreement to acquire Germany-based Saperion AG. Saperion was a developer and provider of enterprise content management (ECM) and business process management (BPM) software in Europe. The company was purchased for $72 million.[18]
In early October 2013, Lexmark acquired PACSGEAR. PACSGEAR was a provider of connectivity solutions for medical image management and electronic health records. The company was purchased for approximately $54 million.[19]
In September 2014, Lexmark acquired Stockholm, Sweden-based ReadSoft for $251 million.[20] ReadSoft was a financial process automation solutions company that specialized in software solutions for document process automation on-premises or in the cloud.[21]
In May 2015, Lexmark announced that it had acquired Kofax for roughly $1 billion.[22] Kofax, headquartered in Irvine, California, was a provider of smart process applications. They combined capture, process management, analytics and mobile capabilities to organizations.[11] This line of business was, in turn, spun off from Lexmark when it was acquired by Apex Technology in November 2016.[9]

Inkjet exit[edit]
In August 2012, Lexmark announced that it would stop production of its inkjet printer line.[23][24] Lexmark will continue to provide service, support and aftermarket supplies for its inkjet installed base.[25]
In April 2013, Funai Electric Company, Ltd. announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire Lexmark's inkjet technology and assets for approximately $100 million (approximately ¥9.5 billion). Funai acquired more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmark's inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets.[26]
Legal cases[edit]
Lexmark pioneered the use of profits from ink cartridges as a business model, with the result of modifying the legal models of product ownership and patent exhaustion over several years.[27]
A court victory in 2005 was handed to Lexmark in the case of ACRA v. Lexmark. This case states that Lexmark can enforce the "single use only" policy written on the side of Lexmark printer cartridge boxes sold to certain large customers at a discount, with the understanding that the customers will return the cartridges to Lexmark after using them. This means that these customers can face lawsuits if they breach the agreements, and do not return the cartridges.
Also in 2005, Lexmark suffered a legal defeat in the case of Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lexmark's petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby rejecting their attempt to have the Court hear their case. In this case, the defendant was a manufacturer of microchips that allowed third-party ink and toner cartridges to work on printers, including many manufactured by Lexmark. Such printers incorporated a feature that would require authentication from a microchip within the ink/toner cartridge in order to function; this was designed to prohibit users from refilling the cartridges. However, a recent firmware update allowed Lexmark to prevent end users from refilling ink cartridges or using third-party ink cartridges.
Lexmark also lost in the Surpreme Court case Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc. in 1 7-1 ruling that reversed and remanded a Federal Circuit court decision (30 May 2017):

When a patentee chooses to sell an item, that product is no longer within the limits of the monopoly and instead becomes the private, individual property of the purchaser, with the rights and benefits that come along with ownership. A patentee is free to set the price and negotiate contracts with purchasers, but may not, by virtue of his patent, control the use or disposition of the product after ownership passes to the purchaser. The sale terminates all patent rights to that item.[28]

History[edit]




Lexmark Headquarters, Lexington, KY


Lexmark was formed on March 27, 1991 when IBM divested a number of its hardware manufacturing operations, including printer and printer supply operations, to the investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc. in a leveraged buyout.[2][3][4][5] Lexmark became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange on November 15, 1995.[6]
It was reported in April 2016 that Lexmark would be acquired by Apex Technology and PAG Asia Capital for $3.6 billion USD. Lexmark was set to be acquired at $40.50 per share in the transaction.[7] Initial talks for the acquisition were begun at the Remax World Expo in 2015.[8] The deal was closed on November 29, 2016. Lexmark stated that its headquarters would remain in Lexington, and that its enterprise software line of business would be spun off and "rebranded" to Kofax.[9]
Operations[edit]
The firm's corporate headquarters is located in Lexington and research and development (R&D) offices are distributed globally with additional R&D facilities located in Boulder, Colorado; Lenexa, Kansas; Cebu, Philippines; Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Berlin, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden[10] and Irvine, California.[11] Lexmark has offices throughout North and South America, Asia, Africa and Europe. The company has more than 12,000 employees worldwide.
Acquisitions[edit]

In May 2010, Lexmark acquired Perceptive Software for $280 million to build upon its software offerings.[12] Perceptive Software was a software firm that developed enterprise content management (ECM) and document output management (DOM) applications.
In 2011, Lexmark International purchased Netherlands-based Pallas Athena in a cash transaction valued at approximately $50.2 million.[13] The purchase of Pallas Athena added business process management (BPM), document output management (DOM) and process mining software capabilities to Lexmark's services.
In March 2012, Lexmark announced the acquisition of Luxembourg-based BDGB Enterprise, including its U.S. subsidiary Brainware, Inc., for a cash purchase price of approximately $148 million.[14] Brainware's intelligent data capture platform extracted critical information from paper and electronic documents, validated the extracted data and passed it to customers' data management systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and/or financial management systems.
In March 2012, Lexmark acquired Australia-based ISYS Search Software and U.S.-based Nolij Corporation, both for $32 million.[15] ISYS built enterprise search solutions and Nolij developed Web-based document imaging and workflow software.
In January 2013, Lexmark acquired Minnesota-based Acuo Technologies for $45 million. Acuo Technologies developed medical imaging document management software.[16]
In March 2013, Lexmark announced acquisitions of AccessVia and Twistage for a combined purchase price of approximately $31.5 million.[17]
In late August 2013, Lexmark signed an agreement to acquire Germany-based Saperion AG. Saperion was a developer and provider of enterprise content management (ECM) and business process management (BPM) software in Europe. The company was purchased for $72 million.[18]
In early October 2013, Lexmark acquired PACSGEAR. PACSGEAR was a provider of connectivity solutions for medical image management and electronic health records. The company was purchased for approximately $54 million.[19]
In September 2014, Lexmark acquired Stockholm, Sweden-based ReadSoft for $251 million.[20] ReadSoft was a financial process automation solutions company that specialized in software solutions for document process automation on-premises or in the cloud.[21]
In May 2015, Lexmark announced that it had acquired Kofax for roughly $1 billion.[22] Kofax, headquartered in Irvine, California, was a provider of smart process applications. They combined capture, process management, analytics and mobile capabilities to organizations.[11] This line of business was, in turn, spun off from Lexmark when it was acquired by Apex Technology in November 2016.[9]

Inkjet exit[edit]
In August 2012, Lexmark announced that it would stop production of its inkjet printer line.[23][24] Lexmark will continue to provide service, support and aftermarket supplies for its inkjet installed base.[25]
In April 2013, Funai Electric Company, Ltd. announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire Lexmark's inkjet technology and assets for approximately $100 million (approximately ¥9.5 billion). Funai acquired more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmark's inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets.[26]
Legal cases[edit]
Lexmark pioneered the use of profits from ink cartridges as a business model, with the result of modifying the legal models of product ownership and patent exhaustion over several years.[27]
A court victory in 2005 was handed to Lexmark in the case of ACRA v. Lexmark. This case states that Lexmark can enforce the "single use only" policy written on the side of Lexmark printer cartridge boxes sold to certain large customers at a discount, with the understanding that the customers will return the cartridges to Lexmark after using them. This means that these customers can face lawsuits if they breach the agreements, and do not return the cartridges.
Also in 2005, Lexmark suffered a legal defeat in the case of Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lexmark's petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby rejecting their attempt to have the Court hear their case. In this case, the defendant was a manufacturer of microchips that allowed third-party ink and toner cartridges to work on printers, including many manufactured by Lexmark. Such printers incorporated a feature that would require authentication from a microchip within the ink/toner cartridge in order to function; this was designed to prohibit users from refilling the cartridges. However, a recent firmware update allowed Lexmark to prevent end users from refilling ink cartridges or using third-party ink cartridges.
Lexmark also lost in the Surpreme Court case Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc. in 1 7-1 ruling that reversed and remanded a Federal Circuit court decision (30 May 2017):

When a patentee chooses to sell an item, that product is no longer within the limits of the monopoly and instead becomes the private, individual property of the purchaser, with the rights and benefits that come along with ownership. A patentee is free to set the price and negotiate contracts with purchasers, but may not, by virtue of his patent, control the use or disposition of the product after ownership passes to the purchaser. The sale terminates all patent rights to that item.[28]

History[edit]




Lexmark Headquarters, Lexington, KY


Lexmark was formed on March 27, 1991 when IBM divested a number of its hardware manufacturing operations, including printer and printer supply operations, to the investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc. in a leveraged buyout.[2][3][4][5] Lexmark became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange on November 15, 1995.[6]
It was reported in April 2016 that Lexmark would be acquired by Apex Technology and PAG Asia Capital for $3.6 billion USD. Lexmark was set to be acquired at $40.50 per share in the transaction.[7] Initial talks for the acquisition were begun at the Remax World Expo in 2015.[8] The deal was closed on November 29, 2016. Lexmark stated that its headquarters would remain in Lexington, and that its enterprise software line of business would be spun off and "rebranded" to Kofax.[9]
Operations[edit]
The firm's corporate headquarters is located in Lexington and research and development (R&D) offices are distributed globally with additional R&D facilities located in Boulder, Colorado; Lenexa, Kansas; Cebu, Philippines; Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Berlin, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden[10] and Irvine, California.[11] Lexmark has offices throughout North and South America, Asia, Africa and Europe. The company has more than 12,000 employees worldwide.
Acquisitions[edit]

In May 2010, Lexmark acquired Perceptive Software for $280 million to build upon its software offerings.[12] Perceptive Software was a software firm that developed enterprise content management (ECM) and document output management (DOM) applications.
In 2011, Lexmark International purchased Netherlands-based Pallas Athena in a cash transaction valued at approximately $50.2 million.[13] The purchase of Pallas Athena added business process management (BPM), document output management (DOM) and process mining software capabilities to Lexmark's services.
In March 2012, Lexmark announced the acquisition of Luxembourg-based BDGB Enterprise, including its U.S. subsidiary Brainware, Inc., for a cash purchase price of approximately $148 million.[14] Brainware's intelligent data capture platform extracted critical information from paper and electronic documents, validated the extracted data and passed it to customers' data management systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and/or financial management systems.
In March 2012, Lexmark acquired Australia-based ISYS Search Software and U.S.-based Nolij Corporation, both for $32 million.[15] ISYS built enterprise search solutions and Nolij developed Web-based document imaging and workflow software.
In January 2013, Lexmark acquired Minnesota-based Acuo Technologies for $45 million. Acuo Technologies developed medical imaging document management software.[16]
In March 2013, Lexmark announced acquisitions of AccessVia and Twistage for a combined purchase price of approximately $31.5 million.[17]
In late August 2013, Lexmark signed an agreement to acquire Germany-based Saperion AG. Saperion was a developer and provider of enterprise content management (ECM) and business process management (BPM) software in Europe. The company was purchased for $72 million.[18]
In early October 2013, Lexmark acquired PACSGEAR. PACSGEAR was a provider of connectivity solutions for medical image management and electronic health records. The company was purchased for approximately $54 million.[19]
In September 2014, Lexmark acquired Stockholm, Sweden-based ReadSoft for $251 million.[20] ReadSoft was a financial process automation solutions company that specialized in software solutions for document process automation on-premises or in the cloud.[21]
In May 2015, Lexmark announced that it had acquired Kofax for roughly $1 billion.[22] Kofax, headquartered in Irvine, California, was a provider of smart process applications. They combined capture, process management, analytics and mobile capabilities to organizations.[11] This line of business was, in turn, spun off from Lexmark when it was acquired by Apex Technology in November 2016.[9]

Inkjet exit[edit]
In August 2012, Lexmark announced that it would stop production of its inkjet printer line.[23][24] Lexmark will continue to provide service, support and aftermarket supplies for its inkjet installed base.[25]
In April 2013, Funai Electric Company, Ltd. announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire Lexmark's inkjet technology and assets for approximately $100 million (approximately ¥9.5 billion). Funai acquired more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmark's inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets.[26]
Legal cases[edit]
Lexmark pioneered the use of profits from ink cartridges as a business model, with the result of modifying the legal models of product ownership and patent exhaustion over several years.[27]
A court victory in 2005 was handed to Lexmark in the case of ACRA v. Lexmark. This case states that Lexmark can enforce the "single use only" policy written on the side of Lexmark printer cartridge boxes sold to certain large customers at a discount, with the understanding that the customers will return the cartridges to Lexmark after using them. This means that these customers can face lawsuits if they breach the agreements, and do not return the cartridges.
Also in 2005, Lexmark suffered a legal defeat in the case of Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lexmark's petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby rejecting their attempt to have the Court hear their case. In this case, the defendant was a manufacturer of microchips that allowed third-party ink and toner cartridges to work on printers, including many manufactured by Lexmark. Such printers incorporated a feature that would require authentication from a microchip within the ink/toner cartridge in order to function; this was designed to prohibit users from refilling the cartridges. However, a recent firmware update allowed Lexmark to prevent end users from refilling ink cartridges or using third-party ink cartridges.
Lexmark also lost in the Surpreme Court case Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc. in 1 7-1 ruling that reversed and remanded a Federal Circuit court decision (30 May 2017):

When a patentee chooses to sell an item, that product is no longer within the limits of the monopoly and instead becomes the private, individual property of the purchaser, with the rights and benefits that come along with ownership. A patentee is free to set the price and negotiate contracts with purchasers, but may not, by virtue of his patent, control the use or disposition of the product after ownership passes to the purchaser. The sale terminates all patent rights to that item.[28]

History[edit]




Lexmark Headquarters, Lexington, KY


Lexmark was formed on March 27, 1991 when IBM divested a number of its hardware manufacturing operations, including printer and printer supply operations, to the investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc. in a leveraged buyout.[2][3][4][5] Lexmark became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange on November 15, 1995.[6]
It was reported in April 2016 that Lexmark would be acquired by Apex Technology and PAG Asia Capital for $3.6 billion USD. Lexmark was set to be acquired at $40.50 per share in the transaction.[7] Initial talks for the acquisition were begun at the Remax World Expo in 2015.[8] The deal was closed on November 29, 2016. Lexmark stated that its headquarters would remain in Lexington, and that its enterprise software line of business would be spun off and "rebranded" to Kofax.[9]
Operations[edit]
The firm's corporate headquarters is located in Lexington and research and development (R&D) offices are distributed globally with additional R&D facilities located in Boulder, Colorado; Lenexa, Kansas; Cebu, Philippines; Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Berlin, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden[10] and Irvine, California.[11] Lexmark has offices throughout North and South America, Asia, Africa and Europe. The company has more than 12,000 employees worldwide.
Acquisitions[edit]

In May 2010, Lexmark acquired Perceptive Software for $280 million to build upon its software offerings.[12] Perceptive Software was a software firm that developed enterprise content management (ECM) and document output management (DOM) applications.
In 2011, Lexmark International purchased Netherlands-based Pallas Athena in a cash transaction valued at approximately $50.2 million.[13] The purchase of Pallas Athena added business process management (BPM), document output management (DOM) and process mining software capabilities to Lexmark's services.
In March 2012, Lexmark announced the acquisition of Luxembourg-based BDGB Enterprise, including its U.S. subsidiary Brainware, Inc., for a cash purchase price of approximately $148 million.[14] Brainware's intelligent data capture platform extracted critical information from paper and electronic documents, validated the extracted data and passed it to customers' data management systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and/or financial management systems.
In March 2012, Lexmark acquired Australia-based ISYS Search Software and U.S.-based Nolij Corporation, both for $32 million.[15] ISYS built enterprise search solutions and Nolij developed Web-based document imaging and workflow software.
In January 2013, Lexmark acquired Minnesota-based Acuo Technologies for $45 million. Acuo Technologies developed medical imaging document management software.[16]
In March 2013, Lexmark announced acquisitions of AccessVia and Twistage for a combined purchase price of approximately $31.5 million.[17]
In late August 2013, Lexmark signed an agreement to acquire Germany-based Saperion AG. Saperion was a developer and provider of enterprise content management (ECM) and business process management (BPM) software in Europe. The company was purchased for $72 million.[18]
In early October 2013, Lexmark acquired PACSGEAR. PACSGEAR was a provider of connectivity solutions for medical image management and electronic health records. The company was purchased for approximately $54 million.[19]
In September 2014, Lexmark acquired Stockholm, Sweden-based ReadSoft for $251 million.[20] ReadSoft was a financial process automation solutions company that specialized in software solutions for document process automation on-premises or in the cloud.[21]
In May 2015, Lexmark announced that it had acquired Kofax for roughly $1 billion.[22] Kofax, headquartered in Irvine, California, was a provider of smart process applications. They combined capture, process management, analytics and mobile capabilities to organizations.[11] This line of business was, in turn, spun off from Lexmark when it was acquired by Apex Technology in November 2016.[9]

Inkjet exit[edit]
In August 2012, Lexmark announced that it would stop production of its inkjet printer line.[23][24] Lexmark will continue to provide service, support and aftermarket supplies for its inkjet installed base.[25]
In April 2013, Funai Electric Company, Ltd. announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire Lexmark's inkjet technology and assets for approximately $100 million (approximately ¥9.5 billion). Funai acquired more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmark's inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets.[26]
Legal cases[edit]
Lexmark pioneered the use of profits from ink cartridges as a business model, with the result of modifying the legal models of product ownership and patent exhaustion over several years.[27]
A court victory in 2005 was handed to Lexmark in the case of ACRA v. Lexmark. This case states that Lexmark can enforce the "single use only" policy written on the side of Lexmark printer cartridge boxes sold to certain large customers at a discount, with the understanding that the customers will return the cartridges to Lexmark after using them. This means that these customers can face lawsuits if they breach the agreements, and do not return the cartridges.
Also in 2005, Lexmark suffered a legal defeat in the case of Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lexmark's petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby rejecting their attempt to have the Court hear their case. In this case, the defendant was a manufacturer of microchips that allowed third-party ink and toner cartridges to work on printers, including many manufactured by Lexmark. Such printers incorporated a feature that would require authentication from a microchip within the ink/toner cartridge in order to function; this was designed to prohibit users from refilling the cartridges. However, a recent firmware update allowed Lexmark to prevent end users from refilling ink cartridges or using third-party ink cartridges.
Lexmark also lost in the Surpreme Court case Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc. in 1 7-1 ruling that reversed and remanded a Federal Circuit court decision (30 May 2017):

When a patentee chooses to sell an item, that product is no longer within the limits of the monopoly and instead becomes the private, individual property of the purchaser, with the rights and benefits that come along with ownership. A patentee is free to set the price and negotiate contracts with purchasers, but may not, by virtue of his patent, control the use or disposition of the product after ownership passes to the purchaser. The sale terminates all patent rights to that item.[28]

History[edit]




Lexmark Headquarters, Lexington, KY


Lexmark was formed on March 27, 1991 when IBM divested a number of its hardware manufacturing operations, including printer and printer supply operations, to the investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc. in a leveraged buyout.[2][3][4][5] Lexmark became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange on November 15, 1995.[6]
It was reported in April 2016 that Lexmark would be acquired by Apex Technology and PAG Asia Capital for $3.6 billion USD. Lexmark was set to be acquired at $40.50 per share in the transaction.[7] Initial talks for the acquisition were begun at the Remax World Expo in 2015.[8] The deal was closed on November 29, 2016. Lexmark stated that its headquarters would remain in Lexington, and that its enterprise software line of business would be spun off and "rebranded" to Kofax.[9]
Operations[edit]
The firm's corporate headquarters is located in Lexington and research and development (R&D) offices are distributed globally with additional R&D facilities located in Boulder, Colorado; Lenexa, Kansas; Cebu, Philippines; Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Berlin, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden[10] and Irvine, California.[11] Lexmark has offices throughout North and South America, Asia, Africa and Europe. The company has more than 12,000 employees worldwide.
Acquisitions[edit]

In May 2010, Lexmark acquired Perceptive Software for $280 million to build upon its software offerings.[12] Perceptive Software was a software firm that developed enterprise content management (ECM) and document output management (DOM) applications.
In 2011, Lexmark International purchased Netherlands-based Pallas Athena in a cash transaction valued at approximately $50.2 million.[13] The purchase of Pallas Athena added business process management (BPM), document output management (DOM) and process mining software capabilities to Lexmark's services.
In March 2012, Lexmark announced the acquisition of Luxembourg-based BDGB Enterprise, including its U.S. subsidiary Brainware, Inc., for a cash purchase price of approximately $148 million.[14] Brainware's intelligent data capture platform extracted critical information from paper and electronic documents, validated the extracted data and passed it to customers' data management systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and/or financial management systems.
In March 2012, Lexmark acquired Australia-based ISYS Search Software and U.S.-based Nolij Corporation, both for $32 million.[15] ISYS built enterprise search solutions and Nolij developed Web-based document imaging and workflow software.
In January 2013, Lexmark acquired Minnesota-based Acuo Technologies for $45 million. Acuo Technologies developed medical imaging document management software.[16]
In March 2013, Lexmark announced acquisitions of AccessVia and Twistage for a combined purchase price of approximately $31.5 million.[17]
In late August 2013, Lexmark signed an agreement to acquire Germany-based Saperion AG. Saperion was a developer and provider of enterprise content management (ECM) and business process management (BPM) software in Europe. The company was purchased for $72 million.[18]
In early October 2013, Lexmark acquired PACSGEAR. PACSGEAR was a provider of connectivity solutions for medical image management and electronic health records. The company was purchased for approximately $54 million.[19]
In September 2014, Lexmark acquired Stockholm, Sweden-based ReadSoft for $251 million.[20] ReadSoft was a financial process automation solutions company that specialized in software solutions for document process automation on-premises or in the cloud.[21]
In May 2015, Lexmark announced that it had acquired Kofax for roughly $1 billion.[22] Kofax, headquartered in Irvine, California, was a provider of smart process applications. They combined capture, process management, analytics and mobile capabilities to organizations.[11] This line of business was, in turn, spun off from Lexmark when it was acquired by Apex Technology in November 2016.[9]

Inkjet exit[edit]
In August 2012, Lexmark announced that it would stop production of its inkjet printer line.[23][24] Lexmark will continue to provide service, support and aftermarket supplies for its inkjet installed base.[25]
In April 2013, Funai Electric Company, Ltd. announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire Lexmark's inkjet technology and assets for approximately $100 million (approximately ¥9.5 billion). Funai acquired more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmark's inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets.[26]
Legal cases[edit]
Lexmark pioneered the use of profits from ink cartridges as a business model, with the result of modifying the legal models of product ownership and patent exhaustion over several years.[27]
A court victory in 2005 was handed to Lexmark in the case of ACRA v. Lexmark. This case states that Lexmark can enforce the "single use only" policy written on the side of Lexmark printer cartridge boxes sold to certain large customers at a discount, with the understanding that the customers will return the cartridges to Lexmark after using them. This means that these customers can face lawsuits if they breach the agreements, and do not return the cartridges.
Also in 2005, Lexmark suffered a legal defeat in the case of Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lexmark's petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby rejecting their attempt to have the Court hear their case. In this case, the defendant was a manufacturer of microchips that allowed third-party ink and toner cartridges to work on printers, including many manufactured by Lexmark. Such printers incorporated a feature that would require authentication from a microchip within the ink/toner cartridge in order to function; this was designed to prohibit users from refilling the cartridges. However, a recent firmware update allowed Lexmark to prevent end users from refilling ink cartridges or using third-party ink cartridges.
Lexmark also lost in the Surpreme Court case Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc. in 1 7-1 ruling that reversed and remanded a Federal Circuit court decision (30 May 2017):

When a patentee chooses to sell an item, that product is no longer within the limits of the monopoly and instead becomes the private, individual property of the purchaser, with the rights and benefits that come along with ownership. A patentee is free to set the price and negotiate contracts with purchasers, but may not, by virtue of his patent, control the use or disposition of the product after ownership passes to the purchaser. The sale terminates all patent rights to that item.[28]

History[edit]




Lexmark Headquarters, Lexington, KY


Lexmark was formed on March 27, 1991 when IBM divested a number of its hardware manufacturing operations, including printer and printer supply operations, to the investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc. in a leveraged buyout.[2][3][4][5] Lexmark became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange on November 15, 1995.[6]
It was reported in April 2016 that Lexmark would be acquired by Apex Technology and PAG Asia Capital for $3.6 billion USD. Lexmark was set to be acquired at $40.50 per share in the transaction.[7] Initial talks for the acquisition were begun at the Remax World Expo in 2015.[8] The deal was closed on November 29, 2016. Lexmark stated that its headquarters would remain in Lexington, and that its enterprise software line of business would be spun off and "rebranded" to Kofax.[9]
Operations[edit]
The firm's corporate headquarters is located in Lexington and research and development (R&D) offices are distributed globally with additional R&D facilities located in Boulder, Colorado; Lenexa, Kansas; Cebu, Philippines; Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Berlin, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden[10] and Irvine, California.[11] Lexmark has offices throughout North and South America, Asia, Africa and Europe. The company has more than 12,000 employees worldwide.
Acquisitions[edit]

In May 2010, Lexmark acquired Perceptive Software for $280 million to build upon its software offerings.[12] Perceptive Software was a software firm that developed enterprise content management (ECM) and document output management (DOM) applications.
In 2011, Lexmark International purchased Netherlands-based Pallas Athena in a cash transaction valued at approximately $50.2 million.[13] The purchase of Pallas Athena added business process management (BPM), document output management (DOM) and process mining software capabilities to Lexmark's services.
In March 2012, Lexmark announced the acquisition of Luxembourg-based BDGB Enterprise, including its U.S. subsidiary Brainware, Inc., for a cash purchase price of approximately $148 million.[14] Brainware's intelligent data capture platform extracted critical information from paper and electronic documents, validated the extracted data and passed it to customers' data management systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and/or financial management systems.
In March 2012, Lexmark acquired Australia-based ISYS Search Software and U.S.-based Nolij Corporation, both for $32 million.[15] ISYS built enterprise search solutions and Nolij developed Web-based document imaging and workflow software.
In January 2013, Lexmark acquired Minnesota-based Acuo Technologies for $45 million. Acuo Technologies developed medical imaging document management software.[16]
In March 2013, Lexmark announced acquisitions of AccessVia and Twistage for a combined purchase price of approximately $31.5 million.[17]
In late August 2013, Lexmark signed an agreement to acquire Germany-based Saperion AG. Saperion was a developer and provider of enterprise content management (ECM) and business process management (BPM) software in Europe. The company was purchased for $72 million.[18]
In early October 2013, Lexmark acquired PACSGEAR. PACSGEAR was a provider of connectivity solutions for medical image management and electronic health records. The company was purchased for approximately $54 million.[19]
In September 2014, Lexmark acquired Stockholm, Sweden-based ReadSoft for $251 million.[20] ReadSoft was a financial process automation solutions company that specialized in software solutions for document process automation on-premises or in the cloud.[21]
In May 2015, Lexmark announced that it had acquired Kofax for roughly $1 billion.[22] Kofax, headquartered in Irvine, California, was a provider of smart process applications. They combined capture, process management, analytics and mobile capabilities to organizations.[11] This line of business was, in turn, spun off from Lexmark when it was acquired by Apex Technology in November 2016.[9]

Inkjet exit[edit]
In August 2012, Lexmark announced that it would stop production of its inkjet printer line.[23][24] Lexmark will continue to provide service, support and aftermarket supplies for its inkjet installed base.[25]
In April 2013, Funai Electric Company, Ltd. announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire Lexmark's inkjet technology and assets for approximately $100 million (approximately ¥9.5 billion). Funai acquired more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmark's inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets.[26]
Legal cases[edit]
Lexmark pioneered the use of profits from ink cartridges as a business model, with the result of modifying the legal models of product ownership and patent exhaustion over several years.[27]
A court victory in 2005 was handed to Lexmark in the case of ACRA v. Lexmark. This case states that Lexmark can enforce the "single use only" policy written on the side of Lexmark printer cartridge boxes sold to certain large customers at a discount, with the understanding that the customers will return the cartridges to Lexmark after using them. This means that these customers can face lawsuits if they breach the agreements, and do not return the cartridges.
Also in 2005, Lexmark suffered a legal defeat in the case of Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lexmark's petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby rejecting their attempt to have the Court hear their case. In this case, the defendant was a manufacturer of microchips that allowed third-party ink and toner cartridges to work on printers, including many manufactured by Lexmark. Such printers incorporated a feature that would require authentication from a microchip within the ink/toner cartridge in order to function; this was designed to prohibit users from refilling the cartridges. However, a recent firmware update allowed Lexmark to prevent end users from refilling ink cartridges or using third-party ink cartridges.
Lexmark also lost in the Surpreme Court case Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc. in 1 7-1 ruling that reversed and remanded a Federal Circuit court decision (30 May 2017):

When a patentee chooses to sell an item, that product is no longer within the limits of the monopoly and instead becomes the private, individual property of the purchaser, with the rights and benefits that come along with ownership. A patentee is free to set the price and negotiate contracts with purchasers, but may not, by virtue of his patent, control the use or disposition of the product after ownership passes to the purchaser. The sale terminates all patent rights to that item.[28]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto presented under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  OVERVIEW  Products and Segments  Lexmark makes it easier for businesses of all sizes to improve their business processes by enabling them to capture, manage and access critical unstructured business information in the context of their business processes while speeding the movement and management of information between the paper and digital worlds. Since its inception in 1991, Lexmark has become a leading developer, manufacturer and supplier of printing, imaging, device management, MPS, document workflow and, more recently, business process and content management solutions. The Company operates in the office printing and imaging, ECM, BPM, DOM/CCM, intelligent content capture and data extraction and enterprise search software markets. Lexmark's products include laser printers and multifunction devices, dot matrix printers and the associated supplies/solutions/services. They also include an integrated suite of ECM, BPM and DOM/CCM that includes case management, electronic signature, process analytics, information and application integration, intelligent content capture and data extraction, enterprise search, medical imaging VNA software products and solutions.  In April 2015, the Company announced a strategic rebranding action to unify and strengthen the market presence of the Company's information technology portfolio of enterprise software, print hardware and MPS. As part of the rebranding action, the Company elected to change the name of its Perceptive Software segment to Lexmark Enterprise Software. Certain software products will still include the Perceptive Software name.  The Company is managed along two operating segments: ISS and Enterprise Software.   ISS offers a broad portfolio of color and monochrome laser printers and laser MFPs, as well as supplies, software applications, software solutions and MPS to help businesses efficiently capture, manage and access information. Laser based products within the distributed printing market primarily serve business customers. ISS employs large-account sales and marketing teams whose mission is to generate demand for its business printing solutions and services, primarily among large corporations, small and medium businesses, as well as the public sector. These sales and marketing teams primarily focus on industries such as financial services, retail, manufacturing, education, government and health care, and in conjunction with ISS' development and manufacturing teams, are able to customize printing solutions to meet customer needs for printing electronic forms, media handling, duplex printing, intelligent capture and other document workflow solutions. ISS distributes and fulfills its products to business customers primarily through its well-established distributor and reseller network. The ISS distributor and reseller network includes IT Resellers, Direct Marketing Resellers, and Copier Dealers. ISS also sells its products through numerous alliances and OEM arrangements.   Enterprise Software offers an integrated suite of ECM, BPM, DOM/CCM that includes case management, electronic signature, process analytics, information and application integration, intelligent content capture and data extraction, enterprise search software and medical imaging VNA software products and solutions. The ECM and BPM software and services markets primarily serve business customers. Enterprise Software uses a direct to market sales and demand generation approach, employing internal sales and marketing teams that are segmented by industry sector - specifically healthcare, public sector (which includes higher education and government), and commercial, which spans areas such as retail, banking, insurance and manufacturing. Enterprise Software also offers a channel partner program that allows authorized third-party resellers to market and sell Enterprise Software products and solutions to a distributed market, as well as an OEM program which includes Enterprise Software's offerings within channel partners' existing solutions to their customers. Enterprise Software has two general forms of software agreements with its customers, perpetual licenses and subscription services.  Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's reportable segments, which is incorporated herein by reference.  Key Messages  2015  Lexmark is focused on driving long-term performance by strategically investing in technology, hardware and software products and solutions to secure high value product installations and capture profitable supplies, software maintenance and service annuities in document-intensive industries and business processes in distributed environments. The Company continues the transition to a solutions company as it shifts from a hardware-centric company to a solutions company providing end-to-end solutions that allow  Table of Contents  customers to bridge the paper and digital worlds and the unstructured and structured content/process worlds. Lexmark provides comprehensive capabilities to allow customers to manage their print and MFP environment, including MPS. The Company also continues to build its capabilities to help customers capture, manage and access unstructured content, in any form, through both organic investment and acquisitions.  The Company continues a strategic focus on growing its MPS offerings and the placement of high-end hardware. The Company also continues the strategic focus on expansion in solutions and software capabilities, to both strengthen its MPS offerings and grow its non-printing related software solutions business focused in the ECM, BPM and DOM/CCM markets. These strategic focus areas are intended to increase our penetration in the business segment. The business segment tends to have higher page generating and more software intensive application requirements, which drive increasing levels of supplies and software maintenance and support revenue.  In order to support these strategic focus areas, and to allow Lexmark to participate in the growing market to manage unstructured data and processes, and to further strengthen the Company's products, content/business process management solutions and MPS, the Company acquired Perceptive Software in 2010, Pallas Athena in 2011, Brainware, Nolij, ISYS and Acuo in 2012; Twistage, Access Via, Saperion and PACSGEAR in 2013; ReadSoft and GNAX Health in 2014; and Claron and Kofax in 2015. These acquisitions are included in the Enterprise Software segment.  While focusing on core strategic initiatives, Lexmark has taken actions over the last few years to improve its cost and expense structure. As a result of restructuring initiatives, significant changes have been implemented, from the consolidation and reduction of the manufacturing and support infrastructure and the increased use of shared service centers in low-cost countries, to the exit of inkjet technology. In the second quarter of 2013, the Company and Funai entered into a Master Inkjet Sale Agreement of the Company's inkjet-related technology and assets to Funai for total cash consideration of $100 million. Included in the sale were one of the Company's subsidiaries, certain intellectual property and other assets of the Company. The Company will continue to provide service, support and aftermarket supplies for its current inkjet installed base. The sale closed in the second quarter of 2013. With this announcement, Lexmark has focused its printing and MFP development activities solely in laser-based technologies.  The Company remains committed on its stated capital allocation framework of returning, on average, more than 50 percent of free cash flow to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while pursuing acquisitions and organic investments that support the strengthening and growth of the Company. During 2015, the Company paused its share repurchases in order to pay down debt associated with the Kofax acquisition.  Lexmark's 2015 revenue was down 4% YTY, primarily due to an unfavorable YTY currency impact of 6% and an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% due to the Company's exit of inkjet technology. The change in YTY revenues reflected a positive impact of 6% for growth in Enterprise Software revenue, primarily due to the acquisitions of Kofax in the second quarter of 2015 and ReadSoft in the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, the Company benefited from continued growth in MPS supplies revenue. Operating income decreased 116% YTY primarily driven by the revenue impacts discussed above and higher operating expenses primarily due to the acquisition of Kofax and recently announced 2016 and 2015 restructuring plans.  As in 2015, the Company is focused in 2016 on revenue and profit growth from the strategic imaging and software segments of the business, particularly MPS offerings and Enterprise Software. This growth is expected to be dampened by the continued unfavorable effects from continued YTY currency impact and continued YTY decreases in inkjet supplies revenue as a result of the Inkjet Exit, although this headwind is expected to decline over time.  In October 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the exploration of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. No decision has been made with regard to any alternatives, and there is no assurance that the Board's exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction being entered into or consummated.  Refer to the section entitled "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" that follows for a further discussion of the Company's results of operations.  Trends and Opportunities  Lexmark serves both the distributed printing and imaging and content and process management markets with a focus on business customers. Lexmark's enterprise content and process management software platform supports traditional business content as well as rich media and industry-specific content like medical image content and includes enterprise search, intelligent content capture and data extraction, DOM/CCM, business process and case management. Lexmark's healthcare offering includes an industry leading, standards based and highly secure, content repository and VNA that integrates all patient unstructured information across the enterprise to enable easy access including access via an EMR system. This healthcare content and process management offering also includes workflow automation and medical information and imaging study sharing within and between facilities and organizations.  Lexmark management believes the total relevant market opportunity of these markets combined in 2015 was approximately $80 billion. Lexmark management believes that the total relevant distributed laser printing and imaging market opportunity was  Table of Contents  approximately $68 billion in 2015, including printing hardware, supplies and related services. This opportunity includes printers and multifunction devices as well as a declining base of copiers and fax machines that are increasingly being integrated into multifunction devices. Based on industry information, Lexmark management believes that the overall distributed printing market declined in the low single digit percentage points in 2015. The distributed printing industry is expected to experience low single digit declining revenue overall over the next few years, but continued growth is expected in MPS, smart MFPs and workgroup color laser printing products which are all areas of focus for Lexmark. Based on industry analysts' forecasts, MPS and fleet solutions are projected to continue to experience approximately 10% annual revenue growth rates over the next several years and the relevant content and process management software markets that Lexmark participates in are projected to grow in high single digit percentage points annually over the next several years. In 2015, the total relevant content and process management software market was approximately $12 billion, excluding related professional services. However, management believes the total addressable market is significantly larger due to relatively low penetration of content and process management software solutions worldwide.  Market trends driving long-term growth include:   Continued penetration of color and graphics output in businesses;   Advancements in electronic movement of information, driving a continued shift in pages away from centralized commercial printing and document scanning to distributed printing and multi-channel capture by end users when and where it is convenient to do so, including via smart MFPs, mobile devices and web portals;   Continued convergence between printers, scanners, copiers and fax machines into single, integrated multifunction and all-in-one devices;   Increasing ability of multi-function printing devices and mobile devices to integrate into business process workflow solutions and enterprise content management systems;   Continued digitization of information and the ability to electronically store and distribute this information, driving the explosive growth of unstructured digital information, such as office documents, emails, photographs, audio and video files;   Customer desire to have a third party expert manage their printing and document output environment;   Ongoing emphasis on improving business process efficiency and driving costs out of business organizations by better managing enterprise content and associated processes;   Increasing need to capture, manage and access content from any location via any web-enabled device, including mobile devices and Smart MFPs, to streamline and optimize process workflows while ensuring information security;   Growing desire to unify structured data in business systems with unstructured paper and digital content to make the unstructured content more valuable and actionable within business processes; and   Increasing need in the healthcare industry to unify structured patient data, that is now typically stored in an EMR system, with unstructured content, that includes medical imaging studies and other patient documents and content such as lab reports and physicians notes, to enable easy unified access by clinical staff and referring physicians, across the healthcare continuum to improve clinical and business outcomes.  As a result of these market trends, Lexmark has growth opportunities in monochrome and color laser printers and MFPs, MPS, as well as fleet management solutions, ECM, BPM, DOM/CCM that includes case management, electronic signature, process analytics, information and application integration, intelligent content capture and data extraction, enterprise search software and medical imaging VNA software products and solutions.  Color and MFP devices continue to represent a more significant portion of the laser printing market. The Company's management believes that these trends will continue. Industry pricing pressure is partially offset by the tendency of customers to purchase higher value color and MFP devices and optional paper handling and finishing features. Customers are also purchasing connected smart MFPs and content and process management software solutions and services to optimize their document-related processes and infrastructure in order to improve productivity and cost. This includes solutions to enable mobile printing and content capture/access.  While profit margins on printers and MFPs have been negatively affected by competitive pricing pressure, supplies sales are higher margin and recurring. In general, as the printing and imaging market matures and traditional printer and copier-based product markets continue to converge, the Company's management expects competitive pressures to continue.  Table of Contents  Lexmark's dot matrix printers include mature products that require little ongoing investment. The Company expects that the market for these products will continue to decline, and has implemented a strategy to continue to offer high-quality products while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit.  The content and process management software and services markets serve business customers. These markets include solutions for capturing all types of unstructured information such as hardcopy documents and forms, photographs, emails, images, video, audio and faxes, and then intelligently indexing, archiving and routing this information to streamline and automate process workflows, while managing changes to both content and processes, and automating and monitoring governance and compliance policies. These solutions help companies leverage the value of their unstructured information by connecting it with existing enterprise applications and making it available in context within processes so that businesses can make better and faster decisions to enhance growth, improve productivity, lower costs and improve customer satisfaction. These markets also include solutions that help businesses understand existing processes, design and manage new processes, and enable the assembly of content into meaningful communications internally and with their customers and partners.  Management sees growth opportunities in large/global enterprises with a distributed workforce, in organizations that are seeking to optimize their content-related infrastructure and reduce costs, and in functional areas where workers rely on mobile devices for productivity.  The demand for content, process management and DOM/CCM solutions is strong in developed and emerging markets alike, representing a considerable growth opportunity for Enterprise Software. Lexmark's products are already installed in geographies around the world, and management believes this global customer base serves as an impetus for additional installations for Enterprise Software outside of North America. Customers continue to purchase solutions that result in greater efficiency and productivity in their various lines of business and back office operations.  Business systems such as enterprise resource planning ("ERP"), electronic medical records ("EMR"), and customer relationship management ("CRM") represent a mature market and remain vital applications but do not satisfy an organization's enterprise content and process management needs. The Company expects organizations to continue to look to ECM, BPM and DOM/CCM solutions to complete their enterprise information infrastructure, increasing the value of their core business system investments and leading to gains in efficiency.  Challenges and Risks  In recent years, Lexmark and its principal competitors, many of which have significantly greater financial, marketing and/or technological resources than the Company, have regularly lowered prices on printers and are expected to continue to do so. Other challenges and risks faced by Lexmark include:   New product announcements by ISS' principal competitors can have, and in the past, have had, a material impact on the Company's financial results.   With the convergence of traditional printer and copier markets, major laser competitors now include traditional copier companies.   The Company expects competition will continue to intensify as the ECM and BPM markets consolidate. The Company sees other competitors and the potential for new entrants into the ECM and BPM markets possibly having an impact on the Company's strategy to expand in these markets.   Lexmark expects that as it competes with larger competitors, the Company may attract more frequent challenges, both legal and commercial, including claims of possible intellectual property infringement.   Refill, remanufactured, clones, counterfeits and other compatible alternatives for some of ISS' toner and ink cartridges are available and compete with ISS' supplies business. However, these alternatives may result in inconsistent quality and reliability. As the installed base of laser and inkjet products matures, the Company expects competitive supplies activity to increase.   Historically, the Company has not experienced significant supplies pricing pressure, but if supplies pricing was to come under significant pressure, the Company's financial results could be materially adversely affected.   Global economic uncertainty, difficulties in the financial markets and unfavorable movements in currency exchange rates could impact the Company's future operating results.   Changes in printing behavior driven by adoption of electronic processes and/or use of mobile devices such as tablets and smart phones by businesses could result in a reduction in printing, which could adversely impact consumption of supplies.  Table of Contents  Refer to the sections entitled "Competition - ISS" and "Competition - Enterprise Software" in Item 1, which are incorporated herein by reference, for a further discussion of major uncertainties faced by the industry and the Company. Additionally, refer to the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a further discussion of factors that could impact the Company's operating results.  Strategy and Initiatives  Lexmark's strategy is based on a business model of investing in technology to develop and sell printing and imaging, and content and process management solutions, including printers, multifunction devices and software solutions with the objective of growing an installed base of hardware devices and software installations, which drives recurring printing supplies sales and software subscription, maintenance and services revenue. The Company's management believes that Lexmark has the following strengths related to this business model:   Lexmark is highly focused on delivering printing, imaging, and content and process management software solutions and services for specific industries and business processes in distributed work environments.   Lexmark internally develops both monochrome and color laser printing technology.   Lexmark, through Enterprise Software, also internally develops content and process management software that includes DOM/CCM, intelligent capture, enterprise search, rich media content management, electronic signature, process analytics and healthcare specific medical imaging and VNA software products as well as other industry tailored solutions to help companies manage the lifecycle of their content and business processes in the context of their existing enterprise applications.   Lexmark has leveraged its technological capabilities and its commitment to flexibility and responsiveness to build strong relationships with large enterprise customers and channel partners.  Lexmark's strategy involves the following core strategic initiatives:   Investing in technology, hardware and software products and solutions to secure high value product installations and capture profitable supplies, and software subscriptions, maintenance and service annuities in content-intensive industries and business processes;   Targeting and capturing business customers, markets and channels that drive higher page generation and supplies usage; and   Advancing and growing the Company's content and process management solutions business internationally.  Refer to the section entitled "Strategy" in Item 1, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a further discussion of the Company's strategies and initiatives.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  Lexmark's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as disclosures regarding contingencies. Lexmark bases its estimates on historical experience, market conditions, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the summary of significant accounting policies. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.  Revenue Recognition  Revenue recognition may be impacted by the Company's ability to estimate sales incentives and expected returns.  Table of Contents  Lexmark records reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements, promotions and other volume-based incentives at the later of the date of revenue recognition or the date the sales incentive is offered. Estimated reductions in revenue are based upon historical trends and other known factors at the time of sale. Lexmark also records estimated reductions to revenue for price protection, which it provides to substantially all of its distributor and reseller customers. The amount of price protection is limited based on the amount of dealers' and resellers' inventory on hand (including in-transit inventory) as of the date of the price change. If market conditions were to decline, Lexmark may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings or reduce prices, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.  The Company also records estimated reductions to revenue at the time of sale related to its customers' right to return product. Estimated reductions in revenue are based upon historical trends of actual product returns as well as the Company's assessment of its products in the channel. Provisions for specific returns from large customers are also recorded as necessary.  Multiple Element Arrangements  The Company enters into multiple element agreements with customers which may involve the provisions of hardware, supplies, separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance services, and other professional services (installation, maintenance, and enhanced warranty services). These arrangements may involve upfront purchase or lease of hardware products with services and supplies provided per contract terms or as needed. Lexmark also enters into multiple element agreements with customers that contain software and related services as well as contracts that include a combination of printing products and related services and software licenses and related services. Furthermore, some contracts may include nonstandard terms and conditions. As such, significant contract interpretation can be required to determine the appropriate accounting for some arrangements.  The Company uses its best estimate of selling price ("BESP") when allocating the transaction price for many of its product and service deliverables as permitted under the accounting guidance for multiple element arrangements when sufficient . . .

my husband and I both agreed that this stuff was a mood killer! Felt nothing! It's so sticky and creates more friction than eliminating it like a lubricant is supposed to do. We will not be using this again!

Q
 How do I apply lubricant and how much do I need?


A
There are really no rules here. The best thing to do is just relax, enjoy and experiment. If trying it for the first time, simply squeeze a little lubricant onto your fingertips and gently apply to your intimate areas. Lubricant can be used with or without a condom, either when it is already on or before. Take care not to use too much before you put the condom on, otherwise it may slip off during sex. You can always apply more if you need it.

Beyond Intercourse: A Recipe for Her Orgasm



Featured







When it comes to the female orgasm; women want them, men want to provide them and yet surprisingly, few are sure on how to achieve them. Although technique is part of it, there are many other factors that come into play when it comes to achieving an orgasm. Find out how you and your partner can get the most out of your intimate moments, as you both relax and ease your way into orgasmic bliss.  It all starts with pre-sex:Contrary to popular belief, the female orgasm isn’t mechanical, able to be programmed at the drop of a dime. While sex for men are usually able to disassociate sexual desires from their feelings, whereas most women are more likely to be aroused by her partner’s desire for her, surroundings, and a relaxing atmosphere that encourages affection.  For most women, feeling wanted and appreciated by their partners can have a positive reaction on their sex life and allow them to become more respondent to their partner’s advances. Some experts also suggest that the pre-sex preparation can begin long before the clothes come off. Taking her on a date, cooking her dinner, or helping her around the house for example all help her unwind and feel cared for, which will then spill over in to the bedroom. Think of it as ‘subconscious foreplay’. Add foreplayMany women like much longer foreplay than their partners realize. This may, therefore, be linked to a subconscious feeling by the woman that she wants to feel affection and pleasure by her partner, rather than just feeling that he is in a hurry to reach his own climax. Women like to experience different things when it comes to foreplay, so try to mix it up with your partner, and don’t be afraid to ask her what she wants and what feels good for her. Many studies suggest that oral sex is the most effective for women to climax, so perhaps start with your fingers and then move down with your lips the closer you think she is getting to orgasm. Do try other things too if oral sex doesn’t do it for her. Gently touching and kissing all the female erogenous zones – legs, breasts, neck and ears – can really heat things up too. Be sensitive and responsive when you get a good reaction to something - keep going. Go Longer According to the Kinsey Institute, while 85% of men believe that their partners had an orgasm during their last sexual encounter, only 64% women reported actually experiencing one. To combat this, when you are having sex, opt for positions that are less stimulating for him and more effective for her. Spooning, for example, is a very romantic position, meaning that the woman can feel her partner’s arms around her, feeling safe and comfortable, which should help her relax into it and bring her closer to orgasm. This position also has a far gentler pace and shallower penetration, than say the missionary, which means he is less likely to get aroused too quickly – so will hopefully be more in sync with her. In addition to incorporating sex positions that help focus on slowing things down, add K-Y Duration™ lubricant to help prolong the time until ejaculation while giving you the control to stay in the moment longer. Mix it upA lot of couples tend to have the same routine when it comes to foreplay and sex, therefore, sometimes orgasms are harder to achieve as the woman generally knows what’s going to happen next. If, however, you try to vary from your routine, perhaps trying a new position or introducing a sex toy, then both partners will feel a heightened sense of excitement, thus making climax easier. Also, switching the location of your embrace can be helpful too - if you normally only have sex in the bedroom, try moving to the kitchen or the bathroom for a change and enjoy the sensation of doing something a little different together.



 

















Sexual Performance Anxiety: How to Overcome in the Bedroom



Featured







Sexual performance anxiety affects almost all men at some point in their sex lives; however, that should come as no surprise. For most, sex is both an emotional and physical act. However, stress on the body can heavily impact the way the body responds to intimacy. With the help of 5 tips, you can learn how to reduce performance anxieties for a calmer, more fulfilling sex life. Stop thinking of sex as a ‘performance’Some men view sex as a demonstration of their manhood - they think it's all about how ‘big’ they should be and how well they perform. This preoccupation with performance can be a problem when it comes to anxiety. Rather than a romantic encounter, sex becomes goal orientated. By changing the psyche, you can improve the situation and reduce the need to panic. Sex should be based on connecting with your partner and providing an atmosphere where you two can physically and mentally connect. Address any anxietiesWhen experiencing anxiety, the body goes into a heightened state of alert- causing difficulty for your partner to maintain an erection. However, sexual anxiety can be addressed through a number of relaxation techniques. Whether you decide to partake in regular workouts or want to improve your breathing through yoga; these activities can help decrease blood pressure and muscle tension in the body, making for a better and more improved performance in the bedroom. CommunicationCommunication is vital in any relationship, but all the more so to address sexual anxieties. Talking with your partner can improve your connection while allowing you both the opportunity to discuss your fears and concerns. Don't be afraid to reveal your desires and fantasies, while remaining open to your partner's feedback and suggestions. Being clear on what you both need, want and expect can prevent you from making it a bigger issue than it needs to be. Clear your mindSex is undoubtedly important in a loving relationship; however, worrying or over thinking about outside problems can inhibit your performance. Instead, focus on kissing, cuddling, and holding your partner. By relaxing and staying in the moment, you are able to enjoy each more making it a more pleasurable experience. For a better time with your partner; let sex happen spontaneously, preferably without any forward planning as this can help clear your mind and increase passion. K-Y ® Duration  is another great addition to add to your bedroom routine for a longer, more pleasurable connection with your partner.  Lifestyle changesCertain lifestyle changes can help to address anxiety issues. For example, eating a balanced diet, getting more sleep, and partaking in regular exercise, can help to combat sexual concerns. However, the abuse of drugs and alcohol can also have long-term detrimental physiological impacts on performance and should be avoided. For some, these can be a short term fix for relaxation; but over time, they can in fact lead to greater anxiety and further complicate problems. By eliminating these substances, it can help improve your general health for a more substantial and better sex life.



 

















5 Ways to Get More Sleep 



Featured







Researchers have uncovered that inefficient sleep quantity is associated with increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. To help maximize the amount of sleep you get each night, incorporate a healthy sleep routine. This can make the difference between a restlessness night and a peaceful slumber. Here are 5 simple tips to get the most out of your sleep routine. Remove any distractionsA study published in the journal Nature revealed that artificial blue light emitted from electronic devices such as your smart phone or tablet can activate neurons within the brain that can prevent you from feeling tired. Light can trigger an increase in heart rate, body temperature and brain activity level; therefore, blue light that is emitted by electronic gadgets can disrupt your melatonin levels. To get the most restful sleep, shut off your devices an hour before sleep. If you are not tired or struggle with sleeping, read a book or spend time with your partner. Avoid caffeineWhile caffeine cannot replace sleep, it can temporarily make one feel more alert by blocking sleep-inducing chemicals in the brain and increasing adrenaline production. Most people consume coffee or soda during the day, and caffeine can stay in the body for several hours, long after a drink was had. Therefore, it is best to limit the amount of caffeine you drink for a minimum of six hours prior to bedtime. Create a sleep-inducing environmentIf you toss and turn most nights, a dark, quiet, and cool environment can help improve sleep. Any source of light, be it an overhead lamp or something as small as a digital clock, can inhibit the secretion of melatonin, which is the hormone that promotes sleep. Your body temperature naturally drops while you sleep, so cooling down your bedroom can help speed up the process and allow you to doze off quicker. However, as your body transitions through different stages of sleep, any unexpected noise can disrupt your sleep causing you to have more shallow cycles. To prevent this, limit any outside noises by playing soft, calming music. Have a patternKeep your mealtime and bedtime consistent even on the weekends as your body establishes a routine. Whether it’s getting to bed at 10 PM or listening to relaxing music before you fall asleep, keeping a regular schedule not only increases the amount of sleep you can receive each night, it can also improve the quality, ensuring you feel alert and refreshed the next morning. Become more activeExercising three times a week for 20-30 minutes can have a noticeable impact on the quality of your sleep while also improving your overall fitness. Exercise is a great way to get your heart pumping while arousing the nervous system to help achieve and maintain sleep. However, try to avoid strenuous exercise in the evening and before bedtime as this can disrupt your sleep.

History[edit]




Lexmark Headquarters, Lexington, KY


Lexmark was formed on March 27, 1991 when IBM divested a number of its hardware manufacturing operations, including printer and printer supply operations, to the investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc. in a leveraged buyout.[2][3][4][5] Lexmark became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange on November 15, 1995.[6]
It was reported in April 2016 that Lexmark would be acquired by Apex Technology and PAG Asia Capital for $3.6 billion USD. Lexmark was set to be acquired at $40.50 per share in the transaction.[7] Initial talks for the acquisition were begun at the Remax World Expo in 2015.[8] The deal was closed on November 29, 2016. Lexmark stated that its headquarters would remain in Lexington, and that its enterprise software line of business would be spun off and "rebranded" to Kofax.[9]
Operations[edit]
The firm's corporate headquarters is located in Lexington and research and development (R&D) offices are distributed globally with additional R&D facilities located in Boulder, Colorado; Lenexa, Kansas; Cebu, Philippines; Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Berlin, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden[10] and Irvine, California.[11] Lexmark has offices throughout North and South America, Asia, Africa and Europe. The company has more than 12,000 employees worldwide.
Acquisitions[edit]

In May 2010, Lexmark acquired Perceptive Software for $280 million to build upon its software offerings.[12] Perceptive Software was a software firm that developed enterprise content management (ECM) and document output management (DOM) applications.
In 2011, Lexmark International purchased Netherlands-based Pallas Athena in a cash transaction valued at approximately $50.2 million.[13] The purchase of Pallas Athena added business process management (BPM), document output management (DOM) and process mining software capabilities to Lexmark's services.
In March 2012, Lexmark announced the acquisition of Luxembourg-based BDGB Enterprise, including its U.S. subsidiary Brainware, Inc., for a cash purchase price of approximately $148 million.[14] Brainware's intelligent data capture platform extracted critical information from paper and electronic documents, validated the extracted data and passed it to customers' data management systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and/or financial management systems.
In March 2012, Lexmark acquired Australia-based ISYS Search Software and U.S.-based Nolij Corporation, both for $32 million.[15] ISYS built enterprise search solutions and Nolij developed Web-based document imaging and workflow software.
In January 2013, Lexmark acquired Minnesota-based Acuo Technologies for $45 million. Acuo Technologies developed medical imaging document management software.[16]
In March 2013, Lexmark announced acquisitions of AccessVia and Twistage for a combined purchase price of approximately $31.5 million.[17]
In late August 2013, Lexmark signed an agreement to acquire Germany-based Saperion AG. Saperion was a developer and provider of enterprise content management (ECM) and business process management (BPM) software in Europe. The company was purchased for $72 million.[18]
In early October 2013, Lexmark acquired PACSGEAR. PACSGEAR was a provider of connectivity solutions for medical image management and electronic health records. The company was purchased for approximately $54 million.[19]
In September 2014, Lexmark acquired Stockholm, Sweden-based ReadSoft for $251 million.[20] ReadSoft was a financial process automation solutions company that specialized in software solutions for document process automation on-premises or in the cloud.[21]
In May 2015, Lexmark announced that it had acquired Kofax for roughly $1 billion.[22] Kofax, headquartered in Irvine, California, was a provider of smart process applications. They combined capture, process management, analytics and mobile capabilities to organizations.[11] This line of business was, in turn, spun off from Lexmark when it was acquired by Apex Technology in November 2016.[9]

Inkjet exit[edit]
In August 2012, Lexmark announced that it would stop production of its inkjet printer line.[23][24] Lexmark will continue to provide service, support and aftermarket supplies for its inkjet installed base.[25]
In April 2013, Funai Electric Company, Ltd. announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire Lexmark's inkjet technology and assets for approximately $100 million (approximately ¥9.5 billion). Funai acquired more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmark's inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets.[26]
Legal cases[edit]
Lexmark pioneered the use of profits from ink cartridges as a business model, with the result of modifying the legal models of product ownership and patent exhaustion over several years.[27]
A court victory in 2005 was handed to Lexmark in the case of ACRA v. Lexmark. This case states that Lexmark can enforce the "single use only" policy written on the side of Lexmark printer cartridge boxes sold to certain large customers at a discount, with the understanding that the customers will return the cartridges to Lexmark after using them. This means that these customers can face lawsuits if they breach the agreements, and do not return the cartridges.
Also in 2005, Lexmark suffered a legal defeat in the case of Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lexmark's petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby rejecting their attempt to have the Court hear their case. In this case, the defendant was a manufacturer of microchips that allowed third-party ink and toner cartridges to work on printers, including many manufactured by Lexmark. Such printers incorporated a feature that would require authentication from a microchip within the ink/toner cartridge in order to function; this was designed to prohibit users from refilling the cartridges. However, a recent firmware update allowed Lexmark to prevent end users from refilling ink cartridges or using third-party ink cartridges.
Lexmark also lost in the Surpreme Court case Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc. in 1 7-1 ruling that reversed and remanded a Federal Circuit court decision (30 May 2017):

When a patentee chooses to sell an item, that product is no longer within the limits of the monopoly and instead becomes the private, individual property of the purchaser, with the rights and benefits that come along with ownership. A patentee is free to set the price and negotiate contracts with purchasers, but may not, by virtue of his patent, control the use or disposition of the product after ownership passes to the purchaser. The sale terminates all patent rights to that item.[28]

Lexmark stated that its headquarters would remain in Lexington, and that its enterprise software line of business would be spun off and "rebranded" to Kofax.[9]
Operations[edit]
The firm's corporate headquarters is located in Lexington and research and development (R&D) offices are distributed globally with additional R&D facilities located in Boulder, Colorado; Lenexa, Kansas; Cebu, Philippines; Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Berlin, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden[10] and Irvine, California.[11] Lexmark has offices throughout North and South America, Asia, Africa and Europe. The company has more than 12,000 employees worldwide.
Acquisitions[edit]

In May 2010, Lexmark acquired Perceptive Software for $280 million to build upon its software offerings.[12] Perceptive Software was a software firm that developed enterprise content management (ECM) and document output management (DOM) applications.
In 2011, Lexmark International purchased Netherlands-based Pallas Athena in a cash transaction valued at approximately $50.2 million.[13] The purchase of Pallas Athena added business process management (BPM), document output management (DOM) and process mining software capabilities to Lexmark's services.
In March 2012, Lexmark announced the acquisition of Luxembourg-based BDGB Enterprise, including its U.S. subsidiary Brainware, Inc., for a cash purchase price of approximately $148 million.[14] Brainware's intelligent data capture platform extracted critical information from paper and electronic documents, validated the extracted data and passed it to customers' data management systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and/or financial management systems.
In March 2012, Lexmark acquired Australia-based ISYS Search Software and U.S.-based Nolij Corporation, both for $32 million.[15] ISYS built enterprise search solutions and Nolij developed Web-based document imaging and workflow software.
In January 2013, Lexmark acquired Minnesota-based Acuo Technologies for $45 million. Acuo Technologies developed medical imaging document management software.[16]
In March 2013, Lexmark announced acquisitions of AccessVia and Twistage for a combined purchase price of approximately $31.5 million.[17]
In late August 2013, Lexmark signed an agreement to acquire Germany-based Saperion AG. Saperion was a developer and provider of enterprise content management (ECM) and business process management (BPM) software in Europe. The company was purchased for $72 million.[18]
In early October 2013, Lexmark acquired PACSGEAR. PACSGEAR was a provider of connectivity solutions for medical image management and electronic health records. The company was purchased for approximately $54 million.[19]
In September 2014, Lexmark acquired Stockholm, Sweden-based ReadSoft for $251 million.[20] ReadSoft was a financial process automation solutions company that specialized in software solutions for document process automation on-premises or in the cloud.[21]
In May 2015, Lexmark announced that it had acquired Kofax for roughly $1 billion.[22] Kofax, headquartered in Irvine, California, was a provider of smart process applications. They combined capture, process management, analytics and mobile capabilities to organizations.[11] This line of business was, in turn, spun off from Lexmark when it was acquired by Apex Technology in November 2016.[9]

Inkjet exit[edit]
In August 2012, Lexmark announced that it would stop production of its inkjet printer line.[23][24] Lexmark will continue to provide service, support and aftermarket supplies for its inkjet installed base.[25]
In April 2013, Funai Electric Company, Ltd. announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire Lexmark's inkjet technology and assets for approximately $100 million (approximately ¥9.5 billion). Funai acquired more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmark's inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets.[26]
Legal cases[edit]
Lexmark pioneered the use of profits from ink cartridges as a business model, with the result of modifying the legal models of product ownership and patent exhaustion over several years.[27]
A court victory in 2005 was handed to Lexmark in the case of ACRA v. Lexmark. This case states that Lexmark can enforce the "single use only" policy written on the side of Lexmark printer cartridge boxes sold to certain large customers at a discount, with the understanding that the customers will return the cartridges to Lexmark after using them. This means that these customers can face lawsuits if they breach the agreements, and do not return the cartridges.
Also in 2005, Lexmark suffered a legal defeat in the case of Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lexmark's petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby rejecting their attempt to have the Court hear their case. In this case, the defendant was a manufacturer of microchips that allowed third-party ink and toner cartridges to work on printers, including many manufactured by Lexmark. Such printers incorporated a feature that would require authentication from a microchip within the ink/toner cartridge in order to function; this was designed to prohibit users from refilling the cartridges. However, a recent firmware update allowed Lexmark to prevent end users from refilling ink cartridges or using third-party ink cartridges.
Lexmark also lost in the Surpreme Court case Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc. in 1 7-1 ruling that reversed and remanded a Federal Circuit court decision (30 May 2017):

When a patentee chooses to sell an item, that product is no longer within the limits of the monopoly and instead becomes the private, individual property of the purchaser, with the rights and benefits that come along with ownership. A patentee is free to set the price and negotiate contracts with purchasers, but may not, by virtue of his patent, control the use or disposition of the product after ownership passes to the purchaser. The sale terminates all patent rights to that item.[28]

History[edit]




Lexmark Headquarters, Lexington, KY


Lexmark was formed on March 27, 1991 when IBM divested a number of its hardware manufacturing operations, including printer and printer supply operations, to the investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Inc. in a leveraged buyout.[2][3][4][5] Lexmark became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange on November 15, 1995.[6]
It was reported in April 2016 that Lexmark would be acquired by Apex Technology and PAG Asia Capital for $3.6 billion USD. Lexmark was set to be acquired at $40.50 per share in the transaction.[7] Initial talks for the acquisition were begun at the Remax World Expo in 2015.[8] The deal was closed on November 29, 2016. Lexmark stated that its headquarters would remain in Lexington, and that its enterprise software line of business would be spun off and "rebranded" to Kofax.[9]
Operations[edit]
The firm's corporate headquarters is located in Lexington and research and development (R&D) offices are distributed globally with additional R&D facilities located in Boulder, Colorado; Lenexa, Kansas; Cebu, Philippines; Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Berlin, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden[10] and Irvine, California.[11] Lexmark has offices throughout North and South America, Asia, Africa and Europe. The company has more than 12,000 employees worldwide.
Acquisitions[edit]

In May 2010, Lexmark acquired Perceptive Software for $280 million to build upon its software offerings.[12] Perceptive Software was a software firm that developed enterprise content management (ECM) and document output management (DOM) applications.
In 2011, Lexmark International purchased Netherlands-based Pallas Athena in a cash transaction valued at approximately $50.2 million.[13] The purchase of Pallas Athena added business process management (BPM), document output management (DOM) and process mining software capabilities to Lexmark's services.
In March 2012, Lexmark announced the acquisition of Luxembourg-based BDGB Enterprise, including its U.S. subsidiary Brainware, Inc., for a cash purchase price of approximately $148 million.[14] Brainware's intelligent data capture platform extracted critical information from paper and electronic documents, validated the extracted data and passed it to customers' data management systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and/or financial management systems.
In March 2012, Lexmark acquired Australia-based ISYS Search Software and U.S.-based Nolij Corporation, both for $32 million.[15] ISYS built enterprise search solutions and Nolij developed Web-based document imaging and workflow software.
In January 2013, Lexmark acquired Minnesota-based Acuo Technologies for $45 million. Acuo Technologies developed medical imaging document management software.[16]
In March 2013, Lexmark announced acquisitions of AccessVia and Twistage for a combined purchase price of approximately $31.5 million.[17]
In late August 2013, Lexmark signed an agreement to acquire Germany-based Saperion AG. Saperion was a developer and provider of enterprise content management (ECM) and business process management (BPM) software in Europe. The company was purchased for $72 million.[18]
In early October 2013, Lexmark acquired PACSGEAR. PACSGEAR was a provider of connectivity solutions for medical image management and electronic health records. The company was purchased for approximately $54 million.[19]
In September 2014, Lexmark acquired Stockholm, Sweden-based ReadSoft for $251 million.[20] ReadSoft was a financial process automation solutions company that specialized in software solutions for document process automation on-premises or in the cloud.[21]
In May 2015, Lexmark announced that it had acquired Kofax for roughly $1 billion.[22] Kofax, headquartered in Irvine, California, was a provider of smart process applications. They combined capture, process management, analytics and mobile capabilities to organizations.[11] This line of business was, in turn, spun off from Lexmark when it was acquired by Apex Technology in November 2016.[9]

Inkjet exit[edit]
In August 2012, Lexmark announced that it would stop production of its inkjet printer line.[23][24] Lexmark will continue to provide service, support and aftermarket supplies for its inkjet installed base.[25]
In April 2013, Funai Electric Company, Ltd. announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire Lexmark's inkjet technology and assets for approximately $100 million (approximately ¥9.5 billion). Funai acquired more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmark's inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets.[26]
Legal cases[edit]
Lexmark pioneered the use of profits from ink cartridges as a business model, with the result of modifying the legal models of product ownership and patent exhaustion over several years.[27]
A court victory in 2005 was handed to Lexmark in the case of ACRA v. Lexmark. This case states that Lexmark can enforce the "single use only" policy written on the side of Lexmark printer cartridge boxes sold to certain large customers at a discount, with the understanding that the customers will return the cartridges to Lexmark after using them. This means that these customers can face lawsuits if they breach the agreements, and do not return the cartridges.
Also in 2005, Lexmark suffered a legal defeat in the case of Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lexmark's petition for a writ of certiorari, thereby rejecting their attempt to have the Court hear their case. In this case, the defendant was a manufacturer of microchips that allowed third-party ink and toner cartridges to work on printers, including many manufactured by Lexmark. Such printers incorporated a feature that would require authentication from a microchip within the ink/toner cartridge in order to function; this was designed to prohibit users from refilling the cartridges. However, a recent firmware update allowed Lexmark to prevent end users from refilling ink cartridges or using third-party ink cartridges.
Lexmark also lost in the Surpreme Court case Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc. in 1 7-1 ruling that reversed and remanded a Federal Circuit court decision (30 May 2017):

When a patentee chooses to sell an item, that product is no longer within the limits of the monopoly and instead becomes the private, individual property of the purchaser, with the rights and benefits that come along with ownership. A patentee is free to set the price and negotiate contracts with purchasers, but may not, by virtue of his patent, control the use or disposition of the product after ownership passes to the purchaser. The sale terminates all patent rights to that item.[28]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Cartridge Type



Genuine or OEM (Original) Cartridges
Remanufactured Cartridges
Compatible Cartridges


Description

OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer, meaning the cartridge was made by the same company that made your printer. Original brand cartridges are very reliable and sometimes the only option if your printer is new to market or uncommon.


Remanufactured ink is a genuine brand cartridge that has gone through one cycle of use. After use, the cartridge is recycled, acquired by a remanufacturing facility and put through a rigorous professional refurbishing process. During the refurbishing process the cartridge is disassembled, thoroughly cleaned and tested for quality. It's then carefully refilled, tested again and brought back to life. Buying remanufactured prevents one less cartridge from ending up in a landfill.


A compatible cartridge is a brand new ink cartridge built by a manufacturer other than your printer. It's like buying the generic version of the genuine brand. Most are uniquely designed to differentiate from genuine cartridges. Despite any structural difference you may notice, the cartridge will still fit in your machine and print a full yield, just like the original brand.



Price Factors

Many printer manufacturers follow the razor-and-blades business model which may result in higher priced genuine cartridges.


Remanufactured ink is much cheaper than the original brand ink. It's far more cost effective to refurbish a previously used cartridge than create a new OEM from scratch.


Compatible ink is much cheaper than the original brand. Compatible suppliers don't have to worry about the additional costs that hinder OEMs like new printers or firmware, which lets them keep prices low.



Quality

Original cartridges work extremely well and are covered under a warranty by the printer manufacturer


High quality remanufactured ink will match the quality of the original, but not all remanufactured ink is created equal. Make sure you buy from a reputable supplier in order to get the absolute best results.


High quality compatible ink will match the quality of the original, but not all compatible ink is created equal. Make sure you buy from a reputable supplier in order to get the absolute best results.





What's the difference between ink and toner cartridges?

Printer Type
Work with inkjet printers
Work with laser printers


Material
Liquid ink
Dry powder


How it works
Inkjet printers use a series of nozzles that spray tiny drops of ink directly on the print suface
Laser toner printers use static electricity and heat to bond dry toner powder to a page


Commonly used by
Casual home users, small business and photographers
Large businesses and schools






Number of Pages You Can Print

A cartridge's page yield is the estimated number of pages you can print. Page yield is based on 5% page coverage. This means that the quoted page yield is based upon printed pages where only 5% of the page has been imprinted with ink. For example, a short memo has approximately 5% coverage. If you have a cartridge that has a yield of 500 pages, it can print 500 pages of that short memo. If you are printing letters, photos or graphics, your coverage will vary greatly and your page yield will drop significantly.



Cartridge Warranty and Shelf Life

Most ink and toner cartridges include a warranty or "best by" date on their box. Remanufactured and compatible ink cartridges can last 12-18 months unopened, and toner cartridges can last up to 3 years.



Cartridge Care and Storage

Only open a cartridge when you need it. Opened cartridges will eventually dry out, especially if the protective tape or clip has been removed. If you have an open ink cartridge around and would like to try and prevent it from drying out, place it nozzle side up in a plastic airtight tub. If your cartridge came with protective tape or a clip reapply both before storing. Place a damp cloth or paper towel in the tub, next to the cartridge and keep it stored in a cool, dark place.

Get $100 in search advertising when you spend $25 in Bing Ads.


†Offer Details: Offer expires December 31, 2017.  Valid only for new Bing Ads customers who are first party recipients of the offer email. A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
