"As an initial partner, Rhymesayers Entertainment has been involved in shaping the direction of the design and feel of the case," says Michael Hsu, co-founder of PERI, Inc. "We trust their knowledge and credibility in the music industry to take the Duo in the right direction. We are excited to have them as partners and even more excited for the opportunities it brings for Duo customers."
Currently pre-selling on Indiegogo, the Duo has surpassed half of its fundraising goal, raising more than $50,000 through the sale of over 500 units. Rhymesayers Entertainment is offering exclusive rewards to its Soundset 2015 festival, offering side stage passes (offered for the first time and not for regular sale), VIP Soundset tickets and of course the limited edition (black/black) Rhymesayers Duo.
"In following with our tradition of embracing the old school and merging with the new, we decided to partner with PERI," says Rhymesayers. "The goal is to give our fans the opportunity to combine that 80's Boombox experience with the convenience of modern smartphones."
You can purchase the Rhymesayers limited edition Duo on Indiegogo now, as well as the standard color Duos (Red/Black/White) here: http://igg.me/at/periaudio. Limited early bird pricing starts at $79, with regular pricing starting at $99 ($149 projected retail price).

Our customers




Worldwide, residential and industrial buildings, bridges and tunnels as well as cultural sites are being realized on a daily basis. During the construction and upkeep of all structures, construction site personnel are often exposed to difficult conditions. At the same time, they are responsible for the quality, safety and durability regarding the execution. And it is thanks only to their day-to-day commitment and experience that projects are successfully realized in spite of extremely tight schedules and high cost pressures. We at PERI make every effort to support our customers in the best possible way.







  




"With SKYDECK, we have exactly the right slab formwork system for our construction project – the drophead for early striking as well as the simple and easy handling have really convinced us. And the MAXIMO wall formwork is 25 per cent faster than conventional panel formwork systems; the one-sided anchoring in particular saves a great deal of time." Jürgen Pischof | Site Manager
Project report




  




"For the team it was the first time they used system formwork. Compared to the use of conventional formwork we were able to save around 50 % of working time. Especially the straightforward application is to be emphasised. The whole team quickly understood the system and worked with little training." William Low | Project Manager
Project report




  




"The collaboration between Lend Lease Structures and PERI to develop a system which accommodated our comprehensive safety requirements was greatly appreciated. PERI has worked closely with us and their continued site service has been a valuable resource when called upon. The added benefit of hydraulics on the LPS system enabled us to free up crane time and helped us in achieving our tight programme." David Langford | Site Manager
Project report




  




"A starting point of any achievement is passion. Less passion will achieve fewer results, same as small fire will provide less warmth. At PERI we found passion for professionalism and providing the best service. Mutual passion for excellence creates success." Dotan Hazan | Project Manager
Project report











More customer reviews 
        






  




"The PERI systems were easily adapted to suit the constantly changing geometry of the Al Hamra Towers. The SCS and ACS climbing systems were easy to handle and featured high safety standards.  In addition, the RCS Climbing Protection Panel provided safe working conditions. With SKYDECK, the slabs could easily be formed by hand even during strong winds which reduced crane requirements. Altogether, the PERI systems made it possible to have an 8-day cycle and have greatly contributed to the success of the Al Hamra project." Hani Abu-Haidar | Project Manager
Project report




  




"The recipe for success is the modularity and adaptability of the PERI UP scaffolding system – as well as the combinability with other products in the PERI portfolio. Furthermore, the project support provided by the PERI engineers was very professional and extremely positive." Michael Stodt | Head of Aircraft Structural Testing at IBAG
Project report




  




"The chosen solution of using VBC Balanced Cantilevered Carriages proved itself to be correct. Thanks to the high flexibility of the system, we could optimize our project so that the workload necessary to pour each segment was as short as possible. It also had a measurable influence on the assumed schedule." Mariusz Urbanski | Construction Manager
Project report




  




"PERI is and has been an effective, proactive partner in developing successful solutions for a very complex architecturally exposed feature structure on a highly visible project. PERI understood the challenges, and implemented a dedicated support team – engineering, sales, and field – that is a significant factor in Baker’s success on the structure. PERI’s team and orientation towards service makes us feel as if this project is their most important!" Pamela Marshall | Project Manager
Project report






  




"There are a number of challenges in the industry, period just in regards to cost. With PERI UP system scaffold we get the usually in the scaffolding market high direct labor cost down. The partnership and the support has been absolutely phenomenal – to ensure that the productivity and efficiency has all been met and our targets are on track." Kyle Morden | Construction Manager
Project Report




  




"The market for houses in concrete construction will grow enormously in the years to come – and PERI is perfectly prepared for this with the UNO system. We have compared several systems and then decided in favor of PERI because of the simplicity and speed. We yield excellent results – also thanks to the customized support." Pedro Letelier | Project leader
Project report




  




"The LGS installation using ridge clasp and roles is absolutely convincing. In addition, PERI engineers demonstrated speed in their planning skills  - size, planning, statics and assembly had to be adhered to a tight schedule." Thorsten Wahner | Site Manager and General Manager
Project report




  




"PERI UP Flex has proven to be a safe, flexible and productive system which supports and facilitates the installation of the structural steel roof for the stadium of the Singapore Sports Hub." Bernward Stube | Director Evans Baek | Project Coordinator
