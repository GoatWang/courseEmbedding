As a partner in our Finance and Mergers & Acquisitions practices, Judy represents public and private companies along with the investors that finance them. She also serves on several public and private boards of directors.


Judy represents entrepreneurial and emerging growth companies and the investors that finance them. She also counsels larger public and private companies in connection with mergers and acquisitions, finance transactions and governance issues.
Acting as a senior business advisor and corporate counsel, Judy works with emerging growth companies at every stage, from start-up to Fortune 500 status, in industries that include communications and IT infrastructure, software, networking, medical devices, and payments. She often functions as a team member within growing enterprises, helping them obtain financing and grow their business.
Judy's broad practice includes general corporate work for large and small companies (including corporate organization, employee benefits, intellectual property, commercial transactions and capital formation); securities (public and private debt and equity financings, and securities law compliance); mergers and acquisitions; and commercial and strategic relationships. She also represents venture capital funds.
In addition, Judy has experience as a cofounder and executive in venture funds and emerging company start-ups, and serves as a board member for several public and private companies.
Judy was ranked for venture capital expertise by Chambers USA in 2015 and 2016, and recommended by Legal 500 U.S. for venture capital and emerging companies expertise in 2015. She was also named among Women Leaders in the Law in 2011 by The Recorder, and by the San Jose Business Journal in 2010 as a Woman of Influence. Judy appeared on the Forbes Midas List as one of venture capital's top deal makers from 2001 through 2005.
