Tempe's Centerpoint towers sold for $30M, will be renamed West Sixth


                February 18, 2011

Featured in Phoenix Business Journal (February 18, 2011)
The saga of the unfinished Centerpoint in downtown Tempe was resolved Friday afternoon when Cleveland-based Zaremba Group purchased the property. It was the same deal that was supposed to close last October but fell apart because of complicated mechanics lien issues and disagreements with the title company.
The deal closed about 4 p.m., according to Mark Winkleman, chief operating officer of ML Manager LLC, the owner of the property.
At 5 p.m. Zaremba announced that the two-tower complex in downtown Tempe will be renamed West Sixth in deference to the formal address of 111 W. Sixth St.
What was intended to be luxury condos will be offered as rentals as soon as the project is completed. Construction will begin immediately and is likely to take several months.
“We got it done. There were so many documents to sign,” Winkleman said.
Originally the deal was a fairly simple one with Zaremba acquiring the 375-unit project for $30 million and finishing it. But a day before the October closing, title company Fidelity National Title Co. backed out. At issue were an estimated $21 million in mechanics liens filed against the troubled project.
In the deal today, Zaremba paid ML Manager $30 million, the same amount it offered previously, with ML Manager talking $13.2 million of that to acquire the mechanics liens back from Zaremba. Now ML Manager will pursue its insurance claims against Fidelity for those mechanics liens.
When other costs of closing the deal are put together, however, investors with ML Manager won’t be seeing any take home money. Winkleman is adamant, however, that ML Manager will be successful in its fight with Fidelity and will recoup some of its losses on behalf of investors. Right now he’s just relieved to have the deal close.
“This is the hardest transaction I have ever been involved with,” Winkleman said.
The story of Centerpoint goes back several years when it was funded by Mortgages Ltd., one of the largest commercial construction lenders in the state. A large portion of the mixed-use project was completed with about $135 million in loans. But Mortgages Ltd. was unable to fund the estimated $50 million to $75 million to finish the development. By early 2008, the project was at a standstill and has been ever since.
In June 2008, in the midst of the economic meltdown, the chairman and sole shareholder of Mortgages Ltd., Scott Coles, committed suicide. In the weeks following, several borrowers forced the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. A year later the company emerged from bankruptcy under the name ML Manager. That company was created to administer the remaining loans and to foreclose where necessary. Since then, Winkleman has been systematically going through the portfolio and mostly foreclosing, taking possession and then selling the properties for whatever he could get on behalf of the investors.
Winkleman reached an almost unsurmountable snag with the Centerpoint deal. When it fell apart last year, he wasn’t sure whether the deal would ever get done, but vowed to fight Fidelity in court for backing away at the previous closing.
In the new deal, First American Title and Thomas Title handled the transaction.

Community: 10 Young Jewish Funders to make grants


                March 21, 2013

Featured in JewishAZ.com by Salvatore Caputo
A group of 10 Jewish businessmen and professionals under age 40 have launched Young Jewish Funders of Arizona, a giving circle, with plans to make grants totaling at least $50,000 to Jewish organizations in the Valley this year. The members will pool their resources to make the grants, two of the group’s founders — Jay Chernikoff and Joshua Simon — told Jewish News.“We want to show that young people here are interested and involved,” said Chernikoff, 33, an entrepreneur and real estate investor who moved to the Valley in 2005.
“This is a nice, sharp, smart group of guys who want to make Phoenix a place where they can live, work, raise a family and feel good about the community as a whole and their part in it.”
The group is focused on supporting effective community-building events and projects that engage individuals who are not yet connected with the Jewish community, he said.
Chernikoff and Simon agreed that their group wants to help establish a culture of giving among younger donors, but in a form that reflects the experience of their generation. The giving circle model would allow them to see the direct effect of their giving, something that both said appeals to younger donors.
“We really want to make a direct impact and be able to say we changed lives locally,” said Simon, who owns two companies and has been a host of Mazelpalooza, a social event for young Jews held on Christmas Eve, for seven years.
“About half of the people in our group come from places that had stronger Jewish communities,” Chernikoff said, and the young funders would like to build similar communal strength here as a legacy for their children.
Chernikoff said he got the idea for the giving circle when he attended the Jewish Funders Network conference in Phoenix in April 2010, which some of the other members of the giving circle also attended. Their discussions ultimately led to this effort, in which they sought advice and help from the Jewish Funders Network nationally and worked with Bryan Kort, chair of the Jewish Community Foundation board, locally, he said.
“We’re doing an application process,” Simon said. “We’re spending the next 30 days telling people about this and getting the word out to the community.”
After narrowing down the applications, he said, the funders will hold individual meetings with the applicants and as a group make their decisions on what to fund, Simon said.
“We all want to be in unison and agreement
on helping the community,” Simon said.
“I’m very lucky,” he added. “I’ve been very successful at a young age, and I want to do this for the community, to thank them.”
Organizations interested in applying for grants from the group may apply at yjfaz.org. To be considered, a proposed project must be scheduled to take place during 2014, and the application must be completed by April 30, 2013. Grant recipients will be notified by May 30.
