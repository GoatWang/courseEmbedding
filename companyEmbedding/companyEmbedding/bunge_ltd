Main heading: Our value chainSub heading: Bulk commodities to the food on your table 



Connecting harvests to homes, from South America to North Africa, Bunge brings food from where it’s produced to where it’s needed. Our integrated value chain links origination, storage and transportation to activities further down the line, including processing, packaging and distribution. This helps farmers and communities prosper, puts better food on the shelf, increases sustainability, strengthens global food security and improves diets.
We are guided by four strategic pillars: we stand for safety to make sure our employees go home every day to their families in good shape; we apply best-in-class practices and share knowledge across our operations to do things better; we strike the right balance to achieve a profitable mix of commodity and value-added businesses and we continue to refine our winning footprint, which helps us serve our customers and outperform our competitors.

Bunge is a leading producer of sugar and ethanol from sugarcane in Brazil and a global sugar trader. Brazil is now easily the biggest producer in the world, with an annual harvest of around 600 million metric tons, of a world total of 1.6 billion.

History[edit]
Formation and listing[edit]
Bunge y Born was founded in 1818 by Johann Peter Gotlieb Bunge in Amsterdam, it was relocated to Antwerp by Edouard Bounge in 1859. Edouard's brother; Ernest Bunge, took the Bunge name to Argentina in 1884, and in 1905 the business extended to Brazil and later on to the United States. The company was converted into the Bermuda-registered Bunge International in 1994, retaining the Bunge y Born name only in Argentina. Bunge remained a privately held company of 180 shareholders (including the longtime controlling family interests) and divested itself in 1998 of almost all its retail foods interests in favor of a greater role in international agribusiness and commodity markets; by then the company's gross annual turnover had reached US$13 billion.[3] Bunge ultimately went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001, becoming Bunge Limited.
In 1994, the Bermuda-registered Bunge International was created as the main company in which the families had shares. There were around 180 shareholders—the main families were Hirsch, Bunge, Born, Engels, and De La Tour. This replaced the older structure in which individual shareholders had stakes in all the different Bunge companies. Now only in Argentina does the Bunge y Born name still exist.




The New York Stock Exchange on August 4, 2011, when Bunge celebrated the 10th anniversary of its listing on the exchange.


In 2001, Bunge was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Through their three businesses—agribusiness, fertilizer, and food products—they have established a leading global presence in the farm-to-consumer food chain. Bunge is the world's largest oilseed processor, the world's number one seller of bottled vegetable oil to consumers and the largest producer and supplier of fertilizers to farmers in South America.
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2004, Bunge acquired Cereol, parent of oilseed companies Central Soya and CanAmera Foods.[4] In 2008, Bunge acquired Walter Rau, a margarine company, from Germany.[citation needed] In 2009, Bunge acquired the margarine business from Raisio Group, maker of functional food ingredients.[5]
Brazilian sourcing protests[edit]
In 2012, Bunge came under criticism from NGO Survival International[6] for sourcing its sugarcane from the ancestral land of the Guaraní people in Brazil. It has been reported by the tribe that crop production has brought pesticides and machinery that has damaged their health, as well as restricting them to a small area that has prevented them from hunting and practicing their traditions.[citation needed] Also, in January 2003, opposition from the tribe had led to the killing of their chief Marcus Vernon by ranchers.[7] In 2012, survivors were requesting Bunge follows the example of the company Raízen, which agreed to stop the sourcing of sugarcane from the area.[8]
Recent[edit]
In early June 2017, Bunge hired advisers to help it fend off takeover interest from Glencore in Switzerland.[9]
Products[edit]
The company's operations include:[1]

originating oilseeds and grains from the world's primary growing regions and transporting them to customers worldwide;
crushing oilseeds to make meal for the livestock industry and oil for the food processing, food service and biofuel industries;
producing bottled oils, mayonnaise, margarines and other food products for consumers;
crushing sugarcane to make sugar, ethanol and electricity;
milling wheat and corn for food processors, bakeries, brewers and other commercial customers; and
selling fertilizer to farmers.

Environmental record[edit]
See also: Gran_Chaco § Conservation_issues
In 2006, the United States Environmental Protection Agency filed charges against Bunge company regarding pollution emissions.[10] This involved twelve soybean processing plants and corn mills in eight states throughout the US. The lawsuit claimed Bunge violated the Clean Air Act by constructing major modifications that increased emissions. Bunge was required to implement engineering changes and pollution control projects, estimated to cost $12 million, to reduce emissions at the facilities by 2,200 tons a year. The settlement also called for Bunge to pay a cash penalty of $625,000 and to spend $1.25 million to fund community-based environmental projects selected by and to be supervised by the impacted states.[11] The state of Kansas will receive $22,000 of the $625,000 civil penalty, this being issued by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.[12]

It has been reported by the tribe that crop production has brought pesticides and machinery that has damaged their health, as well as restricting them to a small area that has prevented them from hunting and practicing their traditions.[citation needed] Also, in January 2003, opposition from the tribe had led to the killing of their chief Marcus Vernon by ranchers.[7] In 2012, survivors were requesting Bunge follows the example of the company Raízen, which agreed to stop the sourcing of sugarcane from the area.[8]
Recent[edit]
In early June 2017, Bunge hired advisers to help it fend off takeover interest from Glencore in Switzerland.[9]
Products[edit]
The company's operations include:[1]

originating oilseeds and grains from the world's primary growing regions and transporting them to customers worldwide;
crushing oilseeds to make meal for the livestock industry and oil for the food processing, food service and biofuel industries;
producing bottled oils, mayonnaise, margarines and other food products for consumers;
crushing sugarcane to make sugar, ethanol and electricity;
milling wheat and corn for food processors, bakeries, brewers and other commercial customers; and
selling fertilizer to farmers.

Environmental record[edit]
See also: Gran_Chaco § Conservation_issues
In 2006, the United States Environmental Protection Agency filed charges against Bunge company regarding pollution emissions.[10] This involved twelve soybean processing plants and corn mills in eight states throughout the US. The lawsuit claimed Bunge violated the Clean Air Act by constructing major modifications that increased emissions. Bunge was required to implement engineering changes and pollution control projects, estimated to cost $12 million, to reduce emissions at the facilities by 2,200 tons a year. The settlement also called for Bunge to pay a cash penalty of $625,000 and to spend $1.25 million to fund community-based environmental projects selected by and to be supervised by the impacted states.[11] The state of Kansas will receive $22,000 of the $625,000 civil penalty, this being issued by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.[12]

History[edit]
Formation and listing[edit]
Bunge y Born was founded in 1818 by Johann Peter Gotlieb Bunge in Amsterdam, it was relocated to Antwerp by Edouard Bounge in 1859. Edouard's brother; Ernest Bunge, took the Bunge name to Argentina in 1884, and in 1905 the business extended to Brazil and later on to the United States. The company was converted into the Bermuda-registered Bunge International in 1994, retaining the Bunge y Born name only in Argentina. Bunge remained a privately held company of 180 shareholders (including the longtime controlling family interests) and divested itself in 1998 of almost all its retail foods interests in favor of a greater role in international agribusiness and commodity markets; by then the company's gross annual turnover had reached US$13 billion.[3] Bunge ultimately went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001, becoming Bunge Limited.
In 1994, the Bermuda-registered Bunge International was created as the main company in which the families had shares. There were around 180 shareholders—the main families were Hirsch, Bunge, Born, Engels, and De La Tour. This replaced the older structure in which individual shareholders had stakes in all the different Bunge companies. Now only in Argentina does the Bunge y Born name still exist.




The New York Stock Exchange on August 4, 2011, when Bunge celebrated the 10th anniversary of its listing on the exchange.


In 2001, Bunge was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Through their three businesses—agribusiness, fertilizer, and food products—they have established a leading global presence in the farm-to-consumer food chain. Bunge is the world's largest oilseed processor, the world's number one seller of bottled vegetable oil to consumers and the largest producer and supplier of fertilizers to farmers in South America.
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2004, Bunge acquired Cereol, parent of oilseed companies Central Soya and CanAmera Foods.[4] In 2008, Bunge acquired Walter Rau, a margarine company, from Germany.[citation needed] In 2009, Bunge acquired the margarine business from Raisio Group, maker of functional food ingredients.[5]
Brazilian sourcing protests[edit]
In 2012, Bunge came under criticism from NGO Survival International[6] for sourcing its sugarcane from the ancestral land of the Guaraní people in Brazil. It has been reported by the tribe that crop production has brought pesticides and machinery that has damaged their health, as well as restricting them to a small area that has prevented them from hunting and practicing their traditions.[citation needed] Also, in January 2003, opposition from the tribe had led to the killing of their chief Marcus Vernon by ranchers.[7] In 2012, survivors were requesting Bunge follows the example of the company Raízen, which agreed to stop the sourcing of sugarcane from the area.[8]
Recent[edit]
In early June 2017, Bunge hired advisers to help it fend off takeover interest from Glencore in Switzerland.[9]

Glencore bids for Rio Tinto Australian coal mines
If successful in buying Coal & Allied from Rio Tinto, Glencore said it would explore selling up to a 50% stake in the business and look to sell other coal assets so that its total financial commitment wouldn't exceed $2 billion. "Glencore Swoops In on Deal for Rio Tinto's Australian Coal Mines -- 2nd Update," published at 2051 GMT, incorrectly stated the commitment wouldn't exceed $1.5 billion in the 11th paragraph. The error also appeared in an earlier version of the story published at 1958 GMT.

Grain trader Bunge's shares surge 16% on report of Glencore approach
Shares of grain trader Bunge Ltd.  jumped 16% Tuesday, after The Wall Street Journal said the company has been approached by commodities giant Glencore Plc  for a possible takeover. It's unclear whether talks have advanced and no deal may materialize, but if one is agreed it would be large, said the paper. Bunge has a $10 billion market value, including debt, while its enterprise value is about $15 billion. Bunge shares have gained 12% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 7%.

Agribusiness company Bunge shares slide 12% on weaker-than-expected earnings
Shares of seeds, grains and fertilizer company Bunge Ltd.  slid 12% Wednesday, after the company posted weaker-than-expected profit for the first quarter. Bunge said it had net income of $47 million, or 36 cents a share, in the quarter, down sharply from $235 million, or $1.60 a share, in the same period a year ago. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 35 cents, or half of the 70 cents consensus of analysts polled by FactSet. Sales rose to $11.1 billion from $8.9 billion, ahead of the FactSet consensus of $8.9 billion. "The slow pace of farmer selling in South America compressed margins in agribusiness and led to a lower than expected first quarter," Chief Executive Soren Schroder said in a statment. "Our teams managed risks, logistics and industrial operations well. Despite this difficult start, we continue to expect 2017 to be a year of solid year-over-year earnings growth, although below our prior expectations." The company is now expecting full-year earnings before interest and taxes at the agribusiness to range from $800 million to $925 million, the bulk of which is expected in the second half. Shares are down 7.5% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.5%.

Here's Why Bunge Ltd Dropped As Much As 12% Today
The company announced disappointing first-quarter 2017 earnings.











                Maxx Chatsko
            

                (TMFBlacknGold)



            
            May 3, 2017 at 4:55PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of global agribusiness leader Bunge Ltd (NYSE:BG) dropped as much as 12% today after the company announced first-quarter 2017 financial results that were sharply impacted by delayed farmer selling in South America. Management expects that to shift results to later in the year as farmers play catch-up, and it still expects solid earnings growth for 2017 compared to last year. That didn't stop Mr. Market from trimming nearly $1 billion off the company's market cap, though. 
Investors do have a point. Bunge also took the slow start to the year as an opportunity to make slight adjustments to previously issued financial guidance. It now expects full-year 2017 earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to fall within a range $800 million and $925 million, which is down from the prior range of $895 million to $1,050 million. At market close, the stock had settled to a 11.3% loss.

So what
This is now the second year in a row that hiccups in South American agriculture have impacted Bunge. The good news is that delayed selling is only a short-term problem created by the increasingly popular trend in recent years for farmers to store more grain on farms, rather than in centrally located storage infrastructure. That practice slightly alters the logistics of getting products from soil to market, but with record soybean and corn harvests this year, following weak harvests recently, farmers are incentivized to sell.
Aside from agribusiness, which includes sales of oilseeds and grains, other segments turned in respectable performances given the seasonal considerations. Food & ingredients saw an insignificant 13% drop compared to the year-ago period. Meanwhile, sugar & bioenergy improved over last year's performance, while fertilizer was essentially flat. Both of the latter segments typically achieve their weakest results during the first quarter of the year due to the inter-harvest period for sugarcane. The timing factors for these segments, coupled with delayed selling for soybean and corn harvests, compounded the negative performance for Bunge during the period.





Now what
While the results were disappointing, there wasn't much Bunge could control to change the outcome. The good news is that farmers will pick up sales of the latest soybean and corn harvests in the coming weeks, the robust sugarcane industry will resume after its annual multiweek shutdown, and fertilizer sales will pick up in the second half of the year as farmers get ready for the next cycle. The stock drop today stings, but long-term investors should not be deterred.
