Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Mill City Ventures III Ltd (NASDAQ:MCVT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

			Joseph A. Geraci, II co-founded the company in January 2006 and has been a director and our Chief Financial Officer since that time. Since February 2002 through the present time, Mr. Geraci has been managing member of Isles Capital, LLC, an advisory and consulting firm that assists small businesses, both public and private, in business development. In March 2005, Mr. Geraci also became the managing member of Mill City Advisors, LLC, the general partner of Mill City Ventures, LP, and Mill City Ventures II, LP, each a Minnesota limited partnership that invested directly into both private and public companies. From January 2005 until August 2005, Mr. Geraci served as the Director of Finance for Gelstat Corporation, a purveyor of homeopathic remedies, based in Bloomington, Minnesota.  Mr. Geraci provided investment advice to clients as a stockbroker and Vice President of Oak Ridge Financial Services, Inc., a Minneapolis-based broker-dealer firm, from June 2000 to December 2004. While at Oak Ridge Financial Services, Mr. Geraci's business was focused on structuring and negotiating debt and equity private placements with both private and publicly held companies. From his career and investment experiences, Mr. Geraci has established networks of colleagues, clients, co-investors, and the officers and directors of public and private companies. Mr. Geraci was employed at other Minneapolis brokerage firms from July 1991 to June 2000. These networks offer a range of contacts across a number of sectors and companies that may provide opportunities for investment, including many that meet the company's screening criteria.

 

In August 2003, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) found in an administrative hearing that Mr. Geraci, while employed by and affiliated with a NASD member, had violated NASD Conduct Rule 2110 and SEC Rule 10b-5 in August 1999, and barred him from associating with any NASD member in the future.
