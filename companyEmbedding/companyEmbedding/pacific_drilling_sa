Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Pacific Drilling S.A. (NYSE:PACD) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: $6.00 (287.10% upside)

Pacific Drilling launches IPO as new ultra-deepwater contractor



Houston (Platts)--11 Nov 2011 202 pm EST/1902 GMT




Shares of ultra-deepwater drilling contractor Pacific Drilling became
available Friday on the New York Stock Exchange as the company launched its
initial public offering with a goal of raising $50 million from 6 million
shares.     Shares of Pacific were trading at $8.30 at 11:50 EDT (1650 GMT) Friday,
after marking a daily range of $7.69 and $8.56.     In a telephone interview, Pacific Drilling CEO Christian Beckett said
his company was unique as a start-up in the ultra-deepwater drilling arena.     "We intend to stay laser-focused on ultra-deepwater assets," said
Beckett, who led the strategic business development and planning group for
contract drilling giant Transocean from 2004 until 2008.

 Since its inception in 2006, Pacific Drilling has committed more than
$4.4 billion to establish a fleet of six newbuild drillships, spending $2.7
billion through the first half of this year.     Operations were launched August 26 when the first of those drillships,
the Pacific Bora, began work on a contract in Nigeria for Chevron, according
to the company's filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.     Two other drillships, the Pacific Mistral and the Pacific Scirocco, are
scheduled to initiate drilling under their contracts next month, and a
fourth, the Pacific Santa Ana, has a contract to begin in March.     Meanwhile, Beckett said he is seeking contracts for the remaining two
vessels, the Pacific Khamsin and the Pacific Sharav, scheduled for delivery
in 2013.     Contract terms from Pacific's fleet status report indicate the Bora has
a three-year contract with Chevron in Nigeria at a rate of $474,700/d.     In addition, the Scirocco is contracted by Total on a Nigerian project
for one year at $470,000/d; the Mistral by Brazil's Petrobras in Brazil for
three years at $458,000/d; and the Santa Ana by Chevron for five years in the
Gulf of Mexico at $467,500/d.     Pacific Drilling traces its roots to a predecessor company formed in
Liberia in 2006 as a holding company that purchased a drillship under
construction.     After forming a venture with Transocean in 2007 to manage construction
of drillships for use by Transocean, the Pacific Drilling investors began to
explore opportunities for forming their contract drilling company, he said.      "The original investments were viewed as financial investments," said
Beckett.     "Those assets were put in a joint venture with Transocean, and
Transocean was operating. Over the course of that relationship, it became
evident that the greater value-capture was to run your own rigs and run them
well. So that was what prompted the desire to build a new drilling contractor
from scratch."     Formed in Luxembourg, Pacific Drilling will have its operational
headquarters in Houston, and the company already has a global staff of 850,
Beckett said.     The well-publicized speculative rig and drillship building boom of the
last five years helped create the opportunity to form Pacific Drilling as
investment firms made it possible for the company to acquire its first two
vessels, he said.      In addition, he said Pacific benefited from the rise of a stricter
global drilling regulatory regime in the last year following the April 2010
crisis in the Gulf of Mexico at BP's Macondo exploration well.     "It has actually helped us," said Beckett. "The vessels we are building
meet the requirements of the new regulations right out of the box."     The Macondo blowout killed 11 workers, destroyed Transocean's Deepwater
Horizon drilling rig and created the largest marine oil spill in US history.     "There is a fundamental advantage in that these new vessels already meet
the requirements," Beckett said.     Beckett said he believes Pacific's position as the operator of young
fleet in the post-Macondo era bolsters the company's strategy of focusing
solely on the single ultra-deepwater market of water depths beyond 7,500 feet
rather than trying to manage multiple classes of drilling equipment.     "It allows us to be more aware of what we are doing in our space," he
said. --Gary Taylor, gary_taylor@Platts.comTweet
