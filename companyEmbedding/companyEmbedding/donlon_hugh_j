Establish a lifetime of good credit habits and secure your financial future
Your credit score is your financial transcript. It is compiled from your credit report, which is a detailed accounting of your borrowing history. Lenders use it to establish your credit worthiness and determine what rates you are eligible to receive. Landlords check it when reviewing your application to rent a property. Employers look to it to when assessing your financial habits and character. This is why it is so important to build a strong credit history by making sound financial decisions and using credit wisely. more

LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 8, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE:   AF) ("Astoria", the "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Bank ("the Bank") today announced that Hugh J. Donlon has been named Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer at Astoria Bank and the Company.  
Mr. Donlon joins Astoria Bank with more than 25 years of senior level banking experience at Citibank and most recently KeyBank which he joined in 2008 as President of the Community Bank's East Region. In that role he was responsible for eight district teams and 1800 employees across New York including the metro NYC area, Vermont, Maine and Florida. His responsibilities included Key's 340 branch retail franchise, business banking, commercial banking which covered middle market companies with annual revenues up to $500 million and private banking which provided investment management, trust and advisory services to high net worth individuals. Mr. Donlon was also responsible for leading the successful integration of HSBC branches which Key acquired from First Niagara in Buffalo and Rochester in 2012. Prior to joining Key, Mr. Donlon spent 23 years at Citibank in a variety of sales and leadership roles of increasing responsibility in retail, business and commercial banking.  These included Sales Director of Citibank F.S.B New Jersey, Executive Vice President of the Commercial Markets Group responsible for Manhattan Commercial Banking and, Managing Director of US Business Banking for Citibank North America. 
Monte N. Redman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria commented, "The hiring of Mr. Donlon will significantly enhance the Bank's previously announced goal of becoming a more diversified, full-service community bank, providing community banking services to both retail and business customers in our Long Island and metropolitan New York City markets. In addition to the vast amount of relevant experience that Mr. Donlon brings with him to Astoria, with Gerard C. Keegan, the Bank's Senior EVP and Chief Operating Officer reaching Astoria's mandatory retirement age for executive officers during 2016, his addition is expected to fill an important need with respect to the Bank's succession planning.  Please join me in welcoming Hugh to the Astoria family."
