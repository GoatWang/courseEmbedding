	STAR GOLD CORP.






	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	JANUARY 31, 2017









	N

	OTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS






	Star Gold Corp. (the "Company") was initially incorporated as Elan Development, Inc., in the State of Nevada on December 8, 2006. The Company was originally organized to explore mineral properties in British Columbia, Canada but the Company is currently focusing on gold, silver and other base metal-bearing properties in Nevada.





	The Company's main business consists of assembling and/or acquiring land packages and mining claims the Company believes have potential mining reserves, and expending capital to explore these claims by drilling, and performing geophysical work or other exploration work deemed necessary.  The business is a high-risk business as there is no guarantee that the Company's exploration work will ultimately discover or produce any economically viable minerals.






	NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Basis of Presentation






	This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Companys management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information, as well as the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of our management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial statements have been included. Operating results for the nine-month period ended January 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending April 30, 2017.  All amounts presented are in U.S. dollars.  For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016.






	Going Concern






	As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred operating losses since inception.  As of January 31, 2017, the Company has limited financial resources with which to achieve the objectives and obtain profitability and positive cash flows.  As shown in the accompanying balance sheets and statements of operations, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $9,851,232 and at January 31, 2017,  the Company's working capital was $158,305.  Achievement of the Company's objectives will be dependent upon the ability to obtain additional financing, to locate profitable mining properties and generate revenue from current and planned business operations, and control costs.  The Company plans to fund its future operations by joint venturing, obtaining additional financing from investors, and/or lenders, and attaining commercial production.  However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve these objectives, therefore substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern exists.  The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded assets nor the implications of associated bankruptcy costs should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. In the event the Company is unable to fulfill the annual exploration expenditures as specified in the Property Option Agreement (Note 3), the Company will default on the agreement(s) and surrender its right to future claims on the respective property.






	Use of Estimates






	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to asset

	impairments and stock option valuation.  Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the Companys reported financial position and results of operations.






	Cash and cash equivalents






	For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.  






	Restricted cash






	Restricted cash constitutes cash held as collateral for the faithful performance of bonds securing exploration permits.






	Financial Instruments



	 


	The Company's financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and reclamation bonds.  All instruments are accounted for on a historical cost basis, which, due to the short maturity of these financial instruments, approximates fair value at January 31, 2017.






	Fair Value Measures






	The Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820 "Fair Value Measurements" ("ASC 820") requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value.  A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:





	Level 1:  Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.





	Level 2:  Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quote prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.





	Level 3:  Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.





	At January 31, 2017 and April 30, 2016, the Company had no assets or liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.






	Mining Interests and Mineral Exploration Expenditures






	Exploration costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. The Company capitalizes costs for acquiring and leasing mining properties and expenses costs to maintain mineral rights as incurred. Should a property reach the production stage, these capitalized costs would be amortized using the units-of-production method on the basis of periodic estimates of ore reserves. Mining interests are periodically assessed for impairment of value, and any subsequent losses are charged to operations at the time of impairment. If a property is abandoned or sold, its capitalized costs are charged to operations.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	Equipment






	Equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation of equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which ranges from three to seven years.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the assets. Gains or losses on disposition or retirement of property and equipment are recognized in operating expenses.






	Reclamation and Remediation






	The Company's operations are subject to standards for mine reclamation that have been established by various governmental agencies.  In the period in which the Company incurs a contractual obligation for the retirement of tangible long-lived assets, the Company will record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability.  A corresponding asset will also be recorded and depreciated over the life of the asset.  After the initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation, the liability will be adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation.  To date, the Company has not incurred any contractual obligation requiring recording either a liability or associated asset.






	Impaired Asset Policy






	The Company periodically reviews its long-lived assets to determine if any events or changes in circumstances have transpired which indicate that the carrying value of its assets may not be recoverable, pursuant to guidance established in ASC Topic 360, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets". The Company determines impairment by comparing the undiscounted net future cash flows estimated to be generated by its assets to their respective carrying amounts. If impairment is deemed to exist, the assets will be written down to fair value.






	Stock-based Compensation






	The Company estimates the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the Black-Scholes model, which requires the input of some subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them (expected life), the estimated volatility of the Companys common stock price over the expected term (volatility), employee forfeiture rate, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield. Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation. Options granted have a ten-year maximum term and varying vesting periods as determined by the Board of Directors.  The value of shares of common stock awards is determined based on the closing price of the Companys stock on the date of the award.


	  



	Loss Per Share






	Basic Earnings Per Share ("EPS") is computed as net income (loss) available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options and warrants.





	The outstanding securities at January 31, 2017 and 2016, that could have a dilutive effect are as follows:


























	 




	January 31, 2017




	 




	January 31, 2016






	Stock options




	 




	 5,210,000




	 




	 




	 3,083,667






	Warrants




	 




	 19,855,400




	 




	 




	 5,855,400






	  TOTAL POSSIBLE DILUTION




	 




	 25,065,400




	 




	 




	 8,939,067






	 




	 




	 




	 




	 




	 






	For the three and nine month periods ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the effect of the Company's outstanding options and common stock equivalents would have been anti-dilutive.

	Income Taxes






	The Company recognizes provision for income tax using the liability method.  Deferred income tax liabilities or assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered. A valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of these deferred tax assets will not be realized.






	New Accounting Pronouncement







	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15Presentation of Financial StatementsGoing Concern. The guidance requires an entitys management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). If conditions or events exist that raise substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern, the guidance requires disclosure in the financial statements. The guidance will be effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.  Early application is permitted.  The Company has concluded that adoption of the standard would have minimal impact on the Companys financial statements as such disclosure is already included the financial statements.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	JANUARY 31, 2017









	The Company established the 2011 Stock Option/Restricted Stock Plan.  The Stock Option Plan is administered by the Board of Directors and provides for the grant of stock options to eligible individual including directors, executive officers and advisors that have furnished bona fide services to the Company not related to the sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction.  





	The Stock Option Plan has a fixed maximum percentage of 10% of the Company's outstanding shares that are eligible for the plan pool, whereby the number of Shares under the plan increases automatically increases as the total number of shares outstanding increase.  The number of shares subject to the Stock Option Plan and any outstanding awards will be adjusted appropriately by the Board of Directors if the Company's common stock is affected through a reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, restructuring, reclassification dividend (other than quarterly cash dividends) or other distribution, stock split, spin-off or sale of substantially all of the Company's assets.  





	The Stock Option plan also has terms and conditions, including without limitations that the exercise price for stock options granted under the Stock Option Plan must equal the stock's fair market value, based on the closing price per share of common stock, at the time the stock option is granted.  The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant utilizing the Black-Scholes model and commonly utilized assumptions associated with the Black-Scholes methodology.  Options granted under the Plan have a ten-year maximum term and varying vesting periods as determined by the Board.  





	On October 18, 2016, the Company rescinded 2,696,667 fully vested options previously granted under the Stock Option plan with a weighted average exercise price of $0.37.  The Company re-issued the options and an additional 2,116,333 options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock, or a total of 4,810,000 options, with an exercise price of $0.06 per share.  The options vested immediately and have a term of 5 years.  The difference between the fair value of the options rescinded and the options granted was treated as a re-pricing event and the Company recognized stock-based compensation in the amount of $126,562 for the nine months ended January 31, 2017.





	The Company estimated the fair value of these option grants using the Black-Scholes model with the following information and range of assumptions:

	 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATION.









	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS






	This quarterly report and the exhibits attached hereto contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.  Such forward-looking statements concern the Companys anticipated results and developments in the Companys operations in future periods, planned exploration and development of its properties, plans related to its business and other matters that may occur in the future.  These statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management.  





	Any statement that expresses or involves discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always using words or phrases such as expects or does not expect, is expected, anticipates or does not anticipate, plans, estimates, or intends, or states that certain actions, events or results may or could, would, might or will be taken, occur or be achieved) are not statements of historical fact and may be forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual events or results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation:





	·

	Star Gold Corp qualifies all forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report by the foregoing cautionary statement.






	Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements. These statements, identified by words such as plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, should, expect, and similar expressions include the Companys expectations and objectives regarding its future financial position, operating results and business strategy. These statements reflect the current views of management with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from those described in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include those set forth under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.





	As used in this Quarterly Report, the terms we, us, our, Star Gold, and the Company, mean Star Gold Corp., unless otherwise indicated. All dollar amounts in this Quarterly Report are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated.





	Managements Discussion and Analysis is intended to be read in conjunction with the Companys financial statements and the integral notes (Notes) thereto included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2016.  The following statements may be forward-looking in nature and actual results may differ materially.






	Corporate Background






	The Company was originally incorporated on December 8, 2006, under the laws of the State of Nevada as Elan Development, Inc.  On April 25, 2008, the name of the company was changed to Star Gold Corp.   Star Gold Corp. is an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of precious metal deposit properties and advancing them toward production.  The Company is engaged in the business of exploring, evaluating and acquiring mineral prospects with the potential for economic deposits of precious and base metals.


	  


	Star Gold Corp. currently leases with an option to acquire unpatented mining claims located in the State of Nevada which in part make up what we refer to as the Longstreet Property. The Longstreet Property in its entirety comprises 125 mineral claims (75 original optioned claims, of which 70 are unpatented staked claims and five claims leased from local ranchers), as well as 50 recently staked claims by Star Gold, covering a total area of approximately 2,500 acres (1,012 ha). The Longstreet property is at an intermediate stage of exploration.





	The Company has no patents, licenses, franchises or concessions which are considered by the Company to be of importance.  The business is not of a seasonal nature.  Since the potential products are traded in the open market, the Company has no control over the competitive conditions in the industry.  






	Overview of Mineral Exploration and Current Operations






	Star Gold Corp. is an exploration stage mineral company with no producing mines.  Mineral exploration is essentially a research activity that does not produce a product.  As such the Company acquires properties which it believes have potential to host economic concentrations of minerals, particularly gold and silver.  These acquisitions have and may take the form of obtaining or leasing unpatented mining claims on federal land or on  private property owned by third parties.  An unpatented mining claim is an interest that can be acquired to the mineral rights on open lands of the federal owned public domain.  Claims are staked in accordance with the Mining Law of 1872, recorded with the federal government pursuant to laws and regulations established by the Bureau of Land Management.   The Company intends to remain in the business of exploring for mining properties that have the potential to produce gold, silver, base metals and other commodities.





	The Company will perform basic geological work to identify specific drill targets on the properties, and then collect subsurface samples by drilling to confirm the presence of mineralization (the presence of economic minerals in a specific area or geological formation).  The Company may enter into joint venture agreements with other companies to fund further exploration and/or development work.  It is the Companys plan to focus on assembling a high









	Page

	17

	of

	29

















	quality group of mid-stage mineral (primarily gold and silver) exploration prospects, using the experience and contacts of the management group.  By such prospects, the Company means properties that have been previously identified by third parties, (including prior owners and/or exploration companies), as mineral prospects with potential for economic mineralization.  Often these properties have been sampled, mapped and sometimes drilled, usually with indefinite results.  Accordingly, such acquired projects will have either prior exploration history or will have strong similarity to a recognized geologic ore deposit model.  Geographic emphasis will be place on the western United States.





	The geologic potential and ore deposit models have been defined and specific drill targets identified the Companys sole remaining property.  The Companys property evaluation process involves using basic geologic fieldwork to perform an initial evaluation of a property.  If the evaluation is positive, the Company seeks to acquire, either by staking unpatented mining claims on open public domain, or by leasing the property from the owner of private property or the owner of unpatented claims.  Once acquired, the Company then typically makes a more detailed evaluation of the property.  This detailed evaluation involves expenditures for exploration work which may include rock and soil sampling, geologic mapping, geophysics, trenching, drilling or other means to determine if economic mineralization is present on a property.





	Portions of the Companys mining properties are owned by third parties and leased to Star Gold as outlined in the following table:

	Annual lease payments totaling $247,000, annual exploration expenditures totaling $1.75m, and 185,000 shares due through 2020.  Annual advance royalty payment of $12,000.










	Compliance with Government Regulations






	Continuing to acquire and explore mineral properties in the State of Nevada will be require the Company to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the State of Nevada and the United States Federal agencies.






	United States






	Mining in the State of Nevada is subject to federal, state and local law. Three types of laws are of particular importance to the Companys U.S. mineral properties: those affecting land ownership and mining rights; those regulating mining operations; and those dealing with the environment.






	Land Ownership and Mining Rights.






	On Federal Lands, mining rights are governed by the General Mining Law of 1872 (General Mining Law) as amended, 30 U.S.C. §§ 21-161 (various sections), which allows the location of mining claims on certain Federal Lands upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and proper compliance with claim location requirements. A valid mining claim provides the holder with the right to conduct mining operations for the removal of locatable minerals, subject to compliance with the General Mining Law and Nevada state law governing the staking and registration of mining claims, as well as compliance with various federal, state and local operating and environmental laws, regulations and ordinances. As the owner or lessee of the unpatented mining claims, the Company has the right to conduct mining operations on the lands subject to the prior procurement of required operating permits and approvals, compliance with the terms and conditions of any applicable mining lease, and compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances.

	Mining Operations






	The exploration of mining properties and development and operation of mines is governed by both federal and state laws.





	The State of Nevada likewise requires various permits and approvals before mining operations can begin, although the state and federal regulatory agencies usually cooperate to minimize duplication of permitting efforts. Among other things, a detailed reclamation plan must be prepared and approved, with bonding in the amount of projected reclamation costs. The bond is used to ensure that proper reclamation takes place, and the bond will not be released until that time. The Nevada Department of Environmental Protection, which is referred to as the NDEP, is the state agency that administers the reclamation permits, mine permits and related closure plans on the Nevada property. Local jurisdictions (such as Eureka County) may also impose permitting requirements (such as conditional use permits or zoning approvals).






	Environmental Law






	The development, operation, closure, and reclamation of mining projects in the United States requires numerous notifications, permits, authorizations, and public agency decisions. Compliance with environmental and related laws and regulations requires us to obtain permits issued by regulatory agencies, and to file various reports and keep records of the Companys operations. Certain of these permits require periodic renewal or review of their conditions and may be subject to a public review process during which opposition to the Companys proposed operations may be encountered. The Company is currently operating under various permits for activities connected to mineral exploration, reclamation, and environmental considerations. Unless and until a mineral resource is proven, it is unlikely Star Gold Corp. operations will move beyond the exploration stage. If in the future the Company decides to proceed beyond exploration, there will be numerous notifications, permit applications, and other decisions to be addressed at that time.










	Competition






	Star Gold Corp. competes with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing and for the acquisition of new mineral properties and also for equipment and labor related to exploration and development of mineral properties. Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom the Company competes have greater financial and technical resources.  Accordingly, competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact Star Gold Corp.s ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for the Company to develop its mineral properties.





	The Company provides no assurance it will be able to compete in any of its business areas effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by the Company will not have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and operating results.






	Office and Other Facilities






	Star Gold Corp. currently maintains its administrative offices at 611 E. Sherman Avenue, Coeur d'Alene, ID  83814.  The telephone number is (208) 664-5066.  Star Gold Corp. does not currently own title to any real property.






	Employees






	The Company has no employees other than its executive officers as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Star Gold Corp. conducts business largely through independent contractor agreements with consultants.

	Research and Development Expenditures






	The Company has not incurred any research expenditures since incorporation.






	Reports to Security Holders






	The Registrant does not issue annual or quarterly reports to security holders other than the annual Form 10-K and quarterly Forms 10-Q as electronically filed with the SEC.  Electronically filed reports may be accessed at


	www.sec.gov






	.  Interested parties also may read and copy any materials filed with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street NW, Washington, DC 20549.  Information may be obtained on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (800) SEC-0330.






	PLAN OF OPERATION   






	The Company maintains a corporate office in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.  This is the primary administrative office for the Company and is utilized by Board Chairman Lindsay Gorrill and Chief Financial Officer Kelly Stopher.





	In the past year the Company completed the following:





	·


	Star Gold Corp Board formally decided to proceed with the studies necessary to allow an EIS document to be produced with the goal of obtaining a mine permit to be issued at Longstreet.


	·


	Met with representatives from USFS and BLM and other stakeholders as to an agreed pathway to proceed through to an EIS document.





	In 2016 the following studies were commenced:


	1.


	Fauna and Flora studies  late 2015 and completed June 2016.


	2.


	Water rights negotiations and requirements commenced in late 2015 and will be ongoing.


	3.


	Cultural Resource Studies began in July 2016.





	Due to the water requirements of the Longstreet Project additional water rights are required. Star Gold is currently in negotiation for these rights.  With the exception of hydrology related drilling, the Company does not intend to drill further at Longstreet deposit until permitting has been completed.





	Funds raised pursuant to our most recent private placement (see Note 5) are intended to finish all necessary studies and should be sufficient to progress from completing the necessary studies and into preparing an Environmental Impact Statement.





	In 2017, the most significant item apart from securing the required water rights is the development of a mine plan. This is currently in the process of being drafted.

	The hydrology work is contingent on securing additional financing.





	Based upon the current condition of the capital markets, mineral prices and the state of the Longstreet project, management reasonably believes it can source additional capital in the investment markets in the coming months and years.  The Company may also consider other sources of funding, including potential mergers, joint ventures and/or farm-out a portion of its exploration properties.


	 


	Future liquidity and capital requirements depend on many factors including timing, cost and progress of the Company's exploration efforts.  The Company will consider additional public offerings, private placement, mergers or debt instruments.





	Additional financing will be required in the future to complete all necessary steps to apply for final permits required to allow the Company to commence any construction of our mining facilities and to begin production of any minerals present in economically viable quantities. Although the Company believes it will be able to source additional financing there are no guarantees any needed financing will be available at the time needed or on acceptable terms, if at all.  If the Company is unable to raise additional financing when necessary, it may have to delay exploration efforts or property acquisitions, or be forced to cease operations.  Collaborative arrangements may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its mining claims.








	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS






	The Company has earned no revenues from operations in 2017 or 2016 and does not anticipate earning any revenues, from operations, in the foreseeable future. Star Gold Corp. is an exploration stage company and presently is seeking additional business opportunities.

	Mineral exploration expense for the nine months ended January 31, 2017, was $196,760 compared to $235,402 for the nine months ended January 31, 2016.  Claims expense decreased $10,165 for the nine month comparable period as a result of the Companys non-renewal of its Excalibur Property Agreement.   





	Environmental and permitting expense decreased from $167,076 for the nine months ended January 31, 2016, to $140,038 for the nine months ended January 31, 2017.  The Company performed extensive archaeological studies related to the permitting process during the nine months ended January 31, 2017.  Technical consultants engaged during the nine months ended January 31, 2017 were reclassified in 2017 to project management roles.





	The emphasis on exploration expense in the current year is on conducting environmental and engineering work geared toward permitting of an open pit heap leach pad operation at Longstreet rather than additional exploratory drilling.

	Legal fees increased $7,168 for the three months ended January 31, 2017 from the three months ended January 31, 2016.  The increase in legal fees was a result of ongoing legal matters related to corporate governance and statutory filings.





	Audit and accounting fees for the three months ended January 31, 2017 increased $974 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2016. The annual audit of the Companys financial statements came in on budget.  The Company expects its audit and accounting fees for the subsequent fiscal quarter to remain relatively constant per a fixed fee engagement with the audit firm.

	The Company total assets increased to $634,095 at January 31, 2017 compared to $358,202 at April 30, 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in cash balance related to the private placement of the Companys common stock.





	Equipment and mining interest, net of depreciation increased from $326,050 at April 30, 2016 to $360,874 at January 31, 2017 as a result of the acquisition of additional mining interests in thee Clifford claims at the Longstreet Property.





	At January 31, 2017, the Company had a working capital of $171,534 primarily related to cash balance from the Companys most recent private placement of its securities.  





	The Company is in compliance with all obligations of the Longstreet Agreement including required cumulative exploration expenditures.  





	As of January 31, 2017, the Company had cash of $225,686.  Since inception, the sources of the Companys financing have been through offerings of its equity and debt securities. Star Gold Corp. has not attained profitable operations and its ability to pursue any future plan of operation is likely dependent upon the Companys ability to obtain additional financing in the future.  





	Star Gold Corp. anticipates continuing to rely on sales of its debt and/or equity securities in order to continue to fund ongoing operations. Issuances of additional shares of common stock may result in dilution to the Company's existing stockholders. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete any additional sales of equity securities or that it will be able arrange for other financing to fund its planned business activities.   





	The Company completed as of January 31, 2017, a private placement offering that raised a total of $700,000.  The private placement consisted of the sale of Units at $0.05 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one common share of the Companys common stock and one common share purchase warrant.  Each Warrant is exercisable no later than sixty months from the date of issuance thereof to purchase one Common Share of the Companys stock at an exercise price of $0.15.  Once the Company has obtained all permits necessary to begin site development and construction at its Longstreet Property, the Company, at its sole discretion, may call the Warrants as due and exercisable by providing the Warrant holders of Warrants with 60 days written notice.

	Disruptions in the credit and financial markets over the past several years have had a material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies.  The prices for gold, silver and other base metals have also recently been subject to fluctuations which have had a material adverse impact on mining related companies ability to raise capital.  These disruptions could, among other things, make it more difficult for the Company to obtain, or increase the cost of obtaining, capital and financing for operations.  Access to additional capital may not be available to terms acceptable to the Company or at all.





	The Company's continuation as a going concern or ultimately to attain profitability is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis, to obtain additional financing as may be required and to further develop its properties.  Potential sources of cash, or relief of demand for cash, include additional external debt, the sale of shares of the Company's stock or alternative methods such as joint ventures, mergers or sale(s) of the Company's assets.  No assurances can be given, however, that the Company will be able to obtain any of these potential sources of cash.  The Company currently requires additional cash funding from outside sources to sustain existing operations and to meet current obligations and ongoing capital requirements.  





	The Companys plans for its long-term continuation as a going concern include financing future operations through sales of our common stock and/or debt and the eventual profitable exploitation of the Company's mining properties.  These plans may also, at some future point, include the formation of mining joint ventures with senior mining company partners on specific mineral properties whereby the joint venture partner would provide the necessary financing in return for an interest in the Companys properties and/or any minerals it may produce in the future.

	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK






	The Company does not hold any derivative instruments and does not engage in any hedging activities.








	ITEM 4.  




	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.







	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its President and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys financial statements for external reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Management evaluates the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework.





	Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys President and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017, and concluded that it is ineffective in assuring that the financial reports of the Company are free from material errors or misstatements.





	Management has identified one material weakness and is taking action to remedy and remove the weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting:





	·


	Inappropriate Segregation of Duties, as the same Officer was responsible for initiating and recording transactions, thereby creating segregation of duties weakness.






	Managements Remediation Initiatives

	.





	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance









	Page

	26

	of

	29

















	that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.





	The Company clearly recognizes, and continues to recognize, the importance of implementing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting and is working to implement an effective system of controls.   Management is currently evaluating avenues for mitigating the Company's internal controls weaknesses, but mitigating controls that are practical and cost effective may not be found based on the size, structure, and future existence of the organization, Since the Company has not generated any significant revenues, the Company is limited in its options for remediation efforts. Management, within the confines of its budgetary resources, will engage its outside accounting firm to assist with an assessment of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting as of January 31, 2017.






	Changes in internal controls over financial reporting






	There have been no material changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 31, 2017.

COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho, Oct. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Star Gold Corp. ("Star Gold" or the "Company") (OTC Markets: SRGZ) announced today that it has completed a capital raise of $650,000 through a private placement of the Company's shares of common stock and warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock. Members of management accounted for a significantly large portion of the raise.  As no brokers were involved, all monies will be available for use to the Company.








Specifically, the monies will be focused almost exclusively on completing the required studies necessary prior to an EIS (Environmental Impact Statement). These studies include:

Fauna & Flora Baseline Studies 
Hydrology - including securing the necessary water rights 
Cultural Resources Studies 
Geo-Chemistry Studies 
Basic engineering models of the proposed mine and leach pads. 

All of these studies have commenced and are at various stages of completion. 
Commenting on this capital raise, President David Segelov stated, "This capital raise enables Star Gold to fulfill all the required steps prior to having an EIS commissioned.  It is a significant step in the development of the Longstreet project and we are targeting to have the EIS filed before the middle of 2017."
About Star Gold Corp. 
Star Gold is a gold exploration/development company with 125 unpatented claims located within the Walker Lane belt. The Company is currently focused on developing its flagship property, the Longstreet Property.  The Longstreet Property is located in Nye County, Nevada.
