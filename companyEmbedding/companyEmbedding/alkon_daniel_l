Graduate Training
The Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs in Biomedical Science are comprised of seven
  degree-granting programs that reside in the School of Medicine and the School of
  Pharmacy, at the West Virginia University Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center.

More about the Interdisciplinary Graduate Programs in Biomedical Sciences

Graduate students in neuroscience laboratories may also complete advanced degrees in the Departments of Biology, Psychology, and the soon to be launched Biomedical Engineering graduate program. Because we are an interdisciplinary body, there are multiple ways in which prospective students can apply to engage in graduate study with our investigators. For more information on these programs, please click the links below:
Behavioral Neuroscience graduate program, Department of Psychology
Graduate research areas in the Department of Biology
Graduate program in Biomedical Engineering (coming soon)

Summer Undergraduate Research Internships (SURI)
For nine weeks over the summer, we will offer internships
  of research-intensive training for qualified undergraduate students. Our research
  opportunities incorporate molecular- to systems-level analyses of nervous system
  function. Projects are offered in sensory, cognitive, and behavioral neuroscience;
  in neural injury and neuro-degeneration; and in neuropsychiatric diseases. Interns
  are expected to devote their time to a well-defined research project under the
  supervision of a Center faculty member.
Interns will receive a $4,000 salary (before taxes) as well as housing in WVU apartments
  on campus. Interns will have access to many of the University's facilities, including
  the new Health Sciences Library, the Personal Rapid Transit system (PRT), and unlimited
  use of the the modern, 177,000 sq. ft. Student Recreation Center.

More about the SURI Program


Faculty Mentoring Program
The goal of the faculty mentoring program is to ensure both the success of new faculty
  and their retention at the institution. Our primary measure of success is based
  on the quality of scientific contributions to a field of inquiry, as judged primarily
  by the quality of peer-reviewed publications and by attracting extramural funding.
  We also value success in communicating scientific knowledge to peers, to students
  and to the lay public, through invited lectures and teaching.

Neurotechnology/Neuroscience (nt/ns) Teams
A major initiative during the past year has been the formation of neurotechnology/neuroscience teams to develop novel technologies that open avenues to address key scientific questions in neuroscience.

Breakthrough Blitz
The Breakthrough Blitz is a biweekly summary of three recently published breakthroughs
  in neuroscience. The eight-minute presentations are delivered by a scientist, a
  clinician, and a trainee, followed by a five-minute question/answer session. The
  Blitzes are held on the second and fourth Tuesday of the month in conference room
  301 of the Erma Byrd Biomedical Research Center, beginning at 4:45 PM (hors d'oeuvres
  at 4:30 PM).

MOBB
Each month, researchers at WVU convene for lunch to discuss current, cutting-edge
  research and scientific literature in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. MOBB
  (Meeting of Behavioral and Biomedical researchers) meetings are open to faculty
  and students, and target areas of behavioral and biomedical research, such as the
Neuroscience, Psychology, Pharmaceutical Systems &
  Policies, and Public Health areas. A catered lunch is provided at each meeting.

Neuroscience Student Forum
Every week, students, faculty, and staff gather to hear presentations by a neuroscience graduate student. These presentations are generally held on Thursdays at 3:00 PM, in room 301 BMRC.

Neuroscience Retreat
The annual Neuroscience Retreat is intended to boost awareness, facilitate multidisciplinary scientific exchange, and create cross-collaborations in the hopes of increasing translational research among our members, including scientists, researchers, clinicians, faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students.
Click here to learn more about this year's retreat.

Notable Neuroscientist Seminar Series
One or two times per semester, we intive a leader of neuroscience research to visit the Health Sciences Center. These guest lecturers are invited to give two presentations: a science talk based on thier research, and a more general, philosophical talk - the "big picture" perspectives - on the current and future states of neuroscience.

Seminars in Neuroscience
One a weekly basis each semester, neuroscientists visit our campus primarily through participation in the Department of Neurobiology & Anatomy seminar series. Visiting neuroscientists hosted through other departmental series are listed in the weekly preview of our events.
