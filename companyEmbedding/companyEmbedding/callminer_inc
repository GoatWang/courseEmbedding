Santander Consumer USA (SCUSA) is a leading automotive finance company with both direct and indirect lending divisions. The company currently has about 7.2 million agent connects per month across all of its contact centers. SCUSA implemented real-time monitoring using the Analyst Pool method where a team of resolution specialists monitor the alerts generated in real-time which allows them to immediately evaluate the situation and take action if necessary. If the call is intercepted, the specialists attempt to de-escalate the customer, then document the actions taken and flag the call for review. With the real-time monitoring program, SCUSA is able to minimize complaints and maintain better relationships with customers, in addition to avoiding callbacks that might have resulted from an unresolved issue.“Customers will typically calm down once a manager comes on the line, and even though the manager will offer the same solution the agent would have, simply having a manager on the call will de-escalate the situation and allow the call to move forward.”Kelly Seis,VP of Quality Assurance/ Speech Analytics at SCUSA

CallMiner, Inc. Key Developments

CallMiner Partners with Nuance Communications to Deliver Enterprise Speech Analytics to Transform the Way Businesses Interact with Customers
Jun 20 17
CallMiner announced a partnership with Nuance Communications to incorporate CallMiner Eureka, the analytics platform, into their analytics offering. This partnership will deliver improved contact center and agent performance, and optimize the customer experience for enterprises. Speech analytics enables organizations to analyze 100% of every customer conversation, automating the process of call monitoring and converting call recordings into business intelligence.  Through automated call monitoring, organizations can improve agent performance and retention, resulting in more efficient call handling, reduced compliance risk, increased sales, and improved customer service. The introduction of CallMiner Eureka adds to Nuance’s analytics product portfolio and services practice, allowing for full customer journey analysis, from initial IVR connection through completion of the customer interaction. This will enable enterprises to incorporate the true voice of the customer into their big data initiatives, for much richer customer intelligence and a better customer experience.


The Christian Broadcasting Network Selects CallMiner Eureka Speech Analytics to Provide Insights for Better Customer Experience
Mar 1 17
CallMiner announced that The Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) has selected CallMiner Eureka speech analytics to enable better experiences for the broad range of people engaging with the ministry. Over 250 prayer center agents in three locations -- Nashville, Virginia Beach and Manila, will be using the Eureka system. Although the majority of its callers and partners engage over the phone, CBN recognizes the importance and opportunities to reach people leveraging other channels such as email, text, web and social. Eureka analytics can evaluate the interactions, regardless of channel. This is one of the capabilities that attracted CBN to CallMiner. CallMiner Eureka solution packs and the additional categories that are available through the Eureka Xchange also influenced CBN's decision as they will accelerate speed to intelligence.


Health Insurance Innovations Forges Partnership with CallMiner to Provide Improved Quality Assurance, Customer Experience
Feb 2 17
Health Insurance Innovations, Inc. and CallMiner announced their newly formed partnership. This partnership will provide quality assurance and will improve agent performance while ensuring rigorous adherence to compliance guidelines. With its strong commitment to providing customers with unparalleled service, HII looks forward to this partnership. The solutions it delivers will serve to reinforce that commitment and to build consumer and regulatory confidence. CallMiner’s unrivaled reputation in the industry and its ability to deliver sensible quality assurance solutions cemented this new collaborative effort. Existing in a highly regulated industry and maintaining partnerships with licensed and carrier appointed insurance agents across the nation involves a network of processes and guidelines that necessitates such a responsive partner. That network requires solutions that allow HII to verify and to ensure quality assurance with each purchase. CallMiner’s cloud-based analytics platform and its ability to gather key business intelligence by listening to customer interactions will serve as ideal tools to allow HII to improve its customer experience.
