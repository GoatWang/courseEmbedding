I grew up in Kansas City working in my father’s body shop fixing cars. As a boy I learned how to work hard, stick to solving problems and build trusted working relationships. Today, my start-up, Mojo Mfg. Co is developing a targeted digital platform and segmented social network. Previously, as a founding partner of Open Minds Advertising I managed client relationships and built exceptional teams in our creative, production and traffic departments for fifteen years. My experience as a creative leader and entrepreneur is unique but my success comes from core principles I learned while working with my father back in Kansas.

Product details


 View a sample of this title using the ReadNow feature For 60 years, courts and practitioners have turned to the insights and analysis contained in Powell on Real Property. Updated 4 times a year, the 17-volume treatise (Main Treatise) includes many topics not originally part of the 1949 version -- for example, green buildings. Now the busy practitioner and researcher can reach for the new, highly abridged, 1-volume Michael Allan Wolf Desk Edition of the treatise. This is a new soft-bound, extremely condensed adaptation of Powell carefully crafted by the General Editor of the Main Treatise, Professor Michael Allan Wolf, to become the version of Powell you can keep at your desk or carry with you as you begin your real property law research and analysis. Valuable as a compact stand-alone resource, the Powell on Real Property: Michael Allan Wolf Desk Edition can also easily be used in tandem with the more comprehensive Main Treatise to delve deeper into real property law because its chapters and sections retain the same numbering system as the Main Treatise.  Questions Addressed in this Desk Edition
