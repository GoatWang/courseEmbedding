UnitedHealth 2Q profit surges as ACA participation shrinks

    By Associated Press
     | 
    July 19, 2017
    
UnitedHealth Group's second-quarter earnings soared as the nation's largest insurer dove deeper into government-funded health coverage like Medicare and Medicaid and continued to distance itself from the turbulent Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges.The insurer also said Tuesday that it drew $1.52 billion in operating earnings from its rapidly growing Optum business, which doesn't sell health insurance.





Private Plans
Unsure of the future, states guess their way through 2018 rate filing season

State regulators and insurers are in the homestretch of preparing rates for 2018. The federal government's month-by-month approach, however, to cost-sharing reduction payments creates a risky situation for payers, providers and consumers.





Self-Insured Plans
Judge blocks Anthem-Cigna merger 

A federal judge blocked the proposed $54 billion tie-up between national insurers Anthem and Cigna late Wednesday, saying the combination would harm competition in the national employer market.





Uninsured
Cardiac arrest incidence in Oregon dropped after Medicaid expansion
After Oregon expanded its Medicaid program in 2014, cardiac arrests significantly dropped among newly covered residents in one county, according to a new study.





Premiums & Benefits
Two health insurers expand Obamacare presence while others retreat
While some health insurers are bailing on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, other are swooping in to take the business they leave behind.





Health Insurance Exchanges
Aetna slapped with shareholder lawsuit over ACA exchange exits
Shareholders allege that national health insurer Aetna's decision to exit exchanges in 11 states in 2017 under false pretenses hurt their investment and the company's bottom line.

Unsure of the future, states guess their way through 2018 rate filing season

    By 
	Virgil Dickson
     | 
    July 26, 2017
    
State regulators and insurers are in the homestretch of preparing rates for 2018. The federal government's month-by-month approach, however, to cost-sharing reduction payments creates a risky situation for payers, providers and consumers.




Anthem warns of more marketplace exits, hints at future M&A opportunities

    By 
	Shelby Livingston
     | 
    July 26, 2017
    
Anthem, one of the biggest marketplace players, said it will exit more ACA exchanges in 2018 if it doesn't feel certain that the Trump administration will fund cost-sharing reduction subsidies. That would be a major blow to exchanges.



Bupa breach affects more than half a million customers

    By 
	Rachel Z. Arndt
     | 
    July 13, 2017
    
Unlike recent ranswomare attacks, the breach came from within the company.



Insurers with the largest share of individual market silent on whether they'd return to medical underwriting

    By 
	Mara Lee
     | 
    July 13, 2017
    
Several prominent health insurer trade groups oppose bringing back pre-ACA style individual plans. But if the Cruz amendment became law, would insurers now on the exchanges choose to sell them? Most declined to speculate.




Oscar and Humana team up to sell small-business plans

    By 
	Shelby Livingston
     | 
    July 12, 2017
    
The partnership with Louisville, Ky.-based Humana, in which the insurers will share risk equally, marks one of Oscar's first forays into employer-sponsored insurance, where more than 150 million Americans get their coverage.




CMS approves Alaska waiver aimed at stabilizing individual market

    By 
	Virgil Dickson
     | 
    July 11, 2017
    
The CMS has approved a first of its kind waiver for Alaska that will allow federal money to create a high-risk fund. It will allow the state to continue trying to entice cash-strapped insurance companies to stay on the individual market in the state and not raise premiums.




Small insurers rack up large charges while Blues benefit under ACA's risk-adjustment program

    By 
	Shelby Livingston
     | 
    July 05, 2017
    
Small health insurers and the few remaining co-op plans were again sacked with large charges under the Affordable Care Act's risk-adjustment program. Blues plans received the largest payouts.




Cruz insurance proposal underscores trouble with protecting pre-existing conditions

    By 
	Harris Meyer
     | 
    June 30, 2017
    
Health insurers are nervous about a new deregulation proposal by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz that could be added to the Senate Republicans' struggling legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.




Aetna targets dentist 'superprescribers' in latest opioid initiative 

    By 
	Shelby Livingston
     | 
    May 18, 2017
    
Aetna's initiative aims to reduce the amount of powerful opioid prescriptions written by dentists and oral maxillofacial surgeons.




Trump administration lets consumers skip HealthCare.gov 

    By 
	Virgil Dickson
     | 
    May 17, 2017
    
The Trump administration took another step Wednesday toward deregulating federal insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act. The new policy will allow consumers to skip HealthCare.gov entirely to sign up for coverage in 2018.




UnitedHealth pulls plug on plan testing no-charge primary care

    By 
	Harris Meyer
     | 
    May 15, 2017
    
UnitedHealth Group is shutting down its health plan experiment featuring staff providers offering unlimited primary and behavioral care at no charge.




Anthem terminates Cigna merger agreement

    By 
	Mara Lee
     | 
    May 12, 2017
    
Anthem announced Friday morning that it will stop pursuing Cigna, a merger that long ago turned into a hostile takeover bid. But the deal's $1.85 billion break-up fee is still in dispute.
