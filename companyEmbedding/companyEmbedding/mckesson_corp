History[edit]
Founded in New York City as Olcott & McKesson by Charles Olcott and John McKesson in 1833, the business began as an importer and wholesaler of botanical drugs. A third partner, Daniel Robbins joined the enterprise as it grew, and it was renamed McKesson & Robbins following Olcott's death in 1853.
The company successfully emerged from one of the most notorious business/accounting scandals of the 20th century—the McKesson & Robbins scandal, a watershed event that led to major changes in American auditing standards and securities regulations after being exposed in 1938. In the 1960s, McKesson & Robbins merged with Foremost Dairies of San Francisco to form Foremost-McKesson Inc.[4]
Since the mid-20th century, McKesson has derived an increasing proportion of its income from medical technology, rather than pharmaceuticals. This culminated in its purchase of medical information systems firm HBO & Company (HBOC) in 1999; the combined firm was briefly known as McKessonHBOC. Accounting irregularities at HBOC reduced the company's share price by half, and resulted in the dismissal and prosecution of many HBOC executives. The firm's name reverted to "McKesson" in 2001.[5] McKesson Technology Solutions, as the information technology branch of the company is now known, has continued to increase its market share through acquisitions, notably Per Se Technologies, RelayHealth, and Practice Partner.
In 2010, McKesson acquired leading cancer services company US Oncology, Inc. for $2.16 billion, which was integrated into the McKesson Specialty Care Solutions business.
On June 24, 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Chairman and CEO John Hammergren's pension benefits of $159 million had set a record for "the largest pension on file for a current executive of a public company, and almost certainly the largest ever in corporate America." A study in 2012 by GMI Ratings, which tracks executive pay, found that 60% of CEOs at S&P 500 companies have pensions, and their value averages $11.5 million.[6]
In addition to its offices throughout North America, McKesson also has international offices in Australia, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Today, McKesson is one of the oldest continually operating businesses in the United States.
As of August 23, 2016, McKesson has decided to merge a majority of its IT business with Change Healthcare.
In 2017, McKesson was involved in a number of lawsuits against the state of Arkansas over the supply of vecuronium bromide. McKesson was under contract by Pfizer not to sell to any correctional facility that authorized and carried out Capital punishment.[7][8]
McKesson Provider Technologies[edit]
McKesson Provider Technologies is the retail name for McKesson Technology Solutions; the software development division of McKesson. Their customer base in the United States includes 50% of all health systems, 20% of all physician practices, 25% of home care agencies, and 77% of health systems with more than 200 beds.
On June 20, 2005, McKesson Provider Technologies acquired Medcon, Ltd., an Israeli company which provides Web-based cardiac image and information management solutions for heart centers, that includes: diagnostic digital image management, archiving, procedure reporting, and workflow management.[9]
In October 2013, McKesson agreed to buy a 50% stake in German peer Celesio for $8.3 billion.[10]
Health Mart pharmacy franchise[edit]

Health Mart is a network of over 4,000[11] independently owned and operated pharmacies. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation, which owns the name "Health Mart." McKesson acquired Health Mart owner FoxMeyer in 1996.
McKesson Canada[edit]
In 1991, McKesson Corporation acquired a 100 percent interest in Medis Health and Pharmaceutical Services from Provigo. In 2002, the McKesson Canada name was adopted. McKesson Canada is a wholly owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation. It includes various business units: McKesson Pharmaceutical, McKesson Automation, McKesson Specialty, McKesson Health Solutions and McKesson Information Solutions.
In March 2016, McKesson agreed to purchase Canadian pharmacy chain Rexall from the Katz Group of Companies for $3 billion.[12] The proposed deal is subject to government approval.
McKesson in the United Kingdom[edit]
In the United Kingdom, McKesson (operating as McKesson Information Solutions UK Ltd) was a provider of information technology services to the health care industry. In addition to numerous clinical software systems and finance and procurement services, McKesson also was responsible for developing the Electronic Staff Record system for the National Health Service which provided an integrated payroll system for NHS's 1.3 million staff, making it the world’s largest single payroll IT system. McKesson Shared Services also provided payroll services for over 20 NHS Trusts, paying over 100,000 NHS members.
McKesson's United Kingdom base was in Warwick with data centers in Newcastle upon Tyne and Brent Cross and offices in Sheffield, Bangor, Glasgow and Vauxhall, London. Across the United Kingdom, it employed over 500 people.
In June/July 2014 McKesson sold most of their healthcare software business to the private equity firm Symphony Technology Group and indicated also that they would not be re-bidding for the Electronic Staff Record contract.[13][14] This came after the company had posted significant year on year losses in revenue (16% in the 2012/13 financial year[15]) after taking over a very successful British operation in 2011.[16]
McKesson in Australia and New Zealand[edit]
In 2010, McKesson Asia-Pacific was acquired by Medibank Private Ltd.[17][18]
McKesson ANZ is a fully owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation. McKesson expanded its footprint in Australia and New Zealand by acquiring Emendo in November, 2012.[19] McKesson ANZ develops and sells healthcare optimization services and software. The company has traditionally been focused on the public markets in Australia and New Zealand. The majority of the District Health Boards in NZ use one or more of McKesson’s Capacity Management solutions.
Christchurch, New Zealand, is one of McKesson’s global Capacity Management R&D centers of excellence. All of McKesson’s R&D for McKesson Capacity Planner is performed in New Zealand. The company employs approximately 40 team members across Australia and New Zealand including general management, R&D, sales, services and support employees.
McKesson Capacity Planner (formerly Emendo CapPlan) is used in more than 40 hospitals in Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Canada and the US[20] to forecast future patient activity and help health systems to allocate resources efficiently and identify unnecessary costs.[19][21]
Facilities[edit]
In addition to its global headquarters in San Francisco, California, McKesson maintains facilities around North America.
Former divisions[edit]
McKesson operated the Mosswood Wine Company from 1978 until 1987, when the division was sold to maintain their focus on pharmaceuticals. The division was founded and run by wine writer Gerald Asher.[22]

History[edit]
Founded in New York City as Olcott & McKesson by Charles Olcott and John McKesson in 1833, the business began as an importer and wholesaler of botanical drugs. A third partner, Daniel Robbins joined the enterprise as it grew, and it was renamed McKesson & Robbins following Olcott's death in 1853.
The company successfully emerged from one of the most notorious business/accounting scandals of the 20th century—the McKesson & Robbins scandal, a watershed event that led to major changes in American auditing standards and securities regulations after being exposed in 1938. In the 1960s, McKesson & Robbins merged with Foremost Dairies of San Francisco to form Foremost-McKesson Inc.[4]
Since the mid-20th century, McKesson has derived an increasing proportion of its income from medical technology, rather than pharmaceuticals. This culminated in its purchase of medical information systems firm HBO & Company (HBOC) in 1999; the combined firm was briefly known as McKessonHBOC. Accounting irregularities at HBOC reduced the company's share price by half, and resulted in the dismissal and prosecution of many HBOC executives. The firm's name reverted to "McKesson" in 2001.[5] McKesson Technology Solutions, as the information technology branch of the company is now known, has continued to increase its market share through acquisitions, notably Per Se Technologies, RelayHealth, and Practice Partner.
In 2010, McKesson acquired leading cancer services company US Oncology, Inc. for $2.16 billion, which was integrated into the McKesson Specialty Care Solutions business.
On June 24, 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Chairman and CEO John Hammergren's pension benefits of $159 million had set a record for "the largest pension on file for a current executive of a public company, and almost certainly the largest ever in corporate America." A study in 2012 by GMI Ratings, which tracks executive pay, found that 60% of CEOs at S&P 500 companies have pensions, and their value averages $11.5 million.[6]
In addition to its offices throughout North America, McKesson also has international offices in Australia, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Today, McKesson is one of the oldest continually operating businesses in the United States.
As of August 23, 2016, McKesson has decided to merge a majority of its IT business with Change Healthcare.
In 2017, McKesson was involved in a number of lawsuits against the state of Arkansas over the supply of vecuronium bromide. McKesson was under contract by Pfizer not to sell to any correctional facility that authorized and carried out Capital punishment.[7][8]
McKesson Provider Technologies[edit]
McKesson Provider Technologies is the retail name for McKesson Technology Solutions; the software development division of McKesson. Their customer base in the United States includes 50% of all health systems, 20% of all physician practices, 25% of home care agencies, and 77% of health systems with more than 200 beds.
On June 20, 2005, McKesson Provider Technologies acquired Medcon, Ltd., an Israeli company which provides Web-based cardiac image and information management solutions for heart centers, that includes: diagnostic digital image management, archiving, procedure reporting, and workflow management.[9]
In October 2013, McKesson agreed to buy a 50% stake in German peer Celesio for $8.3 billion.[10]
Health Mart pharmacy franchise[edit]

Health Mart is a network of over 4,000[11] independently owned and operated pharmacies. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation, which owns the name "Health Mart." McKesson acquired Health Mart owner FoxMeyer in 1996.
McKesson Canada[edit]
In 1991, McKesson Corporation acquired a 100 percent interest in Medis Health and Pharmaceutical Services from Provigo. In 2002, the McKesson Canada name was adopted. McKesson Canada is a wholly owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation. It includes various business units: McKesson Pharmaceutical, McKesson Automation, McKesson Specialty, McKesson Health Solutions and McKesson Information Solutions.
In March 2016, McKesson agreed to purchase Canadian pharmacy chain Rexall from the Katz Group of Companies for $3 billion.[12] The proposed deal is subject to government approval.
McKesson in the United Kingdom[edit]
In the United Kingdom, McKesson (operating as McKesson Information Solutions UK Ltd) was a provider of information technology services to the health care industry. In addition to numerous clinical software systems and finance and procurement services, McKesson also was responsible for developing the Electronic Staff Record system for the National Health Service which provided an integrated payroll system for NHS's 1.3 million staff, making it the world’s largest single payroll IT system. McKesson Shared Services also provided payroll services for over 20 NHS Trusts, paying over 100,000 NHS members.
McKesson's United Kingdom base was in Warwick with data centers in Newcastle upon Tyne and Brent Cross and offices in Sheffield, Bangor, Glasgow and Vauxhall, London. Across the United Kingdom, it employed over 500 people.
In June/July 2014 McKesson sold most of their healthcare software business to the private equity firm Symphony Technology Group and indicated also that they would not be re-bidding for the Electronic Staff Record contract.[13][14] This came after the company had posted significant year on year losses in revenue (16% in the 2012/13 financial year[15]) after taking over a very successful British operation in 2011.[16]
McKesson in Australia and New Zealand[edit]
In 2010, McKesson Asia-Pacific was acquired by Medibank Private Ltd.[17][18]
McKesson ANZ is a fully owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation. McKesson expanded its footprint in Australia and New Zealand by acquiring Emendo in November, 2012.[19] McKesson ANZ develops and sells healthcare optimization services and software. The company has traditionally been focused on the public markets in Australia and New Zealand. The majority of the District Health Boards in NZ use one or more of McKesson’s Capacity Management solutions.
Christchurch, New Zealand, is one of McKesson’s global Capacity Management R&D centers of excellence. All of McKesson’s R&D for McKesson Capacity Planner is performed in New Zealand. The company employs approximately 40 team members across Australia and New Zealand including general management, R&D, sales, services and support employees.
McKesson Capacity Planner (formerly Emendo CapPlan) is used in more than 40 hospitals in Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Canada and the US[20] to forecast future patient activity and help health systems to allocate resources efficiently and identify unnecessary costs.[19][21]
Facilities[edit]
In addition to its global headquarters in San Francisco, California, McKesson maintains facilities around North America.
Former divisions[edit]
McKesson operated the Mosswood Wine Company from 1978 until 1987, when the division was sold to maintain their focus on pharmaceuticals. The division was founded and run by wine writer Gerald Asher.[22]

History[edit]
Founded in New York City as Olcott & McKesson by Charles Olcott and John McKesson in 1833, the business began as an importer and wholesaler of botanical drugs. A third partner, Daniel Robbins joined the enterprise as it grew, and it was renamed McKesson & Robbins following Olcott's death in 1853.
The company successfully emerged from one of the most notorious business/accounting scandals of the 20th century—the McKesson & Robbins scandal, a watershed event that led to major changes in American auditing standards and securities regulations after being exposed in 1938. In the 1960s, McKesson & Robbins merged with Foremost Dairies of San Francisco to form Foremost-McKesson Inc.[4]
Since the mid-20th century, McKesson has derived an increasing proportion of its income from medical technology, rather than pharmaceuticals. This culminated in its purchase of medical information systems firm HBO & Company (HBOC) in 1999; the combined firm was briefly known as McKessonHBOC. Accounting irregularities at HBOC reduced the company's share price by half, and resulted in the dismissal and prosecution of many HBOC executives. The firm's name reverted to "McKesson" in 2001.[5] McKesson Technology Solutions, as the information technology branch of the company is now known, has continued to increase its market share through acquisitions, notably Per Se Technologies, RelayHealth, and Practice Partner.
In 2010, McKesson acquired leading cancer services company US Oncology, Inc. for $2.16 billion, which was integrated into the McKesson Specialty Care Solutions business.
On June 24, 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Chairman and CEO John Hammergren's pension benefits of $159 million had set a record for "the largest pension on file for a current executive of a public company, and almost certainly the largest ever in corporate America." A study in 2012 by GMI Ratings, which tracks executive pay, found that 60% of CEOs at S&P 500 companies have pensions, and their value averages $11.5 million.[6]
In addition to its offices throughout North America, McKesson also has international offices in Australia, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Today, McKesson is one of the oldest continually operating businesses in the United States.
As of August 23, 2016, McKesson has decided to merge a majority of its IT business with Change Healthcare.
In 2017, McKesson was involved in a number of lawsuits against the state of Arkansas over the supply of vecuronium bromide. McKesson was under contract by Pfizer not to sell to any correctional facility that authorized and carried out Capital punishment.[7][8]
McKesson Provider Technologies[edit]
McKesson Provider Technologies is the retail name for McKesson Technology Solutions; the software development division of McKesson. Their customer base in the United States includes 50% of all health systems, 20% of all physician practices, 25% of home care agencies, and 77% of health systems with more than 200 beds.
On June 20, 2005, McKesson Provider Technologies acquired Medcon, Ltd., an Israeli company which provides Web-based cardiac image and information management solutions for heart centers, that includes: diagnostic digital image management, archiving, procedure reporting, and workflow management.[9]
In October 2013, McKesson agreed to buy a 50% stake in German peer Celesio for $8.3 billion.[10]
Health Mart pharmacy franchise[edit]

Health Mart is a network of over 4,000[11] independently owned and operated pharmacies. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation, which owns the name "Health Mart." McKesson acquired Health Mart owner FoxMeyer in 1996.
McKesson Canada[edit]
In 1991, McKesson Corporation acquired a 100 percent interest in Medis Health and Pharmaceutical Services from Provigo. In 2002, the McKesson Canada name was adopted. McKesson Canada is a wholly owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation. It includes various business units: McKesson Pharmaceutical, McKesson Automation, McKesson Specialty, McKesson Health Solutions and McKesson Information Solutions.
In March 2016, McKesson agreed to purchase Canadian pharmacy chain Rexall from the Katz Group of Companies for $3 billion.[12] The proposed deal is subject to government approval.
McKesson in the United Kingdom[edit]
In the United Kingdom, McKesson (operating as McKesson Information Solutions UK Ltd) was a provider of information technology services to the health care industry. In addition to numerous clinical software systems and finance and procurement services, McKesson also was responsible for developing the Electronic Staff Record system for the National Health Service which provided an integrated payroll system for NHS's 1.3 million staff, making it the world’s largest single payroll IT system. McKesson Shared Services also provided payroll services for over 20 NHS Trusts, paying over 100,000 NHS members.
McKesson's United Kingdom base was in Warwick with data centers in Newcastle upon Tyne and Brent Cross and offices in Sheffield, Bangor, Glasgow and Vauxhall, London. Across the United Kingdom, it employed over 500 people.
In June/July 2014 McKesson sold most of their healthcare software business to the private equity firm Symphony Technology Group and indicated also that they would not be re-bidding for the Electronic Staff Record contract.[13][14] This came after the company had posted significant year on year losses in revenue (16% in the 2012/13 financial year[15]) after taking over a very successful British operation in 2011.[16]
McKesson in Australia and New Zealand[edit]
In 2010, McKesson Asia-Pacific was acquired by Medibank Private Ltd.[17][18]
McKesson ANZ is a fully owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation. McKesson expanded its footprint in Australia and New Zealand by acquiring Emendo in November, 2012.[19] McKesson ANZ develops and sells healthcare optimization services and software. The company has traditionally been focused on the public markets in Australia and New Zealand. The majority of the District Health Boards in NZ use one or more of McKesson’s Capacity Management solutions.
Christchurch, New Zealand, is one of McKesson’s global Capacity Management R&D centers of excellence. All of McKesson’s R&D for McKesson Capacity Planner is performed in New Zealand. The company employs approximately 40 team members across Australia and New Zealand including general management, R&D, sales, services and support employees.
McKesson Capacity Planner (formerly Emendo CapPlan) is used in more than 40 hospitals in Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Canada and the US[20] to forecast future patient activity and help health systems to allocate resources efficiently and identify unnecessary costs.[19][21]
Facilities[edit]
In addition to its global headquarters in San Francisco, California, McKesson maintains facilities around North America.
Former divisions[edit]
McKesson operated the Mosswood Wine Company from 1978 until 1987, when the division was sold to maintain their focus on pharmaceuticals. The division was founded and run by wine writer Gerald Asher.[22]

I don't know why someone thinks it's flimsy; it has stood up for the last six years to a range of abuse!  I love this chair.  Also, I'm 5'9" and it fits just fine!

											I just wanted to drop a quick line to say THANK YOU. Just as you promised my travel nebulizer and wheelchair bag showed up at my front door today.  I definitely would say that your service is above and beyond the call of duty. You are the reason I deal with Allegro and not with one of the many other vendors out there via the web. You have been consistent with excellent service (in this day and age service means a lot).  Just wanted to let you know that have a full 10 ATTA BOYS from me. Again, THANK YOU.  If you would like to share this e-mail with a superior/supervisor or other you have my consent. Should they have any questions, they may contact me.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

Dear Customers,


Thank you again for another successful GIVING DAY.


With your help we have been able to touch the lives of abused women, special needs children, under privileged kids, brave soldiers and homeless youth of our country.


This month let us touch the lives of our furry friends and the people they help. Yes, I am talking about service dogs. Dogs that make children with autism safe from the dangers they might face when they wander. Dogs that help kids with seizures sleep in their own bed. Dogs that help children with disabilities and veterans who have lost use of their limb or hearing.

So we would like to give 10% of our sales on GIVING DAY to 4 Paws for Ability, a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization based in Ohio. Their mission is to place quality service dogs with children with disabilities and veterans who have lost use of limbs or hearing; help with animal rescue, and educate the public regarding use of service dogs in public places. They train dogs as Autism Assistance Dogs, Diabetic Alert Dogs, Facilitated Guide Dogs, FASD Assistance Dogs, Hearing Ear Dogs, Mobility Assistance Dogs, Seizure Assistance Dogs, Veterans Assistance Dogs and more. There is a lot of work that goes in to prepare these service dogs for the role they play and the miracle they become. We thank the team at 4 Paws for Ability for the miracles they have done and the joy they have brought in the lives of many.


So please join me on August 11th to support 4 Paws for Ability and their service dogs. Shop more to give more.


Thank you for being our partner and believing in us.


Naheed Quaisar
Co-Founder and CEO












Help us spread the word
Please help us get the word out. Together, we can give ‘4 Paws for Ability’ the support it needs to breed, socialize, train and place service dogs with children and veterans. Starting from their in-house breeding program to final ceremony of a publicly socialized dog, they need all the help and support from us.

In 1995, Karen Shirk was told she was too disabled to receive a service dog. She decided to make sure no one else ever had to hear those words.
4 Paws for Ability is the embodiment of Karen’s vision - a nonprofit organization that breeds, socializes, trains, and places service dogs with children and veterans. Since its inception in 1998, 4 Paws has paired over 1,100 trained service dogs to people living with a variety of disabilities. With a team of 75 employees and over 600 volunteers, 4 Paws now places over 100 dogs per year. 4 Paws dogs (and the humans they love and serve) can be found in almost all 50 statesas well as Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and Switzerland. 


Our first priority is always to reunite our youth with healthy, functional family. For the majority of our kids for whom family is not an option, we give them an educational & vocational assessment and help them find a job that suits their skills and interest. We offer many services to help, from mock interviews & resume writing classes to workshops on basic life skills and healthy relationships.





Dogs trained through 4 Paws meet the criteria for ‘service animals’ as defined by the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA). These dogs serve in diverse areas:
• Diabetic alert
• Seizure alert
• Hearing assistance
• Autism assistance
• Mobility assistance
• Multipurpose assistance
• PTSD assistance
• Assistance for children with Fetal Alcohol
• Syndrome Disorder (FASD)/drug exposure


















The 4 Paws journey begins with an in-house breeding program that produces healthy dogs with the behavioral profile needed to succeed as an assistance animal. The dogs are accustomed to human interaction from their first day of life; staff and volunteers assist in the whelping rooms and continuously monitor the new litters. As soon as the puppies are weaned, they are moved to the Puppy House. This is a popular volunteer opportunity; imagine walking into a house full of puppies, spending hours playing and cuddling with them!
Puppies soon begin public socialization. This is a critical time in a puppy’s development. Puppies, under careful supervision, are slowly exposed to various stimuli - crowds, grass, leashes, service dog vests - to acclimate them to life as a service dog. They are then moved out of the puppy house and into the care of a puppy raiser.
Some of our dogs enter a traditional foster home setting, with volunteers who commit not only to the raising of a puppy that is not their own, but also to the challenging (and rewarding) task of exposing that puppy to the widest possible number of socialization opportunities. Other dogs spend time at one of four Ohio correctional facilities we use for four-six weeks learning basic obedience, potty training, and crate training by vetted inmates who attend a weekly class with a 4 Paws trainer.




Other puppies join the 4 Paws University program. Currently, 4 Paws partners with 25 universities within a three-hour radius of the facility; student organizations are established on these campuses to foster several dogs at a time, often in teams that allow for greater diversity in the puppies’ experiences. College campuses provide an enormous variety of socialization opportunities, from classroom environments (important for those dogs who will serve a school-aged child) to sporting events. Many of our 4 Paws dogs have walked with their college fosters across the stage as the students receive their diplomas; the students love the chance to share this important achievement with their foster pup, who helped make their college experience so memorable and rewarding.
Around one year of age, the professional training staff at 4 Paws evaluate each dog to determine if the dog meets the strict criteria necessary to continue in advanced training. Some dogs are not selected for advanced training; at this point, they are made available for adoption. The 4 Paws team likes to call these dogs the ‘fabulous flunkies’ - loving dogs who fell just short of the narrow standards needed for service doghood. Many happy dog owners have found their perfect companion - and many happy dogs have found ‘forever homes’ - through the adoption program. 
The dogs who continue in the advanced training program begin rigorous instruction with the training staff. It is here the dog is trained for the specific task that will serve their ‘match’ - the child or veteran who has been on their own journey while their service dog in training has been working so hard. 


















The dog, you see, is only half the team.
While the dog has been learning everything from ‘sit’ to ‘leave it’ to the intricate training required to alert a potential medical crisis, the recipient of the dog has been busy. Service dogs are not covered by most insurance plans, and a fully trained service dog through 4 Paws costs between $40,000-$60,000. Families who have been approved by 4 Paws are asked to pay or fundraise $17,000 (except veterans who are completely free); 4 Paws provides promotional assistance and training during the fundraising process. Most families have multiple events during their fundraising period. Some families raise the required amount; others find they raise enough money to cover the full cost of the dog. Excess funds are administered through 4 Paws to families who may have fallen short during the fundraising process, adhering to one of the most fundamental principles of the 4 Paws mission: no one approved through the 4 Paws application process is denied because of the inability to pay.
The final steps of the journey are made together by the child or veteran with disabilities and the service dog who has been trained as their companion. The final two weeks of training show the recipient how to work with (and begin life with) a new service dog. During this time, the bonding process begins - the start of a lifetime partnership between human and canine.
A graduation ceremony at the end of the training allows the puppy raisers and the new service dog families to celebrate the successful completion of the training process, connecting individuals who were impacted by the raising and training of these dogs.

Covenant House New Orleans was founded on the edge of the French Quarter 30 years ago to provide a safe haven for homeless, runaway, and at-risk youth (ages 22 and under). We have provided over 20,000 kids with food, shelter, clothing, medical care, educational and vocational support, individual and family counseling, job readiness and placement, short & long-term housing, life skills, and more.
The vast majority of our youth have endured physical and/or sexual abuse and have also experienced the violence of the streets. Our counselors estimate 85% suffer from some form of traumatic stress disorder. Tulane’s Cowen Institute estimates there are 26,000 at-risk youth in our community. Our first priority is always to reunite our youth with healthy, functional family. For the majority of our kids for whom family is not an option, we give them an educational & vocational assessment and help them find a job that suits their skills and interest.

Soldiers’ Angels provides aid and comfort to the men and women of the United States Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and their families and a growing veteran population. Soldiers’ Angels was established in 2003 by the mother of a son who was deployed to Iraq. She began sending care packages to her son and was then asked to not only send more care packages to many more deployed but to also assist with other needs. September 11th was a catalyst that inspired Americans to support the military and help out any way they could. Soldiers’ Angels was created as an opportunity for them to provide that support with care packages, hand-sewn blankets, letters, cards, and other items from ‘home’.
In just 14 years, since this small beginning of sending care packages, Soldiers’ Angels has grown to over 12 Programs with over 100,000 volunteers nationwide. Most of the programs and services offered by Soldiers’ Angels are performed by volunteers who work tirelessly supporting our nation’s veterans, wounded warriors, deployed service members and their families.

On May 12th, HPFY donated 10% of the day’s sales to ‘Asha for Education’. Asha for Education took roots in 1991 when a group of students including Deepak Gupta, Sandeep Pandey, and VJP Srivatsavoy from the University of Berkeley, CA got together and discussed ways to bring about a socio-economic change in India. The group was formed with a belief that education is a requisite to bring about the much needed socio economic change in India. It was named ‘Asha’, meaning ‘hope’. Since then, Asha for Education has grown via its chapters, and today has more than 65 chapters worldwide.
 Asha for Education is a 501(c)(3) organization in the US. Each year, our work touches the lives of several thousands of children across a few hundreds of projects. We have no offices, and 100% of our efforts are driven by unpaid volunteers. All donations are tax deductible, and we have earned a reputation for sending >98% of donations to our projects.

On April 14th, HPFY donated 10% of the day’s sales to ‘Doug Fluite, Jr. Foundation for Autism’. The Flutie Foundation awards grants to individuals and families dealing with the challenges of autism.
The Doug Flutie, Jr. Foundation for Autism, Inc. was established in 1998 by former NFL quarterback Doug Flutie and his wife, Laurie, in honor of their son, Doug, Jr. who was diagnosed with autism at the age of three. Through their General Grants, Joeys Fund, Allison Keller Technology fund and other programs and initiatives, The Flutie Foundation awards grants to individuals and families dealing with the challenges of autism as well as to the organizations that support them. The grants that they provide give individuals with autism access to much needed educational and other support services, autism specific active lifestyles programs and assistance with transitioning to adult independence. In addition The Flutie Foundation, through their grant programs, awards grants to nonprofit organizations that provide direct services such as family support, education, advocacy and recreational opportunities for individuals with autism.

On March 10th, two days after International Women’s day, HPFY donated 10% of the day’s sales to Women’s of Danbury.

History[edit]
Founded in New York City as Olcott & McKesson by Charles Olcott and John McKesson in 1833, the business began as an importer and wholesaler of botanical drugs. A third partner, Daniel Robbins joined the enterprise as it grew, and it was renamed McKesson & Robbins following Olcott's death in 1853.
The company successfully emerged from one of the most notorious business/accounting scandals of the 20th century—the McKesson & Robbins scandal, a watershed event that led to major changes in American auditing standards and securities regulations after being exposed in 1938. In the 1960s, McKesson & Robbins merged with Foremost Dairies of San Francisco to form Foremost-McKesson Inc.[4]
Since the mid-20th century, McKesson has derived an increasing proportion of its income from medical technology, rather than pharmaceuticals. This culminated in its purchase of medical information systems firm HBO & Company (HBOC) in 1999; the combined firm was briefly known as McKessonHBOC. Accounting irregularities at HBOC reduced the company's share price by half, and resulted in the dismissal and prosecution of many HBOC executives. The firm's name reverted to "McKesson" in 2001.[5] McKesson Technology Solutions, as the information technology branch of the company is now known, has continued to increase its market share through acquisitions, notably Per Se Technologies, RelayHealth, and Practice Partner.
In 2010, McKesson acquired leading cancer services company US Oncology, Inc. for $2.16 billion, which was integrated into the McKesson Specialty Care Solutions business.
On June 24, 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Chairman and CEO John Hammergren's pension benefits of $159 million had set a record for "the largest pension on file for a current executive of a public company, and almost certainly the largest ever in corporate America." A study in 2012 by GMI Ratings, which tracks executive pay, found that 60% of CEOs at S&P 500 companies have pensions, and their value averages $11.5 million.[6]
In addition to its offices throughout North America, McKesson also has international offices in Australia, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Today, McKesson is one of the oldest continually operating businesses in the United States.
As of August 23, 2016, McKesson has decided to merge a majority of its IT business with Change Healthcare.
In 2017, McKesson was involved in a number of lawsuits against the state of Arkansas over the supply of vecuronium bromide. McKesson was under contract by Pfizer not to sell to any correctional facility that authorized and carried out Capital punishment.[7][8]
McKesson Provider Technologies[edit]
McKesson Provider Technologies is the retail name for McKesson Technology Solutions; the software development division of McKesson. Their customer base in the United States includes 50% of all health systems, 20% of all physician practices, 25% of home care agencies, and 77% of health systems with more than 200 beds.
On June 20, 2005, McKesson Provider Technologies acquired Medcon, Ltd., an Israeli company which provides Web-based cardiac image and information management solutions for heart centers, that includes: diagnostic digital image management, archiving, procedure reporting, and workflow management.[9]
In October 2013, McKesson agreed to buy a 50% stake in German peer Celesio for $8.3 billion.[10]
Health Mart pharmacy franchise[edit]

Health Mart is a network of over 4,000[11] independently owned and operated pharmacies. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation, which owns the name "Health Mart." McKesson acquired Health Mart owner FoxMeyer in 1996.
McKesson Canada[edit]
In 1991, McKesson Corporation acquired a 100 percent interest in Medis Health and Pharmaceutical Services from Provigo. In 2002, the McKesson Canada name was adopted. McKesson Canada is a wholly owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation. It includes various business units: McKesson Pharmaceutical, McKesson Automation, McKesson Specialty, McKesson Health Solutions and McKesson Information Solutions.
In March 2016, McKesson agreed to purchase Canadian pharmacy chain Rexall from the Katz Group of Companies for $3 billion.[12] The proposed deal is subject to government approval.
McKesson in the United Kingdom[edit]
In the United Kingdom, McKesson (operating as McKesson Information Solutions UK Ltd) was a provider of information technology services to the health care industry. In addition to numerous clinical software systems and finance and procurement services, McKesson also was responsible for developing the Electronic Staff Record system for the National Health Service which provided an integrated payroll system for NHS's 1.3 million staff, making it the world’s largest single payroll IT system. McKesson Shared Services also provided payroll services for over 20 NHS Trusts, paying over 100,000 NHS members.
McKesson's United Kingdom base was in Warwick with data centers in Newcastle upon Tyne and Brent Cross and offices in Sheffield, Bangor, Glasgow and Vauxhall, London. Across the United Kingdom, it employed over 500 people.
In June/July 2014 McKesson sold most of their healthcare software business to the private equity firm Symphony Technology Group and indicated also that they would not be re-bidding for the Electronic Staff Record contract.[13][14] This came after the company had posted significant year on year losses in revenue (16% in the 2012/13 financial year[15]) after taking over a very successful British operation in 2011.[16]
McKesson in Australia and New Zealand[edit]
In 2010, McKesson Asia-Pacific was acquired by Medibank Private Ltd.[17][18]
McKesson ANZ is a fully owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation. McKesson expanded its footprint in Australia and New Zealand by acquiring Emendo in November, 2012.[19] McKesson ANZ develops and sells healthcare optimization services and software. The company has traditionally been focused on the public markets in Australia and New Zealand. The majority of the District Health Boards in NZ use one or more of McKesson’s Capacity Management solutions.
Christchurch, New Zealand, is one of McKesson’s global Capacity Management R&D centers of excellence. All of McKesson’s R&D for McKesson Capacity Planner is performed in New Zealand. The company employs approximately 40 team members across Australia and New Zealand including general management, R&D, sales, services and support employees.
McKesson Capacity Planner (formerly Emendo CapPlan) is used in more than 40 hospitals in Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Canada and the US[20] to forecast future patient activity and help health systems to allocate resources efficiently and identify unnecessary costs.[19][21]
Facilities[edit]
In addition to its global headquarters in San Francisco, California, McKesson maintains facilities around North America.
Former divisions[edit]
McKesson operated the Mosswood Wine Company from 1978 until 1987, when the division was sold to maintain their focus on pharmaceuticals. The division was founded and run by wine writer Gerald Asher.[22]

In June/July 2014 McKesson sold most of their healthcare software business to the private equity firm Symphony Technology Group and indicated also that they would not be re-bidding for the Electronic Staff Record contract.[13][14] This came after the company had posted significant year on year losses in revenue (16% in the 2012/13 financial year[15]) after taking over a very successful British operation in 2011.[16]
McKesson in Australia and New Zealand[edit]
In 2010, McKesson Asia-Pacific was acquired by Medibank Private Ltd.[17][18]
McKesson ANZ is a fully owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation. McKesson expanded its footprint in Australia and New Zealand by acquiring Emendo in November, 2012.[19] McKesson ANZ develops and sells healthcare optimization services and software. The company has traditionally been focused on the public markets in Australia and New Zealand. The majority of the District Health Boards in NZ use one or more of McKesson’s Capacity Management solutions.
Christchurch, New Zealand, is one of McKesson’s global Capacity Management R&D centers of excellence. All of McKesson’s R&D for McKesson Capacity Planner is performed in New Zealand. The company employs approximately 40 team members across Australia and New Zealand including general management, R&D, sales, services and support employees.
McKesson Capacity Planner (formerly Emendo CapPlan) is used in more than 40 hospitals in Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Canada and the US[20] to forecast future patient activity and help health systems to allocate resources efficiently and identify unnecessary costs.[19][21]
Facilities[edit]
In addition to its global headquarters in San Francisco, California, McKesson maintains facilities around North America.
Former divisions[edit]
McKesson operated the Mosswood Wine Company from 1978 until 1987, when the division was sold to maintain their focus on pharmaceuticals. The division was founded and run by wine writer Gerald Asher.[22]

History[edit]
Founded in New York City as Olcott & McKesson by Charles Olcott and John McKesson in 1833, the business began as an importer and wholesaler of botanical drugs. A third partner, Daniel Robbins joined the enterprise as it grew, and it was renamed McKesson & Robbins following Olcott's death in 1853.
The company successfully emerged from one of the most notorious business/accounting scandals of the 20th century—the McKesson & Robbins scandal, a watershed event that led to major changes in American auditing standards and securities regulations after being exposed in 1938. In the 1960s, McKesson & Robbins merged with Foremost Dairies of San Francisco to form Foremost-McKesson Inc.[4]
Since the mid-20th century, McKesson has derived an increasing proportion of its income from medical technology, rather than pharmaceuticals. This culminated in its purchase of medical information systems firm HBO & Company (HBOC) in 1999; the combined firm was briefly known as McKessonHBOC. Accounting irregularities at HBOC reduced the company's share price by half, and resulted in the dismissal and prosecution of many HBOC executives. The firm's name reverted to "McKesson" in 2001.[5] McKesson Technology Solutions, as the information technology branch of the company is now known, has continued to increase its market share through acquisitions, notably Per Se Technologies, RelayHealth, and Practice Partner.
In 2010, McKesson acquired leading cancer services company US Oncology, Inc. for $2.16 billion, which was integrated into the McKesson Specialty Care Solutions business.
On June 24, 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that McKesson Chairman and CEO John Hammergren's pension benefits of $159 million had set a record for "the largest pension on file for a current executive of a public company, and almost certainly the largest ever in corporate America." A study in 2012 by GMI Ratings, which tracks executive pay, found that 60% of CEOs at S&P 500 companies have pensions, and their value averages $11.5 million.[6]
In addition to its offices throughout North America, McKesson also has international offices in Australia, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Today, McKesson is one of the oldest continually operating businesses in the United States.
As of August 23, 2016, McKesson has decided to merge a majority of its IT business with Change Healthcare.
In 2017, McKesson was involved in a number of lawsuits against the state of Arkansas over the supply of vecuronium bromide. McKesson was under contract by Pfizer not to sell to any correctional facility that authorized and carried out Capital punishment.[7][8]
McKesson Provider Technologies[edit]
McKesson Provider Technologies is the retail name for McKesson Technology Solutions; the software development division of McKesson. Their customer base in the United States includes 50% of all health systems, 20% of all physician practices, 25% of home care agencies, and 77% of health systems with more than 200 beds.
On June 20, 2005, McKesson Provider Technologies acquired Medcon, Ltd., an Israeli company which provides Web-based cardiac image and information management solutions for heart centers, that includes: diagnostic digital image management, archiving, procedure reporting, and workflow management.[9]
In October 2013, McKesson agreed to buy a 50% stake in German peer Celesio for $8.3 billion.[10]
Health Mart pharmacy franchise[edit]

Health Mart is a network of over 4,000[11] independently owned and operated pharmacies. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation, which owns the name "Health Mart." McKesson acquired Health Mart owner FoxMeyer in 1996.
McKesson Canada[edit]
In 1991, McKesson Corporation acquired a 100 percent interest in Medis Health and Pharmaceutical Services from Provigo. In 2002, the McKesson Canada name was adopted. McKesson Canada is a wholly owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation. It includes various business units: McKesson Pharmaceutical, McKesson Automation, McKesson Specialty, McKesson Health Solutions and McKesson Information Solutions.
In March 2016, McKesson agreed to purchase Canadian pharmacy chain Rexall from the Katz Group of Companies for $3 billion.[12] The proposed deal is subject to government approval.
McKesson in the United Kingdom[edit]
In the United Kingdom, McKesson (operating as McKesson Information Solutions UK Ltd) was a provider of information technology services to the health care industry. In addition to numerous clinical software systems and finance and procurement services, McKesson also was responsible for developing the Electronic Staff Record system for the National Health Service which provided an integrated payroll system for NHS's 1.3 million staff, making it the world’s largest single payroll IT system. McKesson Shared Services also provided payroll services for over 20 NHS Trusts, paying over 100,000 NHS members.
McKesson's United Kingdom base was in Warwick with data centers in Newcastle upon Tyne and Brent Cross and offices in Sheffield, Bangor, Glasgow and Vauxhall, London. Across the United Kingdom, it employed over 500 people.
In June/July 2014 McKesson sold most of their healthcare software business to the private equity firm Symphony Technology Group and indicated also that they would not be re-bidding for the Electronic Staff Record contract.[13][14] This came after the company had posted significant year on year losses in revenue (16% in the 2012/13 financial year[15]) after taking over a very successful British operation in 2011.[16]
McKesson in Australia and New Zealand[edit]
In 2010, McKesson Asia-Pacific was acquired by Medibank Private Ltd.[17][18]
McKesson ANZ is a fully owned subsidiary of McKesson Corporation. McKesson expanded its footprint in Australia and New Zealand by acquiring Emendo in November, 2012.[19] McKesson ANZ develops and sells healthcare optimization services and software. The company has traditionally been focused on the public markets in Australia and New Zealand. The majority of the District Health Boards in NZ use one or more of McKesson’s Capacity Management solutions.
Christchurch, New Zealand, is one of McKesson’s global Capacity Management R&D centers of excellence. All of McKesson’s R&D for McKesson Capacity Planner is performed in New Zealand. The company employs approximately 40 team members across Australia and New Zealand including general management, R&D, sales, services and support employees.
McKesson Capacity Planner (formerly Emendo CapPlan) is used in more than 40 hospitals in Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Canada and the US[20] to forecast future patient activity and help health systems to allocate resources efficiently and identify unnecessary costs.[19][21]
Facilities[edit]
In addition to its global headquarters in San Francisco, California, McKesson maintains facilities around North America.
Former divisions[edit]
McKesson operated the Mosswood Wine Company from 1978 until 1987, when the division was sold to maintain their focus on pharmaceuticals. The division was founded and run by wine writer Gerald Asher.[22]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
