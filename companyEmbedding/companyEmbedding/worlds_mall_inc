(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.  You should read the following discussion together with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements.  Business Overview  Worlds Mall, Inc. (the "Company") is a development stage company that was incorporated on March 10, 2011 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company plans to develop an e-commerce website that will connect retail stores with customers around the world. The Company was formed to develop an e-commerce website that will connect retail stores with customers around the world. We believe that companies tend to market their e-commerce websites within the country or region that they are from and only to customers that speak the language of their country. Our goal is to globalize the retail market by eliminating language barriers along and providing better exposure to such companies. Worlds Mall wants to be a portal for retail sellers to connect to the world. . In addition to Company's current business plan, the Company plans to acquire an E-commerce marketplace based in China that would connect retail consumers and small to midsize businesses. There is no assurance at this point, however, that such plan will be executed or the acquisition will be completed.  We are a development stage company, and to date, we have limited operating history for investors to evaluate the potential of our business development. As such, we have not built our customer base or our brand name. We believe we will need to raise additional capital to sustain our operations. If we are unable to raise additional cash, we will either have to suspend or cease our expansion plans entirely.  Recent Change of Control  On December 15, 2015, Thomas Wikstrom, our former President and CEO and Min Huang, our current President and CEO, entered into a stock purchase agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), whereby Mr. Huang purchased from the Mr. Wikstrom 18,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company, representing approximately 82.19% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of $330,000 (the "Change of Control").  As a result of the Change of Control, Mr. Huang has obtained majority interest of the Company. In connection with the Change of Control, Mr. Huang was appointed an officer and director of the Company. In addition to Company's current business plan, the Company plans to acquire an E-commerce marketplace based in China that would connect retail consumers and small to midsize businesses. There is no assurance at this point, however, that such plan will be executed or the acquisition will be completed.  Plan of Operations  We anticipate completing our website in four to five months once we obtain sufficient capital. We have not yet determined when we will begin to generate revenues.  Over the next twelve month period, we must raise additional capital for site development, server management, one new programmer and marketing. Our estimated expenses consist of the following:  � Expected lease of 1,500 sq. ft. of office space: $18,000 ($1,500 monthly)  � Phone bill including long distance calling: $4,800 ($400 per month)  � Website creation: $125,000  � Web hosting: $1,200  � Bookkeeping/Accounting: $15,000  � Marketing: $80,000  � Computers/printers/furniture etc: $10,000  � Travel expenses: $60,000  � Employee payroll: $65,000  � Attorney fees: $20,000  � Electronic filing fees: $3,000  � Miscellaneous fees: $5,000  � Licensing of 3D gaming software: $65,000 (annually)  � Language translation software: $45,000 (annually for the translation of 9 languages)  Based on our financial history since inception, there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company had a deficit accumulated since inception and a net loss and net cash used in operating activities since inception.  Results of Operations - Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014  No revenue has been generated by the Company since inception. The Company's financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to recoverability and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  The Company has a minimum cash balance available for payment of ongoing operating expenses, has experienced losses from operations, and it does not have a source of revenue. Its continued existence is dependent upon its ability to continue to execute its operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance the necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will be available on terms acceptable to the Company.  Our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $84,903 compared to operating expenses of $27,251 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The significant increase is primarily attributed to the increase of professional fees and general and administrative expenses in 2015.  The Company's net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $84,903 compared to $27,251 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The significant increase is primarily attributed to the increase of the operating expenses.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, the net cash used for operating activities was $84,365; the net cash provided by financing activities was $51,107, resulting in a decrease in cash of $33,258 as of December 31, 2015.  The following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015:   For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 Net Cash (Used in) Operating Activities $ (84,365 ) Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities - Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 51,107 Net Decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ (33,258 )  The Company has no assets and has generated no revenues since inception. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able to implement its plan of operations. The Company also does not have sufficient cash to continue for the next twelve months.  Going Concern  Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  As reflected in the financial statements, we had an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2015, a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our cash position is not sufficient to support its daily operations. While we believe in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in our ability to raise additional funds.  Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices  While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements for the reporting period ended December 31, 2015, we believe that the following accounting policy are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  We do not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Contractual Obligations  We do not have any contractual obligations at this time.

	Note 1 - Organization and Operations



	 




	Worlds Mall Inc.




	 


	Worlds Mall Inc. (the “Company”)
	was incorporated on March 10, 2011 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company plans to develop an e-commerce website that
	will connect retail stores with customers around the world.


	 



	Note 2 - Significant and Critical Accounting
	Policies and Practices



	 


	The Management of the Company is responsible
	for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application.
	Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial
	condition and results and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the
	need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company’s significant and critical
	accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles.


	 




	Basis of Presentation – Unaudited
	Interim Financial Information




	 


	The accompanying
	unaudited interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for the interim financial information, and with the rules and
	regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation
	S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
	The unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are,
	in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim period presented. Unaudited interim
	results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction
	with the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto contained in the Company’s
	Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on June 30, 2016.


	 




	Use of Estimates and Assumptions
	and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions




	 


	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s).


	 


	Critical accounting estimates are estimates
	for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly
	uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or
	operating performance is material. The Company’s critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements
	were:


	 




	 



	(i)





	Assumption as
	a going concern

	: Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of
	operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business;





	 




	 



	(ii)





	Valuation allowance
	for deferred tax assets

	: Management assumes that the realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets resulting
	from its net operating loss (“NOL”) carry–forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against
	future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss
	carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred
	recurring losses, (b) general economic conditions, (d) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations
	by way of a public or private offering, among other factors.





	 


	These significant accounting estimates
	or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions,
	and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.


	 






	 


	F-

	5



	 







	 




	 


	Management bases its estimates on historical
	experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole
	under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
	that are not readily apparent from other sources.


	 


	Management regularly evaluates the key
	factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances,
	historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted
	accordingly.


	 


	Actual results could differ from those
	estimates.


	 




	Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 


	The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial
	instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
	(GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements
	and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
	used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted)
	in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of
	fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:


	 







	Level
	1



	 



	Quoted
	market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.





	 


	 


	 





	Level
	2



	 



	Pricing
	inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable
	as of the reporting date.





	 


	 


	 





	Level
	3



	 



	Pricing
	inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.






	 


	Financial assets are considered Level
	3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at
	least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.


	 


	The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
	priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable
	inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the
	categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.


	 


	The carrying amounts of the Company’s
	financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity
	of this instrument.


	 


	Transactions involving related parties
	cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings
	may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions
	were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.


	 




	Cash Equivalents




	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid
	investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.


	 




	Related Parties




	 


	The Company follows subtopic 850-10 of
	the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.


	 


	Pursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related
	parties include a. affiliates of the Company (“Affiliate” means, with respect to any specified Person, any other
	Person that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control
	with such Person, as such terms are used in and construed under Rule 405 under the Securities Act); b. entities for which
	investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option
	Subsection of Section 825–10–15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c. trusts
	for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management;
	d. principal owners of the Company; e. management of the Company; f. other parties with which the Company may deal if
	one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the
	transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g. other parties that can significantly
	influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting
	parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented
	from fully pursuing its own separate interests.


	 






	 


	F-

	The financial statements shall include
	disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar
	items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated
	or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the
	relationship(s) involved; b. a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts
	were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary
	to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions
	for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing
	the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance
	sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.


	 




	Commitment and Contingencies




	 


	The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of
	the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date
	the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more
	future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves
	an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or
	unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or
	unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.


	 


	If the assessment of a contingency indicates
	that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated
	liability would be accrued in the Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material
	loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent
	liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.


	 


	Loss contingencies considered remote are
	generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.


	 




	Revenue Recognition




	 


	The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable
	and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive
	evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii)
	the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.


	 




	Deferred Tax Assets and Income Tax
	Provision




	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes
	under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined
	based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted
	tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
	allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets
	and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
	differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
	is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.


	 


	The Company adopted section 740-10-25
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Section 740-10-25”). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination
	of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under
	Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not
	that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
	The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that
	has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides
	guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires
	increased disclosures.


	 


	The estimated future tax effects of temporary
	differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit
	carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance
	sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.

	Management makes judgments as to the interpretation
	of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition,
	the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In management’s
	opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies
	from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.


	 




	Tax years that remain
	subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions




	 


	The Company discloses

	tax
	years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions

	pursuant to the ASC Paragraph 740-10-50-15.


	 




	Earnings per Share




	 


	Earnings per share ("EPS") is
	the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term is used to refer to either earnings
	or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC
	Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the
	numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to
	common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not
	paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing
	operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar
	to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that
	would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential
	dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants.


	 


	Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21
	through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint
	of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and their equivalents) issued by the reporting
	entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35
	through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied. Equivalents of options and warrants include
	non-vested stock granted to employees, stock purchase contracts, and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260–10–55–23).
	Anti-dilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and purchased call options, shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the
	treasury stock method: a. Exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of
	issuance, if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued. b. The proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be
	used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through
	55-5.) c. The incremental shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed
	purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.


	 


	There were no potentially dilutive common
	shares outstanding for the reporting period ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 




	Cash Flows Reporting




	 


	The Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether
	they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect
	or reconciliation method (“Indirect method”) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards
	Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating
	activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected
	future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash
	receipts and payments.


	 




	Subsequent Events




	 


	The Company follows the guidance in Section
	855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent
	events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards
	Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users,
	such as through filing them on EDGAR.


	 




	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements


	 


	 


	We do not believe that any recently issued,
	but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.


	 






	 


	F-

	In connection with preparing financial statements
	for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity’s management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
	considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within
	one year after the date that the

	financial statements are issued

	(or within one year after the date that the

	financial
	statements are available to be issued

	when applicable). Management’s evaluation should be based on relevant conditions
	and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the

	financial statements are issued

	(or at the date
	that the

	financial statements are available to be issued

	when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity’s ability
	to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable
	that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements
	are issued (or available to be issued). The term

	probable

	is used consistently with its use in Topic 450, Contingencies.


	 


	When management identifies conditions or events
	that raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, management should consider whether
	its plans that are intended to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt. The mitigating
	effect of management’s plans should be considered only to the extent that (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively
	implemented and, if so, (2) it is probable that the plans will mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt
	about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	If conditions or events raise substantial
	doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration
	of management’s plans, the entity should disclose information that enables users of the financial statements to understand
	all of the following (or refer to similar information disclosed elsewhere in the footnotes):


	 







	a.




	Principal
	conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to
	continue as a going concern (before consideration of management’s plans)





	 







	b.




	Management’s
	evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity’s
	ability to meet its obligations





	 







	c.




	Management’s
	plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue
	as a going concern.





	 


	If conditions or events raise substantial
	doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, and substantial doubt is not alleviated after consideration
	of management’s plans, an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating that there is

	substantial doubt
	about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern

	within one year after the date that the financial statements
	are issued (or available to be issued). Additionally, the entity should disclose information that enables users of the financial
	statements to understand all of the following:


	 







	a.




	Principal
	conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to
	continue as a going concern





	 







	b.




	Management’s
	evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity’s
	ability to meet its obligations





	 







	c.




	Management’s
	plans that are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raise substantial doubt
	about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.





	 


	The amendments in this Update are effective
	for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application
	is permitted.


	 


	Management does not believe that any recently
	issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, when adopted, will have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated
	financial statements.



	 




	Note 3 – Going Concern



	 


	The Company has elected to adopt early application
	of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,

	“Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40):
	Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (“ASU 2014-15”)

	.


	 


	The Company’s financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets,
	and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.


	 


	As reflected in the financial statements,
	the Company had an accumulated deficit at June 30, 2016, a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting
	period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The Company is attempting to commence operations
	and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations.
	While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its
	ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
	concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability
	to raise additional funds.

	The financial statements do not include any
	adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities
	that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	Note 4 – Stockholders’ Equity



	 




	Shares Authorized




	 


	Upon formation the total number of shares
	of all classes of stock which the Company is authorized to issue is One Billion (1,000,000,000) shares of which Five Hundred Million
	(500,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and Five Hundred Million (500,000,000) shares shall
	be Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share.


	 




	Common Stock




	 


	For the period from January 11, 2013 through
	November 11, 2013, the Company sold 3,900,000 shares of common stock at $0.01 per share to 39 individuals, or $39,000, $38,000
	was received in cash and $1,000 was received as a stock subscription receivable which was collected on January 17, 2014. The Company
	presented the stock subscription receivable of $1,000 as a current assets as the receivable was paid in cash prior to the publication
	of the financial statements and the payment date is stated herewith in the note to the financial statements.


	 




	Capital Contribution




	 


	During the year ended December 31, 2013, a
	significant stockholder of the Company contributed $13,000 to the Company which was recorded as additional paid-in capital.


	 


	During the year ended December 31, 2014, a

	Item 2. Management’s Discussion
	and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.



	 



	The information
	set forth in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of  Operations (“MD&A”)
	contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
	amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
	including, among others (i) expected changes in our revenue and profitability, (ii) prospective business opportunities and (iii)
	our strategy for financing our business. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements
	of current condition. Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of terms such as “believes”, “anticipates”,
	“intends” or “expects”. These forward-looking statements relate to our plans, liquidity, ability to complete
	financing and purchase capital expenditures, growth of our business including entering into future agreements with companies,
	and plans to successfully develop and obtain approval to market our product. We have based these forward-looking statements largely
	on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial
	condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs.




	 




	Although we believe
	that our expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of
	our knowledge of our business and operations, in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections, the
	inclusion of forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report should not be regarded as a representation by us or
	any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved.



	 



	We assume no obligation
	to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting forward-looking
	statements.



	 





	Our revenues and results of operations
	could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, including, but
	not limited to, the following: the risk of significant natural disaster, the inability of our company to insure against certain
	risks, inflationary and deflationary conditions and cycles, currency exchange rates, and changing government regulations domestically
	and internationally affecting our products and businesses.




	 




	You should read
	the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes attached hereto, and the other financial
	data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

	Overview



	 


	Worlds Mall, Inc. (the “Company”)
	is a development stage company that was incorporated on March 10, 2011 under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company plans
	to develop an e-commerce website that will connect retail stores with customers around the world. The Company was formed to develop
	an e-commerce website that will connect retail stores with customers around the world. We believe that companies tend to market
	their e-commerce websites within the country or region that they are from and only to customers that speak the language of their
	country. Our goal is to globalize the retail market by eliminating language barriers along and providing better exposure to such
	companies. Worlds Mall wants to be a portal for retail sellers to connect to the world. . In addition to Company’s current
	business plan, the Company plans to acquire an E-commerce marketplace based in China that would connect retail consumers and small
	to midsize businesses. There is no assurance at this point, however, that such plan will be executed or the acquisition will be
	completed.


	 


	We are a development stage company, and to
	date, we have limited operating history for investors to evaluate the potential of our business development. As such, we have
	not built our customer base or our brand name. We believe we will need to raise additional capital to sustain our operations.
	If we are unable to raise additional cash, we will either have to suspend or cease our expansion plans entirely. Because of our
	limited operating history and our status as a development stage company, investors should take caution in investing in our company
	at this point.


	 



	Recent Change of Control



	 


	On December 15, 2015, Min Huang, our current
	President and CEO and Thomas Wikstrom, our former President and CEO, entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Stock
	Purchase Agreement”), whereby Mr. Huang purchased from the Mr. Wikstrom 18,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001
	per share, of the Company, representing approximately 82.19% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company, for an aggregate
	purchase price of $330,000 (the “Change of Control”).


	 


	As a result of the Change of Control, Mr. Huang has obtained majority
	interest of the Company. In connection with the Change of Control, Mr. Huang was appointed an officer and director of the Company.
	In addition to Company’s current business plan, the Company plans to acquire an E-commerce marketplace based in China that
	would connect retail consumers and small to midsize businesses. The potential acquisition target is also deemed under control
	by Mr. Huang. There is no assurance at this point, however, that such plan will be executed or the acquisition will be completed.

	Plan of Operations



	 


	We anticipate completing our website in four to five months once
	we obtain sufficient capital. We have not yet determined when we will begin to generate revenues.


	 


	Over the next twelve month period, we must
	raise additional capital for site development, server management, one new programmer and marketing. Our estimated expenses consist
	of the following:


	 




	 



	·




	Expected lease of 1,500 sq. ft. of office space:
	$18,000 ($1,500 monthly)





	 



	·




	Phone bill including long distance calling:
	$4,800 ($400 per month)





	 



	·




	Website creation: $125,000





	 



	·




	Web hosting: $1,200





	 



	·




	Bookkeeping/Accounting: $15,000





	 


	 


	 




	 



	·




	Marketing: $80,000





	 



	·




	Computers/printers/furniture etc: $10,000





	 



	·




	Travel expenses: $60,000





	 



	·




	Employee payroll: $65,000





	 



	·




	Attorney fees: $20,000





	 


	 


	 




	 



	·




	Electronic filing fees: $3,000





	 



	·




	Miscellaneous fees: $5,000





	 



	·




	Licensing of 3D gaming software: $65,000 (annually)





	 



	·




	Language translation software: $45,000 (annually
	for the translation of 9 languages)





	 


	Based on our financial history since inception,
	there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company had a deficit accumulated since inception
	and a net loss and net cash used in operating activities since inception.


	  



	Results of Operations



	 






	Comparison for the Three Months ended June 30, 2016 and
	2015




	 


	No revenue has been generated by the Company
	for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company's financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis,
	which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements
	do not include any adjustment relating to recoverability and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that
	might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The Company has a minimum cash balance
	available for payment of ongoing operating expenses, has experienced losses from operations, and it does not have a source of revenue.
	Its continued existence is dependent upon its ability to continue to execute its operating plan and to obtain additional debt or
	equity financing. There can be no assurance the necessary debt or equity financing will be available, or will be available on terms
	acceptable to the Company.


	 


	We incurred $110,847 in expenses from professional
	fees for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $13,492 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The significant increase
	is mainly due to the increase of legal and accounting fees in preparation of the acquisition described elsewhere in this quarterly
	report. We also incurred $4,285 in general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $1,806
	for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The significant increase is primarily attributed to the increase of salary for our employees.
	We also incurred rent expense of $496, repair and maintenance expense of $3,462 and travel expense of $14,057 for the three months
	ended June 30, 2016.


	 


	Due to the factors described above, our
	operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $133,147 compared to operating expenses of $15,298 for the three
	months ended June 30, 2015.


	 


	As a result, the Company’s net loss
	for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $133,147 compared to $15,298 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.



	 





	Comparison for the Six Months ended June 30, 2016 and
	2015




	 


	No revenue has been generated by the Company
	for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.


	 


	We incurred $201,878 in expenses from professional
	fees for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $20,009 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The significant increase
	is mainly due to the increase of legal and accounting fees in preparation of the acquisition described elsewhere in this quarterly
	report. We also incurred $18,718 in general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $1,824
	for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The significant increase is primarily attributed to the increase of salary for our employees.
	We also incurred rent expense of $496, repair and maintenance expense of $3,462 and travel expense of $14,057 for the six months
	ended June 30, 2016.


	 


	Due to the factors described above, our operating
	expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $238,611 compared to operating expenses of $21,833 for the six months ended
	June 30, 2015.


	 






	 



	5



	 







	 




	 




	Because of the factors described above,
	the Company’s net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $238,611 compared to $21,833 for the six months ended June
	30, 2015.


	 






	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 


	The following is a summary of the Company's
	cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016:


	 




	 


	 


	For the fiscal year

	ended 

	June 30, 2016


	 




	Net Cash (Used in) Operating Activities


	 


	$


	(233,115


	)




	Net Cash (Used in) Investing Activities


	 


	$


	(39,000


	)




	Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities


	 


	$


	351,843


	 





	 


	For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the
	net cash used in operating activities was $233,115. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the net cash used in investing activities
	was $39,000. The net cash provided by financing activities was $351,843 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Company had
	a total cash balance of $79,728 as of June 30, 2016.


	 


	The Company has nominal assets and has generated
	no revenues since inception. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its
	ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company. If continued funding
	and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able to implement its plan of operations.



	 




	Going Concern



	 


	Our financial statements have been prepared
	on a going concern basis. As of June 30, 2016, we have not generated any revenues since inception.  We expect to finance
	our operations primarily through our existing cash, our operations and any future financing.  However, there exists substantial
	doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because we will be required to obtain additional capital in the future
	to continue our operations and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital, through equity or debt financing,
	or any combination thereof, or on satisfactory terms or at all. Additionally, no assurance can be given that any such financing,
	if obtained, will be adequate to meet our capital needs. If adequate capital cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory
	terms, our operations would be materially negatively impacted. Therefore, our auditor has substantial doubt as to our ability
	to continue as a going concern. Our ability to complete additional offerings is dependent on the state of the debt and/or equity
	markets at the time of any proposed offering, and such market’s reception of the Company and the offering terms. There is
	no assurance that capital in any form would be available to us, and if available, on terms and conditions that are acceptable.


	   



	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	  




	Basis of Presentation






	 




	The accompanying
	unaudited interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for the interim financial information, and with the rules and
	regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation
	S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
	The unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are,
	in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim period presented. Unaudited interim
	results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction
	with our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto contained in the our Annual
	Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016.

	Cash Equivalents




	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments
	with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.


	 




	Revenue Recognition




	 


	The Company recognizes revenue when it is
	realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria
	are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered
	to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.


	 




	Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 


	The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37
	of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial
	instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
	(GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements
	and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
	used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted)
	in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of
	fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:


	 







	Level
	1



	 



	Quoted market prices
	available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.





	 


	 


	 





	Level 2



	 



	Pricing inputs other
	than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting
	date.





	 


	 


	 





	Level 3



	 



	Pricing inputs that
	are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.






	 


	Financial assets are considered Level 3 when
	their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one
	significant model assumption or input is unobservable.


	 


	The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
	priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable
	inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the
	categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.


	 






	 



	7



	 







	 




	 


	The carrying amounts of the Company’s
	financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity
	of this instrument.


	 


	Transactions involving related parties cannot
	be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not
	exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were
	consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.


	     




	Use of Estimates and Assumptions and
	Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions




	 


	The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period(s).


	 


	Critical accounting estimates are estimates
	for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly
	uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or
	operating performance is material. The Company’s critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements
	were:


	 







	(i)





	Assumption
	as a going concern

	: Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going
	concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation
	of liabilities in the normal course of business;





	 







	(ii)





	Valuation
	allowance for deferred tax assets

	: Management assumes that the realization of the
	Company’s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (“NOL”)
	carry–forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future
	taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential
	tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance.
	Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses,
	(b) general economic conditions, (d) its ability to raise additional funds to support
	its daily operations by way of a public or private offering, among other factors.





	 


	These significant accounting estimates or
	assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions, and
	certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.


	 


	Management bases its estimates on historical
	experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole
	under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
	that are not readily apparent from other sources.


	 


	Management regularly evaluates the key factors
	and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical
	experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly.


	 


	Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	Accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB
	that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption.

	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements
	that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
	sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to an investment
	in our securities.



	 







	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
	About Market Risk.



	 


	Not applicable because we are a smaller reporting company.



	 







	Item 4. Controls and Procedures.



	 



	Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 




	Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company’s
	management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”)
	(the Company’s principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
	and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based
	upon that evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are
	not effective as of June 30, 2016 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company
	files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
	the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including
	the Company’s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure for the reason described
	below.


	 


	Because of our limited operations, we have
	limited number of employees which prohibits a segregation of duties. In addition, we lack a formal audit committee with a financial
	expert. As we grow and expand our operations we will engage additional employees and experts as needed. However, there can be
	no assurance that our operations will expand.


	   



	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	 


	There were no changes in our internal control
	over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
	likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	dismissed its independent registered public accounting firm, D. Brooks and Associates CPA's, P.A. (“Brooks”). The
	report of Brooks on the financial statements of the Company the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and the related statements
	of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ deficiency, and cash flows for the fiscal years ended December
	31, 2015 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit
	scope or accounting principles other than an explanatory paragraph as to a going concern. The decision to change the independent
	registered public accounting firm was recommended and approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. During the Company’s
	most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and through May 9, 2016, the date of dismissal, (a) there were no disagreements
	with Brooks on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure,
	which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Brooks, would have caused it to make reference thereto in its reports
	on the financial statements for such years and (b) there were no “reportable events” as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v)
	of Regulation S-K.


	 


	Concurrently on May 9, 2016, the Board of
	Directors of the Company appointed Yu Certified Public Accountant, P.C. (“Yu”) as its new independent registered public
	accounting firm to audit and review the Company’s financial statements. During the two most recent fiscal years ended December
	31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and any subsequent interim periods through the date hereof prior to the engagement of Yu, neither
	the Company, nor someone on its behalf, has consulted Yu regarding either: the application of accounting principles to a specified
	transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s consolidated
	financial statements, and either a written report was provided to the Company or oral advice was provided that the new independent
	registered public accounting firm concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the
	accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement as defined in paragraph
	304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K or a reportable event as described in paragraph 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling 
security holders. All of the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
will go to the selling security holders. We have agreed to bear the expenses 
relating to the registration of the common stock for the selling security 
holders.


We currently seem to have very little competition in the segment of the market 
that we are aiming for. When doing 'Google' searches for things like: e-commerce
language translation websites, retail language translation websites, shopping on
e-commerce websites, shopping on e-commerce websites in Italy etc. we could only
find a hand full of retail stores that provide an e-commerce website of their 
own offering language translation. The companies that we did find appear to be 
larger stores that would have a large marketing budget. Worlds Mall Inc. will 
focus on attracting smaller retailers that would not normally market their 
website to the rest of the world in different languages.


Company Description
Worlds Mall, Inc. was incorporated on March 10, 2011 under the laws of the 
State of Nevada. The Company plans to develop an e-commerce website that will 
connect retail stores with customers around the world. The Company was formed 
to develop an e-commerce website that will connect retail stores


 with customers 
around the world. We believe that companies tend to market their e-commerce 
websites within the country or region that they are from and only to customers 
that speak the language of their country. Our goal is to globalize the retail
market by eliminating language barriers along and providing better exposure to 
such companies. Worlds Mall wants to be a portal for retail sellers to connect 
to the world.
