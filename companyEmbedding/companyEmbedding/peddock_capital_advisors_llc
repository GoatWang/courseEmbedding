Peddock Capital Advisors - Investment Management














 Client LoginSecure file uploadDigital Brochure 












Investment Management
Leverages a transparent, research-driven investment approach to provide sound investment decision-making through varied market cycles to protect and grow client assets.
The investment management process starts with you, your goals, objectives, tolerance for risk and your vision for the future.
Personalized Investment Policy Statement
We work closely with you to develop a personalized Investment Policy Statement that sets a strategic asset allocation and provides you with a clear, written explanation of how your portfolio will be constructed, managed and evaluated.
Sophisticated Investment Analysis
Peddock is aligned with Applied Finance Group, Ltd (AFG), of Chicago to access institutional investment research for sophisticated portfolio construction and management. Our top-down capital market expectations are blended with AFG's bottom-up analysis to identify some of the most compelling companies and/or investment vehicles that are positioned to take advantage of broad economic opportunities with the goal of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 Index.
Personalized Investment Management
Using the findings from our analysis, the security selection process systemically identifies undervalued S&P 500 companies with strong management and earnings quality across each sector to construct a well-diversified and value-focused portfolio. Portfolios are grounded in large- to mid-cap domestic stocks, high-quality fixed income investments including corporate, municipal, and government bonds, and exposure to foreign markets through Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs.
Continuous Monitoring
Price targets are regularly calculated for each stock. Securities which have met or exceeded our performance expectations or performed contrary to our expectations are re-evaluated for sale based on remaining upside potential and the tax impact.

What are analysts saying about Ecolab stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Ecolab stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Over the last six months Ecolab outperformed the broader industry trends in terms of price movements. Furthermore, an upbeat outlook for 2018 instills our confidence. We believe a robust product portfolio and an expanding customer base will drive Ecolab organic sales over the long haul. In fact, the realization of targeted synergies associated with acquisitions should also pave way for margin expansion. Ecolab expects its water, food and beverage, and paper businesses to benefit in the near term. On the flipside, Ecolab operates in highly competitive markets, which might dent its prospects over the long haul. We believe volatility in foreign currency exchange rates will remain a significant headwind for the company. Ecolab faces pricing pressure in the Energy segment which is likely to hurt profits. The company exited the first quarter of 2017 on a disappointing note, missing the Zacks consensus earnings estimate." (7/27/2017)
2. Canaccord Genuity analysts commented, "We find Ecolab very well positioned to benefit from the convergence of population growth, resource volatility and rapid industrialization across the world. The company’s recurring services model drives high visibility (even in a variable macro environment)." (3/15/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Ecolab (NYSE:ECL) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 7 Hold Ratings, 8 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.44)Consensus Price Target: $129.31 (1.91% downside)
