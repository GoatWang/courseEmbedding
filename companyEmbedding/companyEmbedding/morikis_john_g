CLEVELAND, Oct. 19, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:   SHW) announced today that its Board of Directors has elected John G. Morikis to serve as the Company's next Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2016.  Mr. Morikis, 52, who has served as Sherwin-Williams' President and Chief Operating Officer since October 2006, will assume the CEO duties currently held by Chairman and CEO Christopher M. Connor.  Mr. Connor, who has held the title of Chairman and CEO for the past 16 years, will remain at the Company in the role of Executive Chairman.  Mr. Morikis was also elected to the Company's Board of Directors effective immediately.  
"This announcement today marks the successful culmination of a multi-year organizational succession plan to identify the absolute best candidate to assume leadership of the Company," said Mr. Connor.  "John has been an important member of our senior leadership team for many years and is one of the key architects of the Company's current organizational structure and strategy.  His success over the years is a direct result of focusing on customer needs, his in-depth knowledge of the coatings market and his dedication to hiring and developing terrific people.  With this transition, John becomes only the ninth CEO in Sherwin-Williams' 150 year history. He is the right leader, and he is surrounded by the right team, to take Sherwin-Williams to the next level."
Mr. Morikis joined Sherwin-Williams in 1984 as a management trainee in the Company's Paint Stores Group.  He has held many key leadership positions during his thirty-one year career with Sherwin-Williams. During his nine-year tenure as President and COO, which included the housing recession of 2008-2009, the Company grew from $7.8 billion in revenues and earnings per share of $4.19 to more than $11 billion in revenues and earnings per share of $8.78 last year.  As President of the Paint Stores segment, he led the Group through one of the most aggressive growth phases in Company history.  Under his leadership, Paint Stores Group grew from approximately $3 billion in sales through 2,400 company operated paint stores to nearly $5 billion in sales through more than 3,100 stores, bolstering Sherwin-Williams' position as the leading architectural coatings company in North America.
"Following a very diligent and thorough selection process, the Board of Directors is extremely pleased to appoint John Morikis as our next Chief Executive Officer," said John Stropki, Sherwin-Williams' Lead Director.

		        		SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF VALSPAR - CREATES THE GLOBAL LEADER IN PAINT AND COATINGS
		        		






SHERWIN-WILLIAMS COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF VALSPAR - CREATES THE GLOBAL LEADER IN PAINT AND COATINGS


CLEVELAND, OH – June 1, 2017 – The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE: SHW) today announced it has completed its acquisition of The Valspar Corporation (NYSE: VAL). Under the terms of the merger agreement, Valspar shareholders will receive $113 per share in cash. In connection with completion of the transaction, Valspar common stock ceased trading prior to market opening today and will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.
John G. Morikis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sherwin-Williams, said, "We are pleased to complete this transaction, and I would like to officially welcome our new colleagues from Valspar and the tremendous talent they bring to Sherwin-Williams. The acquisition of Valspar accelerates Sherwin-Williams’ global growth strategy and creates the global leader in paints and coatings. The combination of these two companies creates a world class brand portfolio, expanded product range, premier technology and innovation platforms and an extensive global footprint. These enhanced capabilities will benefit our customers and create sustainable long-term value for our shareholders."
With corporate headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio, the combined company generated pro forma 2016 revenues of $15.8 billion and employs approximately 60,000 associates worldwide. It has a prominent market position in architectural paint in North America, South America, China, Australia and the UK. In industrial coatings, the combined company is a global market leader in packaging coatings, coil coatings, general industrial coatings and industrial wood coatings.
On May 2, 2017, Sherwin-Williams filed a Current Report on Form 8-K containing unaudited 2016 pro forma financial statements reflecting the acquisition of Valspar.
As previously communicated, Sherwin-Williams expects to achieve $320 million of annual run-rate synergies in the areas of sourcing, SG&A and process and efficiency savings, within three years. The company also expects this transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings (excluding one-time costs) and to meaningfully increase the Company’s operating cash flow.
Sherwin-Williams will announce financial results for the second quarter ended　June 30, 2017 on　Thursday, July 20, 2017. At that time, Sherwin-Williams will provide its outlook on the combined company for the third quarter and full year 2017, and conduct a conference call to answer questions. Further details regarding the call will be available in coming weeks.
On May 2, 2017, Sherwin-Williams conducted a senior notes offering to provide financing for the Valspar acquisition. The company placed $6 billion in bonds with maturities of 3, 5, 7, 10 and 30 years at a blended average interest rate of approximately 3.2 percent.
As previously communicated in Valspar’s quarterly dividend announcement issued May 19, 2017, because the merger was completed prior to the close of business on June 1, 2017, the Valspar quarterly dividend payable on June 8, 2017 will not be paid.
Sherwin-Williams' previously announced exchange offers for any and all outstanding Valspar notes have expired as of 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on June 1, 2017. There were no additional tenders of outstanding Valspar notes since 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 31, 2017.

John has had a long and distinguished career with our Company, rising up through the ranks to achieve this position.  John's success over the years has been due to his focus on meeting customer needs, understanding the coatings market and his dedication to hiring and developing terrific management teams.  I fully expect that John will bring the same energy and passion to this new role, and he will help Sherwin-Williams continue to meet the expectations of our customers, shareholders and employees."
