Workplace & employer accolades[edit]
The company has consistently been recognized for its workplace and employee benefits, and was named the No. 2 Large Company in the 2014 Best Places to Work ranking by the Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal. C.H. Robinson has been named a Top 10000 Large Company in Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal’s Best Places to Work rankings every year since 2006. In 2013, the company earned a spot on Top Workplaces’ Top 150–National Top Workplaces 2013.[22] The Star Tribune has recognized C.H.

History[edit]
Origins and early history[edit]
In the early 1900s, Charles Henry Robinson owned a small wholesale brokerage house that provided produce throughout North Dakota and Minnesota.[26] He partnered with the Nash Finch brothers on April 11, 1905, and became the company’s first president.[13] Nash Finch Company was the leading wholesaler in the region, owning and operating grocery stores.[4][27] Following Charles Henry Robinson’s death in 1909, the Nash Brothers assumed control of the C.H. Robinson Company.[28]
C.H. Robinson became the procurement arm for Nash Finch Company as it rapidly expanded in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Texas. In the 1940s, the FTC found Nash Finch Company to have a price advantage, and under the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, C.H. Robinson Co. was split into two companies. The first, C.H. Robinson Co., was formed by the offices that sold produce to Nash Finch’s warehouses, and ownership was retained by C.H. Robinson employees. The second company, C.H. Robinson, Inc., was still owned by Nash Finch.[4][13]
Expansion into logistics and trucking[edit]
C.H. Robinson’s entry into the trucking business came after the Federal Highway Act of 1956 expanded interstate commerce and the roadways of America.[16] C.H. Robinson and other shippers had previously relied on trains to transport goods. In 1968, the firm entered the regulated truck business as a contract carrier named Meat Packers Express based out of Omaha, Nebraska.[4] Robco Transportation Inc. was formed by merging Meat Packers Express with additional carriers three years later and was sold in 1986.[13][26]
In the mid-1960s, C.H. Robinson Co. and C.H. Robinson, Inc., consolidated their operations under the name C.H. Robinson Co. Nash Finch still held a 25% stake in the brokerage company, with C.H. Robinson employees owning the remainder. By 1976, the Nash Finch shares had been bought out and the company was 100% employee owned. C.H. Robinson focused on using emerging technology to its advantage and adopted IBM mainframe technology in 1979.[13]
The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 deregulated transportation industries in America and increased competition for logistics providers and shippers.[16][26] In addition to distributing food products, C.H. Robinson created a contract carrier program, expanded its freight contract operations, and established itself as a middleman sourcing operation for virtually all shippable goods. The company’s average annual growth, measured by truckloads, doubled and C.H. Robinson posted more than $700 million in sale within five years. Forty percent was generated by truck brokerage, with the rest of the revenue coming from produce sales.[4][13]
Renaming and IPO[edit]
The company renamed itself C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., in 1997 and had an IPO that raised $190 million for the 101 employees who sold their shares.[4] The initial market value totaled $743 million, and the firm began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol CHRW.[19][29] Gross revenues for 1997 reached $1.79 billion, while net revenues amounted to $206 million, a 15.1% increase over the previous year.[4][13]
Acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 1989, C.H. Robinson began expanding its international logistics operations with the opening of its Monterrey, Mexico office. It acquired C.S. Greene International in 1992 to add international freight forwarding, air freight operations, and refrigerated containers. In 1993, C.H. Robinson bought a 30% stake in Transeco, a major French motor carrier, and eventually bought the entire company. C.H. Robinson enhanced its operations by purchasing companies including Daystar International, a distributor of fruit juice, and FoodSource. It also became an exclusive marketer for Tropicana, Motts, Glory and Welch’s.
The company continued expanding its logistics services by purchasing regional logistics firms like the Chicago-based American Backhaulers, Inc., for $136 million in 1999 and the Minnesota-based Trans-Consolidated Inc.[4][13]
At the end of the 1990s, the company began making targeted acquisitions to broaden its global presence and position it to better deliver shipping and logistics services in international markets. These acquisitions include: Preferred Translocation Systems; the Argentina-based Comexter Group; the Western European transportation provider Norminter; New York-based Vertex Transportation Inc.; Smith Terminal International Services, one of the largest third-party logistics providers in Florida; the Germany-based international freight logistics provider Frank M. Viet GmbH Internationale Spedition; Dalian Decheng Shipping Agency Co.; FoodSource Procurement LLC; Apreo Logistics S.A.; and other major European, Indian, Chinese, and North American logistics providers.[4][7][8][13][20][30][31][32][33]
In 2012, C.H Robinson purchased Phoenix International for $635 million and doubled its ocean freight capacity.[7][19][34] The company also acquired the Polish shipping firm Apreo Logisitics S.A., which provides trucking, air, and ocean shipping services throughout Europe.[33]
The company launched a technology-enabled platform called Navisphere in 2012. The service provides facilities to C.H. Robinson employees, customers, and service providers to manage supply chain logistics, transportation, and sourcing activities on a global scale.[14][35]
TMC, a division of C.H. Robinson,[36] provides support for C.H. Robinson’s network through its Managed TMS a combination of global transportation management system (TMS) software and logistics process management.[37]
To connect its shipping and logistics services with the global e-commerce market and expand its opportunities in less than truckload markets, the company acquired Freightquote, a privately owned online transportation broker that provides shipping rate comparisons for national and regional freight carriers, in 2015.[33][38]

History[edit]
Origins and early history[edit]
In the early 1900s, Charles Henry Robinson owned a small wholesale brokerage house that provided produce throughout North Dakota and Minnesota.[26] He partnered with the Nash Finch brothers on April 11, 1905, and became the company’s first president.[13] Nash Finch Company was the leading wholesaler in the region, owning and operating grocery stores.[4][27] Following Charles Henry Robinson’s death in 1909, the Nash Brothers assumed control of the C.H. Robinson Company.[28]
C.H. Robinson became the procurement arm for Nash Finch Company as it rapidly expanded in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Texas. In the 1940s, the FTC found Nash Finch Company to have a price advantage, and under the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, C.H. Robinson Co. was split into two companies. The first, C.H. Robinson Co., was formed by the offices that sold produce to Nash Finch’s warehouses, and ownership was retained by C.H. Robinson employees. The second company, C.H. Robinson, Inc., was still owned by Nash Finch.[4][13]
Expansion into logistics and trucking[edit]
C.H. Robinson’s entry into the trucking business came after the Federal Highway Act of 1956 expanded interstate commerce and the roadways of America.[16] C.H. Robinson and other shippers had previously relied on trains to transport goods. In 1968, the firm entered the regulated truck business as a contract carrier named Meat Packers Express based out of Omaha, Nebraska.[4] Robco Transportation Inc. was formed by merging Meat Packers Express with additional carriers three years later and was sold in 1986.[13][26]
In the mid-1960s, C.H. Robinson Co. and C.H. Robinson, Inc., consolidated their operations under the name C.H. Robinson Co. Nash Finch still held a 25% stake in the brokerage company, with C.H. Robinson employees owning the remainder. By 1976, the Nash Finch shares had been bought out and the company was 100% employee owned. C.H. Robinson focused on using emerging technology to its advantage and adopted IBM mainframe technology in 1979.[13]
The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 deregulated transportation industries in America and increased competition for logistics providers and shippers.[16][26] In addition to distributing food products, C.H. Robinson created a contract carrier program, expanded its freight contract operations, and established itself as a middleman sourcing operation for virtually all shippable goods. The company’s average annual growth, measured by truckloads, doubled and C.H. Robinson posted more than $700 million in sale within five years. Forty percent was generated by truck brokerage, with the rest of the revenue coming from produce sales.[4][13]
Renaming and IPO[edit]
The company renamed itself C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., in 1997 and had an IPO that raised $190 million for the 101 employees who sold their shares.[4] The initial market value totaled $743 million, and the firm began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol CHRW.[19][29] Gross revenues for 1997 reached $1.79 billion, while net revenues amounted to $206 million, a 15.1% increase over the previous year.[4][13]
Acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 1989, C.H. Robinson began expanding its international logistics operations with the opening of its Monterrey, Mexico office. It acquired C.S. Greene International in 1992 to add international freight forwarding, air freight operations, and refrigerated containers. In 1993, C.H. Robinson bought a 30% stake in Transeco, a major French motor carrier, and eventually bought the entire company. C.H. Robinson enhanced its operations by purchasing companies including Daystar International, a distributor of fruit juice, and FoodSource. It also became an exclusive marketer for Tropicana, Motts, Glory and Welch’s.
The company continued expanding its logistics services by purchasing regional logistics firms like the Chicago-based American Backhaulers, Inc., for $136 million in 1999 and the Minnesota-based Trans-Consolidated Inc.[4][13]
At the end of the 1990s, the company began making targeted acquisitions to broaden its global presence and position it to better deliver shipping and logistics services in international markets. These acquisitions include: Preferred Translocation Systems; the Argentina-based Comexter Group; the Western European transportation provider Norminter; New York-based Vertex Transportation Inc.; Smith Terminal International Services, one of the largest third-party logistics providers in Florida; the Germany-based international freight logistics provider Frank M. Viet GmbH Internationale Spedition; Dalian Decheng Shipping Agency Co.; FoodSource Procurement LLC; Apreo Logistics S.A.; and other major European, Indian, Chinese, and North American logistics providers.[4][7][8][13][20][30][31][32][33]
In 2012, C.H Robinson purchased Phoenix International for $635 million and doubled its ocean freight capacity.[7][19][34] The company also acquired the Polish shipping firm Apreo Logisitics S.A., which provides trucking, air, and ocean shipping services throughout Europe.[33]
The company launched a technology-enabled platform called Navisphere in 2012. The service provides facilities to C.H. Robinson employees, customers, and service providers to manage supply chain logistics, transportation, and sourcing activities on a global scale.[14][35]
TMC, a division of C.H. Robinson,[36] provides support for C.H. Robinson’s network through its Managed TMS a combination of global transportation management system (TMS) software and logistics process management.[37]
To connect its shipping and logistics services with the global e-commerce market and expand its opportunities in less than truckload markets, the company acquired Freightquote, a privately owned online transportation broker that provides shipping rate comparisons for national and regional freight carriers, in 2015.[33][38]

History[edit]
Origins and early history[edit]
In the early 1900s, Charles Henry Robinson owned a small wholesale brokerage house that provided produce throughout North Dakota and Minnesota.[26] He partnered with the Nash Finch brothers on April 11, 1905, and became the company’s first president.[13] Nash Finch Company was the leading wholesaler in the region, owning and operating grocery stores.[4][27] Following Charles Henry Robinson’s death in 1909, the Nash Brothers assumed control of the C.H. Robinson Company.[28]
C.H. Robinson became the procurement arm for Nash Finch Company as it rapidly expanded in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Texas. In the 1940s, the FTC found Nash Finch Company to have a price advantage, and under the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, C.H. Robinson Co. was split into two companies. The first, C.H. Robinson Co., was formed by the offices that sold produce to Nash Finch’s warehouses, and ownership was retained by C.H. Robinson employees. The second company, C.H. Robinson, Inc., was still owned by Nash Finch.[4][13]
Expansion into logistics and trucking[edit]
C.H. Robinson’s entry into the trucking business came after the Federal Highway Act of 1956 expanded interstate commerce and the roadways of America.[16] C.H. Robinson and other shippers had previously relied on trains to transport goods. In 1968, the firm entered the regulated truck business as a contract carrier named Meat Packers Express based out of Omaha, Nebraska.[4] Robco Transportation Inc. was formed by merging Meat Packers Express with additional carriers three years later and was sold in 1986.[13][26]
In the mid-1960s, C.H. Robinson Co. and C.H. Robinson, Inc., consolidated their operations under the name C.H. Robinson Co. Nash Finch still held a 25% stake in the brokerage company, with C.H. Robinson employees owning the remainder. By 1976, the Nash Finch shares had been bought out and the company was 100% employee owned. C.H. Robinson focused on using emerging technology to its advantage and adopted IBM mainframe technology in 1979.[13]
The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 deregulated transportation industries in America and increased competition for logistics providers and shippers.[16][26] In addition to distributing food products, C.H. Robinson created a contract carrier program, expanded its freight contract operations, and established itself as a middleman sourcing operation for virtually all shippable goods. The company’s average annual growth, measured by truckloads, doubled and C.H. Robinson posted more than $700 million in sale within five years. Forty percent was generated by truck brokerage, with the rest of the revenue coming from produce sales.[4][13]
Renaming and IPO[edit]
The company renamed itself C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., in 1997 and had an IPO that raised $190 million for the 101 employees who sold their shares.[4] The initial market value totaled $743 million, and the firm began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol CHRW.[19][29] Gross revenues for 1997 reached $1.79 billion, while net revenues amounted to $206 million, a 15.1% increase over the previous year.[4][13]
Acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 1989, C.H. Robinson began expanding its international logistics operations with the opening of its Monterrey, Mexico office. It acquired C.S. Greene International in 1992 to add international freight forwarding, air freight operations, and refrigerated containers. In 1993, C.H. Robinson bought a 30% stake in Transeco, a major French motor carrier, and eventually bought the entire company. C.H. Robinson enhanced its operations by purchasing companies including Daystar International, a distributor of fruit juice, and FoodSource. It also became an exclusive marketer for Tropicana, Motts, Glory and Welch’s.
The company continued expanding its logistics services by purchasing regional logistics firms like the Chicago-based American Backhaulers, Inc., for $136 million in 1999 and the Minnesota-based Trans-Consolidated Inc.[4][13]
At the end of the 1990s, the company began making targeted acquisitions to broaden its global presence and position it to better deliver shipping and logistics services in international markets.

History[edit]
Origins and early history[edit]
In the early 1900s, Charles Henry Robinson owned a small wholesale brokerage house that provided produce throughout North Dakota and Minnesota.[26] He partnered with the Nash Finch brothers on April 11, 1905, and became the company’s first president.[13] Nash Finch Company was the leading wholesaler in the region, owning and operating grocery stores.[4][27] Following Charles Henry Robinson’s death in 1909, the Nash Brothers assumed control of the C.H. Robinson Company.[28]
C.H. Robinson became the procurement arm for Nash Finch Company as it rapidly expanded in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Texas. In the 1940s, the FTC found Nash Finch Company to have a price advantage, and under the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, C.H. Robinson Co. was split into two companies. The first, C.H. Robinson Co., was formed by the offices that sold produce to Nash Finch’s warehouses, and ownership was retained by C.H. Robinson employees. The second company, C.H. Robinson, Inc., was still owned by Nash Finch.[4][13]
Expansion into logistics and trucking[edit]
C.H. Robinson’s entry into the trucking business came after the Federal Highway Act of 1956 expanded interstate commerce and the roadways of America.[16] C.H. Robinson and other shippers had previously relied on trains to transport goods. In 1968, the firm entered the regulated truck business as a contract carrier named Meat Packers Express based out of Omaha, Nebraska.[4] Robco Transportation Inc. was formed by merging Meat Packers Express with additional carriers three years later and was sold in 1986.[13][26]
In the mid-1960s, C.H. Robinson Co. and C.H. Robinson, Inc., consolidated their operations under the name C.H. Robinson Co. Nash Finch still held a 25% stake in the brokerage company, with C.H. Robinson employees owning the remainder. By 1976, the Nash Finch shares had been bought out and the company was 100% employee owned. C.H. Robinson focused on using emerging technology to its advantage and adopted IBM mainframe technology in 1979.[13]
The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 deregulated transportation industries in America and increased competition for logistics providers and shippers.[16][26] In addition to distributing food products, C.H. Robinson created a contract carrier program, expanded its freight contract operations, and established itself as a middleman sourcing operation for virtually all shippable goods. The company’s average annual growth, measured by truckloads, doubled and C.H. Robinson posted more than $700 million in sale within five years. Forty percent was generated by truck brokerage, with the rest of the revenue coming from produce sales.[4][13]
Renaming and IPO[edit]
The company renamed itself C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., in 1997 and had an IPO that raised $190 million for the 101 employees who sold their shares.[4] The initial market value totaled $743 million, and the firm began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol CHRW.[19][29] Gross revenues for 1997 reached $1.79 billion, while net revenues amounted to $206 million, a 15.1% increase over the previous year.[4][13]
Acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 1989, C.H. Robinson began expanding its international logistics operations with the opening of its Monterrey, Mexico office. It acquired C.S. Greene International in 1992 to add international freight forwarding, air freight operations, and refrigerated containers. In 1993, C.H. Robinson bought a 30% stake in Transeco, a major French motor carrier, and eventually bought the entire company. C.H. Robinson enhanced its operations by purchasing companies including Daystar International, a distributor of fruit juice, and FoodSource. It also became an exclusive marketer for Tropicana, Motts, Glory and Welch’s.
The company continued expanding its logistics services by purchasing regional logistics firms like the Chicago-based American Backhaulers, Inc., for $136 million in 1999 and the Minnesota-based Trans-Consolidated Inc.[4][13]
At the end of the 1990s, the company began making targeted acquisitions to broaden its global presence and position it to better deliver shipping and logistics services in international markets. These acquisitions include: Preferred Translocation Systems; the Argentina-based Comexter Group; the Western European transportation provider Norminter; New York-based Vertex Transportation Inc.; Smith Terminal International Services, one of the largest third-party logistics providers in Florida; the Germany-based international freight logistics provider Frank M. Viet GmbH Internationale Spedition; Dalian Decheng Shipping Agency Co.; FoodSource Procurement LLC; Apreo Logistics S.A.; and other major European, Indian, Chinese, and North American logistics providers.[4][7][8][13][20][30][31][32][33]
In 2012, C.H Robinson purchased Phoenix International for $635 million and doubled its ocean freight capacity.[7][19][34] The company also acquired the Polish shipping firm Apreo Logisitics S.A., which provides trucking, air, and ocean shipping services throughout Europe.[33]
The company launched a technology-enabled platform called Navisphere in 2012. The service provides facilities to C.H. Robinson employees, customers, and service providers to manage supply chain logistics, transportation, and sourcing activities on a global scale.[14][35]
TMC, a division of C.H. Robinson,[36] provides support for C.H. Robinson’s network through its Managed TMS a combination of global transportation management system (TMS) software and logistics process management.[37]
To connect its shipping and logistics services with the global e-commerce market and expand its opportunities in less than truckload markets, the company acquired Freightquote, a privately owned online transportation broker that provides shipping rate comparisons for national and regional freight carriers, in 2015.[33][38]

Our Culture
Rich in potential.

We’re drawn to motivated people who demonstrate incredible potential. Inside our walls, you can’t even walk around a corner without bumping into a hardworking, impassioned individual. Our people hone their own skills while sharpening the skills of others, constantly improving output and performance. Take a sample of our employees and you’ll find an assorted mix of fresh college graduates, dedicated professionals, and veterans in it for the long haul, all growing and learning together.

Redefining community.

We encourage our employees to think outside the office and extend helping hands to their local communities. Robinson Cares sponsors a variety of charity events and gives employees an outlet to participate in their communities while raising monetary support and awareness for great causes.

Work hard, play hard.

Open floorplans, low cubicles, shared workspaces. This is how we work. We’re in each other’s business on a daily basis. Literally. Projects are collaborative and require teamwork, so thick partitions and segregated departments are less than ideal. We’re loud, enthusiastic, and passionate. We hold each other accountable for our tasks, projects, and work ethic. You can hear the cheers from another part of the office when an employee is being recognized for an accomplishment or milestone (and figure out where the cake is). We've designed our workspace to be conducive to teamwork, and we like it that way.

Mingling outside the watercooler is encouraged.

Our employees are quick to make friends within the company and spend time together outside of work. Charity events, seminars, and lunch hours are all catalysts for off-the-clock employee interaction that creates solid friendships across the organization.

Workplace & employer accolades[edit]
The company has consistently been recognized for its workplace and employee benefits, and was named the No. 2 Large Company in the 2014 Best Places to Work ranking by the Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal. C.H. Robinson has been named a Top 10000 Large Company in Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal’s Best Places to Work rankings every year since 2006. In 2013, the company earned a spot on Top Workplaces’ Top 150–National Top Workplaces 2013.[22] The Star Tribune has recognized C.H.

History[edit]
Origins and early history[edit]
In the early 1900s, Charles Henry Robinson owned a small wholesale brokerage house that provided produce throughout North Dakota and Minnesota.[26] He partnered with the Nash Finch brothers on April 11, 1905, and became the company’s first president.[13] Nash Finch Company was the leading wholesaler in the region, owning and operating grocery stores.[4][27] Following Charles Henry Robinson’s death in 1909, the Nash Brothers assumed control of the C.H. Robinson Company.[28]
C.H. Robinson became the procurement arm for Nash Finch Company as it rapidly expanded in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Texas. In the 1940s, the FTC found Nash Finch Company to have a price advantage, and under the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, C.H. Robinson Co. was split into two companies. The first, C.H. Robinson Co., was formed by the offices that sold produce to Nash Finch’s warehouses, and ownership was retained by C.H. Robinson employees. The second company, C.H. Robinson, Inc., was still owned by Nash Finch.[4][13]
Expansion into logistics and trucking[edit]
C.H. Robinson’s entry into the trucking business came after the Federal Highway Act of 1956 expanded interstate commerce and the roadways of America.[16] C.H. Robinson and other shippers had previously relied on trains to transport goods. In 1968, the firm entered the regulated truck business as a contract carrier named Meat Packers Express based out of Omaha, Nebraska.[4] Robco Transportation Inc. was formed by merging Meat Packers Express with additional carriers three years later and was sold in 1986.[13][26]
In the mid-1960s, C.H. Robinson Co. and C.H. Robinson, Inc., consolidated their operations under the name C.H. Robinson Co. Nash Finch still held a 25% stake in the brokerage company, with C.H. Robinson employees owning the remainder. By 1976, the Nash Finch shares had been bought out and the company was 100% employee owned. C.H. Robinson focused on using emerging technology to its advantage and adopted IBM mainframe technology in 1979.[13]
The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 deregulated transportation industries in America and increased competition for logistics providers and shippers.[16][26] In addition to distributing food products, C.H. Robinson created a contract carrier program, expanded its freight contract operations, and established itself as a middleman sourcing operation for virtually all shippable goods. The company’s average annual growth, measured by truckloads, doubled and C.H. Robinson posted more than $700 million in sale within five years. Forty percent was generated by truck brokerage, with the rest of the revenue coming from produce sales.[4][13]
Renaming and IPO[edit]
The company renamed itself C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., in 1997 and had an IPO that raised $190 million for the 101 employees who sold their shares.[4] The initial market value totaled $743 million, and the firm began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol CHRW.[19][29] Gross revenues for 1997 reached $1.79 billion, while net revenues amounted to $206 million, a 15.1% increase over the previous year.[4][13]
Acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 1989, C.H. Robinson began expanding its international logistics operations with the opening of its Monterrey, Mexico office. It acquired C.S. Greene International in 1992 to add international freight forwarding, air freight operations, and refrigerated containers. In 1993, C.H. Robinson bought a 30% stake in Transeco, a major French motor carrier, and eventually bought the entire company. C.H. Robinson enhanced its operations by purchasing companies including Daystar International, a distributor of fruit juice, and FoodSource. It also became an exclusive marketer for Tropicana, Motts, Glory and Welch’s.
The company continued expanding its logistics services by purchasing regional logistics firms like the Chicago-based American Backhaulers, Inc., for $136 million in 1999 and the Minnesota-based Trans-Consolidated Inc.[4][13]
At the end of the 1990s, the company began making targeted acquisitions to broaden its global presence and position it to better deliver shipping and logistics services in international markets. These acquisitions include: Preferred Translocation Systems; the Argentina-based Comexter Group; the Western European transportation provider Norminter; New York-based Vertex Transportation Inc.; Smith Terminal International Services, one of the largest third-party logistics providers in Florida; the Germany-based international freight logistics provider Frank M. Viet GmbH Internationale Spedition; Dalian Decheng Shipping Agency Co.; FoodSource Procurement LLC; Apreo Logistics S.A.; and other major European, Indian, Chinese, and North American logistics providers.[4][7][8][13][20][30][31][32][33]
In 2012, C.H Robinson purchased Phoenix International for $635 million and doubled its ocean freight capacity.[7][19][34] The company also acquired the Polish shipping firm Apreo Logisitics S.A., which provides trucking, air, and ocean shipping services throughout Europe.[33]
The company launched a technology-enabled platform called Navisphere in 2012. The service provides facilities to C.H. Robinson employees, customers, and service providers to manage supply chain logistics, transportation, and sourcing activities on a global scale.[14][35]
TMC, a division of C.H. Robinson,[36] provides support for C.H. Robinson’s network through its Managed TMS a combination of global transportation management system (TMS) software and logistics process management.[37]
To connect its shipping and logistics services with the global e-commerce market and expand its opportunities in less than truckload markets, the company acquired Freightquote, a privately owned online transportation broker that provides shipping rate comparisons for national and regional freight carriers, in 2015.[33][38]

Robinson Company.[28]
C.H. Robinson became the procurement arm for Nash Finch Company as it rapidly expanded in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Texas. In the 1940s, the FTC found Nash Finch Company to have a price advantage, and under the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, C.H. Robinson Co. was split into two companies. The first, C.H. Robinson Co., was formed by the offices that sold produce to Nash Finch’s warehouses, and ownership was retained by C.H. Robinson employees. The second company, C.H. Robinson, Inc., was still owned by Nash Finch.[4][13]
Expansion into logistics and trucking[edit]
C.H. Robinson’s entry into the trucking business came after the Federal Highway Act of 1956 expanded interstate commerce and the roadways of America.[16] C.H. Robinson and other shippers had previously relied on trains to transport goods. In 1968, the firm entered the regulated truck business as a contract carrier named Meat Packers Express based out of Omaha, Nebraska.[4] Robco Transportation Inc. was formed by merging Meat Packers Express with additional carriers three years later and was sold in 1986.[13][26]
In the mid-1960s, C.H. Robinson Co. and C.H. Robinson, Inc., consolidated their operations under the name C.H. Robinson Co. Nash Finch still held a 25% stake in the brokerage company, with C.H. Robinson employees owning the remainder. By 1976, the Nash Finch shares had been bought out and the company was 100% employee owned. C.H. Robinson focused on using emerging technology to its advantage and adopted IBM mainframe technology in 1979.[13]
The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 deregulated transportation industries in America and increased competition for logistics providers and shippers.[16][26] In addition to distributing food products, C.H. Robinson created a contract carrier program, expanded its freight contract operations, and established itself as a middleman sourcing operation for virtually all shippable goods. The company’s average annual growth, measured by truckloads, doubled and C.H. Robinson posted more than $700 million in sale within five years. Forty percent was generated by truck brokerage, with the rest of the revenue coming from produce sales.[4][13]
Renaming and IPO[edit]
The company renamed itself C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., in 1997 and had an IPO that raised $190 million for the 101 employees who sold their shares.[4] The initial market value totaled $743 million, and the firm began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol CHRW.[19][29] Gross revenues for 1997 reached $1.79 billion, while net revenues amounted to $206 million, a 15.1% increase over the previous year.[4][13]
Acquisitions[edit]
Beginning in 1989, C.H. Robinson began expanding its international logistics operations with the opening of its Monterrey, Mexico office. It acquired C.S. Greene International in 1992 to add international freight forwarding, air freight operations, and refrigerated containers. In 1993, C.H. Robinson bought a 30% stake in Transeco, a major French motor carrier, and eventually bought the entire company. C.H. Robinson enhanced its operations by purchasing companies including Daystar International, a distributor of fruit juice, and FoodSource. It also became an exclusive marketer for Tropicana, Motts, Glory and Welch’s.
The company continued expanding its logistics services by purchasing regional logistics firms like the Chicago-based American Backhaulers, Inc., for $136 million in 1999 and the Minnesota-based Trans-Consolidated Inc.[4][13]
At the end of the 1990s, the company began making targeted acquisitions to broaden its global presence and position it to better deliver shipping and logistics services in international markets. These acquisitions include: Preferred Translocation Systems; the Argentina-based Comexter Group; the Western European transportation provider Norminter; New York-based Vertex Transportation Inc.; Smith Terminal International Services, one of the largest third-party logistics providers in Florida; the Germany-based international freight logistics provider Frank M. Viet GmbH Internationale Spedition; Dalian Decheng Shipping Agency Co.; FoodSource Procurement LLC; Apreo Logistics S.A.; and other major European, Indian, Chinese, and North American logistics providers.[4][7][8][13][20][30][31][32][33]
In 2012, C.H Robinson purchased Phoenix International for $635 million and doubled its ocean freight capacity.[7][19][34] The company also acquired the Polish shipping firm Apreo Logisitics S.A., which provides trucking, air, and ocean shipping services throughout Europe.[33]
The company launched a technology-enabled platform called Navisphere in 2012. The service provides facilities to C.H. Robinson employees, customers, and service providers to manage supply chain logistics, transportation, and sourcing activities on a global scale.[14][35]
TMC, a division of C.H. Robinson,[36] provides support for C.H. Robinson’s network through its Managed TMS a combination of global transportation management system (TMS) software and logistics process management.[37]
To connect its shipping and logistics services with the global e-commerce market and expand its opportunities in less than truckload markets, the company acquired Freightquote, a privately owned online transportation broker that provides shipping rate comparisons for national and regional freight carriers, in 2015.[33][38]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
