										Dr. Shenk was very clear in her explanations about hearing aids and worked with me to find the best product for my situation. I would recommend her to anyone needing a hearing aid.

										Review for
										
HEATHER L SHENK										


										I have had hearing aids for a long time. I met Heather at my hearing aid center. She apparently left that company to work for Willow Vally. I found this deal to be very strange since she used to visit Willow Valley while working for the center I go to. Now she is calling me and other patients of hers from where she used to work trying to get us to come to her now that she works for Willow Valley.I find this practice underhanded and will not go to her!

BIO

Heather McDonough joins CORE as a Licensed Real Estate Broker after 15 years of experience in Manhattan and Miami’s luxury real estate market. Heather and her partner Henry Hershkowitz have collectively sold over $1 Billion in residential real estate in New York City, including resales and new development sales at 15 William Street, Soho Mews and Related's esteemed 520 West 28th Street project by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid.
 
Heather exclusively specialized in new development sales and marketing on many high profile projects until the market turn of 2008, at which point, she successfully transitioned into a traditional role working with buyers and sellers. Her new development experience created a strong, business-minded platform on which her resale business is based. Her direct knowledge of predevelopment planning, strategic product positioning, and the marketing and sales of new and existing properties offer both buyers and sellers a winning combination of skills.
Heather’s strong analytical mind, attention to detail and ability to listen to her clients' needs have guided thoughtful, wise decisions based on facts. Her ability to respond and transition to fluctuating market climates and trends are due to her recognition that "business as usual" is not going to cut it in today's unique real estate environment.
Heather's natural and relaxed approach traces back to her Ohio roots. After graduating from The Ohio State University, she moved to South Florida where she received a Master's at St. Thomas University.
