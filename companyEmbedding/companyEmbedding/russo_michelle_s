Michelle S. Russo, CHAM, MAI, CHA
Founder and CEO   
mrusso@hotelAVE.com 



Michelle Russo has more than 25 years of practical, hands-on experience with hotels, restaurants, resorts, convention centers, real estate and finance. She has worked on thousands of hotel assets across the United States and, in 2003, founded Hotel Asset Value Enhancement. While Ms. Russo oversees the practice, she is very involved in strategic asset positioning, management contract negotiations and interacting with senior level brand and management executives on behalf of the portfolio.
Prior to founding hotelAVE, Ms. Russo was Vice President, Senior Leisure Analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex Brown where she also garnered capital markets experience.  Her experience on Wall Street forced her to be very forward focused.  Ms. Russo also managed a $500M portfolio for John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company where she improved the portfolio and achieved 20% cash-on-cash returns. She is well-known for initiating the legal action taken in the 2660 Woodley Road case in which Hancock was originally awarded $52M. In addition, Ms. Russo was responsible for changing the property’s management and overseeing a $100M repositioning renovation of the 1,500-room convention hotel.
Ms. Russo is a regular guest lecturer at Cornell University and has appeared on CNBC and CNN to provide commentary on the hospitality and leisure industry. She has also been invited as a speaker at numerous industry conferences such as NYU, ALIS, ULI, Boston University, Distressed Hotel Summit, and Hunter Hotel Conference. Ms. Russo serves on the Dean's Advisory Board for Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration.  She is also a member of ULI’s Hotel Council, Marriott’s Distribution Strategy Advisory Committee, the AHLA’s Financial Management Committee, Morgans Board of Directors, and the Pillsbury Institute for Hospitality Entrepreneurship Advisory Board at Cornell University.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Russo Michelle S18 S Maryland AvePort Washington, NY 11050(516) 767-2111Legal Service PlansAttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Michelle S Russo PC2 Haven AvePort Washington, NY 11050(516) 767-2111AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Russo Michelle S23 S Main StFreeport, NY 11520(516) 678-9797AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Louis J Russo III Law Office305 BroadwayNew York, NY 10007(917) 282-1993AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. Uscher Quiat Uscher & Russo, P.C.43 W 43rd St Suite 166New York, NY 10036(212) 856-1214AttorneysInsurance AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection6. Michael Russo Law Office111 John St Rm 1900New York, NY 10038(212) 732-0102AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Russo, Alicia A1290 Avenue Of The AmericasNew York, NY 10104(212) 218-2100AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection8. Vincent Berg Russo Marcigliano & Zawacki127 John StNew York, NY 10038(212) 344-2083AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection9. Russo & KeaneBBB Rating: A+33 Whitehall St Ste 16New York, NY 10004(212) 482-0001AttorneysConstruction Law AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection10. Russo Joseph2 Prince StBrooklyn, NY 11201(718) 403-0980AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection11. Russo Joseph(1)16 Court StBrooklyn, NY 11241(718) 875-1173AttorneysPersonal Injury Law AttorneysWebsiteMake an AppointmentI am a friend of Joseph Russo who lived in Coney Island and Poplar Ave I am Sandie Silverberg HarrisonAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection12. Russo & Burke600 3rd AveNew York, NY 10016(212) 557-9610AttorneysWebsiteServicesFrom Business: Established in 1984, Russo & Burke is a full-service law firm.
