Job Details
               HealthCare Chaplaincy is dedicated to caring for persons in spirit, mind and body. For forty-five years we have been educating chaplains and providing chaplaincy services to area hospitals and other healthcare institutions. The financial support of these institutions has been essential in the provision of such chaplaincy services. Now, for the first time, as part of our strategic plan for the future of HealthCare Chaplaincy, we have established a fund that would provide support for professional pastoral care and chaplaincy services to community healthcare organizations that otherwise could not afford them. Some examples of services which would be considered for funding include professional pastoral care staffing, skills and training upgrade of existing chaplaincy staff, or an assessment of needs for of pastoral care services in an organization. The overall goal of CharityCare is to broaden our care for persons in spirit, mind and body to those who are being served by organizations with severely limited means. What type of organization is eligible for this grant? Any health/social/welfare organizations with a 501(c) 3 designation in the New York metropolitan area. Typically, grants will be awarded to smaller, community-based organizations. How large would a grant be? On average, grants will be below $25,000. How does my organization apply? There is no formal application form. An organization wishing to make a request may do so by sending a letter of inquiry signed by a senior corporate officer of the institution seeking support. The letter of inquiry should not exceed 1 page and contain the following information:1.History and Purpose of the Organization including proof of 501(c)3 status
