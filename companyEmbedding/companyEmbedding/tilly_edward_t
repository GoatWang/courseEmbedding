John Lothian Newsletter: Two-Part Interview with Ed Tilly








Taking the Reins: CBOE’s Ed Tilly Makes The Transition to CEO
It has been half a year since Ed Tilly took over as CEO of the CBOE from Bill Brodsky, who moved to the newly created role of executive chairman.
With six months under his belt, John Lothian News Publisher John Lothian sat down with him to talk about his new job, new initiatives from the CBOE and the challenges facing the industry.[3]










Getting Shorter: CBOE’s Ed Tilly Introduces Short-term VIX and Industry Taxes
In Part 2 of this interview, Tilly talks about the CBOE extending the VIX trading hours to access trading from European traders and how he expects the VIX will someday be open the same hours as the CME’s Globex S&P 500 futures.
He also talked about the CBOE’s new VXST short-term VIX contract, which will offer traders a much more sensitive instrument to be able to trade short-term events.
He spoke about the meeting the industry had with the chairman of the SEC about problems that have plagued the markets in recent months.
Lastly, he spoke about the impact of the Camp Proposal, a piece of proposed legislation from Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI), a member of the House Committee on Ways & Means, that could have a big impact on the options business and its customers. Camp’s proposal includes several provisions that would change the tax treatment for strategies used in options trading. Some believe it could severely harm the listed options business in the United States.[4]

"It has been a great honor to work with Ed Joyce, whose wisdom and leadership have been a guiding force in the successful development of CBOE and the entire U.S. options industry for the past 38 years," said William J. Brodsky, CBOE Holdings Chairman and CEO.  "In addition to a career marked by numerous professional distinctions, Ed brought wit, grace and unfailing kindness to his daily interactions with colleagues, staff and competitors alike. I speak for the entire CBOE community in saying thank you to Ed, both for his many accomplishments and for his abiding friendship." 
"Fortunately, CBOE has a deep and experienced executive team," Brodsky continued, "and I am very pleased that Ed Tilly, former Executive Vice Chairman of CBOE Holdings, has been named our new President and COO.

His executive leadership was instrumental in CBOE's demutualization and IPO, the development of our VIX product line and our all-electronic C2 Options Exchange, and most recently, the launch of SPXpm, the electronic counterpart to our flagship SPX product." 
"I had the good fortune to work side by side with Ed Joyce for many years, and I am deeply honored to succeed him as President and COO," said Edward T. Tilly.  "This is an exciting time in the history of CBOE, and it is gratifying to continue working in this new role with the most accomplished staff and trading community in the options business.  I am proud of all that our team accomplished in our first year as a publicly-traded company and even more excited by what we can achieve in the months and years ahead."
