   The Wight Foundation, Inc. was founded in 1986 by Mr. Russell B. Wight, Jr., a New Jersey businessman and real estate entrepreneur. Mr. Wight was inspired by a Public Television documentary, which highlighted the social and economic challenges that plagued many families in the Greater Newark area. The documentary also spoke to the limited educational opportunities available for young people at that time.
Deeply affected by the documentary, Mr. Wight reached out to community and business leaders to begin to address the challenge of providing educational opportunity for young people. In response, The Wight Foundation, Inc. was founded with the mission to provide superior educational opportunities for young men and women of the Greater Newark area to achieve academic excellence and personal development within a boarding school environment. The Foundation fosters the development of each scholar's leadership potential and helps him or her gain confidence to be successful both in and out of the classroom.
In 1986, a group of five students entered boarding school as the first class of Wight Foundation scholars. Since then The Wight Foundation has experienced tremendous growth. Its recruitment outreach efforts have extended to the five counties of the Greater Newark area. Many new programs and initiatives have been developed. Most of all, the size of its scholar and alumni population has grown.
The Wight Foundation provides grants, based on family income, to attend boarding schools in the New England and Mid-Atlantic Regions. Applicants must currently be in the 7th grade, excel in their academic work and attend school in the Greater Newark area (Essex, Union, Hudson, Passaic and Middlesex Counties).

Jerry McCrea/The Star-LedgerPhilanthropist Russell Wight Jr.'s group has quietly sent hundreds of students from Newark area to prestigious boarding schools.
NEWARK — For years, he’s been quietly sending hundreds of students from Newark and surrounding towns to prestigious boarding high schools.
They are teens like Kathleen Da Silva, who grew up in Newark. In the fall, Da Silva will be attending Harvard on a full scholarship. And that makes Russell Wight Jr. smile.
The goal is more than just getting students into top colleges. For Wight, it’s personal satisfaction, an estimated $25 million worth.
"I beam — I get excited," he said, while sitting in the Wight Foundation’s 17th-floor office in downtown Newark. "It’s very hard to describe the thrill, the satisfaction you get from this."
Wight and his namesake nonprofit organization have operated in obscurity for 25 years. Now, the philanthropist and former New Jerseyan has emerged from behind the scenes because he wants to expand his foundation to other cities. He’s seeking other benefactors.
The foundation selects seventh-graders and spends nearly a year preparing them for the rigors of boarding school.
A former real estate tycoon, Wight, 71, is still a businessman at heart and speaks of philanthropy in investment terms.
"For the amount of money we spend, the return we get is unbelievable," he said. "We change lives."
A TICKET UP
For Da Silva, her ticket to Harvard came after four years of grueling academics. On her first day of class at boarding school, teachers dived into lessons and piled on homework. While lugging heavy textbooks around, Da Silva remembers thinking, "Wow, I hope it’s not like this every day."
She arrived at boarding school in Concord, Mass., with just two suitcases and a "ton" of stuffed animals. While home on breaks, her friends said she spoke differently and seemed more mature.
"You feel like you’re in two different worlds," said the dimpled 17-year-old who graduated from Middlesex School last month.
Aristide Economopoulos/The Star-LedgerKathleen Da Silva, who grew up in Newark, will be attending Harvard this fall after graduating from the Middlesex School in Concord, Mass.
Scores of Wight Foundation scholars have gone to Ivy League and other top-tier universities. Success in boarding school helps them snag college scholarships. Now Da Silva and her stuffed animals will be going to Harvard.
HUMBLE FOUNDATIONS
Born in Philadelphia, Wight moved to New Jersey in his late 20s to start Interstate Properties with a partner in 1968.
He made his millions as a shopping center developer with the Clifton company, which started with two men and a secretary and grew to 150 workers. He now splits his time between Aspen, Colo., and Boca Raton, Fla., with his wife, Melissa, and their two children. He also has two children from a previous marriage.
Wight started the foundation after being moved by a documentary on Newark he saw in 1985. The film highlighted problems like high school dropouts and teen pregnancy.
A product of prep school education, Wight began contacting boarding schools. At the time, elite academies were looking to diversify their student body and welcomed Wight’s proposal to sponsor minorities from poor families with good grades and leadership skills.
Foundation students attend 48 boarding schools along the East Coast and New England regions. They include top private schools in New Jersey like the Lawrenceville School near Princeton and the Peddie School in Hightstown.
In 1986, Wight sent five students away to school. Today, his foundation sends about 25 students each year.
THINKING AHEAD
The foundation accepts about one out of every eight applicants. Rhonda Auguste said they waste no time gearing up for the top priority: college.
"It always blows the parents away," said Auguste, the longtime executive director. "They look at us like, ‘Wait a minute, my child is going to eighth grade. Why are we talking about college?’ "
But the statistics speak for themselves: Only a couple students have left the program. The rest — the majority either black or Hispanic and 60 percent girls and 40 percent boys — go on to four-year colleges.
Funding works in different ways. Sometimes the foundation and the school split the tuition. Other times, schools provide full funding.
Families pay about 1 percent of the cost, which ends up being about $400 a year, Auguste said. That way the parents also feel invested, she said.
Wight joked that he’s "the guy who writes the checks." But he also visits schools. He’s been known to show up by helicopter and whisk students away in a limo for dinner and a catch-up. But he also keeps an eye on academics. Each student’s report card comes across his desk. If he sees slipping grades, he writes a letter.
'CULTURE SHOCK'
Shakirah Miller-Harrington, 38, was raised by a single mom in Newark. She recalls getting an "F" on an essay at boarding school. She rewrote the paper three times — still all "F"s. Her fourth try got her a "D."
Da Silva also recalls struggling. She learned to accept critiques — even when they felt brutal. In English, for example, the entire class dissected essays line by line.
"It’s not to make anybody feel bad, it was so we could learn," she said. "I realized you need criticism to get better."
There were other challenges, too. 
"It was like culture shock to the nth degree," said Thalia Brownridge-Smith, a Newark native and Peddie 2000 graduate. She applied to 11 colleges and got into every one, then went to the University of Pennsylvania on a full scholarship.
Miller-Harrington cited misconceptions about Newarkers: "Questions used to arise — ‘Do you know how to steal a car?’ "
But she found her niche, making friends on the field hockey and basketball teams.
For Auguste, the most gratifying part of her job is seeing alumni return home to work. Brownridge-Smith is a teacher at Miller Street Elementary School in Newark, where Miller-Harrington is principal.
"I’m contributing to the growth of the city," Miller-Harrington said.
"I tell my students wherever you go, you are competing globally, but you give back to your community — you invest in it."
