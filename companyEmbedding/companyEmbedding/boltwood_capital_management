OUR VALUES

 



We believe that operating our business with the following core values allows us to best serve our clients.

 




INTEGRITY: As an independent firm we strive to treat our clients how we want to be treated – with accountability and responsibility at all times.  Regardless of the impact on our firm we promise to place the interests of our clients’ above ours.

 




OUTSTANDING CLIENT SERVICE: We demand of ourselves that we have a complete understanding of our clients’ needs, desires, unique circumstances and concerns.

 




DISCIPLINE: Our investment approach is based on an analytical approach that demands thoughtfulness.  While we have core investment philosophies we also recognize that client circumstances and investing climates change forcing us to identify new insights and ways of helping our clients’ reach their goals.  In our view complacency and stubbornness are ingredients for a poor outcome.

 




CANDOR: We believe that through open, clear and honest communication, both with ourselves and clients, we are best able to service our stakeholders.  We promise to always tell our clients the truth, whether or not it is good for the firm or difficult for a client to hear.

 




KNOWLEDGE: One of the wonderful things about our profession is there is always more to learn.  Investment techniques, planning issues and circumstances are constantly changing. We promise to continually improve our knowledge while educating and sharing this information with our clients.

 





A FIRM VOID OF SELLING PRESSURE WHERE CLIENTS’ INTERESTS ARE PUT FIRST

 


The financial advisor landscape includes many different types of operators.  This collection of service providers includes stock brokers, registered investment advisors (like BCM), wealth managers, financial planners and countless other types of financial professionals.  All of these providers serve different roles and have different levels of responsibilities to their client.




Although many advisors use different terminology, in general advisors come in some version of the following:





Investment Managers: Manage assets according to a particular strategy in a pooled portfolio on behalf of their clients.  They have no obligation to make sure the investments they are making are in the best interest for their clients.






Asset Allocators: These managers outsource investment advice via mutual funds or other investment avenues.  More time is spent on vetting managers than on which investments to make.






Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs):  Independent managers manage separate accounts on behalf of each client they serve.  These advisors have a legal obligation to act in the best interests of their clients.  RIA’s are not compensated for transactions but rather the objective advice they provide their clients.





As Chet Boltwood correctly identified decades ago there is a significant difference between the obligation of a Registered Investment Advisor and a broker or other managers.  These non-fiduciary advisors are salespeople and like all salespeople they are paid to pitch (and ultimately) sell a product or service.  They have no legal obligation to offer objective advice or act in the best interest of their client.




Here at Boltwood Capital Management we are proud to be a fiduciary investment manager.  We believe that by aligning our interest with yours creates a superior long-term experience for all parties involved.

What are analysts saying about Abbott Laboratories stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Abbott Laboratories stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "For the majority of last one month, Abbott is trading above the broader Medical Products industry. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance in the last reported first quarter. Overall, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing integration and synergy achievement of St. Jude. We are also looking forward to the company’s plans to focus on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Recently, Abbott received CE mark for its TactiCath Sensor and Confirm Rx ICM products which is quite encouraging. The company also launched science-based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries. On the flip side, Abbott’s sluggish pediatric business in China continues to hamper growth. Management is also concerned about the on-going economic problem in Venezuela that is expected to remain unresolved in the coming quarters." (6/21/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Investment summary: We are reiterating our Overweight rating for CORI and we are raising our PT by $2 to $12 following the positive donepezil patch bioequivalence results. Progress in the development of a proprietary pipeline is key, in our opinion, to the performance of the shares. Successful development of patch formulations of donepezil (Aricept) and/or memantine (Namenda) should position the company well to more-effectively monetize the transdermal drug delivery platform, in our opinion. Retention of meaningful commercialization rights could enable the company to turn the corner and pursue other opportunities more broadly, in our opinion. Corplex donepezil pilot study shows bioequivalence. Management reported that the Corplex donepezil pilot study met the FDA statistical criteria for bioequivalence. We note, too, that the patch was well-tolerated, with good skin and GI tolerability." (5/12/2017)

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

Electro Savings Credit Union


                                            Electro Savings approve loans under a different set of rules to African Americans than Caucasian customers!  I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!

                                            Applied for a credit card and was denied based on what they said was a loss from a personal loan in 1978. I have never had an account with PenFed, so I questioned the accuracy of this denial. Considering, as a business owner, my scores are well north of 700, I thought this...show more
