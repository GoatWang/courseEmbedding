			John T. Nesser, III has served as a director since June 2012. Since July 2013, Mr. Nesser has served as the co-founder, manager, co-chief executive officer and director of All Coast, LLC ("All Coast"). Following its acquisition of Hercules Offshore Domestic Liftboat Fleet in July 2013, All Coast owns and operates the largest fleet of liftboats for the offshore oil and gas market in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Nesser retired as executive vice president and chief operating officer of McDermott International, Inc. (NYSE:MDR) ("McDermott") in 2011. He joined McDermott, a global engineering, procurement, construction and installation company with a focus on the energy industry, as associate general counsel in 1998 and spent over ten years in various senior management roles, including as general counsel, chief administrative officer and chief legal officer. Previously, he served as a managing partner of Nesser, King & LeBlanc, a New Orleans law firm, which he co-founded in 1985. Mr. Nesser has served as a director of Layne Christensen Company (NASDAQ:LAYN) since August 2013 and is currently the chair of its compensation committee and a member of the audit and nominating and corporate governance committees. Mr. Nesser is a member of the Texas and Louisiana Bar Associations and is also a member of the Louisiana State University Law Center Board of Trustees. Mr. Nesser holds a B.S. in Business Administration, majoring in finance and a J.D. from Louisiana State University. We believe that Mr. Nesser's significant prior experience in the roles of chief operating officer and general counsel and his legal and operational backgrounds make a significant contribution to the Board's mix of backgrounds and skills and qualify him to be a director.
