FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

      This press release is not for tax reporting purposes but is being
      provided to announce the amount of each Fund's distributions that have
      been declared by the applicable Board of Directors. In early 2018, after
      definitive information is available, each Fund will send shareholders a
      Form 1099-DIV, if applicable, specifying how the distributions paid by
      each Fund during the prior calendar year should be characterized for
      purposes of reporting the distributions on a shareholder's tax return
      (e.g., ordinary income, long-term capital gain or return of capital). If
      applicable, a current estimate of the distribution's composition can be
      found in the Section 19 notice section of the website. Please consult
      your tax advisor for further information.

      investment program, and may result in loss of principal. Each closed-end
      fund will have its own unique investment strategy, risks, charges and

  Prudential Global Short Duration High Yield Fund, Inc.  (NYSE:GHY), (the "Fund"), a diversified, closed-end management investment company, announced today its unaudited investment results for the quarter ended April 30, 2017.                                                    As of     April 30, 2017         As of    January 31, 2017         As of    April 30, 2016      Net Assets         $678,151,576       $678,727,185       $673,247,863     Loan Outstanding         $280,000,000       $285,000,000       $275,000,000     Shares Outstanding         40,923,879       40,923,879       40,923,879     Net Asset Value ("NAV") Per Share (a)         $16.57       $16.59       $16.45     Market Price Per Share (b)         $15.21       $15.09       $14.93     Premium / (Discount) to NAV (c)         -8.2%       -9.0%       -9.2%                               Undistributed / (Overdistributed) Net Investment Income (d)         $8,402,406       $9,239,467       $8,432,620     Undistributed / (Overdistributed) Net Investment Income Per Share (e)         $0.21       $0.23       $0.21                                        Quarter Ended    April 30, 2017         Quarter Ended    January 31, 2017         Quarter Ended    April 30, 2016       Quarterly Earnings                         Net Investment Income         $11,440,102       $11,845,697       $12,754,903     Net Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss)         ($12,015,711)           ($13,698,262)           $8,309,872     Net Increase / (Decrease) in Net Assets From Operations         $(575,609)           $(1,852,565)           $21,064,775                                Quarterly Earnings Per Common Share Outstanding                         Net Investment Income         $0.28       $0.29       $0.31     Net Realized and Unrealized Gain / (Loss)         ($0.29)           ($0.33)           $0.20     Net Increase / (Decrease) in Net Assets From Operations         ($0.01)           ($0.04)           $0.51                                This financial data is unaudited. Amounts do not reflect adjustments for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles including those relating to amortization of premiums on securities held.                   Notes:     (a)       Net Asset Value ("NAV") Per Share is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding.     (b)       Market Price Per Share is the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange.     (c)       Premium / (Discount) to NAV is the % difference between the market price and the NAV price.     (d)       Overdistributed amounts may be funded by capital gains on portfolio securities or through return of shareholder's capital. Undistributed / (Overdistributed) Net Investment Income ("UNII") represents the balance to date of a fund's net investment income less its distributions. Includes prior year UNII of $9,742,839 for the fiscal year ended 7/31/16 and $9,429,823 for the fiscal year ended 7/31/15.     (e)       The UNII information provided treats amounts relating to foreign currency transactions as net realized and unrealized gain (loss). However, these amounts are treated as net investment income (loss) for federal income tax purposes. In accordance with federal income tax treatment, the UNII balances would have been $1,858,382 ($0.05 per share), $8,735,451 ($0.21 per share), and $1,242,709 ($0.03 per share), as of the current quarter, prior quarter, and year ago quarter, respectively. While not required to do so, the Fund may attempt to hedge its foreign currency exposure, which may offset all or a portion of the foreign currency exposure included in the table above. As of the date of this press release, the Fund believes that it has significantly hedged its foreign currency exposure.                  The Fund files its annual and semi-annual stockholders reports on Form N-CSR, as well as complete schedule of investments with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") for the first and third quarters of each fiscal year on Form N-Q. The Fund's Forms N-Q are available on the Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov. The Fund's Forms N-Q may also be reviewed and copied at the Commission's Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. Information on the operation and location of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling (202) 551-8090. To obtain information on Form N-Q or annual and semi-annual stockholder reports, shareholders can call (800) 451-6788 (toll-free). You may also call this number to request additional information or to make other inquiries pertaining to the Fund.  About PGIM and Prudential Financial, Inc.
