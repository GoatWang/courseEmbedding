We will now begin with remarks from Tim Conver. Tim?
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Steve, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. Today I'll discuss our Q3 performance and highlight some of the important progress we've made. Teresa Covington will review Q3 financials and year-to-date results, then I'll discuss our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year before we take your questions.
Our team continued to execute our strategy successfully and we delivered results in line with our full year plan. Q3 revenue of $68.4 million was slightly above Q3 last year and slightly below our expectations for this year due to component part shortages. The component issues have now been resolved for Q4 shipments.
Healthy customer funded R&D revenue in Q3 across multiple projects reflected continued customers interest in our advanced developments. Gross profit margin of 39.5% for the quarter was in line with expectations. Total revenue of $173 million for the first nine months of the year leaves $87 million to go to achieve the midpoint of our annual revenue guidance. Our team once again extended our market leadership in our core business during Q3.

In our EES business segment, we introduced TurboDock during the quarter. This is a simpler lower cost solution for workplace charging that we believe can expand our EV charging footprint and will help support broader EV adoption. TurboDock leverages the unique size and dual-voltage design of our successful TurboCord residential charging solution. It adds a smartphone user interface and back office support to provide a compelling new solution for the workplace. Our charging station costs, availability and access issues have slowed adoption to-date.
In our UAS business segment, we began shipments of new Wasp AE systems to the U.S. Marine Corps in Q3. This is the first contract to support the Marine's new small unmanned airplane system family requirement. We also continued to successfully demonstrate shipboard applications of Puma AE during the quarter. Broad and positive customer response continues to reinforce our expectation of significant Navy and other maritime opportunities for our solutions.
We also continued to make progress on expanding from our core small UAS business into next generation larger UAS solutions. We're currently executing on Phase II of the contract for DARPA's TERN program. The goal of this program is to develop a new class of unmanned airplane system capable of long range and long duration operations from naval vessels such as destroyers that lack deck space for traditional aircraft operations. We have an innovative and practical approach to delivering this capability and are working with a team of industry leaders to develop and demonstrate our system solution. We anticipate a customer decision regarding the TERN Phase III contract in our fiscal year 2016.
Now turning to our international UAS business. You may recall that in 2013 we signed a teaming agreement with Dynamatic Technologies to explore opportunities for our small UAS in the Indian market. Our persistent work together is beginning to yield positive results. We were recently selected as the first of four pathfinder projects as part of the U.S./India defense technology transfer initiative. This is a strategic initiative supported at the highest levels of both governments. We're working with Dynamatic, the U.S. and the Indian governments to finalize terms on a joint development and production program in India named Cheel.
Cheel is to be the next generation small UAS based on our small UAS leading market technology solutions and Dynamatic's cost effective aerospace capabilities. The Indian military is one of the world's largest and has expressed requirements for small UAS. This program's initial objective is to provide a compelling and rapidly available solution for those procurement opportunities. We will update you as we finalize details on this project and begin to move ahead.
Beyond our activities in India, we continue to see significant interest in our small UAS solutions from allied military forces around the world. International order flow timing tends to be more difficult to predict accurately, but we expect multiple proposals to be decided on over the next few quarters. In government fiscal 2016, DoD budget request was recently released and we found no significant surprises. Budget identified procurement line items have averaged only 15% of our actual DoD bookings over the prior two years. Independent of the budget, it's important to note that the threat environment that drove the initial demand for both small UAS and Switchblade and then validated their compelling advantages does not seem to be abating.
Now onto this year's increased investments in three of our largest growth opportunities: Tactical Missile Systems, Global Observer and Commercial UAS solutions. The return on invested capital from adoption and success in these markets is compelling. Positioning for success in these opportunities is a key element of executing our growth strategy to build stockholder value. We are increasing these investments because lead customers in each market continue to show increased interest in adoption. We're managing these investments with a metered and gaited approach to stay closely linked to customers and adoption timing. These investments have mainly been on the income statement to-date in the form of research and development and business development expense. We've made significant progress year-to-date and we continue to strengthen our positions and build options for AV's success when the adoption window opens for these transformational opportunities.

In Tactical Missile Systems we're investing in two key areas. First, the development of Switchblade variants to address customer interest in additional concepts of operation. Second, we're developing the capability to demonstrate the compelling solution for an Army program of record. We are pleased to report that initial demonstrations of the first of three new Switchblade variants exceeded customer expectations, and we received follow-on customer funding early in Q4. Two additional Switchblade variant programs for different customers are progressing well and are on schedule. We continue to optimize Switchblade for an Army LMAMS program of record that would institutionalize the enduring requirement and the volume demand for multi-year procurement of sustainment. A program of record continues to gain strong support within the U.S. Army.
We are also making incremental investments this year in Global Observer. Customers in other countries continue to express interest in Global Observer solutions and we have developed teaming relationships to optimally address each. In Turkey, we are working through our joint venture, Altoy, our memorandum of understanding with Aselsan and others. Our memorandum of understanding with Lockheed Martin is focused on another opportunity set. The timing of these potential opportunities remains uncertain, but the need and the value of affordable seamless persistence is clear.
In Commercial UAS, we successfully completed our first season of delivering advanced information services to BP in Alaska. We continue to work closely and collaboratively with BP to expand our services and to integrate into their regular operations. It is important to note that BP has already added pipeline inspection to the scope of our services contract for calendar year 2015. We are excited about BP's success to-date and the opportunities ahead.
Our successful operations in Alaska have led to significant increase in the FAA authorized airspace for our Commercial UAS flight operations. As a result, we are now responding to multiple requests for proposal from new customers for our services in Alaska. We expect to expand further within and beyond Alaska this year in the oil and gas industry.
In addition to the oil and gas industry and Alaska, we continue to support and work with early adopters of small UAS for use in public safety applications. We also are evaluating broad and high value applications in agriculture. These and other industry specific solutions show great promise for delivering actionable information that can drive high returns on investment for adopting customers.
We were pleased to see the FAA recently released proposed rules for the small UAS operation. First it's important to understand that these are proposed rules, and that the regulations that had been governing our industry remain in effect until new rules are implemented. The public comment and review period may ultimately take many months, at a minimum, and potentially longer. In the meantime, we are aggressively expanding our commercial operations in Alaska as I discussed earlier. We're also pursuing all other means for near-term options for authorized Commercial UAS operations elsewhere in the United States. We believe that preserving the safety of the National Airspace System is vitally important and that the FAA rules need to incorporate standards to ensure safety in UAS operations.
AV invests significant time and resources in developing, testing and validating the underlying technologies and the integrated solutions that enable our systems to operate safely. We have logged more than 1 million operating miles, and we know very well what is required for safe operations. We believe that many industries will come to depend on UAS technologies in support of their mission critical operations and will necessarily seek safe, professional grade solutions to do so. Further, we believe that the right solutions are capable of safe operation beyond line of sight in the hands of trained and qualified operators.

The release of the proposed rules is a significant start to a discussion that we hope will lead to practical laws that enable the many industries, organizations and the economy to benefit from these solutions while protecting our airspace and the people and property underneath it.
We have continued to expand our research and development capacity. And we made progress in developments for Tactical Missile Systems and Commercial UAS during the quarter. However, competition for R&D resources from growing customer research and development contracts, which we record as service revenue, limited our total Q3 internal R&D to about flat quarter-over-quarter. We did accelerate our work to refine customer requirements, define optimal solution sets and explore accelerated market access for these emerging new opportunities. These investments are primarily reflected in our SG&A.
Our year-to-date delay in internal research and development spending has not reduced our expected total investment. Rather, it pushed that investment to the right. In the meantime, flat R&D investment quarter-over-quarter resulted in higher operating profit in the third quarter. Moderate success in any of these three growth opportunities can significantly enhance stockholder value. Good success in all three will be transformational for UAV – for AeroVironment.
With the overview of the quarter, now I'd like to introduce Teresa Covington, our interim CFO. Teresa joined AeroVironment in 2011 to lead finance for our EES business segment. She's been a key member of AeroVironment's senior financial team since that time working closely with the management team on operations across the entire organization. Teresa will now provide a financial overview. Teresa?
Teresa P. Covington - Interim Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. AeroVironment's fiscal 2015 third quarter results are as follows. Revenue for Q3 was $68.4 million, a decrease of $0.8 million or 1% as compared to $69.2 million a year ago. Looking at revenue by segment, UAS revenue was $58 million, an increase of $0.5 million or 1% compared to last year. The increase was primarily due to higher customer funded R&D work of $2.9 million, partially offset with lower service revenue of $2 million and lower product deliveries of $0.4 million. EES revenue decreased $1.4 million or 12% to $10.4 million in the third quarter. This decrease was primarily due to lower product deliveries of our electric vehicle test systems.
Turning to gross margin, gross margin for the third quarter was $27 million, a decrease of $0.1 million as compared to $27.1 million in the prior year. By segment UAS gross margin increased $0.8 million or 4% to $24.8 million in the quarter. The increase was primarily due to favorable product mix. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin for UAS increased from 42% to 43%. EES gross margin decreased $0.9 million or 29% to $2.2 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher manufacturing and engineering overhead support costs, lower sales and unfavorable product mix. As a percentage of revenue, EES gross margin decreased from 27% to 21%.
SG&A expense for the third quarter was $13.3 million or 19% of revenue compared to SG&A expense of $13.2 million or 19% of revenue in the prior year. R&D expense for the third quarter was $8.6 million or 13% of revenue compared to R&D investments of $5.2 million or 8% of revenue in the prior year. R&D investments increased by $3.3 million year-over-year.
Operating income for the third quarter was $5.1 million or 8% of revenue compared to the prior year operating income of $8.6 million or 12% of revenue. Operating income was lower primarily due to higher R&D investments. Other expense for the quarter was $0.1 million compared to the prior year other income of $4.9 million. Other income was lower primarily due to the prior year unrealized gain related to our CybAero convertible notes investment. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 54%, an increase from the prior year of 17%.

Net income for the quarter was $2.3 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to net income of $11.2 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the CybAero investment, EPS would have been $0.10 per diluted share compared to $0.34 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. We have provided an EPS reconciliation table in the press release.
Now moving quickly through our first nine months fiscal 2015 results. Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 was $172.9 million, a decrease of $5.3 million or 3% as compared to $178.2 million in the prior year. UAS revenue decreased $6.5 million or 4% to $142.3 million, primarily due to decreases in service revenue of $5.5 million and customer funded R&D work of $4 million, offset by higher product deliveries of $3.1 million. EES revenue increased $1.2 million or 4% to $30.7 million primarily due to increased product deliveries of our industrial fast charge systems.
Gross margin for the nine months was $58.9 million as compared to $63.5 million in the prior year. This represents a decrease of $4.6 million or 7%. Gross margin was impacted by a government contract accounting reserve we set up in the second quarter for prior year incurred cost audit findings. UAS gross margin decreased $4.9 million or 9% to $50.4 million. The decrease is primarily due to a termination settlement for a Global Observer technology demonstration contract that occurred during the first nine months of the prior year, and lower service margins. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin for UAS decreased from 37% to 35%.
EES gross margin increased $0.4 million or 5% to $8.5 million, primarily due to higher sales volume. As a percentage of revenue, EES gross margin remained at 28%. SG&A expense for the nine months was $40.1 million or 23% of revenue compared to SG&A expense of $38.7 million or 22% of revenue in the prior year. R&D investments for the nine months were $24.2 million or 14% of revenue compared to R&D investments of $19.3 million or 11% of revenue in the prior year.
Operating loss for the nine months was $5.5 million or negative 3% of revenue compared to operating income of $5.5 million or 3% of revenue last year. Other income for the nine months was $0.4 million compared to the prior year other expense of $0.4 million. Other income was higher primarily due to the prior year expense related to the conversion feature of our CybAero convertible notes investments.
The effective tax rate for the nine months was 8% compared to the effective tax benefit rate from prior year of 12.3%. The net loss for the nine months was $4.2 million or $0.18 loss per share compared to the net income of $5.7 million, or $0.25 per diluted share last year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the CybAero investment, EPS would have been a $0.19 loss per share compared to earnings of $0.28 per diluted share in the prior year.
Looking at backlog, funded backlog at the end of the quarter was $89.3 million, up $23.4 million, or 36% from April 30, 2014.
Turning to our balance sheet, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the third quarter totaled $258.1 million, up $1 million from the prior quarter. The increase in cash equivalents and investments was driven by lower working capital needs.
Turning to receivables, at the end of the third quarter, our accounts receivable, including unbilled receivables, totaled $46.2 million, up $8 million from the prior quarter. Total days sales outstanding was at approximately 61 days compared to 65 days at the end of the prior quarter.
Taking a look at inventory, inventories were $48.8 million at the end of the quarter compared to $51.8 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days in inventory were approximately 106 days compared to 134 days at the end of the prior quarter.

Turning to capital expenditures, in the third quarter, we invested approximately $1.2 million, or 2% of revenue in property improvements and capital equipment. AV recognized $2.1 million of depreciation in the quarter.
Now an update to our fiscal 2015 visibility. As of today, year-to-date third quarter revenues of $173 million, third quarter ending backlog that we can execute in fiscal 2015 of $73 million, fourth quarter quarter-to-date bookings that we can execute in fiscal 2015 of $4 million, unfunded backlog that we expect to recognize in fiscal 2015 of $4 million, and revenues needed to hold EES revenues flat relative to last year of $6 million.
This puts the total fiscal 2015 revenue visibility at $260 million, or 100% of the midpoint of guidance. This implies fourth quarter revenue of $87 billion.
Now I'd like to turn things back to Tim to discuss AV's expectations for the balance of fiscal 2015.
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Teresa. We guided on revenue and gross profit margin this year to maintain visibility on our core business operations because planned R&D and SG&A investments could consume more operating profit. We remain on track for our fiscal 2015 annual revenue and gross profit margin guidance. We plan to significantly increase our fiscal 2015 growth opportunity investments this quarter, including a target to increase IR&D by more than 50% over Q3.
Our visibility gives us confidence in our fiscal 2015 guidance of $250 million to $270 million in revenue. Strong Q3 gross profit and our Q4 outlook support our gross profit margin guidance of 34.5% to 37.5%. In Q4, the primary focus of new bookings in on building backlog for fiscal 2016 revenue. Looking ahead, our funded backlog and our new order pipeline remain strong. Our increased investments this year are positioning us well for market opportunities that can drive significant stockholder value.
We will continue to closely monitor and adjust these investments based on customer adoption behavior, timing and projected returns on investment capital. We're actively engaged in the planning process for fiscal 2016. And we're excited about the opportunities ahead. We look forward to providing you with our views on the coming year in our Q4 earnings release.
Before we close the call and open it for Q&A, I want to recognize our employees for their hard work every day that has extended AV's position as a market leader across our business segments and our product lines, while at the same time positioning AV for leadership in exciting new markets with compelling innovations. This team is the best in the world at what they do. Thank you for your interest. And now, we'll take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. The first question is from Michael Ciarmoli of KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hi, good afternoon, guys. This is actually Kevin on for Mike. Just wondering if you could give us any color on the – additional color, I guess, on the TERN program? And now that the first down-select is complete, what the company's working on there to get ready for the next down-select and whether you're still expecting that to occur in the next nine months or so? I think last quarter, you'd said give or take 12 months. Kind of where that stands now.
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Kevin. TERN is the – a DARPA program that's intended to be a next-generation unmanned airplane system. It's a ship-based, vertical take-off and landing, medium-altitude, long-endurance platform. Five companies competed during Phase I, that was down-selected to two companies currently competing in Phase II. We do expect Phase III to be awarded during our fiscal year 2016.

We're working on an innovative approach that we believe represents a high value and highly reliable means of achieving the DARPA objectives. We have a broad team of industry experts collaborating with us in developing and demonstrating this system design that our team has developed. And we think this puts us in a strong position for next-generation larger UAS solutions that I've said before is a priority for us.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Tim. And then just looking at the R&D line, any color you can give us there in terms of how the mix has changed over the past quarter or so and kind of where you see it going in 4Q as it relates to specific programs or markets?
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, our R&D, I think of it as being divided into three sections. We're running internally-funded R&D to support our core businesses. We are investing incrementally in internally-funded R&D to position ourselves for these three large emerging markets that we see adoption activity increasing within customers. And we conduct customer-funded research and development. And what – we've been building our R&D capacity significantly through the year. We knew we planned on incrementally increasing the investments for these growth opportunities. That capacity growth is both in terms of internal resources and developing additional external relationships that can execute R&D in conjunction with us.
During Q3, we had a significant increase in customer-funded research and development activities. That competes directly with the same resources that we apply to our internal projects. And so, the balance of R&D that was allocated to the core business and R&D that was allocated to our growth opportunities accounted for the – a flat internally-funded R&D quarter-over-quarter. We expect to significantly increase our R&D in Q4. And our target, as I mentioned in my call, is to increase internally funded R&D by over 50%. This is still a delicate dance between allocation of scarce resources to multiple high-priority activities, but we think we're getting our capacity where we need it, and we're moving ahead with that intent.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from Tyler Hojo of Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.
Tyler E. Hojo - Sidoti & Co. LLC
Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess the first one, just on, Tim, you mentioned kind of multiple RFPs coming in, just kind of similar to what you're doing with BP in Alaska. I was hoping that maybe you could just maybe just talk about the size of this near-term opportunity. And also what the competitive dynamic looks like. I mean, how many people do you think kind of offer a similar sort of offering? Or maybe just generally competing for the same work you are?
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Let me maybe address the competitive issue first, Tyler, and then try to talk about the size of the operations. When BP put out RFPs for the services that they were interested in previously, they had multiple responses from many different types of organizations, including multiple UAV suppliers. In the final analysis, we were selected for all of the services exclusively. I think that goes to – that says a lot about a sophisticated organization doing an informed analysis of available capabilities and matching them to the needs of the organization.
We continue to see multiple other companies, primarily companies with quadcopter capability in the commercial space. They're clearly great fun to fly, they produce wonderful video; they're carrying an increasing number of other payloads. But I think we find that large enterprises that are looking at integrating this capability into the core part of their operations are looking for reliable, safe, professional solutions that can operate not just when it's a pleasant day outside, but when their operations require it. And as a result, we've been extremely successful in competing in those environments.

As to the size of the operation, the number of opportunities are growing dramatically, dramatically. We started with one customer in Alaska. So, but they're growing by quite a bit based on the success in the first year. I still don't expect that to transition into meaningful revenue contributions yet this year. We're still – in each one of these new organizations, we'll be working with them for the first time as they evaluate how they integrate this capability into their operation. As I mentioned in my call earlier, BP is moving forward to add new services and to overtly move to integrate these services into regular operations, and I think that's very positive. And it supports our view that there's significant economic return for customers that adopt this capability.
Tyler E. Hojo - Sidoti & Co. LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks, Tim. And just a second question if I may. Just on the R&D line of questioning earlier, could you maybe just talk a little bit about how early on or where you think you are in this kind of development spending curve? Is it early? Should we kind of expect kind of elevated levels to persist for some time? Just some general comments there would be helpful.
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, if you recall, when we initiated our plan for fiscal 2015 and announced our intent to make significant investments in R&D and in SG&A to position ourselves for these three emerging markets, the majority of our investments was anticipated to be in research and development for the new solutions optimized for these applications. And that is turning out to be the case. Most of our investments are in R&D and a lesser amount in SG&A. We're behind our plan year-to-date in our R&D investments. We're trying to play catch up in Q4. To the extent that we don't complete all of the R&D investments that we had planned for fiscal 2015 and they continue – as they look right now, they continue to look like they are necessary and appropriate for optimally positioning for these opportunities, then we'll probably move that incremental amount into the first part of 2016.
Beyond what we had planned for 2015, it'll – I think the situation will remain open for analysis and reaction to what customers decide to do and what the timing of adoption looks like as it evolves. It's a constantly-moving target. And when and if we see the acceleration of adoption that would call for increased investment to maximize the stockholder returns that we can get from capturing a market position there, we'll clearly look seriously at that. But that will be sometime in 2016. And we may or may not know anymore as we talk about our plan for 2016 when we present that to you next call.

Thank you. And the next question is from Josephine Millward of Benchmark Company. Your line is open.
Josephine L. Millward - The Benchmark Co. LLC
Hi, Tim.
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hello, Josephine.
Josephine L. Millward - The Benchmark Co. LLC
Tim, given the limited visibility you have on the fiscal year 2016 budget requests, what do you see as the biggest drivers for AV in the coming year? Is it international? Is it the Switchblade? And do you expect the DoD to continue to upgrade those small UAS fleet?
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think the answer to all three of those questions will be yes, Josephine. Our pipeline and our activities in international business development indicate strong and growing demand. As I mentioned in my comments, the timing of contract processing for international orders is a little more difficult to be accurate about. But clearly the pipeline is there, and we think that will continue to grow. Interest and demand for Switchblade is increasing. We have obvious constraints in the budget, and it's a new program that needs to get adjudicated across theaters. But I think the demand for Switchblade itself, the strong interest in the variants that we're developing for Switchblade and the growing support within the army for a program of record for LMAMS are all positive indicators for future demand.

As to the small UAS that you mentioned, I think the sustainment activities are likely to continue. There are other programs that appear to be driving upgrade demands in small UAS across DoD. And we have the new CPDs in both the Army and the Marine Corps for the family of small UAS that we think, although we don't know the specific timing of that, we expect to continue to see that to generating demand for Puma AE, Wasp AE and others in the future.
Josephine L. Millward - The Benchmark Co. LLC
Tim, a follow-up on that. Can you expand on this U.S.-India technology transfer initiative? It seems like the Indian papers are talking about joint production of the Raven perhaps later this year and a multi-billion dollar pipeline. Can you give us a little more on that?
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll mostly reiterate the comments I made during my previous comments, and if that isn't adequate, then I'll follow up later. This is a strategic initiative between the governments of the United States and India, that's a joint defense technology transfer agreement. And this project for small UAS is the first pathfinder project along the way of what is anticipated to be a broad and growing defense technology agreement. The initial intent of this project is for AeroVironment and our partner Dynamatic's that we signed an MOU with in 2013 for the purpose of pursuing small UAS in India, and for the two companies to do a joint development and production program of a next-generation small unmanned airplane system.
We're applying all of our technology and knowhow to this program. And our – Dynamatic's will apply their technology, their knowhow and their extensive aerospace manufacturing capability within India as we jointly develop this and then produce this in India. The initial intent of that production capability of this new design will be to address what we believe is a large demand within the Indian government. There's, I believe, something like 550 brigades in the Indian Army, which is one of the largest in the world, plus other police requirements. So, the potential requirement is quite large.
The interest at the highest levels of the government seems to be real and on point. So we're in the process now of working with Dynamatic's, with the U.S. government and with the Indian government to finalize the terms of how we would structure this agreement and how we would move forward. And as we get that finalized and begin actually moving, then we'll report more to you.

Thank you. The next question is from Troy Jensen of Piper. Your line is open.
Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Hey, yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Tim, just to put some numbers behind those R&D comments, so $8.6 million in the January quarter should go to $13 million? I'm assuming there's no externally funded R&D to offset that.
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
That's our target. And you could hopefully hear me hedging that a little bit. That's what we want to do. That's what we're planning on doing. And we have ongoing competition with our customer-funded R&D to accomplish it with the same resources. But that looks like an achievable plan at this early point in the quarter.
Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay. Understood. And then on the R&D spend, are you guys doing any development in data analytics outside of capturing video, just to process and interpret what the camera sees (42:53)?
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Excuse me. I missed the first part of the question, Troy. Could you try that again?
Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Yeah. Just on the R&D spending. Is any of it going towards data analytics?

Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Oh. Yes. Yep, in terms of the R&D that's being applied towards our growth opportunities, it includes UAV platforms, payloads and the data analytics associated with much of the actionable intelligence intent of our commercial solution.
Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
All right. Understood. Last question and I'll cede the floor. With the proposed rules for UAVs, just curious to know if you think that the line of sight, there's going to be any type of constraints to growth here?
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, to the extent that the existing constraint on line of sight stays in place, it does clearly limit the potential benefit that customers can achieve from these solutions. As I mentioned in my comments, we believe that a properly-defined solution with properly trained and certified operators can safely operate beyond line of sight. And I think there's probably room for ongoing discussion with this. Clearly, the FAA's intent is safety in the national air space. And there are huge potential economic benefits to optimizing these solutions. So we'll continue to work with the FAA and with our providing optimized design solutions to maximize safety in that environment.

Thank you. The next question is from Greg Konrad of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC
Good evening. I just wanted to go back to commercial UAVs. It seems like you're making some progress with BP and you mentioned that you had a bunch of other RFPs out there. So obviously without blanket rules in place, you have some flexibility to kind of go after commercial business. When these rules finally do get in place, what are kind of the biggest markets that open up after versus kind of some of the things you can do on a one-off basis today?
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, we've been focusing, as we've described, primarily on large industrial markets that by nature are global, oil and gas, for example, agriculture, for example. Both of those appear at this point to offer very large global opportunities, and in both cases, the use of unmanned aircraft to capture digital data, process that data to generate concise actionable information that significantly improves the safety and the economics of the operation of the enterprise and as a result delivers significant return on investment. To the extent that that continues to be validated as we roll out these solutions with those and other industries like that, then these large projections of economic activity associated with commercial UAS seem quite plausible to me.
Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC
And then just to go back to electric vehicle charging, have you seen any impact in the business from gas prices? I know they've obviously been fairly volatile. And then just kind of the follow-up to that. Over the past three years, you've announced a number of kind of preferred relationships with different models of electric vehicle. What type of take rate are you seeing on that to help us kind of correlate sales of these vehicles kind of with AVAV products?
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, we've had quite a difficulty in getting an accurate tie with EV sales and our attach rate because the mechanism for selling the chargers is not directly with the car. But consumers make their decision for charging infrastructure independent, and they make it in – with – not necessarily in the same timeframe. So, I don't have an accurate answer for our attach rate with you. We have clearly seen a decline in the last couple of months in the sale of plug-in electric vehicles. It's very early and it's hard to make a – determine what the correlation is with the price of gasoline. But one would suspect that higher gas prices would motivate higher EV sales. But I think it will be a few more months at the minimum before anyone makes an informed correlation decision there.

Thank you. The next question is from Michael Ciarmoli of KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hi. Good evening, again, Kevin. Just a quick follow-up. Tim, just wondering what drove the increase in customer-funded R&D in the quarter. Was it – it seems like it was unexpected and I'm just wondering what kind of drove that.
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I don't think it was necessarily unexpected, Kevin. But there are multiple projects being funded by customers, most of which I will leave for the customers to announce. The nature of customer-funded R&D often can be sensitive competitive information, although the largest piece of that is the TERN program.
Kevin Ciabattoni - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay, great. Thanks. That's all I have.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Joe DeNardi of Stifel. Your line is open.
Joe W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hey. Good evening. Tim, I'm wondering if you could talk about, given some of the issues or maybe the headwinds you're having with the EES business, does that business still make sense to have within AeroVironment? Maybe what are some of the synergies that flow through to the UAV business? And do you see that as an impediment to a potential acquirer not necessarily wanting the EES business?
Timothy E. Conver - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Joe, we've got three product lines within EES. We have a leading market share position in each of those. Currently, the EV test product line is in decline. That's kind of a post-stimulus environment of over-capacity generated by the stimulus, and it hasn't really grown back yet. The electric vehicle industrial charging market is actually a growth opportunity of electric forklifts and other EV vehicles are continuing to gain share over IC engines. And we do have a strong position in North America in charging infrastructure for plug-in electric vehicles. That's not yet a significant revenue generator. But it has the potential to be very significant if and when the adoption rate of plug-in vehicles reaches even single-digit penetration in the overall car market. We don't expect that's likely to happen within the next few years. Or we do expect it will happen maybe within three years to five years.
Overall, we have – we think given the strong position we have and the potential growth in those markets, it's a good option to have in the enterprise. There is a lot of synergy in the underlying technology. Both businesses are essentially focused on electric vehicles and much of the core technology in electric vehicles resides in our EES system. And we leverage the same kind of production and program management and strategic practices and systems across both. In general, the – owning and managing the EES segment has not been a diversion from the other growth opportunities in the UAS system. And we've always felt that if and when that happens, then we would reassess this.
Joe W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Tim.

Timothy E. Conver
Thank you, Steve. The AeroVironment team made great progress on our business objectives in fiscal 2015. Our results are best summarized by the two following achievements: first, our strong core business delivered the revenue we expected and exceeded expectations for profitability. Second, our growth portfolio advanced through careful strategic investments that improved our position for large new market opportunities.
More broadly we strengthened our market leadership positions, moved key programs forward to generate long-term value, reinforced our strategic plan and continue to extend our track record of successfully driving innovation.
Today I'll summarize our fiscal 2015 by first reviewing our financial performance and achievements during the quarter and the year and then discussing our operating performance in our core business and in our growth portfolio. Teresa Covington will provide a detailed overview of our financials before our share -- our outlook and goals for fiscal 2016 and then we will take your questions.
Now our financial results. Our fourth quarter revenue was $86 million, an 18% year-over-year increase. Gross margin in the quarter increased by 50% year-over-year and fully diluted earnings per share were $0.31. Our fiscal year 2015 revenue of $259 million was just about at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range of $250 million to $270 million, and was up 3% year-over-year.

Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the year was 40%, well above our guidance range of 34.5% to 37.5%. We are pleased to report that even after making the incremental investments we plan for the year, the strong gross margin produced an operating profit of $2 million which translates to fully diluted EPS of $0.13.
Total cash equivalents and investments increased by over $27 million, up 11% year-over-year. Ending funded backlog was $64.7 million compared to $65.9 million to prior year. In our core business, we reported another year of revenue in line with projected growth targets and our team delivered strong gross profits.
Briefly I’d like to provide additional context to the accounting restatement referenced in our press release. This matter related to accounting for amortization of the premium of held-to-maturity bonds and had no impact on our balance sheet income statement or on net cash flow. Teresa will provide more details in her prepared remarks.
Now let’s review our operating performance in fiscal 2015, starting with our efficient energy system segment or EES, where we maintained market leadership positions in all three product lines, electric vehicle or EV test systems, industrial EV charging solutions, and passenger EV charging solutions.
In our EV test system product line, we introduced the next generation of smart EV test systems last September with the AV-900 EX, capable of more varied and accurate testing and scalable from 250 kilowatts to more than 1 megawatt. We believe our current and prospective customers will embrace this new capability and the EV testings market.
In our industrial EV charging business, we continue to serve our customers in airports, vehicle manufacturing, distribution, consumer goods and industrial product markets, while engaging with new global enterprise customers for potential expansion. We expect industrial EVs to continue to gain market share from fossil fuel vehicles.
In passenger EV charging solutions, we’ve deployed nearly 25,000 level 2 charge docks throughout North America.
We’ve significantly differentiated our market leading technology with our portable TurboCord Dual voltage charging system, which we launched in January of 2014.
At the beginning of our fiscal 2016, Volvo became the first automaker to include TurboCord as standard equipment with the delivery of its plug in vehicles. This important development highlights TurboCord’s value in a global OEM solution and establishes an important new distribution channel for us. We hope to secure additional TurboCord in the trunk OEM adoption.
This January we introduced TurboDock level 2 workplace charging system with Bluetooth connectivity TurboDock provides access control charging at lower cost than celluar-based networks. We see great potential for growth in the workplace and commercial market segments with this product.
And now let’s turn to operating performance in our unmanned aircraft system segment where we focus on global defense in commercial markets with unmanned airplane systems or UAS, tactical missile systems, large UAS and commercial UAS. I will update you on each of these areas separately starting with small UAS.
In our core small UAS business, we remain the market leader with the largest installed base in the global defense industry in a very active development portfolio. Our battle proven Puma became the first small UAS approved by the FAA for commercial operations, demonstrating how our core technology delivers value across defense and commercial markets.
AeroVironment developed and introduce the concept of a family of small UAS with differentiated platforms optimized for different missions and interoperable with the common ground control system, data link, user interface, training, support and all environment capabilities.

All environment reference to the unique capability of these airplanes to regularly land in salt water, in addition to landing on the ground and is designated by the suffix AE. This family of small UAS is unique to AeroVironment and is another growing differentiator for our solutions.
Last year the Army and the Marine Corps each defined their next generation small UAS requirements as a family of systems, and both are built almost entirely around AeroVironment solutions. The army defined a new micro UAS as part of its system requirements and our Shrike vertical take off and landing or VTOL solution is well positioned for that requirement when the army decides to initiate a procurement.
In fiscal 2015, we’ve supported the army’s large installed base of Raven and Puma systems with sustainment orders and performance improvements upgrades. We expect sustainment revenue for maintaining and upgrading our large and growing fleet of systems supplied across all military services to continue to be an important ongoing component of our business.
The Marine Corps began procurement of their new small UAS requirements with Wasp AE systems in fiscal ’25 -- fiscal 2015 and is evaluating additional Puma AE procurement. The U.S navy shows great potential as the next market to begin adoption of small UAS. Our all-environment and enhanced ship deck landing capability are unique and compelling for navy applications. In fact, the navy recently conducted successful evaluations of our Puma AE and procured their first systems.
International demand for small UAS continues to grow with multiple acquisition programs moving forward on independent, but hard to predict timelines. For example, the Australian Defense Force recently began training on its new Wasp AE systems. These international programs include significant opportunities emerging in India with our Dynamatics MoU, and in Turkey with our Altoy joint venture.
We remain in a strong position to fulfill established and emerging needs for small UAS to support United States and allied forces, as well as any urgent needs that may develop in an increasingly uncertain world.
And now I will discuss our fiscal 2015 investments and how they improved our competitive position across the three areas within our growth portfolio. Innovation is at the core of our business model and strategic investments will position AeroVironment for continued success and value creation.
During fiscal 2015, we invested $46 million in internal research and development or R&D. Each about $26 million of that amount or 10% of revenue was used to support our core business and the additional $20 million was strategic investment into our growth portfolio.
In addition, we spend $25 million performing customer funded R&D for a total of $71 million in research and development invested primarily in UAS and tactical missile system technology. We think our investment in new UAS solutions and our deep understanding of the industry represents a strategic advantage in the race to deliver next generation solutions to customers, build market leadership and deliver return on invested capital.
We said at the beginning of last year, investments throughout fiscal 2015 in Tactical Missile Systems, Global Observer and Commercial UAS would position AeroVironment to lead when adoption accelerates and would generate significant value in the near and long-term, and we continue to believe that.
These investments yielded the intended results to better position us for the specific Tactical Missile Systems and Global Observer adoption opportunities that we can now continue to pursue within our normal incremental investments -- within our normal and without incremental investments. Building out enterprise solutions for large commercial market UAS adoption however will require continued investment this year.

In tactical missile systems we have been delivering Switchblade systems and generating revenue from hardware sales, customer support and R&D for the last few years. We applied incremental fiscal 2015 investment to develop and demonstrate new Switchblade variants that customers have requested as a result of seeing Switchblades unique capabilities. These variants have now demonstrated and been deployed from ground, air and sea platforms.
Additionally we prepared for a pending Army program of record for LMAMS by developing advanced capabilities for Switchblade. We did develop three separate customer funded Switchblade variants in fiscal 2015, and all demonstrations met or exceeded customer expectations. We co-funded these developments with AeroVironment R&D investment as I outlined earlier which proved essential in successfully driving all three opportunities forward.
As a direct result of these successes to date, we are confident that at least one of these variants will produce significant product revenue in fiscal 2016. We expect the other two likely will receive additional customer funding to proceed in fiscal 2016. We are optimistic that continued success in these programs will accelerate adoption of a family of Tactical Missile Systems and drive significant revenue growth.
A Program Objective Memorandum or POM is the recommendation of an armed service on how they plan to allocate resources for a program over the next five year planning cycle. We believe the LMAMS program of record has not yet been included in the Army fiscal ’17 POM, which will likely move a start of that program of record out by one or two years. However we think this can actually have a positive outcome for us. It provides the opportunity for Switchblade as the only deployed solution to continue satisfying multiple procurement opportunities prior to program of record.
Last year we combined our Global Observer Solution for High Altitude Long Endurance or HALE UAS and our current solution for Medium Altitude Long Endurance or MALE UAS to form our large UAS business area. Our strategic investments in fiscal 2015 ensured we are well positioned for both Global Observer and current Phase III opportunities and we anticipate the ongoing pursuit of programs in both categories in our fiscal 2016 base plan. We remain engaged in active teaming and MOU agreements and customer discussions for Global Observer adoption by allied governments.
TERN represents the next generation category of MALE UAS for operation from small naval vessels. We with our industry leading partners remained focused on executing our Phase II TERN program with DARPA. We are committed to delivering the most capable and effective solution and competing to secure an anticipated Phase III contract later this year.
Our third area of strategic investment in fiscal 2015 was in developing a new business in Commercial UAS. Here we are developing both hardware and software solutions to deliver powerful insights on demand that will support confident decision making for improved enterprise performance. Our investments in Commercial UAS include pilot programs with lead adopters in large markets like our service agreement with BP.
These customer engagements are delivering important successes and valuable learning and are expanding in terms of applications, customer and industry verticals. The FAA’s issuance of Section 333 exemptions for our Puma AE and VTOL UAS provide us with increased flexibility to conduct customer demonstrations and commercials services supporting our market entry strategy and exposing more potential customers to our differentiated offering.
In fiscal 2016, we will lead to continue to invest to position AeroVironment for leadership in commercial UAS solution adoption. We will continue to develop the hardware, back-office and customer facing software to optimize our solution for maximum customer value. We will work closely with lead customers to refine the winning solutions for what we believe is a large and dynamic global opportunity. And for our shareholders we are confident that this will lead to enhance value. Our team has substantial innovation capacity and is developing a compelling small UAS platform for broad commercial appeal.

In FY 2015, we executed our plan and achieved the financial operating and new opportunity positioning goals we had established. Our team developed and maintained strong relationships with customers continued our leadership position in our core business markets and developed strong positions for future leadership positions in the large new market opportunities we’re pursuing. We also made several leadership changes to optimize our management resources for scaling into large new opportunities.
Wahid Nawabi was appointed Chief Operating Officer. Roy Minson took on a new Commercial UAS strategy position and Kirk Flittie and Ken Karklin have been promoted into the business segment general management roles. And now Teresa will discuss our fourth quarter and full fiscal 2015 financials.
Teresa P. Covington
Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. AeroVironment's fiscal 2015 fourth quarter results are as follows. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $86.5 million, an increase of $13 million or 18% as compared to $73.5 million a year ago. Looking at revenue by segment, UAS revenue was $78.7 million, an increase of $18.7 million or 31% compared to last year. The increase was primarily due to higher product deliveries of $9.1 million, higher customer funded R&D work of $12.7 million, offset with lower service revenue of $3.1 million. EES revenue decreased $5.7 million or 42% to $7.8 million in the fourth quarter. This decrease was primarily due to lower product deliveries of our industrial EV charging solutions.
Turning to gross margin, gross margin for the fourth quarter was $45.4 million, an increase of $15.2 million as compared to $30.1 million in the prior year. By segment UAS gross margin increased $16.8 million or 66% to $42.3 million in the quarter. The increase was primarily due to favorable product mix. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin for UAS increased from 42% to 54%. EES gross margin decreased $1.6 million or 35% to $3 million in the quarter, primarily due to lower sales. As a percentage of revenue, EES gross margin increased from 35% to 39%.
SG&A expense for the fourth quarter was $15.6 million or 18% of revenue compared to SG&A expense of $17 million or 23% of revenue in the prior year. R&D investments for the fourth quarter were $22.3 million or 26% of revenue compared to R&D investments of $6.2 million or 8% of revenue in the prior year.
Operating income for the fourth quarter was $7.5 million or 9% of revenue compared to prior year operating income of $6.9 million or 9% of revenue. Operating income was higher primarily due to higher sales and gross margin. Other expense net for the quarter was $0.5 million compared to the prior year other income net of $2.9 million. Other income was lower primarily due to the prior year gain related to our convertible notes investment. No convertible notes were held in the fourth quarter of this year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was minus 1.2%, a decrease from the prior year of 18.2%.
Net income for the quarter was $7.1 million or $0.31 per diluted share compared to the net income of $8.1 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the convertible bond and related equity investment, fourth quarter EPS would have been $0.32 per diluted share compared to $0.27 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. We have provided an EPS reconciliation table in the press release.
Now moving quickly through the fully year fiscal ‘15 results. Revenue for the year was $259.4 million, an increase of $7.7 million or 3% as compared to $251.7 million in the prior year. UAS revenue increased $12.1 million or 6% to $221 million, primarily due to higher product deliveries of $12.2 million and higher customer funded R&D work of $8.6 million, offset by lower service revenue of $8.6 million.

EES revenue decreased $4.4 million or 10% of $38.4 million, primarily due to lower product delivery of our industrial EV charging solutions and lower passenger EV charging solutions.
Gross margin for the year was $104.3 million, as compared to $93.6 million in the prior year. This represents an increase of $10.7 million or 11%. UAS gross margin increased a $11.9 million or 15% to $92.7 million. The increase was primarily due to favorable product mix. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin for UAS increased from 39% to 42%.EES gross margin decreased $1.2 million or 10% to $11.6 million, primarily due to lower sales volume. As a percentage of revenue, EES gross margin remained at 30%.
SG&A expense for the year was $55.8 million or 21% of revenue compared to $55.7 million or 22% of revenue in the prior year. R&D investments for the year were $46.5 million or 18% of revenue compared to R&D investments of $25.5 million or 10% of revenue in the prior year.
Operating income for the year was $2 million or 1% of revenue compared to operating income of $12.4 million or 5% of revenue last year. Other expense net for the year was $0.1 million compared to the prior year other income net of $2.5 million. Other income was higher in the prior year primarily due to the gain related to the conversion feature of our convertible notes investment. The effective tax rate for the year was minus 52.9%, compared to the effective tax rate from prior year of 7.9%.
Net income for the year was $2.9 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to the net income of $13.7 million or $0.60 per diluted share last year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the convertible bond and related equity investment, EPS would have been $0.13 per diluted share compared to earnings of $0.56 per diluted share in the prior year. Looking at backlog, funded backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $64.7 million, down $1.2 million or 2% from April 30, 2014.
Turning to our balance sheet, cash equivalents and investments at the end of the fourth quarter totaled $275.6 million, up $17.4 million from the prior quarter. The increase in cash equivalents and investments was driven by lower working capital needs and higher income.
Turning to receivables at the end of the fourth quarter, our accounts receivable, including unbilled receivables, totaled $51 million, up $5 million from the prior quarter. Total days sales outstanding was at approximately 53 days compared to 61 days at the end of the prior quarter.
Taking a look at inventory, inventories were $39.4 million at the end of the quarter compared to $48.8 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days in inventory were approximately 86 days compared to 106 days at the end of the prior quarter.
Turning to capital expenditures, in the fourth quarter, we invested approximately $3 million, or 3% of revenue in property improvements and capital equipment. AV recognized $2 million of depreciation in the quarter. For the full-year, we invested approximately $5.3 million or 2% of revenue in property improvements and capital equipment and recognized $8.4 million of depreciation and amortization.
During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended April 30, 2015, we identified a presentation error in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2013 and 2014 and for the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015. The amortization of premiums related to held-to-maturity investments was presented within the investing activity section rather than the operating activity section of our consolidated statements of cash flows.
We corrected the error by restating those prior financial statements in the notes included in our Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2015. The error did not impact our consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statements or the overall change in cash flow for any of those periods.

Now an update to our fiscal ’16 visibility. As of today, we have fourth quarter ending backlog that we can execute in fiscal ’15 of $61 million. We had various orders; we’ve booked to date in the first quarter of $19 million. Incremental revenues to hold EES revenues flat year-over-year $38 million. And finally the balance of the government fiscal 2015 that we have not booked yet of $43 million. This adds up to $162 million or 60% at midpoint of revenue guidance.
Now I'd like to turn things back to Tim to discuss AV's expectations for fiscal ’16.
Timothy E. Conver
Thank you, Teresa. We’ve a strong position in our core small UAS and efficient energy systems business, as demonstrated by our leading market share and ongoing competitive success. The core business has strong profitability as evidenced by our gross profit and the markets for both segments suggest long-term growth trends.
We anticipate single-digit growth in our core business this fiscal year and continued opportunity for long-term growth. But our growth strategy for AV goes far beyond our core business. In our growth portfolio, our 2015 incremental investments solidified the positions we’ve been building to compete for and capture identified tactical missile systems, Global Observer, and MALE UAS opportunities.
We expect contract decisions on each of these opportunities are likely to be decided over the next 24 months. Each of these three opportunities represents initial adoption into potential billion dollar markets. With the strong positions we’ve established last year, we can fund the ongoing pursuit of these new significant opportunities as well as support growth in our core business without incremental IR&D and SG&A spending levels this year.
Building the strong position we want in the very large commercial UAS market opportunity that we believe is emerging, will require incremental investment in both IR&D and SG&A this year. We intend to invest this year to develop enterprise solutions for global vertical markets including energy and agriculture and an innovative commercial small UAS.
Third-party forecasters project billion dollar market growth in commercial UAS. Our potential return on investment could be very large with success in this opportunity, but we will need to invest prudently now or risk missing a wave of adoption.
These incremental investments in commercial UAS market solutions could offset much of the operating profit, our core business would otherwise generate this year, resulting reduced or possibly no operating profit in fiscal 2016. As a result, we will guide profitability for FY2016 at a gross profit margin level. With that background, we expect fiscal 2016 revenue of between $260 million and $280 million and gross profit margin between 36% and 37.5%.
We will maintain focus and visibility on the underlying gross profit, competitive effectiveness and revenue growth of our core business throughout FY16, while we pursue key new opportunities in tactical missile systems and large UAS. We will prudently manage gated investment decisions to develop winning solutions for our new commercial UAS business.
We see a future full of opportunities to drive shareholder value through success in these new markets. We built our core business by developing innovative new solutions and we’re familiar with the process of new market adoption. We will remain constructively engaged with lead adopting customers which positions us to make informed decisions on investments in order to be first to market with the right solution.
As new opportunities develop in these dynamic emerging markets, we will continue to be guided by optimizing our return on invested capital and maximizing shareholder value.
There are numerous specifics regarding our innovative solutions for these new opportunities that we cannot discuss in order to maintain a competitive advantage or because of customer confidentiality agreements. To the extend that these constrains ease in the future, we will share these bold and innovative solutions with you.

Across our business, our technology solutions are designed to bring our current and our future customers the confidence to proceed in the complex and uncertain world in which they operate. Others have recognized our performance with Aviation Week selecting us as the top performing company in the $250 million to $1 billion revenue category. This recognition reflects the quality and the performance of our people.
From design engineering to production, from procurement to sales, our people strive everyday to do what's right for our customers and our shareholders. As always, thank you to the members of the AeroVironment team whose creativity, passion and grip turns bold ideas into compelling value propositions for our customer’s. To those customers who place their trust in us and to you on this call for your interest in AeroVironment.
Teresa and I will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrea James with Dougherty & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Andrea James
Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Can you touch upon …?
Timothy E. Conver
Hi, Andrea.
Andrea James
Hi. You touched upon this in your opening remarks. So I was hoping if you could go a bit deeper. You said you’re expecting single digit growth in your core business. And I guess that accounts for all of the guidance. So I just want to make sure it does the FY ’16 guidance imply any recognized revenue growth against Switchblade Commercial UAS or Global Observer?
Timothy E. Conver
Well Andrea, I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks are observed that we have been delivering revenue from Switchblade programs for the last few years, that’s a combination of hardware deliveries, customer funded R&D and services. So, certainly ongoing revenue from Switchblade in fact probably growing revenue from Switchblade this year. In terms of Global Observer, we don’t have Global Observer revenue built into our core plan. I did mention that we expect the first opportunity for a contract decision on Global Observer from a foreign government within the next 24 months back to predicting the timing of adoption of innovation being difficult.
Andrea James
Okay. And then, I guess I’ll just throw this out there, because it was in the news this week. Do you have any thoughts on the board structure in light of the activist letter that kind of made the rounds?
Timothy E. Conver
Well we haven’t responded to that letter at this point. As always we continue to welcome open communication with all of our shareholders and we value the input that is particularly direct towards enhancing shareholder value. So, we’ll continue to make all of our decisions around the business from a management and a board level with the focus on strong corporate governance and maximizing shareholder value.
Andrea James
Thank you. I’ll hop back in the queue.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Troy Jensen with Piper. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Troy Jensen
Hi, congrats on the nice quarter and the margins.
Timothy E. Conver
Thank you.
Troy Jensen
Just to follow-up a little bit on the commercial opportunities here. Do you think you’d be selling military quality UAVs in the commercial applications or do you plan on like a new line of hardware to get into the commercial space or will you guys entrance be more on the services side like you’re doing with BP?
Timothy E. Conver
We have a primary focus on enterprise solutions that would address large global vertical markets like energy, like agriculture and our experience to date has brought us down to a business model that we’re developing that would comprise capturing data from small unmanned aircraft and that amounts to specific and sometime specialized payloads on small UAS platforms that we think will be optimized for these enterprise solutions in industrial markets. So probably a long way of saying that our target solution would be built around platforms that would be optimized for commercial applications rather than military applications.

Troy Jensen
Right.
Timothy E. Conver
Beyond that collection of course we’ve got a lot of data analytics and software presentation capability to close the loop on an actionable information enterprise solution. The entry into our engagement with commercial customers however has been based on applying our previously developed and proven small UAS from the military and Puma being the first FAA certified small UAS for commercial applications has been a great help in working with BP and others in that area.
Troy Jensen
And so, if I could follow-up with a couple of questions for Teresa here mainly on the model and mainly on the expense side. I understand you kind of talked about the investments maybe offsetting the operating profits, but if we just look at the R&D, I mean it was up significantly here in April quarter, how do we think about modeling that on a quarterly basis through 2016? And you maybe touched on SG&A it spiked up a bit here, does it grow from this level or was there some onetime stuff in the fiscal fourth quarter?
Timothy E. Conver
The R&D in Q4 was abnormally high from our prior run rate and is not a level that we expect to maintain going forward. We were closing out a year of incremental investment to position ourselves in these new markets and we got off to a bit of a late start and a strong finish.
Troy Jensen
But I guess, I was wanting Teresa -- or for Teresa specifically that we’re too much into the quarter, so you’ve got to have a fairly good grasp on what your R&D expense should look like this quarter. So could you just kind of give us a range of where you think that number will be?
Teresa P. Covington
I think the R&D for the first quarter, if you exclude the fourth quarter from 2015; the range for R&D will be in the range of the quarters from fiscal ’15, quarters one, two and three.
Troy Jensen
So you’re talking $7 million to $8.5 million roughly on a quarterly basis.
Teresa P. Covington
Correct.
Troy Jensen
But you said excluding July quarter, most of that would -- might be at a higher level?
Teresa P. Covington
As Tim mentioned, the fourth quarter was abnormally high at $22 million. Our first three quarters of fiscal ’15 were closer to our historic levels in terms of R&D investment.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Peter Arment
Hi, yes. I guess, just to follow-on on that Tim. The last couple of years you’ve kind of had a revenue base that kind of was 40% in the first half of the fiscal year and kind of 60% in the second half of the year. With the guidance range you put out and obviously there’s a lot of moving parts and I don’t want to have any doubt on any of it, but how do we think about kind of the revenue progression throughout the year?
Timothy E. Conver
I think the best -- a good way to approach that is just looking at those historic patterns that you mentioned. We have been about 60% in the first half -- 40% in the first half, and 60% in the second half. Even as we look at 2016, Q1 this year probably looks a lot like Q1 last year.
Peter Arment
Okay. That’s helpful. And then Tim, if I could ask you about, in terms of your building cash position. You guys continue to obviously generate a lot of cash and make the necessary internal investments on these, a lot of these growth opportunities. But at what point do we, either the cash just for term record, shareholders or you see an external use for where you’re going to look to acquire or something. Can you give us a little color on your thoughts on that? Thank you.
Timothy E. Conver
Yes, absolutely. The management and the board are regularly looking at capital allocation and evaluating options for return on invested capital. To date, we have continued to look at that in the terms of primarily these very large growth opportunities that we are pursuing and that we’ve been talking about today in positioning for multiple new market opportunities that have billion dollar potential. Our investments to date have primarily been in, on the income statement to position ourselves for those markets. When those markets adopt, we expect the likelihood and historically we have seen the necessity to increase our investments to ensure adoption. And once they have adopted and begin to scale across an industry, if we then have proven -- if it then proves to be the kind of large opportunity we believed, we will either be displacing or attracting the largest competitors in the space. Which means, we will have to move with great agility and make meaningful investments to secure a leading position in order to deliver the return to our stock holders that we have been investment for all these years. That ability to move with agility is significantly enabled by the cash on the balance sheet and that’s what has driven our structure to date. At some time in the future, if in the context of those compelling returns on executing our plan, the board -- if the board ever determines that we continue -- that we, in that time have excess cash then obviously we will consider other uses of that cash.

Peter Arment
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bobby Burleson with Canaccord. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Bobby Burleson
Hi. This is a question for Tim. I was curious when I look at the opportunity for Commercial UAS, can you talk about additional investments in enterprise solutions. How much is data analytics part of that investment in developing your own proprietary data analytics? And how long could you sustain that investment, if you’re looking at energy and agriculture and maybe other verticals, how much re-use do you get out of what you developed for one?
Timothy E. Conver
Data analytics, we believe will be a significant element of that system solution that we intent to deliver and that we believe will be the basis of the winning solution. To date we have addressed that with the combination of internal development and extensive use of external partners. So I think we will continue that approach. We do not intend to build out everything from scratch. So wherever possible as we have to date, we’ll engage with the existing enterprises that have large and optimized solutions much like we’ve done in addressing the multiple applications with BP on the North Slope. So its -- I don’t know if that fully answered your question, but I’ll wait to have you follow-up.
Bobby Burleson
No, that definitely helps. So you obviously don’t want to compete with your customer lets say in the agricultural space it sounds like.
Timothy E. Conver
No. But the agricultural vertical at least this much if not more so than energy is, is a pretty complex set of opportunities that runs through across the growers operation and precedes it and follows they proved after that leaves the grower. So it’s a pretty interesting opportunity rich new frontier I believe.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Greg Konrad
Good afternoon. I was hoping just to start on the EV business. I looked at EES in the quarter, it was down a bit. I think you said some of that was the industrial business. When I think about the past couple of years, you’ve announced a number of agreements with electric cars for, on the charger side. Can you maybe discuss a little bit what type of take rate you’re seeing there, and some of the larger opportunities to announce other agreements with OEs?
Timothy E. Conver
Well we do have a half a dozen relationships with some of the largest auto manufactures in the world. They’re a very important part of our business strategy. One of our channels for distribution of our charging systems is through the dealer networks of those OEMs. We think it’s particularly important that we’ve been able to announce this recent adoption of Volvo of TurboCord that now included TurboCord with the delivery of their plug-in vehicles that will begin with their premium model launch in North America later this year. That’s an entirely new distribution channel. It has the potential to grow across we believe other OEMs. It seems to us like a compelling advantage to consumers. And that channel has the ability to significantly lever volume, because it comes with the car when the consumer buys it.
Greg Konrad
That makes sense. And then just to follow-up on cash, you had a very good conversion rate this year and it seems like inventories came down quite a bit. What should we expect going forward and kind of given the growth expectations of ’16, should we expect working capital to come up a bit from ’15?
Timothy E. Conver
I think the biggest -- we were very focused on driving that inventory number down this year. That inventory number peaked a couple of years ago and it’s been a priority for the -- the operating management team to get to the target that they achieved at the end of the fourth quarter. I think at this point going forward, it would be a good assumption to just plan on us keeping the same kind of rations as we move along with growing revenue.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Michael Ciarmoli
Hi, good evening guys. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, you kind of mentioned it before, I mean in terms of creating shareholder value, I mean what do you think you guys might be doing wrong? The playbook you guys have now, I guess its still -- it’s still generally similar to the S1 filed nine years ago. There’s a lot of growth opportunities, earnings aren’t growing. It seems like the commercial market to some extent is passing you guys by when you look at DJI or what GoPro wants to do, Google and Amazon I mean, I don’t -- do you think the market really cares about exquisite optimized solutions or do they just want cheap drones with off the shelf analytics out there. Just trying to get a sense, from a strategic standpoint and a shareholder value standpoint, what you guys are thinking out there. Because it just seems like some of that first mover advantage has kind of eroded on you guys?
Timothy E. Conver
Well we’ve talked about multiple market opportunities. You’re addressing the commercial UAS market opportunity explicitly Michael, and I think the -- we continue to see a very large opportunity with the major organizations in large verticals that I described. Now that’s quite different than the market for consumer quadcopters that you’re addressing and certainly that’s generated a lot of market cap and a lot of initial investment that’s been publicized in the last few months. Nevertheless we believe that our validation with large industrial users of this enterprise model is going to produce a significant opportunity that we continue to pursue. Outside of the commercial UAS market, we’ve been pursuing global observer and mail and tactical missile system market opportunities and we see beginning last year significant increased adoption activity from customers that activity has sustained and increased over the last year and we’re now in a position to be able to look at likely contract decisions in those three areas this year and next year that if made positively would signal the adoption of billion dollar potential markets with these new solutions. So I think we have proven the underlying truth of the statement we’ve made for many years that it’s hard to predict the timing and the rate of adoption of innovations.
Michael Ciarmoli
Got it. Even on something like, I mean, you mentioned and I mentioned each AI the quadcopters, are you -- you’ve got the Shrike product, you guys probably could have attack that market first, I mean, is there -- when you guys look at your product roadmap and kind of or do you think you’re at the right price points, to spark this adoption or is it still too early, too tough to tell?
Timothy E. Conver
We are using a very end of our Shrike product in the cube system that we work with public safety agencies with as they evaluate the adoption of UAS in their enterprises. That’s not -- that is much closer to a variant of a defense product than it is a quadcopter in the consumer class that you’re describing. So we’ve not entered the market with a low price point product that you’re describing and that’s not our espoused strategy.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josephine Millward with Benchmark Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Josephine Millward
Hi Tim. So can you guys hear me? Hi there.
Timothy E. Conver
Yes, we can. Hello.
Josephine Millward
Hi there. Given your backlog of $65 million, can you walk us through how you get visibility for guidance? Now Teresa, I think you said you have 60% visibility based on your backlog and it sounds like you expect DoD UAS sustainment and upgrades to remain fairly steady and you expect Switchblade and international to drive growth. Can you expand on that?

Teresa P. Covington
Let me walk through the fiscal ’16 visibility again. We have $61 million of Q4 ending backlog that we believe we can execute in’16. Orders that we booked thus far in the first quarter of $19 million, $38 million holding EES revenue flat and then we believe the balance of government fiscal 2015 not yet booked of $43 million, and so that totals to the $162 million.
Josephine Millward
Okay. Is that $43 million from the base budget? Because that seems quite high.
Teresa P. Covington
It is not from the base budget. As you know from our history, our actual orders often exceed what is published in the government budget. So this represents expectations of bookings.
Josephine Millward
And the other 40% what can you expand on what areas they might come from?
Timothy E. Conver
Well, as usual at this time of the year Josephine, we have what Steve Wright [ph] used to refer to as a go get element of our business plan for the year. And that’s defined by a set of business opportunities that we have identified with customers that we’re in various stages of pursuing and they’re in various stages of contracting for. To the degree that there is uncertainty farther out in the year in those bookings, then we use a method to discount the probabilities of either the contract not being placed or more likely a delay in contract placement such that we can get to a probability of revenue that then leads to our plan and to the guidance we’re providing you.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I’m showing a follow-up from the line of Andrea James with Dougherty & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Andrea James
Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-ups. Just a couple of housekeeping and then more strategic. Teresa, what was your customer funded R&D in Q4? Can you hear me?
Timothy E. Conver
Yes, she heard you. She is just checking the number Andrea.
Andrea James
Oh thank you. I appreciate it.
Teresa P. Covington
For the fourth quarter, the customer funded was $19.1 million.
Andrea James
Thank you. And then -- that’s the other [indiscernible] was $19.1 million, okay. And then, so net net by the end of this year, FY16, you think you’ve added to the cash balance over the course of the year?
Timothy E. Conver
Could you repeat the question please?
Andrea James
If you plan to -- I’m just looking at free cash flow and kind of what I think you’ve communicated so far in this call; do you think you’ve added to the cash balance over the course of this fiscal year, by the end of the year?
Timothy E. Conver
Well we did last year. We have historically, we don’t guide on cash, so I don’t -- we don’t have a forecast that we’re prepared to guide on at this point, but we continue to have confidence in the strength of the core business.
Andrea James
That’s helpful. And then to build off an earlier question, what’s the strategic conversation that you guys have had or to what level have you had a conversation about possibly going after that consumer market, the quadcopter market and why not? Is it because its commoditized or just what is your thinking about whether or not to go after that business and leverage maybe your brand name a little bit?
Timothy E. Conver
Well, as we’ve mentioned for the last year, we’ve been focused on the commercial enterprise solution. But the opportunity to address the consumer appetite for these products with a leapfrog technology has not escaped the innovation halls of AeroVironment engineering. So I probably don’t want to get too far ahead of myself on that, but it’s an interesting question you pose.
Andrea James
And it sounds like you guys; it’s something you might be studying at least? Fair enough, okay. I appreciate you taking my follow-ups. Thank you.
Timothy E. Conver
Thank you, Andrea.
Operator

Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up from the line of Josephine Millward with Benchmark Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Josephine Millward
Hi, Tim. I just wanted to ask you when do you expect a Phase 3 of TERN to be awarded and if you can talk about the size of the program and do you have that -- some of that in your guidance?
Timothy E. Conver
Our best understanding is that DARPA expects to make a decision on the Phase 3 of the TERN program probably in the second half of our fiscal 2016. We are -- as I mentioned in my prior comments, we’re very focused on executing on Phase 2 and positioning ourselves well for Phase 3. We think we have a strong position, but we know we’re competing against one of the world’s largest and most successful suppliers. We’ve got a very strong industry team working with us on this that are as excited about this opportunity as we are and to, I guess, in terms of the component of our revenue plan that would anticipate this program, I’d go back to the earlier answer on the how we address uncertain -- uncertainty in late in contract opportunities that fall late in the year and that tends to be adjusted for probabilities. Mostly in the past we found that when the actual results vary from the potential results, it’s the cause is dominated by schedule slides rather than some other reason.
Josephine Millward
And the size of the program, Tim?
Timothy E. Conver
I don’t believe that I’ve seen a number published by DARPA on that program. They have said, they intend to produce an operating solution. So we’re talking about a MALE airplane, I would guess it’s a material contract.
Operator
Thank you. And I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Gitlin for any closing remarks.

Timothy E. Conver, CEO of drone maker AeroVironment, thinks small - latimes

YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→BusinessHOW I MADE IT Timothy E. Conver, CEO of drone maker AeroVironment, thinks smallAeroVironment is the nation's largest provider of tiny robotic spy planes, which play a crucial role in modern warfare. It also produces charging stations for electric cars.March 20, 2011|By W.J. Hennigan, Los Angeles Times


AeroVironment CEO Timothy E. Conver holds the Nano Hummingbird, a drone… (Al Seib, Los Angeles Times )The gig: Timothy E. Conver, 67, is chief executive of AeroVironment Inc., the Monrovia-based manufacturer of swarms of tiny robotic spy planes that are being launched into the skies over Afghanistan.Hot planes: Once thought to be high-tech toys for aviation enthusiasts, remote-controlled planes play a crucial role in modern warfare. There are thousands of AeroVironment planes in the war zone and 1,300 more in next year's Pentagon budget. The company is the nation's largest provider of small drones, which have names such as Raven, Wasp and Digital Puma. Last year its Pentagon sales totaled more than $200 million.Hummingbirds: The hot new creation in the company's menagerie of potential military drones is its tiny battery-powered Nano Hummingbird, built to look like a bird for potential use in spy missions. Equipped with a camera, the drone can fly at speeds of up to 11 mph. It can hover and fly sideways, backward and forward, as well as go clockwise and counterclockwise, by remote control for about eight minutes.Family fun: Last month, Conver brought his wife of 40 years, Barbara, to AeroVironment's Simi Valley office to watch a rare public display of the bird in action. One of his three adult children also came to the event. "They think that stuff is just great," he said.Climbing the ladder: Conver received a bachelor's degree from the University of Montana and later got a master's degree in business administration at UCLA. While working in the aerospace industry, he had a chance meeting with AeroVironment founder Paul MacCready and bought a stake in the company. Conver has been chief executive since 1993 and owns about 15% of the company's shares. His total compensation last year was $757,650.His advice for newcomers: "Choose the work you wish to do and the way you wish to do it based primarily on what makes you happy and most fulfilled — good things will follow."Ahead of the curve: Conver said AeroVironment started small, leaving larger drones to the big boys such as Northrop Grumman Corp. and Boeing Co. It went after smaller lucrative projects such as the hand-launched drones his company has specialized in for nearly a decade. "That's just fine with us," Conver said with a chuckle. "We've been working on developing this technology since 1986. It took two decades before the government caught up with us." The company is starting to look at large projects and is developing the Global Observer, a robotic spy plane with a 175-foot wingspan.Not just for the birds: Although more than 80% of the company's work is done for the Pentagon, AeroVironment also produces charging stations for electric cars, most notably Nissan's all-electric Leaf passenger car. As with the company's development of the mini-drones, AeroVironment engineered the charging systems — largely on its own dime — before the rest of the world caught up. "We are on the cutting edge of technology here," Conver said. "This company has never been daunted by complexity."Out-innovate: Conver relies heavily on the ingenuity of his engineering team's members and their ability to foresee trends before they happen. "This is not traditional aerospace engineering," he said. "We have an incredible cadre of people here. We try to give them every tool we can. Their success will propel the company forward."The great outdoors: An avid outdoorsman with a penchant for skiing, hiking and camping, Conver grew up in Montana and now lives in the northern San Fernando Valley. Along with his two sons, he enjoys fly fishing in the Sierra Nevada. He likes a little adventure, he said. "That way you discover new things. You find out more about yourself."Keeping it simple: On the AeroVironment manufacturing floor in Simi Valley, workers wearing blue smocks sit at workstations snapping together the small planes. The drones are placed on table tops and packed onto shelves awaiting assembly. Conver's office on the second floor is spartan but offers wide views of the surrounding Simi Valley hills. "I like to keep things simple," he said.william.hennigan@latimes.com
