See above “Average Annual Total Returns %” for performance information current to the most recent month-end. Returns for the other share classes will vary due to different charges and expenses. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes.Total investment return at net asset value has been calculated assuming a purchase at net asset value at the beginning of the period and a sale at net asset value at the end of the period; and assumes reinvestment of dividends, capital gain distributions and return of capital distributions/allocations, if any, in accordance with the provisions of the dividend reinvestment plan. Net asset value equals total Fund assets net of Fund expenses such as operating costs and management fees.

Benchmark Disclosures

Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index
The Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is a widely recognized, unmanaged index of publicly issued investment grade U.S. Government, mortgage-backed, asset-backed and corporate debt securities. The Index does not reflect fees, brokerage commissions, taxes or other expenses of investing. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.




Principal Risks
All investing involves risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainties of rates of return and yield inherent in investing. High-Yield Securities, or “junk bonds”, are rated lower than investment-grade bonds because there is a greater possibility that the issuer may be unable to make interest and principal payments on those securities. To the extent that the Fund invests in Mortgage-Related Securities, its exposure to prepayment and extension risks may be greater than investments in other fixed-income securities. The Fund may use Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Foreign Investing does pose special risks including currency fluctuation, economic and political risks not found in investments that are solely domestic. As Interest Rates rise, bond prices fall, reducing the value of the Fund's share price. Other risks of the Fund include but are not limited to: Bank Instruments; Company; Credit; Credit Default Swaps; Currency; Floating Rate Loans; Interest in Loans; Interest Rate; Investment Models; Liquidity; Market; Market Capitalization; Municipal Securities; Other Investment Companies; Prepayment and Extension; Price Volatility; U.S. Government Securities and Obligations; Portfolio Turnover; and Securities Lending Risks. Investors should consult the Fund's Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for a more detailed discussion of the Fund's risks.

Principal Risks
All investing involves risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainties of rates of return and yield inherent in investing. High-Yield Securities, or “junk bonds”, are rated lower than investment-grade bonds because there is a greater possibility that the issuer may be unable to make interest and principal payments on those securities. To the extent that the Portfolio invests in Mortgage-Related Securities, its exposure to prepayment and extension risks may be greater than investments in other fixed-income securities. The Portfolio may use Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Portfolio performance. Foreign Investing does pose special risks including currency fluctuation, economic and political risks not found in investments that are solely domestic. As Interest Rates rise, bond prices fall, reducing the value of the Portfolio’s share price. Other risks of the Portfolio include but are not limited to: Credit Risks; Extension Risks; Investment Models Risks; Municipal Securities Risks; Other Investment Companies Risks; Prepayment Risks; Price Volatility Risks; U.S. Government Securities and Obligations Risks; Inability to Sell Securities Risks; Portfolio Turnover Risks; and Securities Lending Risks. Investors should consult the Portfolio’s Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for a more detailed discussion of the Portfolio’s risks.
