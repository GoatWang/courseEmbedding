Science Applications International Corporation
by Charlie Cray, Crocodyl.org


For the latest company profile on Science Applications International Corporation, visit our corporate malfeasance wiki, Crocodyl.org.
Founded
in 1969, Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC) is a major
intelligence, military, aerospace, engineering and systems contractor.
It is involved in defense/military (DoD), intelligence community, and
homeland security contracting, as well as selected commercial markets.
As a March 2007 Vanity Fair article published by the investigative journalist duo Bartlett and Steele put it
SAIC "sells human beings who have a particular expertiseexpertise
about weapons, about homeland security, about surveillance, about
computer systems, about "information dominance" and "information
warfare." ... What everyone agrees on is this: No Washington contractor
pursues government money with more ingenuity and perseverance than
SAIC. ... No contractor seems to exploit conflicts of interest in
Washington with more zeal. And no contractor cloaks its operations in
greater secrecy. SAIC almost never touts its activities in public,
preferring to stay well below the radar."




Global Fortune 500 position: 298






Ownership status: Publicly traded






Number of employees worldwide: 44,000






Chief executive officer: Kenneth Dahlberg

Corporate accountability

Environment and product safety: 


In
1991, SAIC was charged with falsifying data submitted to the EPA on
soil samples from toxic waste dumps, for which it ended up paying $ 1.3
million in fines and restitution.




Political influence: 


According to
investigative journalists Bartlett and Steele, "everyone agrees [that]
no Washington contractor pursues government money with more ingenuity
and perseverance than SAIC. No contractor seems to exploit conflicts of
interest in Washington with more zeal."
"SAIC's relative anonymity has allowed large numbers of its
executives to circulate freely between the company and the dozen or so
government agencies it cares about," Bartlett and Steele report.
The company has many friends in Washington, including secretary of
defense Robert M. Gates, a former member of SAIC's board of directors.
William B. Black, Jr. (retired from NSA in 1997 to join SAIC and
returned to NSA in 2000. Black managed the Trailblazer contract that
was abandoned after $1 billion was spent.
Donald Foley, a current SAIC director, is a former top official with
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the group
responsible for developing new military technology.
Mark Boster, a former deputy assistant attorney general, joined SAIC in 1999. Boster paid $30,000 to settle charges he violated federal ethics rules by calling Justice on behalf of the company just three months after he switched sides.
SAIC personnel were instrumental
in pressing the case that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq
under Saddam Hussein, and that war was the only way to get rid of them.
When no weapons of mass destruction were found, SAIC personnel staffed
the commission set up to investigate how American intelligence could
have been so disastrously wrong, including Gordon Oehler, the
commission's deputy director for review a 25-year CIA veteran, Jeffrey
R. Cooper, vice president and chief science officer for one of SAIC's
sub-units and Samuel Visner, a SAIC vice president for corporate
development who had also passed through the revolving door and back to
the NSA.
David Kay, who later chaired the Iraq Survey Group (which showed
that Hussein didn't possess WMD, thereby proving that the war was
launched under false pretenses), is also an SAIC shareholder and former
director of SAIC's Center for Counterterrorism Technology and Analysis.
In 1998, Kay testified
before a Senate committee that Saddam Hussein "remains in power with
weapons of mass destruction" and that "military action is needed."
Another SAIC stockholder and board member Wayne Downing, was used as a
military analyst in the build-up to the war in Iraq. SAIC also hired
Iraqi exiles including Khidhir Hamza, a member of the Iraqi
Reconstruction and Development Council, once perceived as a conduit for
Iraqi exiles living in the U.S. who would be called upon to serve in
the newly established government. (Operating under a $33 million
contract, SAIC organized the Iraqi exiles and reported to Douglas
Feith, then undersecretary of defense for policy and a key assistant to
Donald Rumsfeld Feith's deputy, Christopher "Ryan" Henry is a former
SAIC senior vice president, according to Bartlett and Steele.
Another SAIC "subject-matter expert" was Shaha Riza, whose
relationship to Paul Wolfowitz was one of the reasons for his downfall
as President of the World Bank.
During the Iraq war SAIC was awarded a $ 15 million no-bid contract
(which later grew to $82 million) to establish a "free and independent
indigenous media network" in Iraq. According to Bartlett and Steele,
"with SAIC's cooperation, the network quickly devolved into a
mouthpiece for the Pentagon -- "a little Voice of America."
In addition to having many friends in high places, SAIC also pays lobbyists from FBA Inc. and Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis. In 2004, its lobbying expenditures topped $1.5 million.
The company's PAC, SAIC Inc., has spent hundreds of thousands so far in the 2008 election cycle.






Contracting: Incompetence and other Costly Errors
In 1995, SAIC was charged
with defrauding the government over its efforts to design a flat panel
display screen for fighter jets. The government alleged that SAIC
received millions of dollars but never produced a fully operational
model and misled the government about the status of their progress.
According to media reports, in December 1995, SAIC settled with the
government and paid a fine of $2.5 million.
In 1998 that SAIC paid $1,124,850 to settle a case of "Voluntary Disclosure Cost/Labor Mischarging."
On May 10, 1995, the Department of Justice announced
that SAIC was among three government contractors that would pay a total
of $230,000 to settle alleged False Claims Act violations in which they
allegedly failed to properly test electrical cables installed at a U.S.
Treasury facility under construction in Fort Worth, Texas, that prints
money SAIC was the prime contractor on the project. Its share of the
settlement was $125,000.
A 2006 GAO report (GAO-06-698T) reported (p. 13) that SAIC billed the FBI twice for the same invoice as a subcontractor for the Trilogy project.
In their March 2007 article, Bartlett and Steele reported
that several of SAIC's biggest projects have turned out to be colossal
failures," including a $280 million contract to build a NSA
communications intercept computer system called Trailblazer. "Four
years and more than a billion dollars later, the effort has been
abandoned. ... Happily for SAIC, it will get the chance for a comeback
... [t]he company has been awarded the contract for a revised
Trailblazer program called ExecuteLocus. The contract is worth $361
million."
Another failed effort involved a $124 million contract to upgrade the FBI's computer Virtual Case File
(VCF) system. The FBI pulled the plug on the system in 2005, after
concluding that it would not work. VCF was written off "by a global
publication for technology professionals as "the most highly publicized
software failure in history." The draft Senate appropriations bill for
the Justice Department directed the Department and FBI to use "all means necessary" to recover the funds spent on the project.
In testimony
to Congress, then-FBI Director Mueller said an independent verification
and validation review was conducted by Aerospace Corporation, which
"could "find no assurance" that the requirements were satisfied, nor
that the architecture, Concept of Operations, and requirements were
correct and complete."
SAIC officials explain that the scope of the project changed over time.  In addition, there were
too few FBI technicians compared with the number of SAIC contractors.
As a result, the FBI could not keep up with communicating the
ever-expanding requirements for VCF to SAIC developers.
FBI data czar Zalmai Azmi blamed
SAIC for planning what he thought was an overly ambitious, all-at-once
transition from the old "legacy" Automated Case Support system (ACS) to
the new VCF system, and blamed SAIC for "fast-tracking" the project to
such an extent that it created "silos" of information that could not
interconnect. SAIC has said it was the FBI's desire to fast-track the
project that contributed to VCF's collapse.
SAIC security engineer Matthew Patton, posted
an email on the InfoSec News mailing list (www.infosecnews.org) in
response to a Senator's public statements about the deplorable state of
the nation's information technology infrastructure. Patton's post was
interpreted by FBI and SAIC management as an attempt to "blow the
whistle" on what he saw as crippling mismanagement of a national
security-critical project. He was removed from the project and
eventually left SAIC.
SAIC failed to deliver
a highly touted security system for the 2004 Athens Olympics, causing
the Greek government to refuse final payment. A newspaper in Athens
described the system as "operationally useless."




History



Science
Applications International Corporation was created in February 1969 in
La Jolla California by John Robert Beyster, former head of the
accelerator-physics department at General Atomic Corporation. Within a
year, the company opened up an office in Washington, DC, where it would
bring in most of its revenues from government contracts. As Beyster saw
it, the job of SAIC's employees was to "sell your high-tech ideas and
blue-chip expertise to the army, navy, air force, CIA, NSA, Atomic
Energy Commission and any other government agency to money to spend."
To help the company open these doors, Beyster "aggressively packed
his company with former generals, admirals, diplomats, spies, and
Cabinet officers of every kind," using an internal stock ownership
program as an incentive.

US: Contracting Boom Could Fizzle Out
by Dana Hedgpeth, Washington Post 
April 7th, 2009
The surge in the U.S. military contracting workforce would ebb under Defense Secretary Gates's budget proposal as the Pentagon moves to replace private workers with full-time civil servants. The move could affect companies such as CACI and SAIC. "We are right-sizing the defense acquisition workforce so we can improve our contract oversight and get a better deal for the taxpayers," said the Pentagon's director of defense procurement and acquisition policy.
