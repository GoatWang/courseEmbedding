Power shift
Not long ago, coal provided 98% of the electricity for the pulp-and-paper mills and iron-ore producers around the western edge of Lake Superior, as well as the nearby city of Duluth, Minn. That was 2005. Today, coal use is plunging, and by 2025, it is expected to power just one-third of this region, reports the Wall Street Journal.
