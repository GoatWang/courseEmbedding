Technology>Spectral Reflectometry


Spectral Reflectometry

Nova’s metrology solutions utilize Spectral Reflectometry (SR), which characterizes unknown properties of a sample by measuring the reflection of light in different wavelengths from the sample.  Models, created using sophisticated computational methods, are used to predict the amount of light reflected from a given sample. Using advanced Spectral Reflectometry technology, Nova delivers highly accurate critical dimension measurements of complex structures,   such as Silicon-Germanium (Si-Ge) channel stress for x1 technology nodes, High Aspect Ratio (HAR) structures, VNAND, 3D FinFET, Through Silicon Via (TSV).
Benefits


High measurement speed
With the availability of bright light sources and highly sensitive photo-detectors, Spectral Reflectometry measurement time is very short, and with a high signal-to-noise ratio.


No need for sample preparation
Since Spectral Reflectometry does not require special sample preparation before it is measured, it is an ideal solution for process monitoring and especially for integrated metrology.


Non-destructive
Spectral Reflectometry is a non-destructive type of measurement, and has no impact on the production line.


Accurate interpretation
Since the interaction of light with the sample is well-known, the interpretation of the spectral reflectometry signal is highly accurate.

Spectrum Modeling



        Overview

        Nova’s Solution



Metrology is widely used in semiconductor process development and manufacturing in integrated or stand-alone modes. As device complexity increases, the process development becomes highly challenging and requires frequent changes to structures and metrology requirements.
Metrology measures embedded details and critical profile parameters of complex 3D device structures in semiconductor manufacturing. It reliably provides the precise measurements required for ensuring tight process control and increased yields.
Challenges
In order to deliver an effective and efficient metrology solution for semiconductor manufacturing you need a robust optical platform, advanced metrology IP and a powerful the computational infrastructure.
The dynamic nature of the semiconductor industry makes process development efficiency imperative in order to increase yield and stay ahead of the competition. The metrology solution must combine ease and speed of development.
With shrinking device sizes and increasing structure complexity, the demands for advanced metrology are continuously on-the-rise. These process control solutions need to effectively address the most advanced and complex requirements of 3D structures and state-of-the art manufacturing processes.


Over the years, Nova has continually invested in the development of a powerful, flexible yet user friendly metrology modeling engine; the NovaMARS software platform.  This focus on building a software infrastructure and algorithmic development has enabled Nova to partner with semiconductor manufacturers in new application development. This technology base is effectively used to launch metrology solutions for new market innovations like through-silicon-via (TSV) very quickly.
 
To accelerate the computationally intensive process development, Nova HPC, high performance computing platform is provided. The solution combines a scalable, user-configurable infrastructure with Nova’s proprietary task management software designed to address the increasing complexity of IC manufacturing processes in an efficient way.
 

Holistic Metrology
Hybrid Metrology

Holistic Metrology
Nova’s holistic, multi-faceted approach to metrology produces detailed reproduction of complex 3D structures by extracting fine shape parameters. As a result, complex technology node manufacturers achieve the desired level of process control in fabrication of advanced devices.


 


 


 


 


 


Hybrid Metrology
Hybrid Metrology is the practice of combining measurements from multiple equipment types or toolsets.
NovaMARS proprietary algorithms enables the exchange of data from one tool set with another toolset and used in a complementary or synergistic way to enable or improve the measurement of one or more critical parameters.
First phase of the implementation of the Hybrid solution is released through the communication with the FAB host for the transfer of data.



Hybrid metrology will support multiple data processing                                 

Multiple sets of data parameters (from single tool or more)
Combination of internal injection and external injection







Data from the secondary tool will be transferred to the primary tool via host before job process

Photolithography



        Overview

        Nova’s Solution



Photolithography (Litho) is the process of projecting a microscopic pattern, of the desired circuitry, onto a wafer. The process involves multiple steps:

Coating the wafer with light-sensitive photoresist film 
Exposing the film using a mask with the desired circuit pattern 
Developing the photoresist film to leave behind the required pattern on the wafer

Challenges
Immersion lithography and multi-patterning are key enablers as the semiconductor industry moves towards smaller critical dimension (CD) geometries. Metrology requirements for these advanced technologies are driven by Litho process challenges such as photoresist shrinkage and tighter CD uniformity (CDU).
Traditional metrology methods like CD-SEM are unable to meet the required sampling throughput and may damage the resist material. As a result, semiconductor manufacturers are looking for metrology solutions to provide the speed and accuracy in the Litho process control.


Nova’s scatterometry solutions deliver accurate measurements of key photolithography features, including high resolution & precision of the resist profile CD and sidewall angle. The non-destructive measurement technique provides tight process control for advanced Litho processes.
Nova’s metrology solutions are renowned for delivering the industry’s leading throughput. The high-throughput solution delivers CDU sampling in feedback and feed-forward modes to improve process control.
For example – better control over multi-patterning can be achieved with post-litho, resist profile measurements feedback to the litho cell for lot-to-lot control. Feed-forward measurements to the etch process provide the required resist-trimming information for wafer-to-wafer control.

Nova Measuring Instruments - Great GARP Opportunity - Nova Measuring Instruments Ltd. (NASDAQ:NVMI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Nova Measuring Instruments - Great GARP OpportunityFeb.21.17 | About: Nova Measuring (NVMI) Hedged Equity Deep Value, special situations, long/short equity, macroHedgedEquitySummaryNova provides advanced metrology solutions to the semiconductor industry.Recent Q4 results were excellent, beating estimates.Share price has strong momentum.NOVA MEASURING INSTRUMENTS - STRONG GROWTH AT AN ATTRACTIVE VALUATION Introduction Worldwide semiconductor revenue is set to hit $364bn in 2017, according to a recent report from Gartner. And as the demand for smaller, more complex semiconductors increases, the demand for advanced metrology solutions is also likely to rise. One company set to capitalize on this demand is $460m market-cap Nova Measuring Instruments (NASDAQ:NVMI). Nova specializes in providing advanced metrology solutions to the semiconductor industry, partnering with its clients to add significant value across the entire product life cycle. In this article we present a concise investment analysis of the semiconductor metrology specialist, and examine whether the strong recent share price momentum can continue. Company description Nova Measuring Instruments is a provider of advanced metrology solutions to the semiconductor industry. Headquartered in Israel, the company provides a full range of metrology products and services to address the ever-increasing technical challenges arising in the semiconductor industry. Metrology is an essential component of semiconductor process development and manufacturing. As semiconductor complexity increases, and the demand for smaller, more powerful devices increases, process development becomes more challenging. The metrology function measures embedded details and critical profile parameters with the aim of reliably providing the precise measurements required for ensuring a tight process control and increased yields. Nova places a strong focus on long-term partnerships with its clients, striving to understand both current and future needs in order to develop advanced control methodologies precisely suited to the customer's requirements. This enables Nova's customers to improve process performance, enhance product yields and accelerate time to market.
 Nova employs over 500 employees and has subsidiaries in the USA, Europe, Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. The company is listed on both the NASDAQ and the Tel Aviv 100 index. Financials & Ratios 

 Nova's revenues have increased substantially in recent years. The top-line has grown from $102.8m in FY2011 to $163.9m for FY2016, a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8%. Analysts following Nova expect the company to generate revenue of $184.3m and $200.0m for FY2017 and FY2018, year-on-year growth of 12.4% and 8.5% respectively. Earnings have been trending upwards since FY2013, with the company generating diluted non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.10 for FY2016. At the current share price of $17, that places the company on a price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.4, falling to 14.9 for FY2017, which seems very reasonable for a technology firm growing its top-line at just under 10% per year over the last five years. The company's enterprise value (EV) to sales ratio of 2.26 also suggests that the stock is not expensive. Nova currently has no debt on its balance sheet. Nova's Q416 results released on 14th February were excellent. The metrology specialist generated record quarterly revenue of $50.2m, up 25% year-on-year, significantly exceeding guidance of $42-$46m. Non-GAAP net income was $11.7m, or $0.42 per diluted share, up 121% year-on-year on a per-share basis, exceeding guidance of $0.31-$0.40 per share. For the 2016 full year, Nova generated record revenue of $163.9m, up 10% year-on-year, and non-GAAP net income of $30.3m. Nova had sizeable cash reserves of $91.7m at the end of 2016. Bull case Nova's recent Q4 results were impressive, with earnings of $0.42 per share beating market estimates by 3 cents. Management were bullish in regard to both the results and the future, with President and Chief Executive Officer Eitan Oppenhaim stating:
 "The fourth quarter was an outstanding conclusion to another record year, demonstrating our ability to execute our growth plans effectively while improving our customer diversification and operational model. We believe that the strong end to 2016 sets us on course for another growth year in 2017, bolstered by growing demand for our entire product portfolio. The strength of our business, as evidenced by our strong guidance for the first quarter, will continue into 2017 as we continue to secure wins from multiple customers in various industry segments." Nova has released 2017 Q1 guidance of $50m-$54m revenue and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.37-$0.45. The company expects to generate free cash flow of $15m-$20m. As the semiconductor market continues to strive to develop smaller, more powerful products, the need for advanced metrology solutions is likely to remain robust. Nova believe that the metrology market is growing at an annual rate of 17% per year and that this growth will continue in the coming years. On a list of the Top 10 Vendors in the Semiconductor Process Control Equipment Market from 2016 to 2020 released by TECHNAVIO, a market research specialist, Nova was placed in 8th spot in terms of market share in the metrology industry. For a company operating in a fast-growing industry and generating excellent revenue growth, Nova appears to be attractively valued. Bear case While Nova looks to have strong momentum at present, there are several risks that investors should be aware of. One key risk is the company's client base. While Nova continues to expand and diversify its client base, adding a new memory customer in the most recent quarter, four key customers each generate over 10% of revenue. These include TSMC (37%), SMIC (13%), UMC (13%), and Samsung (12%). This is clearly a risk, and if Nova were to lose any of these key clients, revenue could be significantly impacted. Long-term changes in technology could also affect the company as Nova operates in a highly specialised niche industry, with its prospects strongly linked to the growth of the semiconductor industry.
 Chart 

 The chart shows that the share price has been trending up slowly over the last five years. The stock endured a significant correction in 2015, falling from $13 to $9, but has since rallied strongly over the last 12 months to now trade at $17. Recent momentum has been strong, with the stock rising from $14 to $17 since the beginning of 2017 with a decent level of volume. Conclusion In conclusion, Nova Measuring Instruments offers exposure to the fast-growing semiconductor metrology industry, at an attractive valuation. The company has grown its revenues significantly over the last five years and analysts expect the growth to continue at a formidable rate in coming years. Recent 2016 Q4 results were excellent, beating expectations, and while the share price has surged 20% already in 2017, the stock still looks attractively priced on a forward-looking P/E ratio of under 15.
