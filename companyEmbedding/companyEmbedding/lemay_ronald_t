Waste Management Inc. said late yesterday that its chairman and chief executive, Ronald T. LeMay, had quit, the second chief executive to leave the troubled trash hauling company in nine months.Mr. LeMay, 51, is returning to the Sprint Corporation as president and chief operating officer -- his position before he joined Waste Management, formerly called WMX International. Before leaving Sprint in July, Mr. LeMay had been considered the heir apparent to Sprint's chief executive,  William T. Esrey.Robert Miller, a turnaround specialist, will become acting chairman and chief executive of Waste Management, the company said.Waste Management hired Mr. LeMay in July after a six-month search for a new chairman and chief executive to replace Phillip B. Rooney, who resigned in February. Shareholders had been pressuring the company to return to its trash-hauling roots after a disappointing foray into other businesses.

The resignations come after the company announced third-quarter earnings last week that matched estimates. It also said it may take a fourth-quarter charge as it seeks a new formula for growth after relying for years on acquisitions.The company's profit from continuing operations fell to $172 million, or 38 cents a share, from $420 million, or 49 cents a year ago. The earnings matched the average estimate of 38 cents by 13 analysts surveyed by First Call Inc.Sprint said Mr. LeMay contacted the company when he decided that he was not going to stay with Waste Management.''When Ron informed us he was going to resign from Waste Management, the board decided that someone with his caliber and his talent was someone we needed,'' said a Sprint spokesman, Bill White.
