Syndicate Funding on AngelList – A Company’s Perspective


A few months ago AngelList announced Syndicates – enabling investors on AngelList to create fund-like groups of investors to invest together in AngelList companies (following a single lead investor). It’s a great idea and at Foundry we quickly decided it would be an interesting experiment to form our own syndicate. We were the first formal venture fund to do this. Since then we’ve completed about 10 deals (I say “about” because we have a few things in various stages of completion as I write this – the intent of FG Angels is to make 50 AngelList investments – about 1 per week).
We often get asked how the process works and while what’s below has specifics about working with FG Angels it also contains some great advice for anyone raising money on AngelList in general, and through Syndicates specifically. I’ve edited the text and added some things of my own, but this is largely the work of Carrie Requist, CEO of UGrokit, a company we recently funded through FG Angels.

How AngelList Syndicates (and FG Angels) Works

It’s important to understand that AngelList syndicates work somewhat like an opportunity fund, where AngelList investors sign up to “follow” a syndicate and pledge to invest a certain amount of money. The key here is that this isn’t a hard commitment – each syndicate member makes a deal by deal decision to invest. As a result the syndicate size isn’t the total amount of money you’ll raise – it’s the maximum you’ll raise from the syndicate. And depending on how many members there are to the syndicate and what crowdfunding exemption you use (more on that below) the actual limit will likely be quite a bit less than the total you see next to the syndicate name on AngelList. And, of course, it will also require some work on your part to pull syndicate members into your actual deal. Syndicates aren’t automatic capita – you’ll still need to work for your money.
There are 2 parts to the FG Angels or any AngelList Syndicate investment:

Foundry Group (or your syndicate leader) invests their portion – in FG Angels case this is $50,000
In parallel they open the investment to their syndicate members on AngelList

AngelList shows for each syndicate the amount that the syndicate leader will invest and the amount pledged by all the syndicate members as a whole (shown as “backed by” on AngelList). At the time of FG Angels investment in U Grok It, their syndicate total was $426k (that total excludes the FG Angels portion).
It’s worth reiterating that unlike a mutual fund, the investors are not committed to investing in every company that any syndicate backs, so the $426k from the members of FG Angels represents the maximum investment if every member decided to contribute (and again, as a practical matter given the number of members in the syndicate and the exemptions that AngelList relies upon to fund these syndicates the actual maximum is below this number). Members have not given any money to AngelList or FG Angels for the syndicate and ultimately, the investor must make their own decision on each deal and then transfer money on a deal by deal basis.  Many things can effect your actual deal participation including how many deals the syndicate has completed, the pace of the syndicate’s investments, the type of investment (ie., note or equity), the stage of the company, how much the company is raising, specific deal terms, and members personal preferences.
U Grok It was actively raising on a convertible note and had already closed a portion of it, so we already had terms in place. Foundry reviewed these terms before committing to invest and both FG Angel’s $50k and the syndicate member’s total amount are under the terms of this note. This means we did not negotiate deal terms with Foundry or with AngelList, the investors accepted the terms we already had for the convertible note (or choose not to invest). There are syndicate deals where the lead investor does negotiate terms (Foundry does this on other FG Angel deals) but syndicate members don’t – they either accept the terms or don’t participate. And they do look at terms so structuring a fair deal is important.
Syndicate Dynamics:
To sign up for FG Angels, an investor must be approved by Foundry Group and agree to their terms, which include a carry. The carry is a percentage of the returns on the investment that the investor will give to Foundry Group for managing the syndicate and investments (note that AngelList itself takes a carry as well). The carry is between Foundry Group and the investor and has no direct impact on the AngelList company. This is beneficial to the startup because neither AngelList nor Foundry Group take any of the investment funds -there is no “finders fee” or other fee to the startup for being part of the syndicate. FG Angels and AngelList will get their carry straight from the syndicate investors upon an exit. The terms for being a syndicate member and the specific carry vary between syndicates, but the key for founders here is that this is all taken care of outside of any specific investment and any investor listed as part of the syndicate will have already agreed to the terms and carry.
The AngelList syndicate shows the number of members in FG Angels and lists each syndicate member as well as the amount they have pledged per investment. There is a portion of syndicate members who rarely invest in any deals and some who invest in every deal. A smaller group performs due diligence on each deal before they invest and makes a deal by deal decision whether or not to participate.
The Timing:
FG Angels Syndicate investments go FAST. Foundry committed to invest through FG Angels on a Friday. Over the weekend we revised our note and updated our AngelList profile. On Monday our deal went live and almost all the funds raised from the FG Angles syndicate were in process by the following Monday (within one week).
Be Ready for the Syndicate Investment to go Live on AL:
FG Angels is a popular and fast moving syndicate with 219 members at the time of the U Grok It investment – with an explicit goal to launch a new investment each week. This means that the interest in your startup will shoot up as soon as the FG Angels investment goes live on AngelList. Here is a graph of the investor views on U Grok It’s AngelList profile over the two weeks that the FG Angels Syndicate investment was live:
The first short bar is the Monday it went live (we launched towards the end of the day). The big spike is Tuesday. What this means for an AngelList company is – be completely ready for investors before giving FG Angels the green light to go live.
506(b) vs 506(c):
These refer to two of the SEC rules that regulate “crowdfunding” financing. 506(c) is the new Jobs Act provision that, in part, allows for what’s called a general solicitation (on AngelList, this is shown as a “public” fundraising). FG Angels Syndicate investments are NOT general solicitations and some syndicate members do not want to invest in companies that are using this exemption. Check with your lawyer to make sure you have not engaged in general solicitation and make sure you DO NOT CLICK on the AngelList button that says “Activate” under “Raise Online On Your Own.” (this can’t be undone, so make sure you’re careful about this step). Your AngelList company profile shows “Investors Only” in the upper right under Fundraising if you are 506(b), which is likely you want (this isn’t legal advice – talk to your lawyer about the pros and cons about the various exemptions but understand that, broadly speaking, few institutional investors will ever invest in your company if you use the new broad solicitation rules – they simply don’t work as intended (yet).
What the FG Angels Syndicate Wants to See:
Closing an investment is just another form of closing a sale for your company. Investors just have a different pain they are trying to solve – they want a big return on their investment. Make sure your investor messaging is clear on this in your AngelList profile. Be sure to have your profile polished. For example, you’ll want:

Video of your deck – if you have a good quality video of yourself presenting your deck, great. If not, record your audio and put that with your slides. We did this in house (the production quality does not have to be stellar, just clear) and put it as an unlisted video on YouTube. You can then put the link in AL.
Product demo video
Product shots / screen shots
Every part of your profile completed
Current investors and total investment amount for this round. AngelList will show how much you are raising and how much is left in the raise, so make sure the numbers are up to date by updating each closed investor prior to launch
AngelList comments and references for both your company and the founders. If you don’t have these, ask for them. Your networking should have brought you into contact with many people who are rooting for you – this is a way they can help you without investing money. We had some high profile supporters who gave us comments just before the investment went live and this was a big help
Your website – Make sure your website is up to date because the FG Angels Syndicate members will go from AngelList right to your website to see what your customer messaging looks like and how you position your business.

What Happens After the FG Angels Syndicate Investment Goes Live:
You will have a lot of fundraising work to do in the week after the investment goes live. Members start to make reservations in the investment – you’ll see that is shown in the activity for both FG Angels and your company on AngelList. Members can also increase the amount they want to invest in your company. Members can also withdraw or cancel from the investment.
AngelList will show your company as having raised the total backing amount of the syndicate (which is overstated for the reasons already discussed) and separately show the total backing amount + FG Angels $50k. These are shown on your company’s Stats page > Fundraising > Manage > Overview. This total will initially be the full backing amount of the FG Angels Syndicate and will go down slowly as members withdraw (yes, slightly disheartening). Remember that this will be a good investment both from the funds standpoint and by having Foundry Group’s support.
Note that most FG Angels members will neither reserve nor withdraw. Your company will also get a lot of follows (mostly from FG Angels syndicate members) and a lot of request for intros. You should follow everyone who follows you and have a message prepared to send to each one. U Grok It’s message thanked them for following, invited them to watch the pitch deck and demo videos and to contact us with any questions, giving direct contact information. Also reply to each request for intro and expect these people to email you back, usually with questions. The request for intros are often investors who do more diligence about the investment. Some followers and request for intros are from investors who are not members of the FG Angels Syndicate, but watch what the syndicate does to find new investments. Plan that most of the your week after the FG Angels Syndicate investment goes live will be spent courting AngelList investors.
In our case, we were also contacted by people who follow FG Angels or one of the Foundry partners but who are not part of the FG Angels syndicate. These people can become outside investors (we are still conversing with a few that may be interested in our Series A round). Some syndicate members may also wish to invest directly in addition to their participation in the syndicate. U Grok It has a new investor in this round who has a small amount in the FG Angels syndicate, but is investing substantially more directly (this is a bit of an end around Foundry, so be careful here who you let in and whether they’re trying to simply piggback on FG Angels w/o paying the carry associated with doing so or if they’re legitimately interested in participating in the syndicate and so excited they want to invest more). So don’t discount a syndicate member just because their syndicate participation may be low. Also to this point, less than half of our syndicate investment came from investors at $5K or higher. The majority was at $2,500 or lower.
Closing the Investment:
At your direction, AngelList will begin to close the FG Angels investment. This will allow syndicate members to start transferring their investments into the fund (more on this below). AngelList will then select a closing date (about a week after you start closing). Our investment opened on Mon, March 24 and AngelList started closing on Wed, March 26 with an initial closing date of Tuesday, April 1.
Here is where you start to get an indication of how much you will actually raise from the FG Angels syndicate. Members will start transferring their investment and in the Stats > Fundraising > Manage > Manage page you will see the amount that has been collected (starts as $0) above a four-tabbed list: All, Not Started, Pending and Collected. In the “All” list, you will see only the members who have not previously opted out of the investment and then you will see some members cancel.You will see the pending amount increase and then the collected amount increase as the pending amount decreases (funds move from pending to collected). Starting to close doesn’t lock anyone out of the investment. Any member of the syndicate (even if they did not opt in, as most of them didn’t) can transfer their investment during this part of the closing. AngelList will send a message to the FG Angels members when the investment starts to close and another one a few days later reminding them to transfer their funds.
This is a great time to update the FG Angels Syndicate members in the Not Started group. If you ask AngelList, they will send you a spreadsheet of the members with their email addresses so you can do a group BCC: email with send you the link they need to click on to make their investment. Include some update on your company (in our case we received a new, glowing profile from a high profile AngelList member and we were opening our online sales). Come up with something to update them about. Make sure this email goes only to the Not Started group. AngelList is also generally happy to extend the closing date if your pending investments are still going up. We extended from April 1 to April 7, but the vast majority of the investment was in Pending by April 1. When investments slow or stop (in one to two weeks), AngelList will close the investment – this does keep members who have Not Started from joining the investment, but keeps things open until the pending investments have been received.
 The Investment Paperwork and Details
The FG Angels Syndicate investment is overseen by Foundry Group (for which they receive the carry if the investment generates a return). The company will have only two new investors: FG Angels and FG Angels Syndicate. The FG Angels Syndicate members who invest in your company become part of a fund setup by Foundry Group through Assure Fund Management. Someone from Assure will contact you after the FG Angels syndicate investment goes live on AngelList to set up your funding vehicle (this is separate from FG Angel’s direct $50k investment).
If you have filled your round and are closed, that is great. If you still have room in your round (we did since we had extended the round to ensure there was enough room for the FG Angels Syndicate), then you can keep raising.
CONGRATS – Now What? – Investor Relations with the Syndicate
Technically, you only have FG Angels and fund(s) managed by FG Angels as your investors. However, some syndicate members will want to connect with you directly (in our experience often on LinkedIn), some will ask for updates and some will offer their help (services, connections, advice).
This is evolving so there aren’t really any norms here yet. On the one hand, it is impossible for a small startup to effectively manage 100 new investors. On the other hand, these investors all now have a stake in your success and many are willing to help make that success happen, so they can be quite beneficial to your startup.
You can send updates to the syndicate investors as a group through AL in Stats > Fundraising > Manage > Manage where, once the deal is finalized, you will see a list of Closed investors and Didn’t Close and on the right a Message box with a link to “Update Investors or ask for advice.” These updates are only visible to you and your investors. We updated the investors when the round completely closes and plan on providing them major updates and perhaps a quarterly post while right now I send out a monthly (or so) email to our direct investors as well as field calls and make calls when there is a topic to discuss.
Hopefully this overview is helpful in gaining an understanding of the AngeList syndicate process in general and the FG Angels process in particular. Of course this is a new and therefore evolving method for funding your business so check for updates from AngelList (and here where we’ll post new developments).

What is a syndicate?



A syndicate allows investors to participate in a lead investor's deals. In exchange, investors pay the lead carry.Here's an example: Sara, a notable angel investor, decides to lead a syndicate. The syndicate investors agree to invest $200K total in each of her future deals and pay her 15% carry.When Sara makes her next investment, she offers to invest $250K in the company. She personally invests $50K and offers the remaining $200K to her syndicate.If the investment is successful, the syndicate investors first receive their $200K, after which every dollar of the syndicate’s profit is split 80% to the syndicate investors, 15% to Sara and 5% to AngelList Advisors.  AngelList Advisors is a venture capital exempt reporting advisor with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a subsidiary of AngelList.View syndicates »

What are the benefits of syndicates?



Investors get access to deals, leads get carry and startups get more capital with fewer meetings.Investors get access to a lead's investments and benefit from her experience in picking and managing investments. Investors can also invest as little as $1K.Leads get carry for their investments. They can invest 5–10x their typical investment amount, which gives them access to more deals and allows them to lead more deals. They may also get major investor rights. Finally, leads get access to syndicate investors who are often experts in the startup’s market.Startups get more capital with fewer meetings. They get the attention of a lead who is making a large investment. They get access to the syndicate investors’ networks without putting each one on the cap table. And they can easily collect many small investments.

How much do syndicates cost?



Startups don’t pay for syndicate investments. Investors pay 0-25% deal carry to the syndicate lead, and 5% deal carry to AngelList Advisors.Investors also pay the out-of-pocket costs for each deal—currently $8K in the US and £8,300 in the UK. These costs are paid to third parties such as state regulatory agencies, payment processors and accountants—AngelList or AngelList Advisors does not profit from these fees.The lead and AngelList Advisors do not receive carry until the syndicate investors’ investments and out-of-pocket costs are returned.

What is the legal structure of a syndicate?



Syndicate investors don't invest directly in a company. They invest in a special purpose fund that is created specifically to invest in the company.  The fund is formed as a series LLC.The fund is managed by Assure Fund Management and advised by AngelList Advisors. The lead also serves as a contractor of AngelList Advisors.The lead usually does not invest through the fund but is required to disclose to AngelList Advisors how she votes, or if she buys or sells shares. If there is a lead, the fund will usually vote with the lead unless she has a conflict of interest or there are other unusual circumstances. If there is no lead, the fund will usually vote with the majority of other shareholders.

What is carry?



Carry is a share of the profit of an investment that is paid to the managers of the investment. It is short for ‘carried interest’.In a VC fund, the limited partners of the fund pay carry to the general partners if the entire fund is profitable. This is called fund carry or net carry.In syndicates, investors pay carry to the lead for any profitable investment. This is called deal carry. Syndicates use deal carry so investors can opt out of any investment or stop investing anytime.Learn more about carry and the economics of
syndicates.

Do syndicates receive pro rata rights?



Syndicates receive pro rata rights if the lead negotiates them with the startup.  If a syndicate has pro rata rights, syndicate investors in the initial round may have the opportunity to invest their pro rata allocation in subsequent financings. Any remaining allocation may be offered to other investors or funds.  The pro rata may not be offered to syndicate investors if the lead does not participate, if it is unlikely that a reasonable amount of the pro rata will be filled, or for other reasons. Pro rata rights vary in strength and enforceability. Pro rata rights may be waivable by a majority of investors in the round or waived as a condition to a new financing round.

Leads: What is minimum I have to invest in each deal?



The minimum investment for a lead who is investing her own money is generally 2.5% of the amount that the syndicate raises from individual investors. The minimum investment for a lead who is investing out of a fund raised from limited partners is generally 20% of the amount that the syndicate raises from individual investors.This minimum only applies to capital raised from individuals. Syndicates can raise an unlimited amount of capital from institutional investors such as platform funds.For example, if a lead puts $5K of her own money in a startup, she can raise an additional $195K from individual investors in her syndicate. She can also raise an unlimited amount of capital from a platform fund like CSC Upshot.The minimum investment may be reduced if a notable investor is making a significant investment in the round. It may also be reduced in pro ratas and other special situations. Investors in the syndicate will be notified if the minimum is reduced.Investors can also view the lead's investment amount in any deal and opt out of the deal, for any reason.Learn more

Leads: What happens if my allocation in a deal is smaller than my syndicate?



Each investor’s commitment will be reduced pro rata if your allocation is smaller than the total commitments from syndicate investors. Here's an example. Sara has a syndicate with 10 accepted investors. Each investor has committed $10K to the syndicate, for a total of $100K. Sara personally invests $20K in the deal and asks for an additional $100K for her syndicate. However, the startup is only able to allocate $50K to the syndicate. So each of her syndicate investors will invest $5K instead of the $10K they requested.If an investor‘s reduced amount is less than the minimum investment for a deal, the investor will invest the minimum investment. In this case, if the reduced amounts still exceed the syndicate's allocation, the lead will use her judgment to reduce investors’ amounts for that deal. The lead will likely favor backers who have expertise in the company‘s markets or have large investment amounts.In some deals, a maximum may be placed on aggregate commitments by the platform funds.

Leads: Should I negotiate for pro rata rights?



Yes. Pro rata rights are important for AngelList and syndicate leads to invest additional capital in winning investments and generate larger returns. For syndicate leads this is especially valuable, since they can still earn carry in follow-on rounds. Leads should negotiate for pro rata rights on all deals.

Updated Aug 15, 2016








Leads: What is the lead's carry in a pro rata?



The lead's carry in a pro rata is the same as the initial round, as long as her investment is greater than or equal to either her pro rata allocation or her investment in the initial round, whichever is smaller.The lead's carry in a pro rata will be reduced by 5% if her investment is less than either her pro rata allocation or her investment in the initial round, whichever is smaller. AngelList Advisors, the fund's investment adviser, will receive this additional carry in addition to its usual 5% carry. This is due to  the added work and risk, and since AngelList Advisors is less able to look to the lead’s decision when advising the fund.In both cases, if the lead does not provide access to the pro rata and provide relevant information, she will not earn any carry and AngelList will receive a total of 10% carry.

Updated Nov 22, 2016








Leads: What should I name my syndicate?



Most leads use their full name for their syndicate because they expect investors to join the syndicate on the basis of their personal reputation.If you are investing on behalf of a firm or if you focus on a specific type of investment, you may wish to choose a different name for your syndicate.Investors should be able to clearly tell who is running the syndicate from the syndicate's name. The name should also not be generic or contain the word ‘syndicate’.“FG Angels” is a good name for a syndicate. “Angel” is not.“Hardware Investments by Vinod Khosla” is a good name for a syndicate. “The Hardware Syndicate” is not.

These deals may not be marketed publicly.You may market syndicated deals subject to section 506(c), commonly referred to as general solicitation.

The AngelList-affiliated funds automatically consider every syndicate deal for investment.Featuring happens with the permission of the founder.

Leads: Limitations on syndicate investments in certain foreign companies (PFIC & CFC)




Investments in certain types of foreign companies ares subject to disadvantaged tax treatment and  ongoing compliance requirements. 
These rules are complicated, but if the investment is in a foreign holding company it may be a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC)  and if the investment is in a foreign company that is majority owned by US taxpayers, it may be a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC). 
As a result of the added tax and  compliance burdens, AngelList does not generally facilitate investment in either PFIC's or CFC's. When a syndicate makes an investment in a non-US company, the company will be asked to certify that it is neither a PFIC nor a CFC and agree to ongoing compliance requirements. 
 A lead should confirm the PFIC / CFC status with a foreign company early on to avoid wasted efforts. Any investment in a company that cannot certify to being a non-PFIC / CFC will either not be facilitated on AngelList or will require additional disclosures and approvals from AngelList.

Investors: What am I committing to when I back a syndicate?



You are committing to invest in the syndicate’s deals, on the same terms as the lead. You also agree to pay the lead and AngelList carry on those deals as well as the out-of-pocket costs of each deal. This is not a legally-binding agreement and you can opt out of any agreement or stop investing at any time. All of your existing investments remain intact if you stop investing.

Investors: I've indicated investment interest to a syndicate—what's next?



When the next deal is syndicated by the lead, you will be notified and given the opportunity to invest or opt out of investing, depending on the terms of your commitment. The lead will also provide her investment rationale and disclose conflicts of interest.

Syndicate investors receive less information than direct investors. An AngelList entity or the lead will distribute the following documents to investors when they invest in a syndicate deal:Documents related to the fund’s formation such as its operating agreement, private placement memorandum and subscription agreement.General terms of the investment, if the company permits. Templates of deal documents signed by the fund may also be made available to investors. Qualitative updates on the company status, if available. This is high-level information similar to the information VCs provide to their LPs. For example, it may include information about the company’s customers or financing. It will generally not include any figures.Any information investors need for taxes, such as K-1s, is distributed annually.

Investors: When do I receive a return on my investment?



You will generally receive returns, if any, when the company is acquired or has an IPO. There may also be other opportunities for the syndicate to sell its shares.When there is an exit opportunity, AngelList Advisors, in consultation with the lead, will advise the syndicate fund regarding the best time to sell the syndicates’ shares. The decision to sell the shares is then made by Assure Fund Management. This will generally happen soon after the shares become liquid. If there are any profits, they are distributed to the syndicate investors.The syndicate fund, like all investors, is bound by  agreements with the company and can only sell shares in certain situations.

Investors: Do I have to invest every time one of my syndicates invests in a company?



No. You can opt out of any deal. Many leads indicate whether they expect investors to participate in every deal.

Investors: Can I change my investment amount in a particular deal?



Investors can increase or decrease their investment in a particular deal. Any change is subject to approval by the lead. Investors can also opt out of any deal. The lead may also reduce an investor’s investment in a deal, particularly if it is oversubscribed.Investors that regularly lower their investment amounts or frequently opt out of deals may be removed by the lead.

Investors: How does investing in a syndicate differ from investing in a VC fund?




Syndicates are intended to complement, not replace VC funds. Differences include:Syndicate investors choose which startups they want to invest in and can stop investing any timeSyndicates have much lower minimum investmentsLeads typically personally invest more per deal than GPsSyndicates use deal carryExcept in rare cases, syndicates do not charge management feesLearn more »

Investors: Why isn't there a higher minimum investment for leads?



Raising the minimum investment would cause some leads to stop syndicating their investments. Instead, they would start or join venture capital funds, which typically have no minimums.The
partners of a VC fund typically provide 1-5% of the fund's capital, but
also take out 15-25% in management fees. In
effect, they don't make a contribution to the fund. The minimum for leads investing their own money in a syndicate is 2.5%. And the minimum for leads investing out of a fund is 20%. Except in rare cases, leads receive no management fees from the syndicate. So, for the vast
majority of leads, syndicates are already more expensive than venture capital
funds. Raising the minimum would cause some leads to stop syndicating their
investments. They would instead invest through a venture capital fund.

Raising the minimum would also cause some leads who are new to investing to stop altogether, because it is already a significant portion of their net worth. This would lead to less diversity of investment opportunities from new leads.Investors who are unhappy with a lead's contribution can always opt out of an investment. They can also invest in AngelList Funds, which make investment decisions on behalf of investors, for no additional cost or carry.Learn more about the economics of syndicates.

Investors: What documents do I sign?



You sign documents to invest in a special-purpose fund that invests in the company. This signature is provided by simply checking a box.You do not sign the company’s financing documents. The company's financing documents are signed by Assure Fund Management for the special-purpose fund.

Investors: Can non-U.S. investors invest in syndicates?



Under U.S. law, yes. You should also check the laws in your country.A Tax Identification Number (TIN) is helpful but not required.Investors inside and outside the U.S. should get tax advice when investing in startups.

Updated Aug 15, 2016








Investors: What are the tax consequences of investing in a syndicate?



For each syndicate deal, investors become members of a special-purpose fund formed to make the investment. That fund will purchase preferred shares, convertible debt or other instruments issued by the company.  Certain taxable events may result in income or losses flowing through the special-purpose fund to its investors.  Investors with taxable income or loss will receive K-1s.If the fund holds an equity interest in a portfolio company, there is a taxable event on exits or when the company is dissolved or files for bankruptcy. In rare instances, there may also be a taxable event if the fund receives a dividend or distribution.  If the fund purchases convertible debt, prior to conversion into equity, there may be a tax consequence for your portion of the interest on the debt or in connection with the cancellation of debt such as in a bankruptcy. Be sure to consult your tax advisor.

Investors: What are the tax consequences for non-U.S. investors in syndicates?



For each syndicate deal, investors become members in a special-purpose vehicle, structured as a US series LLC. Each syndicate will typically send out IRS Forms K-1 to all its members, both foreign and domestic, in any year in which it has taxable income or deductible expenses. We understand from informal consultation with tax counsel that, generally, income and distributions from AngelList syndicated deals to non-US investors without substantial US business involvement are exempt from US tax and withholding requirements, provided that such investors have submitted the appropriate FATCA Related Forms. AngelList is not qualified to provide tax advice and the above should not be read as tax advice. There are many important exceptions to the generalization stated above, so please be sure to consult your tax advisor and relevant international tax treaties before making an investment.

Investors: What is AngelList Advisors? 



Syndicate investors don't invest directly in a company. They invest in a special-purpose fund that is created specifically for each investment. This fund then invests in the company. The corporate form of the fund is a series of an LLC.The fund is managed by Assure Fund Management and advised by AngelList Advisors, a subsidiary of AngelList. The lead serves as a contractor of AngelList Advisors, providing certain information related to the investment. AngelList Advisors and the lead each receive carry from the special-purpose fund

Investors: What is a management fee?



A management fee is a quarterly or annual fee added onto a deal, meant to compensate the lead for their time and expenses. Leads may charge management fees for hiring employees, maintaining an office, paying salaries, etc. This is similar to how venture capital firms operate. However, in the case of an AngelList syndicate, because investors can opt in or out on each deal, all economics (including management fees) are calculated on a deal-by-deal basis.

·
Updated Nov 07, 2016








Investors: Which leads can charge management fees?



This is a new feature AngelList is exploring. To start, only leads who incur substantial costs running their AngelList syndicates will charge management fees. Right now this only applies to Gil Penchina. AngelList will determine if other leads qualify for management fees in the future.

·
Updated Nov 07, 2016








Investors: How do management fees work?



For each deal, the lifetime total management fee (ex. 3%) is collected upfront and drawn down by the lead over time (ex. 0.25% quarterly, for three years). If there's an exit before the entire management fee is drawn, undrawn capital is returned to investors. If there's a profitable exit, the lead must return the entire amount raised (including the management fee) before earning any carried interest.

Updated Nov 07, 2016








Investors: How do management fees benefit investors?



Management fees allow leads to hire staff, maintain offices, and be competitive with venture capital firms that have fees at their disposal. Many of the world's top investors are VC General Partners. By introducing management fees, AngelList is better equipped to support this cohort of investors and attract them to share their deals online.Over time, many of the current syndicate leads will face financial pressure to start or join venture capital firms where they can earn fees to offset their costs. They may choose this instead of syndicating. Management fees help mitigate this financial pressure and retain leads on the AngelList platform.

·
Updated Nov 07, 2016








Investors: How do I know which deals charge management fees?



Management fees are displayed on the deal page alongside the setup costs that you pay on each deal. There is clear disclosure on deals with management fees. No additional work is required from you to participate in these deals. As always, you should review deal terms before participating and opt out on deals where you don’t like the terms. There are dozens of leads on AngelList with quality deal flow and no management fees.

Startups: Can my company be syndicated?



First, you must have a syndicate lead.You must also be a U.S. C corporation, S corporation or LLC (only if the LLC is issuing debt in the financing). U.K. corporations also qualify.Other types of entities may also be syndicated—please contact syndicates@angel.co to discuss an exception.

Startups: On what terms does the syndicate invest?



The syndicate will generally invest on the same terms as the syndicate lead.

·
Updated Aug 15, 2016








Startups: How many investors are added to my cap table?



Syndicates add two investors to your cap table: the lead investor and a special-purpose fund that collects the investors in the syndicate. The individual investors in the special-purpose fund are not listed in your cap table.

Link to this
·
Updated Aug 15, 2016








Startups: Do syndicate investors count towards my company’s shareholder limit?



No. A syndicate only adds two investors to the company's cap table and syndicate investors should not be counted toward the SEC’s limit of 2000 “shareholders of record” that private companies must observe.

·
Updated Aug 15, 2016








Startups: How do I post updates to my syndicate?



You can post an update by selecting the ‘For Investors’ tab on your startup profile.You are not required to share any information or communicate with your syndicate. But many companies choose to post monthly updates and ask investors for help. Syndicate investors are often experts in your market and can provide advice and introductions.Although investors are under NDA and forbidden from forwarding confidential information, you should only share information at your own risk.

Investors: How do I invest in a syndicate deal?



If you are provided with access to a syndicate deal, review information provided by the company and the deal lead carefully.  AngelList and its affiliates as well as their agents take no responsibility for and do not endorse any information concerning companies or deal terms.  Should you decide to invest after performing your own diligence (including reviewing the relevant private placement memorandum, subscription agreement and operating agreement), you will provide various information in the subscription process and execute a copy of the subscription agreement and the operating agreement online.

Ending Our FG Angels Experiment


After two years of a dedicated experiment, we’ve decided to stop making new investments via our FG Angels Syndicate. We’ve learned a lot, achieved some of our goals, but ultimately have decided that the effort required to maintain our investment pace on AngelList is too great for us, at least for now. More on that in a bit, but let’s start with some history.
The Monday after AngelList announced their Syndicate product in September 2013 we decided to to jump in with both feet and start FG Angels. As a result, we were one of the very first syndicates and the first VC firm to create a syndicate.
We had several high level goals:

Understand how AngelList and Syndicates worked by actively participating;
Be able to experiment with seed investments outside of our themes;
Extend our network of entrepreneurs and angel investors; and
Generate additional economic returns for our funds.

It took a few months for AngelList to gear up Syndicates so that they actually worked. As a result our first investment wasn’t made until early January when we invested in OnTheGo Platforms, which was just acquired by Atheer.
Our plan was to make 50 investments, directly committing $2.5m from our funds ($50k from us for each investment) through 2014. When we did a retrospective on our first year of FG Angels, we had invested in 42 companies. Seth did a nice job of summarizing what the deals and the syndicate activity for the first year looked like.

Total number of investments: 42
Average syndicate investment amount per deal: $316k
Largest syndicate investment in any single deal: $785k
Total number syndicate investors (syndicate members who invested in at least one FG Angels deal): 116
Total number of investors (all investors who have joined FG Angels in at least one deal): 410
# of investors who have participated in at least half of FG Angels deals: 30
Most active syndicate member investment total: $905k across 41 of our 42 FG Angels deals
% of investments with a female co-founder: > 20%

Our plan was not to generate investment deal flow for us to follow on with our main funds. Instead, we took a one time seed investor approach patterned after an angel strategy that I’ve used for almost 20 years that has now generated a realized return over 10x invested capital and still has about half the money at play.
We’ve ended up investing in three companies through our main funds that we had invested in first with FG Angels (Mattermark, Revolar, and Havenly). However, both Revolar and Havenly went through accelerator programs that we are involved with (Techstars and MergeLane, respectively), which allowed us even more perspective into working with them.
We decided to continue making FG Angels investments through 2015 at about the same pace. By the end of 2015, we had made a total of 65 FG Angels investments. We have 49 funded Backers, a 236 unfunded Backers, a total syndicate backing of $976,653, and an estimated 30 day raise of $171,058.
At the end of 2015, we revisited the goals I mentioned at the beginning of this post. Let’s see how we did and what we learned.
Goal 1: Understand how AngelList and Syndicates worked by actively participating: In addition to understanding in depth how AngelList and Syndicates worked, I’d like to think we helped Naval and his awesome team at AngelList on figuring out the legal, workflow, and UX dynamics around AngelList. We’re fans of both AngelList and Syndicates and it was important to us to give back to the platform and help them work through the dynamics involved in creating and rolling out their Syndicates product.
Goal 2: Be able to experiment with seed investments outside our themes: While we did a lot of investments outside our themes, we generated very little incremental learning on our part. While we could be very helpful in a generic early investor way, the time to value ratio was way off in both directions. While we regularly did short, quick hit help via email, whenever someone wanted to spend an hour or more with one of us, we eventually realized that our investment and ownership in the company was dramatically underweighted. And, this took time away (we each have a finite number of hours each week) from companies we had much larger investments in. We also realized that we were getting the experimentation value and learning at a greater rate from our deep engagement in Techstars.
Goal 3: Extend our network of entrepreneurs and angel investors: As we expected, our network of entrepreneurs was expanded (by about 150 people across the 65 companies.) These founders are active members of our portfolio and our goal is to be helpful to them any way we can, given time constraints. However, we have been disappointed in how we have – or haven’t – been effective at building a broader network of angel investors. We’ve made some new friends and built strong connections with a few angels in the syndicate, but we’ve struggled to build any kind of extended community. The tools for this on AngelList just aren’t there yet and we haven’t committed the resources to do this separately. And, ultimately, some face to face time is likely needed which we haven’t been willing to do.
Goal 4: Generate additional economic returns for our funds: We’ve invested about $3.2 million in FG Angels and are excited about the portfolio. However, it’s a very early stage portfolio that will take a very long time to mature. Even when you include the carry we are getting on FG Angels (15%), this total amount represents less than one fund investment on our part (our typical investment size is $5m to $15m, with this growing to as much as $40m when you include our late stage fund.) Even if we generate a huge multiple on our overall FG Angels investment (say 10x), the impact on our fund return is limited given the size of the investments we were making.
Ultimately, we’ve decided that the effort that we are putting into FG Angels is too great for us to continue on in the way that we’ve have been for the past two years. However, by running the experiment, we’ve better understood the leverage points at the angel / seed level that AngelList and Syndicates create, which for some investors, and many entrepreneurs, is very powerful. Finally, we’d like to believe that we’ve contributed to the evolution and dynamic of angel / seed investing through this effort.
While we are no longer going to be actively making FG Angels investments, every now and then we might do something out of FG Angels. We continue to believe that AngelList Syndicates is an effective platform for companies and investors. We simply felt that we needed to better balance the time and effort we were spending on FG Angels relative to the weight it has in our overall portfolio.
It’s important to all of us at Foundry Group to experiment around the edges of our industry and to push the boundaries of the venture model to find new and innovative ways to create value for our investors while supporting as broad a set of entrepreneurs as possible. We’ll continue to look for ways to do that.

This is an Awesome Article. – Hanuman Chalisa






Rick Moss – Better Ventures



Kudos to you and Foundry Group for doing this and sharing your learning. Can you put this into the context of venture investing doesn’t scale? Sounds like you’re saying it was more work than benefit versus focusing on your larger investments and getting many of the same benefits from working with accelerators? And I also see a connection to your increased focus on investing in funds which is of course more scalable than syndicate investments. Thanks, Brad!






bfeld



I would not put it in the context of venture investing doesn’t scale.
For example, if we hired a dedicated partner to do this, we could manage it. Or if we hired an associate whose job it was to organize, leverage, and get value out of the investor network being created, that part would be more effective. And, while AngelList has great software, there’s a bunch of stuff missing that we would have liked. We could have built a small team to write this…
But we chose not to. Our core team strategy has been not to add anyone, to stay very lean (e.g. no associates), and minimize overhead associated with managing a team. That’s one of the strategy tradeoffs we’ve made and weren’t willing to change it for this.
We could have certainly put more money into each AngelList deal (instead of $50k). But we wanted to solve the other things first.






Dabelon



Awesome post.  What software tools/features do you think are missing in terms of interacting with your investor network?






bfeld



It’s a long list. We spent some time sketching it out and then decided we were only dealing with it at a surface level so we stopped when we knew we weren’t going to execute on it.








Rick Moss – Better Ventures



Got it. Thanks again.










Jud Valeski



Awesome run down and transparency. Thanks. 






Pierre Powell



Brad, thanks, it was fun.   I think we invested in all but two companies.   My experiement/goal was different.   We are Oil & Gas people.   And I look at investing in oil wells like investing in start-ups; with NOT a normal distribution of return, but a skewed distribution; i.e. the mode, median, and mean are displaced.
My idea was if you invest in ONE company, the most likely return is the mode, which is displaced in a skewed distribution from the mean; and it means you will most-likely return less.   However, if I can invest a little, in a lot (with someone smart at the helm), then I can move my return from mode to mean.  
The things I really didn’t consider is the syndicate angels really had a difficult time obtaining enough information on whether we should or even could invest in later rounds; I’d want to follow your lead.   
Also, not sure about all the logistics of returns and the like, for example, I know that ONTHEGOPLATFORMS was acquired, not sure what that means for the syndicate, or us as a syndicate angel.
Many Blessings






bfeld



Re: OnTheGo – you should have received a message from them via AngelList. It was a stock for stock transaction – so we now own shares in Aether (the acquirer).






pointsnfigures



That’s an interesting point on following on, and pro rata.








Chris Amelinckx



Thanks Brad. Do you have a suggestion for teams looking for Angel investment with an affinity for the great work at Foundry?






bfeld



Just email me. We still make seed investments and will occasionally do something via FG Angels.








TejDhawan



Once I get over the sadness, I will re-read and promise to understand the economics without emotion :). Thanks for all your team did to help the syndicated angel community grow past infancy.






bfeld



Smile!








Frank W. Miller



Hmm. Interesting.  Thanks for putting this together.  It has been an interesting way for me to dip my toe in the water for angel investing.  I’m only in five companies with little bitty investments but kinda fun.  I’m worried I have not been promiscuous enuff to have a good chance at that 10x-100x but I feel like one of them might in the future have something happen.  I guess we’ll see.  Its been more than a year since these investments were made.  I guess the last bit of experience I gain will be how long it takes for any of these to come to a conclusion, good or bad.






bfeld



Timing – expect at least a decade for full resolution – probably longer. I’ve still got angel investments from the 1990s that are live / active (and successful) companies.








Mac



A pattern has evolved.  Every time over the past four years, when you’ve returned from being off the grid, it seems like big changes occur.  Not certain what that forecast for 2016.  🙂  Thanks for the FG Angels experiment.  Liked the idea of seed investing with Foundry Group in a leadership/ management role.  






bfeld



I think the timing is more around the end of the year (and my sabbaticals have been in November, which just happens to correspond when we have been making decisions around – or implementing – new big new things.
We have another thing we are winding down (which I’ll blog about in the next few weeks) where the decision was made nine months ago to make a major change in what we were doing and then another decision was made at the end of Q3 to shut the initiative down. We are in the “finishing it up and ready to talk about it” stage for that also.








Dariel Luciano



Neat post. How did you guys go about thinking when it was time for you to move away from angellist? Was it a series of conversations that ended up in that decision or did you have a predetermined benchmark you wanted to hit and then stop? Just trying to understand how fg thinks about when it’s time to cut something off.






bfeld



We talked about it a few times. The first was at the end of 2014 (our first year of doing FG Angels) and decided to just continue for a while.Then we probably talked about it at the end of Q2 and the end of Q3. 
At the end of Q3, we decided to finish the investments we had in our pipeline and then stop.








Elizabeth Kraus



Great post. I benefited tremendously from my participation. Excellent diversification for a small amount of capital. It increased my profile on AngelList which has increased my credibility and our deal flow for MergeLane. Seeing the terms of all of the deals was a great benchmark for setting valuations and terms. I got to know the team at AngelList and saw their ability to innovate on a dime. And like you touched on, it made me realize how hard it is to add value to a portfolio that big. Great learning for going forward. 
I am 100% glad I did it, but decided to take a break because the volume got a little overwhelming. In the future, I think I’ll continue to invest in syndicates, but will 1) invest in syndicates investing in 10 or fewer deals per year or 2) lower my expectations of myself for tracking the deals and the updates. I think viewing it more as a diversification tool and broad deal flow funnel makes more sense than trying to view it through the same lens as my other angel investments.
And re: building the community of angels, it might have had a bigger impact than you think. It is really hard to figure out who is interested in angel investing and AngelList is quickly changing that. I’ve met at least twenty angels because they created a profile on AngelList just to join your syndicate. I’ve also had a few investors reach out to me because they saw my involvement with FG. Great impact for the ecosystem.  
Thanks for all of your hard work with this. It made a difference.






bfeld



Super feedback. 
Re: the Network – that’s interesting and I hadn’t considered that.








jkostecki



Hi Brad and thank you and Seth for the analysis. How did you guys go about doing due diligence on the companies you invested in? I understand that your selection criteria was based on a thesis and experience, but what other steps did you take to not only choose among the 700k startups listed on Angel List (of course not all of them are raising) and then once you decided to consider the investment how did you vet the teams and the startups themselves?






bfeld



It varied a lot but broke down into roughly three categories.
1. We knew the founders already and had some relationship.
2. We had a relationship with one of the lead angels who had done a lot of work already.
3. Random – and we had to do a new diligence process.
1 and 2 were the majority of the investments we made.








Sean



Interesting experiment – thanks for sharing the results with us all. Curious to hear what AngelList’s response to this was? Have they been begging you to stay or simply accept it as over right away?






bfeld



Naval is a total gem and his team is excellent. I sent him this post to review and he said “Looks balanced and thoughtful Brad, thanks for running the experiment with us.” 
He also had some other hypotheses about who / what situations with VCs AngelList would work more effectively in.
I have enormous respect for Naval and hope to have more opportunities to do things with him.








Pete Griffiths



Very interesting.  Thanks.






Rich Weisberger



Seems like you could have used one slack across all the investments to limit your time commitment? 






bfeld



Nope – Slack would have never worked effectively for this. The nature of the syndicate is very dynamic since individual angels can invest in whichever companies they want. So it’s a complex many-to-many relationship with us in the middle. Email doesn’t work effectively either.






Rich Weisberger



Oh I see. I thought the problem was dealing with communications between the sydicate lead and the portfolio companies. 






bfeld



Nope. AngelList does that very well.












James Green, Drowning Worms



Very interesting Brad. It’s interesting that a VC found it hard to build a network of angels. I know, as an angel, it’s also hard to build a network of VCs (perhaps also due to limited time, but on both sides). There’s clearly a willingness and appetite for some kind of angel-VC introduction service. If you find something that fits the bill, please share it. If I come up with something, I’ll message you somehow! All the best and thanks for the info.






bfeld



I thought more of the Angels would be proactive about developing a relationship with us. That was an incorrect assumption on my part.








William Mougayar



re: #3 “we have been disappointed in how we have – or haven’t – been effective at building a broader network of angel investors.”
– my guess is that the AL tools that “aren’t there” relate to potentially some CRM of sorts that could interweave all these angels into a manageable relationship management?






bfeld



Correct. We thought about trying a few different approaches but given the dynamic nature of the syndicate and who participates in each deal, this didn’t make sense to do outside of AngelList.








pointsnfigures



Cool that you are being so transparent about it.  What I am curious about is off all the investments, how many have raised another round?  Did they do traditional VC-or did they raise it on Angel List?  How many failed fast? Too soon to ask about exits.  
My own experience/perception of Angel List is that if a company wants to raise money, they need to have raised some prior to listing on Angel List.  They also should have a name lead investor.  
Angel List is a great development and there are a lot of other platforms trying to follow them.  On the flip side, it gets seed stage companies the capital they need, but not necessarily the mentorship guidance they need.  (Based on your and other experiences I have heard)






bfeld



It’s too early to analyze the outcome data. Many of the companies are still in the round they raised, a few have failed, a decent number have raised another round, and one has been acquired. We’ll do an analysis at some point in the future – but probably in another year or two.






pointsnfigures



Makes sense.  Huge respect to you for putting it out there as transparently as you have.

Brad, thanks for experimenting with FG Angels. Your investment in The Mighty gave us the time to focus on doing what we needed to do to raise the next round. Happy to be a very small part of Foundry’s portfolio.

Thanks – and our pleasure. We look forward to continuing to help!








Eric Ver Ploeg



Huge admiration for you guys in trying this experiment. Of course, most experiments don’t pan out, but getting in early and learning as much as you can, is way better than sitting back and watching.






bfeld



Yup – it’s the best way to learn!

We run the largest syndicate in Europe and I can definitely sympathise with you on points 1 and 3. 
1. AngelList is a great product but it is still buggy and lacking good UX. The legals and completion process is still messy and time consuming too. I don’t think they’ve taken the pain out of that yet. 
3. AL has good liquidity and a lot of investors on its platform, yet to form a relationship with a new investor and get them to actively fund your syndicate deals takes a lot of work. To do this still requires a face-to-face relationship. Fundamentally angels still invest with who they actually know, and most importantly trust. 
Thanks for sharing your learnings on it.

Awesome post.  Sad to no longer see regular FG Angels deals!
While actively running the syndicate is no longer the right strategy for FG, what are your thoughts on benefits/drawbacks for individual angels investing via syndicates?






bfeld



I think it’s an awesome platform for that.








Alex Mathews



Thanks for the transparency, Brad.
In addition to hiring a potential VP/associate to run this, what about the added benefit of translating follow-on pro rata rights into special purpose vehicles via AL? In this case, the deal flow (originally not the intention of FG Angles) could become meaningful for your main FG LPs if given that exposure, no?






bfeld



I think this is going to be a curious debate over the next few years. I’m not convinced of the argument about soaking up all the pro-rata rights, especially at the early stages. And, it’s not important for us or our LPs as a fund since we (Foundry Group) certainly have the capability to do that from our main fund if we want.

Another experience that demonstrates how difficult it is to replace an experience based on trust with a seemingly more efficient process based online.  Thanks for sharing the details.
Meanwhile, two years ago, you were worrying about the 99 investor limit in the syndicate.  Was that ever actually an issue, and did you have to turn away some of those 416 investors in any of the deals?  Or did AngelList find a workaround?






bfeld



The 99 investor limit is and continues to be an issue.

Thanks for the opportunity to invest with FG in the syndicates from the very beginning, it’s been great to see the wide array of companies and in a few cases I’ve been able to broker introductions for a few founders despite my very small stake.  
Given the deal flow volume, it was tough at times to keep up with even basic analysis of the investment opportunities as there often wasn’t a large enough lead time from announcement to closing (at least not enough for me).  If you delve into these waters again perhaps there is a way for active syndicate members to join a (secure, private) community discussion of the opportunities, contributing our expertise where applicable, before the deals reach a close. I think we’d all be able to accelerate our knowledge advancement this way.
If you even opt to pick up education / learning / edtech as a theme area and want a large company and startup perspective feel free to drop a line, helping would be the least I can do.
Thanks again and all the best for a great 2016 and beyond.

I am the founder of a company and a first time CEO. I am here basically looking for advice on what to do with my company. Here is my situation. We are still in startup mode, however we are making money. I have always been an entrepreneur at heart, and I have managed to retain 100% percent of the company. I realize now in order to bring my vision to fruition, I am going to need the right team, and also some funding to get the company moving. Is this the purpose of seed funding? And if so, can someone please lead me in the right direction. I want to start taking the necessary steps to acquire the resources we need. Any advice is much appreciated.

It’s mind boggling and sad how much money is wasted on bad people and bad ideas. You could build so much more instead, and with less. In fact, having so much cash on hand, I don’t see how these angel investors and especially VCs don’t just bring all of this startup development in house. A solid working prototype of most of these startups would cost 25-50k, especially with a solid, trusted go-to team. You own all the equity, re-use back office, avoid startup mistakes, avoiding wasting money. Need Uber of X cashcows? Easy. Need Zero-to-One breakthroughs like Google’s algorithm? Invite tech geniuses who want to create rather than raise money and party in San Francisco. 
I only see upsides.






Patrick Foley



Sorry if this is a stupid question, but would it make more sense to “invest” in individual angels? Presumably you could limit to angels that fit a certain profile (low time sink, at minimum). You could magnify their impact on their portfolio companies and maybe get 1 in 100 great follow on investment. Outside of my world, but I’m just curious if that would work.
