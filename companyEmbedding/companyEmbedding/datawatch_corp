History[edit]
Datawatch began as a Business Intelligence (BI) tool, which is defined as the gathering, analysis and dissemination of information in the proper format for accurate and timely decision making.
1985-1991: Datawatch established as a private company.
In the beginning, Datawatch designed, manufactured, and marketed computer workstations and peripherals that conformed to the U.S. government’s TEMPEST security standard for processing classified information. This security standard was designed to prevent unauthorized access to information in computing devices by limiting their electrical emissions.
1991: Datawatch acquired Personics Corporation, a producer of network data access and translation software and video enhancement software. Personics’ principal product was Monarch, a software program that provided data access, translation, and reporting capabilities to users of networked PCs. Datawatch announced Monarch V1.0.
1992: Datawatch went public with an IPO.[1]
2013: Datawatch acquired Panopticon Software AB, a Swedish software company whose primary product was Panopticon Designer, a visual data discovery application that can create visualizations of streaming real-time data.[2]
2016: Datawatch was going back to focus on their principle Monarch software to address the need of self-service data preparation market for data visualization tool and release the new Monarch Data Prep Studio in the 13.0 release.[3]
Technology Overview[edit]
Datawatch's technology relies on in-memory OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cubes, which are displayed through a series of visualizations including treemaps. This allows the user to load data, select variables and hierarchical structures, and navigate through the resultant visualization, filtering, zooming and drilling (sometimes called slicing and dicing), to identify outliers, correlations and trends.
Its streaming OLAP implementation takes an in-memory OLAP cube and allows data to be streamed through it. This combination makes the company's products attractive to industry verticals that require live streaming data, such as financial market data, utility grid monitoring and telecommunications network traffic analysis. This is very different than the vast majority of OLAP implementations in which cubes are rebuilt periodically for new batches of data.[4]
This support for streaming data with its products has allowed financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Citadel , and BlackRock to implement the Datawatch software within their real-time trading and risk applications. Euromoney has stated that it provides the trader community with a way of quickly digesting information.[5]
Datawatch offers three main products: Datawatch Designer, Datawatch Server and Monarch software.[6]
Joint Ventures[edit]
In December, 2013 Xerox Canada and Datawatch partner to unlock value of data for retail chains, other large enterprises.[7] In February, 2014 Datawatch announced a Global Strategic Alliance with MarkLogic.[8] In February, 2014 Datawatch announced a partnership with Monarch Experts, the leading specialist consultancy in London. Monarch Experts will help existing Datawatch customers transition to the new Visual Data Discovery platform.[9] In March, 2014 Datawatch named Carahsoft Technology as its Master Government Aggregator. Carahsoft, a government IT solutions provider, is now marketing and selling Datawatch’s solutions to the public sector.[10] March, 2014 - Datawatch announced its global partnership with OSIsoft and the release of its real-time data connector to the PI System.[11]
In April, 2014 Datawatch integrated its software with Cloudant's NoSQL database-as-a-service DBaaS.[12] In May, 2014 Datawatch announced a Global Relationship with Informatica,[13] as well as support for IBM Cognos TM1[14] and a Global Strategic Alliance with Perceptive[15][16] They announced a partnership with MDS Tech Inc[17][18] joined the Industrial Internet Consortium[19][20] announced OEM agreement with Kx Systems[21][22] NASDAQ OMX launched MiQ with a partnership with Datawatch.[23] In June 2014 Datawatch announced predictive analytics solution with partner Quant5[24][25] announced support for Cloudera Enterprise 5[26] and announced solution developed with First Florida Credit Union.[27]

History[edit]
Datawatch began as a Business Intelligence (BI) tool, which is defined as the gathering, analysis and dissemination of information in the proper format for accurate and timely decision making.
1985-1991: Datawatch established as a private company.
In the beginning, Datawatch designed, manufactured, and marketed computer workstations and peripherals that conformed to the U.S. government’s TEMPEST security standard for processing classified information. This security standard was designed to prevent unauthorized access to information in computing devices by limiting their electrical emissions.
1991: Datawatch acquired Personics Corporation, a producer of network data access and translation software and video enhancement software. Personics’ principal product was Monarch, a software program that provided data access, translation, and reporting capabilities to users of networked PCs. Datawatch announced Monarch V1.0.
1992: Datawatch went public with an IPO.[1]
2013: Datawatch acquired Panopticon Software AB, a Swedish software company whose primary product was Panopticon Designer, a visual data discovery application that can create visualizations of streaming real-time data.[2]
2016: Datawatch was going back to focus on their principle Monarch software to address the need of self-service data preparation market for data visualization tool and release the new Monarch Data Prep Studio in the 13.0 release.[3]
Technology Overview[edit]
Datawatch's technology relies on in-memory OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cubes, which are displayed through a series of visualizations including treemaps. This allows the user to load data, select variables and hierarchical structures, and navigate through the resultant visualization, filtering, zooming and drilling (sometimes called slicing and dicing), to identify outliers, correlations and trends.
Its streaming OLAP implementation takes an in-memory OLAP cube and allows data to be streamed through it. This combination makes the company's products attractive to industry verticals that require live streaming data, such as financial market data, utility grid monitoring and telecommunications network traffic analysis. This is very different than the vast majority of OLAP implementations in which cubes are rebuilt periodically for new batches of data.[4]
This support for streaming data with its products has allowed financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Citadel , and BlackRock to implement the Datawatch software within their real-time trading and risk applications. Euromoney has stated that it provides the trader community with a way of quickly digesting information.[5]
Datawatch offers three main products: Datawatch Designer, Datawatch Server and Monarch software.[6]
Joint Ventures[edit]
In December, 2013 Xerox Canada and Datawatch partner to unlock value of data for retail chains, other large enterprises.[7] In February, 2014 Datawatch announced a Global Strategic Alliance with MarkLogic.[8] In February, 2014 Datawatch announced a partnership with Monarch Experts, the leading specialist consultancy in London. Monarch Experts will help existing Datawatch customers transition to the new Visual Data Discovery platform.[9] In March, 2014 Datawatch named Carahsoft Technology as its Master Government Aggregator. Carahsoft, a government IT solutions provider, is now marketing and selling Datawatch’s solutions to the public sector.[10] March, 2014 - Datawatch announced its global partnership with OSIsoft and the release of its real-time data connector to the PI System.[11]
In April, 2014 Datawatch integrated its software with Cloudant's NoSQL database-as-a-service DBaaS.[12] In May, 2014 Datawatch announced a Global Relationship with Informatica,[13] as well as support for IBM Cognos TM1[14] and a Global Strategic Alliance with Perceptive[15][16] They announced a partnership with MDS Tech Inc[17][18] joined the Industrial Internet Consortium[19][20] announced OEM agreement with Kx Systems[21][22] NASDAQ OMX launched MiQ with a partnership with Datawatch.[23] In June 2014 Datawatch announced predictive analytics solution with partner Quant5[24][25] announced support for Cloudera Enterprise 5[26] and announced solution developed with First Florida Credit Union.[27]

Four Easy Steps to Market Your Practice OnlineThanks to advancing technology, marketing a medical practice online doesn't have to be costly and confusing. In fact, it can be distilled down into four basic steps that anyone can take. These are: (1) Creating a viable, enhanced practice website, (2) utilizing techniques to be found by patients online, (3) engaging in social media and mobile health apps, and (4) monitoring your online reputation. We'll discuss these in this whitepaper as well as the best practices for each.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
