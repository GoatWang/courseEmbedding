Healthcare Venture Capital Investing in Early Stage Biotechnology Companies | The Column Group - TCG






















































   L O A D I N G    


























extraordinary starts here
TCG is a science-driven venture capital firm with $1.1 billion in assets under management. TCG's three funds are invested in a select group of early stage drug discovery companies with unique scientific platforms that can change the world.



 









Mission & Strategy 







The Column Group (TCG) is a science-driven venture capital firm that makes significant financial and operational commitments to build early stage drug discovery companies based on their unique scientific platforms and potential to deliver multiple breakthrough therapeutics.TCG’s investment strategy runs counter to the prevailing trend in life sciences venture capital toward assembling diversified portfolios of later stage, single product-orientated companies across multiple industry sectors, with proximity to value inflection points and the early identification of a Pharma “buyer” as key investment considerations.In contrast, TCG takes the long view in making investments, recognizing that significant time is often required to generate significant value. Our approach is not “building-to-exit.” Key variables, including scientific opportunities, the competitive and regulatory landscape, and Pharma priorities, can change very rapidly. Instead, TCG’s mission is the generation of fundamentally strong companies, built from the ground up, based on great science and the ability to generate multiple differentiated product opportunities.Rather than diversification, TCG emphasizes focus. We are dedicated to early stage drug discovery as the best source of a new generation of novel, highly effective human therapies. We believe that the most critical resources, such as great ideas, world class founders, and top quality managerial and scientific talent, are very rare and that concentrating them within a small cohort of companies is the key path to success.TCG is about the bold pursuit of big ideas using innovative science to generate breakthrough therapies that address significant diseases. Our firm is committed to all facets of company building and brings together a rich combination of scientific, financial and operational expertise to shape promising science into a value-rich portfolio poised to have a profound impact on human health. 














TCG's success starts with idea generation, having the capacity and connections across the scientific community to generate at least the germ of a powerful idea in-house.  That’s not something you find everywhere.



Richard Heyman, CEO, Seragon Pharmaceuticals





The Column Group is a 'big science, dare-to-dream' venture fund. They identify large, unmet needs in life sciences and back these ideas and teams with conviction.



Bill Rieflin, CEO, NGM Biopharmaceuticals





The driving force behind TCG is great science and the desire to start meaningful companies with a key platform component that will be here for the long term.



Dr. David Baltimore, Science Partner, The Column Group
















Our Team 										



Vital to the execution of TCG’s unique strategy is the ability to tap the extraordinary capabilities of its team, comprising Partners and Science Partners with decades of collective experience building, operating, and financing biotech companies, as well as successfully discovering and developing drugs. With six members of the National Academy of Sciences, three Nobel Prize winners, and several current and former members of biotech/big pharma senior management and boards of directors, TCG has nearly unrivaled access to new company ideas, entrepreneurs, and top scientific and managerial talent.

Charles Sawyers, MD
Science Partner							





Charles Sawyers, MD, is an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the inaugural Director of the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program (HOPP) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. His laboratory is currently focused on characterizing signal transduction pathway abnormalities in prostate cancer, with an eye toward translational implications. His earlier research focused on BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase function in chronic myeloid leukemia. This work, and that of colleagues Brian Druker and Novartis, led to the development of the kinase inhibitor imatinib (Gleevec) as primary therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and the discovery that imatinib resistance is caused by BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. This discovery led him to evaluate second generation Abl kinase inhibitors, such as the dual Src/Abl inhibitor dasatinib, which received fast-track approval at the FDA in June 2006. Dr. Sawyer's more recent work in prostate cancer has defined critical signaling pathways for disease initiation and progression through studies in mouse models and human tissues. This preclinical work led to the development of a novel anti-androgen ARN-509, a small-molecule inhibitor discovered in collaboration with UCLA chemist Michael Jung, which targets the increased levels of androgen receptor found in hormone-refractory disease.
Dr. Sawyers is past President of the American Society of Clinical Investigation and served on the National Cancer Institute's Board of Scientific Councilors. He has won numerous honors and awards, including the Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Foundation Award, the Dorothy Landon Prize from the American Association of Cancer Research, the David A. Karnofsky Award from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the 2009 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award. He is a member of the Institute of Medicine and in 2010 was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.
Dr. Sawyers was a co-founder of Aragon Pharmaceuticals and the founder of Seragon Pharmaceuticals. He is also the founder of ORIC Pharmaceuticals.  Scientific Advisory Board:
