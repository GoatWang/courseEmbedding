QuickSelect™ LoadHolding SelectorSun's new QuickSelect LoadHolding™ selector tool makes choosing your next load-holding valve a lot easier. Rather than trying to guess which valves might work, just answer a few questions about your application, and the tool will narrow your options from 184 load-holding valves down to a handful of suitable options, arranging your results by stability and efficiency.Don't take a chance on your next load-holding valve.  Try our new QuickSelect LoadHolding selector tool.

Relief Cartridges

+Product Overview



Sun Hydraulics offers pressure-limiting and pressure-regulating relief cartridges with a variety of mounting options with 2, 3, or 4 ports.


Functionally interchangeable (except pilot-only versions) with valves with the same number of ports (same flow path, same cavity for a given frame size)
Flow rates up to 200 gpm (800 L/min.)
Versions are available with an integral pilot control cavity that accepts Sun's T-8A pilot pressure controls — electro-proportional or pneumatic
Fully adjustable up to and including 5000 psi (350 bar) or 6000 psi (420 bar) intermittent, except air-piloted versions

QuickSelect™ LoadHolding SelectorSun's new QuickSelect LoadHolding™ selector tool makes choosing your next load-holding valve a lot easier. Rather than trying to guess which valves might work, just answer a few questions about your application, and the tool will narrow your options from 184 load-holding valves down to a handful of suitable options, arranging your results by stability and efficiency.Don't take a chance on your next load-holding valve.  Try our new QuickSelect LoadHolding selector tool.

About Sarasota, FL USA 
Our Story
Sun’s University Parkway facility in Sarasota, Florida was built in 1980 and serves as the company’s global headquarters. Most cartridge design engineers reside in this facility, as well as support and administrative personnel. Activities at the University Parkway operation include Sun’s main testing and R&D lab, parts machining and finishing, and production and test of low volume, high mix cartridges.
Sun’s 701 Tallevast Road facility in Sarasota, Florida was built in 1997, coincident with Sun becoming a public company. The Tallevast facility has been home to most of Sun’s North American manifold design engineering group. Activities included production and test of Sun’s high volume cartridges.In August 2013, Sun announced the opening of its new facility at 803 Tallevast Road, adjacent to the 701 Tallevast plant. This new facility houses design, engineering and manufacturing activities for aluminum and ductile iron manifolds and integrated packages, along with all shipping operations.

QuickSelect™ LoadHolding SelectorSun's new QuickSelect LoadHolding™ selector tool makes choosing your next load-holding valve a lot easier. Rather than trying to guess which valves might work, just answer a few questions about your application, and the tool will narrow your options from 184 load-holding valves down to a handful of suitable options, arranging your results by stability and efficiency.Don't take a chance on your next load-holding valve.  Try our new QuickSelect LoadHolding selector tool.
