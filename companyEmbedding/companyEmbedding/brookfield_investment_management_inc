Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

Separately Managed Accounts
We seek to establish and develop long-term partnerships with our clients and appreciate that certain clients may have specific risk/return objectives, which may be better suited to separately managed accounts.
We have a long history of managing separately managed accounts for large institutional investors, as well as several different custodians and have deep operational and compliance experience in this regard and maintain advanced oversight systems. Our portfolio managers collaborate with clients to ensure investment strategies are appropriate for their individual investment objectives. 
Opportunistic Strategies
In addition to our long-only strategies, we have created a number of opportunistic strategies focused on real asset public securities for qualified investors. Our opportunistic strategies seek to deliver strong absolute returns over a market cycle, drawing upon our high conviction approach, a value-oriented lens, and taking into account the trade-off between quality and value, and a keen awareness for the cyclical nature of capital markets.

Infrastructure Equities
Our Infrastructure Equities strategies provide exposure to long-life assets delivering essential goods and services to the global economy. We have been actively investing in the infrastructure public markets since 2008, seeking out companies whose underlying infrastructure platforms position them to generate predictable, stable cash flows over the long term.
Available Strategies

Global Infrastructure Securities
Master Limited Partnership and Energy Infrastructure Securities
Global Infrastructure Securities Long/Short

How to Invest
We offer multiple points of entry to our Infrastructure Equities strategies, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds, UCITS funds, closed-end funds and opportunistic strategies.
Real Asset Debt
Our Real Asset Debt Strategy invests in publicly traded debt securities of global real estate, infrastructure and natural resource companies. Our objective is to provide investors with consistent returns across the corporate high-yield and investment-grade debt of companies with tangible underlying assets, while maintaining an overarching focus on capital preservation.

We are value investors who seek fundamentally creditworthy, attractively priced companies generating stable cash flows. Our portfolio construction and risk management processes are informed by extensive in-house research at the security level. Our team also benefits from Brookfield’s extensive informational resources, active participation in the global capital markets and direct investment experience across various real asset classes.

How to Invest
Investors can participate in our Real Asset Debt Strategy through separately managed accounts and closed-end funds.
Real Asset Solutions
Brookfield’s diversified real asset solutions invest in multiple asset classes across the capital structure and liquidity spectrum. Our strategies can approach individual investor needs  through several vehicle types, from separately managed accounts and private placements to SEC-registered mutual funds and UCITS. These solutions can offer a diversified approach to listed real assets, or combine these securities with private-market investments.  We also customize the strategies to meet the specific needs of our clients.
Diversified Real Assets Strategy
Our Diversified Real Assets Strategy invests globally in the equity and debt securities of publicly traded companies that derive cash flows from real assets. This multi-strategy solution allocates actively to three liquid real asset classes: real estate equities, infrastructure equities and real asset debt. Other asset classes are deemed to be more opportunistic in nature. Examples include natural resource equities, commodities and TIPS, where the potential to add alpha is greater in periods of elevated inflation.

In each of these asset classes, we seek the best opportunities on the basis of relative valuation and the potential for excess returns. Our goal is to identify the optimal combination of assets that balance the investment objectives of portfolio diversification, inflation protection, capital appreciation and current income. This approach combines diversified exposure to real asset cash flows with dynamic asset allocation, with the added public-market benefits of daily pricing, ongoing liquidity and corporate transparency.

Real Assets Hybrid Fund
The Real Assets Hybrid Fund provides a single-solution way to manage allocations across private funds and public securities in several real asset classes. This structure allows investors to diversify the drivers of risk and return across multiple investments, while also maintaining the liquidity to i) seek alpha-generating opportunities in periods of public-market dislocations ii) allocate to private markets across multiple vintage years and sectors and iii) meet periodic private-fund capital calls.
How to Invest
We offer multiple points of entry to our Real Asset Solutions, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds and UCITS funds.

Overview
Brookfield Investments Corporation (the “Company”) makes investments in the forest products and property sectors. The Company’s sole common shareholder is Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (“Brookfield”), and Brookfield owns more than $1.0 billion of the Company’s retractable preferred shares.
Effective on December 22, 2015, Brookfield has provided a full and unconditional subordinated guarantee of the Company’s outstanding Class 1 Senior Preferred Shares, Series A (the “Preferred Shares”), other than those held by Brookfield or its affiliates. As a result, the Company will be entitled to rely on an exemption from the requirements to file certain continuous disclosure documents with Canadian securities regulators, including financial statements, on the basis that holders of the Preferred Shares will have access to certain continuous disclosure filings on Brookfield as the guarantor. Certain financial information of the Company will be included in the consolidated summary financial information in Brookfield’s consolidated annual financial statements and interim reports going forward.
The Guarantee will terminate (subject to any existing rights or claims at the time of such termination) upon among other things, the date that no Preferred Shares are outstanding or the date the Company commences filing its own continuous disclosure materials with Canadian securities regulators. A copy of the Guarantee has been filed on SEDAR under the profile of the Company. Investors should refer to that filing for the complete terms of the Guarantee.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
