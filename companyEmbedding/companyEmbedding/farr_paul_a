Swatara Park Rebrand
Swatara Park was an amusement park that my family used to own and operate from 1938-1971. This project is a reimagining of the park—bigger and better—for a modern reopening. To show this, I created a map, food packaging, and an app for the park, as well as several comps and mockups to showcase other visual elements of the park.Art Director: Paul KeppleDesigner/Illustrator: Will FarrInstitution: Tyler School of Art, Temple University










Concussion Puzzle
Traumatic brain injuries are puzzling. Simply one is enough to cause irreparable mental health defects. Further cranial injuries are likely to compound any detrimental effects. Concussed seeks to piece out the numerous concussions that one brave designer sustained and overcame in his quest to graduate, and convey how one may find a piece of themselves missing after a concussion.Art Directors: Melissa McFeeters, Dermot Mac CormackDesigner/concussion survivor: Will FarrInstitution: Tyler School of Art, Temple University

Forks of Nature Restaurant Identity
This project required designing and branding an entire restaurant from scratch. To effectively execute the disaster aesthetic, each menu entry, beer bottle, and take out collateral were styled in weather related imagery and terminology. The conclusion of this project was producing a branding standards manual to explain the thought process going into every aspect of the brand.Art Director: Kelly HolohanDesigner: Will FarrInstitution: Tyler School of Art, Temple University

40 Days In Rome Spreads
While studying abroad in Rome for a collaborative design workshop, we created conceptual spreads based on the sites we visited: The Coliseum, San Clemente, San Sebastiano, and St. Peter's Basilica. I wanted to try a different style for each location, so ended up using a wide arrange of techniques and even experimented with hand drawn type.Art Director: Paul SheriffDesigner/Illustrator: Will FarrInstitution: Temple Rome, Temple University










Posters Against Ebola
This poster uses the letterforms of "Ebola" and "Fear" to illustrate a skeleton, which was sold at the gallery exhibition "Posters Against Ebola" to support Doctors Without Borders.Client: Doctors Without BordersArt Director: Kelly HolohanIllustrator/Designer: Will FarrInstitution: Tyler School of Art, Temple University










Burning Man Rebrand
This project was to rebrand the Burning Man Festival into a new visual identity that still reflected what the event and activities represented on a T-shirt, water bottle, bag, ticket, and promo flyer. I went for a more primal and "return to nature" approach with rougher, grittier aesthetics that are combined with smaller items so that each piece can easily be worn simultaneously.










Daily Designs & Doodles
In an effort to maintain the flow of creative juices, I play around with goofy ideas and styles and polish them a little.










Lyric Book
For this project, I interpreted the song, "Slow Cheetah" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and illustrated it into a narrative about escaping from the 9-5 and returning to nature.Art Director: Dusty SummersIllustrator/Designer: Will FarrInstitution: Tyler School of Art, Temple University










Pick Up Your S!#@
One of society's greatest plagues is the dog owner that doesn't pick up their dog's feces. The aim of this poster is to address this issue. This poster was made using photography and a variety of foods to replicate dog poop. Art Direction: Kelly Holohan

Paul K "PK". Farr Jr. 71 of Jonesboro, Indiana died on Tuesday, October 27, 2015, at Marion General Hospital after becoming ill at work.
Born Wednesday, December 1, 1943 in Marion, Indiana, he was the son of the late Paul K. Farr Sr. and the late Georgia Hutchison  Farr.  Paul attended   VanBuren Schools and went to work at General Motors at a young age where he was a die setter.  He recently received his 50 year ring.  He also owned and operated Farr's Lawn Service and Farr's Snow Removal.  Gardening was  one of Paul's passions, supplying many of his friends and co-workers with green beans and tomatoes.   He attended Fairmount Wesleyan Church where he was known by all the kids as the Donut Man.  You could find Paul early on Sunday Morning trying to get in the doors of the church with several boxes of donuts and the kids gathered around him.  He greeted everyone with a smile, a mint, a story, and a whole lot of teasing.  He will be missed.  Paul loved to go camping and fishing in Chetek, Wisconsin where he and Winona went every year since 1982.  He also enjoyed going to the modified truck and tractor pulls in Ohio.  
Paul is survived by his wife of 37 Years, Winona A. Custer Farr.  They were married in Swayzee, IN on June 2, 1978.
Also surviving are sons, Kevin  Farr . Ohio and Robert (Imelda) Farr of Villa Rica, GA, 
Daughter-in-law; Tina (Pete Boardman) Farr, Tipton, IN
sister, Norma (Gerald) Eakins of Van Buren, IN;
Four grandsons: Conner, Clayton, Collin, Caleb Farr and one granddaughter, Genevieve Farr.
Father and mother In- laws:  John & Donna Custer of Fairmount and RuthAnn Custer of Marion.
Many brothers and sisters-in-law, nieces and nephews.
He was preceded in death by a sister Janet Farr.
A Funeral service will be at 10:00 AM on Monday at Fairmount Wesleyan Church with the Pastor Steve Fletcher and Pastor Jeff Luedtke officiating. Interment will be in Gardens of Memory, Marion, IN.
The family will receive friends from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM on Sunday, November 1, 2015, at Fairmount Chapel Armes-Hunt Funeral Home and Cremation Services, 415 S. Main St., Fairmount, Indiana.
