Jonathan Gregory













                    
                    Jonathan Gregory is a British writer who had lived and worked in Sweden for the past twenty-six years. He started writing because he was having trouble finding books he wanted to read or was disappointed by the best sellers he purchased. He loves reading books from different genres but began to get bored with the formula approach that so many followed. Having served his time sending off books to agents and collecting rejection slips, he kept on writing and refining his stories. He loves good stories that don't just follow a typical formula and he loves books that are easy to read; not simple but focusing on the story line and the characters rather than proving how clever the writer is using English! He loves how enthusiastic Kindle and Amazon are towards new writers; so different from the 'go away and die' approach of so many agents.His first book, Nice People, is a classic gay novel based around the growing relationship between two men from very different backgrounds whose past experiences constantly affect their future together. The second, Country Life, is a new take on the English country murder mystery where the main focus is the community, not just the crime. It is the first volume of the Gemini & Flowers mystery series. The second book, Family Life, was published in February 2013. The third book, In Real Life, came out in August 2013. It was a finalist in the Lambda Mystery Book prize for 2013.The fourth book, After Life, came out in February 2014. It was nominated for the Lambda prize for that year.The fifth, Unsporting Life, was published in January 2015. The series has a website, www.thegeminiandflowersmysteries.comHe has also published a future history novel, The Stone Age, in the classic English science fiction tradition. He has also released a book of short stories, Accidental Murderer, published in August, 2015. He can be contacted via jonathangregorysweden@gmail.comJonathan does have a blog which looks at how Country Life developed and where the rest of the Gemini & Flowers series will go. As he lives in Sweden, it has the following Internet address: http://geminiandflowers.blogspot.se
