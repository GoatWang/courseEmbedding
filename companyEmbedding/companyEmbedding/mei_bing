Product Description
Shou Mei is a style of white tea production using one bud and 2-3 leaves. These cakes come from Taimu Mountain, one of the most famous areas in Fuding.  The tea gardens are located between 600 and 800 meters of elevation in the Taimu Mountains, the authentic place for white tea. The Taimu Mountains are a national nature reserve (also referred to as a National Geopark). The environment there is truly unparalleled. While white tea has a long history dating back to the famous “Tea Classic” by Luyu, and aging of white tea has been practiced in Fuding for countless years, white tea has only been made into cakes (or bing cha, like puer tea cakes) since approximately 2000.
beTeas is proud to offer this direct-sourced tea by our partners at Zhen Tea of Ottawa. This special Shou Mei tea is grown in gardens at  Yipianwa (meaning “a piece of earthen tile”) Temple. The tea from Yipianwa Temple is meticulously cared for by Shi Tai and Chanxin Shi Fu. During the busy tea season, they recruit help from the valley, but most of the time it is only the two of them looking after the tea fields. Although we cannot provide organic certification for this tea, it is clear that the gardens receives meticulous care and the tea grown is extremely healthy and flourishes. The proof is found in your cup and your palette!
Each cake is 357g.

Reviews (0)



Product Description
2006 Shou Mei Bing – 寿眉饼 Longevity Eyebrow Cake.  Due to the rising awareness and popularity of white tea in china in the late 1990’s, as well as interest in the aging and collecting of white teas, Fuding tea producers have since the early 2000’s begun to press white teas into cakes (bings) and bricks in the style of Pu Er and other hei cha (fermented teas), which are also aged.  Though white tea is traditionally produced as loose leaves, which age faster, cakes are more collectible, compact, and easy to transport and store.  The dense form also changes the aging process, yielding a slower, but more thorough and transformative, maturation.  This 10-year-old cake of Shou Mei “Longevity Eyebrow” is past the 7-year “treasure” mark and has a sweet honey fragrance, rich dried fruit profile with a deep and syrupy mouthfeel.  It has also started to take on some of the earthy notes associated with hei cha, as a result of natural fermentation over time.
