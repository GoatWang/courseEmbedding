I was saddened to read of Billy Joe's passing. I so enjoyed sharing in his wonderful southern humor and his passion for sharing in God's word. He set a wonderful example for those whose life he touched. We know he now sits at the  right hand of God in the promise of the Bride.
May God's love and promise of everlasting life give you comfort is this time of sorrow.
Your neighbor from down the road a piece.....

Description


Product Details




                    The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance.
The Memorial Candle Program has been designed to help offset the costs associated with hosting this Tribute 
Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of Billy Joe White can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month


Candle will be lit for the limited time of one year


Candle will be lit indefinitely

 Just received my Mywalit Flapover bag at 7.30 this morning. Bought the ruby rose colour which is true to the web picture. The bag is beautiful, simple clean design and bigger than it first looks. The leather and suede are unbelieveably soft and I've already had several comments from jealous friends. C.C, Tyne and Wear1
