Biography[edit]
He was born in Liverpool, Pennsylvania in 1820. He was educated as a civil engineer, but became interested in the coal and iron industry. While directing a smelting establishment in Pennsylvania, Walters produced the first iron manufactured from mineral coal in the United States.[1]
He moved to Baltimore in 1841, where he worked as a grain merchant and in 1847 became established as a liquor wholesaler.[1]
He spent much of the American Civil War in Europe, where he studied and purchased art. After the end of the war, he returned to the United States, where he invested in banking and railroads, founding the Atlantic Coast Line.[1] He was appointed as the United States commissioner at the Paris expositions of 1867 and 1878, and also to that at Vienna in 1873.[1] In the late 1880s he took in business in the horse trade, importing Percheron horses with his partner Samuel Hopkins.[2]

Marriage and family[edit]




Ellen Harper Walters (George Augustus Baker, circa 1859)


In 1846, Walters married Ellen Harper (1822–62), daughter of a prosperous Philadelphia merchant and his wife. They had a son Henry (b. 1848) and daughter Jennie Walters. Ellen died young of pneumonia, contracted when they were traveling in England.
Art collector[edit]
With his success in business secured, Walters turned to art collection, purchasing contemporary American and European works. During the American Civil War, he took his wife to Europe and lived in Paris. (Their children were in boarding school in the US part of the time.) They traveled widely in Europe, where Walters cultivated his interest in art, and purchased numerous additions for his collection.[1]
In addition to contemporary European work, Walters began to collect Asian art and ceramics. His private collection became one of the largest and most valuable in the United States.[1]
From 1874 onwards, Walters opened his house in Mount Vernon Place to the public most springs, with a 50 cent entrance fee; all proceeds went to charity. This annual exhibit of his gallery netted $30,000 for the poor of Baltimore.[1]
Brayton Ives, a New York financier, made a well known collection of rare and historical swords. When he ceased collecting, the historical swords were sold, and through the efforts of Mr. Heber R. Bishop, William Thompson Walters and the American Art Association, the valuable sword collection, valued at $15,000, was donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[3]
At his death in 1894, Walters had bequeathed his collection to his son Henry Walters, who had also been collecting art. He added to it greatly, and founded the Walters Gallery (now the Walters Art Museum) in Baltimore at Mount Vernon Square. He donated this to the city of Baltimore at his death in 1931 for the benefit of the public.

Insider Trading Charges for Gambler


Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, announced criminal charges against the ex-chairman of Dean Foods and a high-rolling sports gambler.

                    By CNBC on                                                                Publish Date May 19, 2016.

Phil Mickelson has five major golf championships and countless endorsement deals. Thomas C. Davis, a former investment banker, has a Harvard pedigree and a country club lifestyle.They also had a secret.Both men owed money to William T. Walters, a high-rolling Las Vegas kingmaker, often considered the most successful sports bettor in the country.Now, federal authorities say those debts were at the center of a long-running insider trading scheme.Federal prosecutors in Manhattan on Thursday unveiled criminal charges against Mr. Walters, saying that illegal stock tips from Mr. Davis helped him generate some $40 million in profits and avoided losses. They also charged Mr. Davis, who has agreed to plead guilty and who is cooperating against Mr. Walters.

Mr. Mickelson was not accused of wrongdoing. But the Securities and Exchange Commission listed him in a civil complaint as a relief defendant, arguing that he was “unjustly enriched” and must disgorge “ill-gotten gains” he made from trades Mr. Walters recommended. Mr. Mickelson, known as “Lefty,” agreed to repay nearly $1 million, and his lawyer said he “takes full responsibility for the decisions and associations that led him to becoming part of this investigation.” Continue reading the main story

The investigation hinged on Mr. Davis’s mounting debts, which were far larger than Mr. Mickelson’s and which may have provided a motive to share inside information.Mr. Davis retired from investment banking at Credit Suisse First Boston in 2001, the government said, but not from the free-spending lifestyle it enabled. His finances were so troubled, the authorities said, that he even misused money from a charity.Mr. Walters also lent him money. Mr. Davis, then the chairman of Dean Foods, returned the favor by feeding Mr. Walters boardroom secrets as far back as 2008, the authorities say.

To disguise the scheme, they said, the two men used disposable cellphones and created “a secret code” for discussing Dean Foods, a Dallas company, referring to it as “the Dallas Cowboys.”“Davis breached his duty and broke the law as the result of being in dire financial straits,” Andrew J. Ceresney, the head of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, said at a news conference on Thursday. And Mr. Walters, who was arrested at a resort in Las Vegas late Wednesday, was “gambling on a sure thing.”The case, however, is much broader than a story about gambling debts. The charges represent one of the most notable insider trading prosecutions since a federal appellate court overturned two prominent convictions — a ruling that led to the dismissal of about a dozen other convictions.After the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the convictions of two hedge fund managers, Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, in December 2014 — and in the process imposed the greatest limits on prosecutors in a generation — the government predicted a chilling effect on future insider trading investigations. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, who led a sweeping crackdown on insider trading, warned that the ruling could allow “a potential bonanza for friends and family of rich people.”

But in charging both Mr. Walters and Mr. Davis with securities fraud and wire fraud, his office and the S.E.C. are sending a message that these cases can still be made.“Brazen insider trading continues to be a blot in our securities markets, and so the integrity of our markets continues to be a priority for this office,” Mr. Bharara said at the news conference. Still, he added that “there is conduct that we think is nefarious and undermines faith in the market and undermines the strength of the market that will not be able to be prosecuted because of the Newman decision.”Mr. Walters’s lawyer said his client had done nothing wrong. “Bill Walters is a true American success story, whose extraordinary accomplishments as a lawful sports gambler have been widely recognized and lauded,” the lawyer, Barry Berke, said in a statement. “Mr. Walters and his counsel look forward to his day in court.”This is not the first time Mr. Walters, who is 69, has been the subject of a criminal investigation. He has faced charges four times, none of which resulted in a conviction.The latest investigation of Mr. Walters centered largely on trading in shares of Dean Foods, the nation’s largest milk processor, and its decision to spin off a subsidiary.

                Insider Case Against Gambler and Dean Foods Ex-Chairman            

                Federal authorities announced criminal charges against the ex-chairman of Dean Foods and a sports gambler with ties to prominent athletes and corporate executives.            








                    OPEN Document                




The court filings detail the following:Days after learning of the planned spinoff in 2010, Mr. Davis flew to Las Vegas to meet with Mr. Walters. On the next business day, Mr. Walters purchased a million shares of Dean Foods.The deal was delayed. But two years later, while at his country club, Mr. Davis dialed into a Dean Foods conference call to discuss a renewed spinoff effort.

Three minutes after the call ended, Mr. Davis rang Mr. Walters. Nine minutes after that, Mr. Walters called his stockbroker to buy more shares.Mr. Walters also called Mr. Mickelson and recommended that he buy shares in Dean Foods. At the time, Mr. Mickelson owed money to Mr. Walters on a gambling debt. The S.E.C. said some of the nearly $1 million in trading profit Mr. Mickelson made on shares of Dean Foods went to reimburse Mr. Walters.

Mr. Mickelson, who has a reputation for betting on sports, may not have known the origins of the tip. But on at least two occasions, the F.B.I. contacted Mr. Mickelson to seek his cooperation in the case against Mr. Walters, people briefed on the investigation have previously said. Once, agents approached him on a golf course, another time at an airport hangar.At Thursday’s news conference in Lower Manhattan, the S.E.C. displayed a chart with the heading: “Mickelson’s Trades in Dean Foods.”Gregory Craig, a lawyer for Mr. Mickelson, described the three-time winner of the Masters golf tournament as “an innocent bystander.”“Phil understands and deeply respects the high professional and ethical standards that the companies he represents expect of their employees, associates and of Phil himself,” Mr. Craig said in a statement. “He subscribes to the same values and regrets any appearance that, on this occasion, he fell short.”Through all the illicit trades that underpin the case against Mr. Walters, Mr. Davis was the common thread.

In addition to the 2012 spinoff, Mr. Davis provided Mr. Walters with “sneak previews” of at least six quarterly earnings statements for Dean Foods, the S.E.C. said.Authorities say that Mr. Davis also tipped Mr. Walters to a not-yet-public activist campaign by a group of hedge fund investors who were looking to shake things up at Darden, which owns restaurant chains including Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse.In the summer of 2013, Mr. Davis was approached by a representative of the group about its intention to acquire shares in Darden. Mr. Davis signed an agreement that he would keep the plans confidential but he told Mr. Walters nonetheless, authorities said.

Mr. Davis also “misappropriated” $100,000 from a charity he ran that raised money for a battered-women’s shelter in Dallas, according to the court filings. He took the money to pay down a gambling debt at a Las Vegas casino.The charges against Mr. Davis include perjury — authorities said he lied to the S.E.C. during a deposition last year — and obstruction of justice because he “corruptly altered” and destroyed evidence in May 2014 when news of the investigation first emerged. Mr. Davis resigned as chairman of Dean Foods last August.Thomas M. Melsheimer, a Dallas lawyer representing Mr. Davis, said his client was “pleased to be assisting the government in its investigation.”The case against Mr. Walters comes as prosecutors reassess their ability to bring insider trading cases. The appeals court ruling constrained the pursuit of cases involving the sharing of inside information between friends. Specifically, the appeals court required “proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective, consequential and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature.”The case against Mr. Walters addressed the issue of “pecuniary” gain head-on. The 40-page indictment not only details Mr. Walter’s longtime friendship with Mr. Davis — they first met 20 years ago on a golf course — but that he had entered into numerous business deals and personal loans with him.They invested in a software company together. Mr. Walters arranged for a friend to provide Mr. Davis with a $625,000 personal loan. And as Mr. Davis fell deeper into financial trouble, Mr. Walters helped bail him out with a $350,000 loan that was never repaid.“It’s a straightforward announcement that the Southern District is still in the insider trading prosecution business,” said Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor, who is now a professor at Columbia Law School. “It’s also a reminder that however important Newman is, if the facts are there, you can take on the burden of proving precisely the kind of exchange that Newman demanded.”

Four times, the authorities went after the famed Las Vegas sports gambler William T. Walters, and four times the man known as Billy emerged victorious.But on Friday, Mr. Walters’s luck turned, as a federal jury in Manhattan convicted him on fraud and conspiracy charges in one of the biggest insider trading trials in years.“To say that I was surprised would be the understatement of my life,” Mr. Walters, who is 70, told reporters as he left the courtroom. “If I would have made a bet I would have lost. I just did lose the biggest bet of my life. Frankly I’m in total shock.”His lawyer, Barry H. Berke, said he would appeal the verdict.Mr. Walters, one of the most successful professional sports gamblers in the country, was accused in the latest case against him of using nonpublic information from Thomas C. Davis, a board member of Dean Foods of Dallas, to make more than $40 million from 2008 to 2014 by realizing profits and avoiding losses.

The investigation into Mr. Walters’s activities and subsequent trial drew in prominent figures like Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire investor and unpaid adviser to President Trump, and Phil Mickelson, the champion professional golfer. Continue reading the main story

The conviction of Mr. Walters lifted something of a cloud that had hung over the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan since December 2014, when a federal appeals court threw out the insider trading convictions of two hedge fund managers. That ruling led prosecutors to vacate the convictions and guilty pleas of several other people.The verdict against Mr. Walters was also a coda to a series of insider trading prosecutions led by Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan who was fired days before the trial began.The jurors in Mr. Walters’s case reached their decision after deliberating for a little more than half a day, rendering a swift decision in a trial that lasted 14 days spread over four weeks.The quickness of the verdict vindicated of the government’s trial strategy, including a decision to give a central role to Mr. Davis, an acknowledged embezzler and philanderer who had pleaded guilty to several offenses connected to the insider trading scheme.Mr. Davis, the government’s main witness, had his credibility repeatedly called into question by lawyers for Mr. Walters. The defense team said Mr. Walters had been falsely implicated by Mr. Davis, who was desperate to escape punishment for his own misdeedsOne juror interviewed outside the federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan where the trial was held said that he and the rest of the jury had not been swayed by that argument.“We looked at his credibility,” the juror, Lonnie Drinks, said of Mr. Davis. “Everything was factored.”

Mr. Walters was convicted of 10 charges of securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy, the most serious of which carry a potential sentence of up to 20 years in prison.“Armed with his illegal edge, Walters made huge, perfectly timed trades, at times accounting for over a third of the trading volume in Dean Foods stock,” Joon H. Kim, the acting United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. “In engaging in his yearslong stock fraud scheme, Walters underestimated law enforcement’s resolve to pursue and catch those who cheat the market.”Mr. Walters, who was once profiled by “60 Minutes” because of his betting prowess, was not the only big name to come up during his trial.Mr. Icahn emerged in testimony and court filings as having had frequent discussions with Mr. Walters. A broker for Mr. Walters testified on cross-examination that some of Mr. Walter’s stock-trading ideas had come from Mr. Icahn, who was not charged with wrongdoing.During a hearing outside the presence of the jury, one of Mr. Walters’s lawyers told the judge that Mr. Walters and Mr. Icahn were friends.

The lawyer, Paul Schoeman, added: “Mr. Walters has a long history of investing in stocks that Mr. Icahn has publicly announced he’s interested in.”Mr. Mickelson was also mentioned during the trial as someone who had traded in Dean Foods shares and once owed nearly $2 million in gambling debts to Mr. Walters.Mr. Mickelson made roughly $1 million trading Dean Foods shares; he agreed to forfeit those profits in a related civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Known as “Lefty” for his left-handed stroke, Mr. Mickelson was not criminally charged. Though he was once seen as a potential witness at Mr. Walters’s trial, he was never called to testify.

Prosecutors said that Mr. Walters had tried to hide his actions by supplying Mr. Davis with a prepaid cellphone called the Bat Phone to use while conveying secret information and by sometimes speaking in code.During the trial, prosecutors displayed phone logs and trading records, and an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified that Mr. Walters sometimes made major trades within moments of speaking with Mr. Davis on the phone.For instance, the agent testified, Mr. Davis and Mr. Walters spoke on the phone for 10 minutes one day in 2008 beginning at 12:54 p.m. At 1:05 p.m., Mr. Walters bought 462,200 shares of Dean Foods stock for about $9.3 million.Mr. Davis provided Mr. Walters with secret Dean Food information about future earnings statements, the planned purchase of another company and a pending initial public offering, prosecutors said.At the same time, Mr. Walters arranged for loans of nearly $1 million to Mr. Davis, who had financial problems and repaid only a small portion of what he borrowed, prosecutors said.Defense lawyers offered a contrasting account. They said that Mr. Walters was a skilled and fearless trader, referred to by one of his brokers as “the Babe Ruth of Risk,” who did not need inside information. Mr. Davis, Mr. Walters’s lawyers said, was trying to save himself by maligning Mr. Walters.The competing narratives were on display throughout the trial. Mr. Davis testified that he had acted as a “virtual conduit” of secrets and had supplied Mr. Walters with an “enormous” amount of information.At one point, Mr. Davis said, Mr. Walters provided him with the Bat Phone to use while communicating about Dean Foods, adding that later he had thrown it into a creek after federal agents visited his home.

Mr. Davis also testified that Mr. Walters sometimes spoke in code, using “Dallas Cowboys” to refer to Dean Foods and asking “How’s the milkman doing?” when inquiring about the company, then the country’s largest dairy processor.Defense lawyers cross-examined Mr. Davis at length, eliciting acknowledgments that he had been squeezed for money, had taken $100,000 from a charity he ran, had mislabeled expenses on his taxes and had lied to many people, including investigators with the S.E.C.Mr. Walters’s lawyers suggested that Mr. Davis had misled prosecutors about his sports gambling habits and his contact with prostitutes, at one point reading into the record phone numbers for escort services in Chicago, Denver, New York and San Francisco that Mr. Davis, who told prosecutors he had not hired prostitutes in recent years, had called in 2010, 2011 and 2014.Mr. Berke also questioned the existence of what he called the “so-called Bat Phone,” which was never recovered, pointing out that Mr. Davis had first told prosecutors that it was black before then testifying at trial that it was maroon.

Southern District of New York



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Thursday, May 19, 2016 
William T. “Billy” Walters Charged In Manhattan Federal Court With Insider Trading
Thomas C. Davis, former Chairman of the Board of Directors of Dean Foods Company, Has Pled Guilty to His Role in the Scheme and is Cooperating with the Government
Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Diego Rodriguez, the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and Philip R. Bartlett, Inspector-in-Charge of the New York Office of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (“USPIS”), announced the arrest of WILLIAM T. WALTERS, a/k/a “Billy,” on charges of participating in a scheme, from in or about 2008 through in or about 2014, to commit insider trading principally relating to securities of Dean Foods Company (“Dean Foods” or the “Company”).  In addition, Mr. Bharara announced the unsealing of charges against THOMAS C. DAVIS, who pled guilty and admitted to his participation in the scheme earlier this week.  On a number of occasions beginning in 2008, DAVIS, who routinely possessed material, nonpublic information through his service on the Dean Foods’ Board of Directors, betrayed his duty of confidentiality to the Company by providing this information to WALTERS before it was publicly announced.  As alleged in the charging documents, WALTERS, in turn, used the confidential information to execute profitable trades in Dean Foods that netted him realized and unrealized gains and avoided losses of more than $40 million.  In exchange, WALTERS provided DAVIS with substantial pecuniary benefits, including, among other things, capital for joint business ventures and two loans of nearly $1 million that DAVIS largely did not repay.
WALTERS, who is charged with conspiracy, securities fraud, and wire fraud, was arrested yesterday in Las Vegas, Nevada, and will be presented later today before a United States Magistrate Judge in the District of Nevada.  His case is before United States District Judge P. Kevin Castel in the Southern District of New York.  On Monday, DAVIS pled guilty before Judge Castel to conspiracy, securities fraud, wire fraud, obstruction of justice, and perjury.
In a separate action, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filed civil charges against WALTERS and DAVIS. 
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: “Tom Davis has admitted that, over five years as a Dean Foods board member, he repeatedly and systematically fed material nonpublic information about the company to Billy Walters, who we allege benefited handsomely by trading on that information.  With a direct channel into Dean Foods’ boardroom, Walters allegedly traded in advance of good news and bad news alike.  As alleged, it was all good news for Walters, because he had the information before everyone else – he had tomorrow’s headlines today.  Brazen insider trading continues to be a blot on our securities markets, and so the integrity of our markets continues to be a priority for this office.  When the board member of a Fortune 500 company feeds inside information to a professional gambler who makes a fortune on well-timed trades in that company’s stock, that is a form of corruption – the corruption of our markets.  And we don’t let corruption stand.  We intend to prove every one of these allegations in a court of law.”
FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Diego Rodriguez said: “Trading on inside information for personal gain causes untold devastation in the stock and commodities markets. This kind of criminal behavior keeps wealth concentrated among the powerful, prevents everyday investors from turning a profit, and undermines public confidence in the integrity of the marketplace.  The FBI and our federal partners will continue to work to protect Americans from the devastating consequences of these deceptive practices.”
USPIS Inspector-in-Charge Philip R. Bartlett said: “These individuals were more concerned with their ‘high-roller’ image and the continuation of their lavish lifestyles than they were with adhering to fair and equitable investment regulations.  This arrest should send a message to all that no matter how much money you accrue, no one is above the law and all will be prosecuted equally for their illegal investment practices.”   
According to the allegations in the charging documents unsealed today in Manhattan federal court, including the Indictment,[1] and statements made in court proceedings:
From in or about 2008 through in or about 2014, WALTERS and DAVIS, among others, participated in a scheme to commit insider trading principally related to securities of Dean Foods, a Fortune 500 company that is the largest processor and distributor of fresh milk in the United States.  From in or about 2001 until on or about August 7, 2015, DAVIS served as a member of the Board of Directors of Dean Foods (the “Board”), in which role he regularly possessed material, nonpublic information about Dean Foods, including about the Company’s financial performance and results, including quarterly earnings results; contemplated and actual corporate transactions; and other significant corporate and strategic developments (the “Inside Information”).  In furtherance of the scheme, DAVIS violated his duties of trust and confidence to Dean Foods by providing Inside Information to WALTERS in advance of public announcements.  WALTERS, knowing that DAVIS owed duties of trust and confidence to the Company, used the Inside Information to execute profitable trades in Dean Foods stock.  In total, WALTERS’s trading on the basis of Inside Information netted realized and unrealized profits of approximately $32 million and avoided additional losses of approximately $11 million.  In return for DAVIS providing the Inside Information to WALTERS, WALTERS, among other things, provided capital to DAVIS for joint business ventures and made two loans to DAVIS for approximately $1 million in total, which DAVIS largely did not repay.
In furtherance of the scheme, and to avoid detection by law enforcement, WALTERS provided DAVIS with a prepaid cellular phone to use when passing Inside Information to WALTERS.  Moreover, WALTERS further instructed DAVIS to use code words when discussing the Inside Information, including by referring to Dean Foods as the “Dallas Cowboys.”
Specific Examples of WALTERS’s Insider Trading in Dean Foods
On June 25, 2008, in an unanticipated announcement near the end of the second quarter, Dean Foods informed the public that it had revised upwards its earnings guidance for that quarter.  From June 19 to June 23, 2008, WALTERS purchased nearly four million shares of Dean Foods – which constituted between 29 and 37 percent of the daily trading volume of Dean Foods stock on those days – on the basis of tips provided to WALTERS by DAVIS about the second-quarter financial performance.  As a result of trading on the Inside Information provided by DAVIS, WALTERS earned realized and unrealized profits of approximately $6 million.
On or about Friday, April 9, 2010, WALTERS and DAVIS met in Las Vegas, Nevada.  During that meeting, WALTERS agreed to provide DAVIS with a loan of $625,000, and DAVIS provided Inside Information to WALTERS about Dean Foods’ recent engagement of investment bankers to investigate strategic possibilities related to the separation of WhiteWave-Alpro (the “WhiteWave Spinoff”), a segment of Dean Foods that produced and distributed organic and other branded food and beverage products.  On Monday, April 12, 2010, the next trading day, and up through April 15, WALTERS purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Dean Foods.  Less than three weeks later, DAVIS tipped WALTERS about Dean Foods’ forthcoming first-quarter earnings announcement, which DAVIS knew did not meet Wall Street’s expectations.  On the following two days, Monday, May 3, and Tuesday, May 4, WALTERS sold the approximately 1.5 million shares of Dean Foods he had purchased in April, which sales constituted 29 and 16 percent, respectively, of the daily trading volume for those days.  On May 10, 2010, Dean Foods publicly announced its poor earnings results for the first quarter of 2010 and suspended full-year guidance, which caused the stock to decrease by approximately 28 percent that day.  As a result of his timely sales of Dean Foods stock the prior week, WALTERS avoided losses of $7.3 million.  Moreover, beginning on May 10, 2010, and continuing through May 14, 2010, WALTERS purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Dean Foods stock, thereby re-establishing his previous position in the stock at a reduction in cost of $9.5 million.  
In addition, on or about May 8, 2012, DAVIS provided Inside Information to WALTERS about Dean Foods’ positive first-quarter earnings and its intention to pursue the WhiteWave Spinoff, on the basis of which WALTERS purchased 1.2 million shares of Dean Foods on May 8 and 9, 2012.  On May 9, 2012, Dean Foods announced its earnings results for the first quarter of 2012, which were positive, and that the Company was “mindful of the opportunity . . . to perhaps accrete value for our shareholder.”  After this announcement, Dean Foods stock rose by approximately 10 percent.  In the ensuing months, DAVIS repeatedly provided WALTERS with additional Inside Information about the WhiteWave Spinoff, including the expected timing of the Spinoff announcement on August 7, 2012.  From July 13 through July 31, 2012, WALTERS purchased an additional 2.8 million shares of Dean Foods to raise his total position to 4 million shares. 
On August 7, 2012, Dean Foods announced and that it intended to spin off WhiteWave through an initial public offering (“IPO”), and that the Company would maintain ownership over more than 80 percent of WhiteWave stock following the IPO.  On August 8, 2012, the day after the announcement, Dean Foods’ stock price increased by approximately 40 percent, netting WALTERS unrealized profits of approximately $17.1 million on his 4 million shares of Dean Foods stock.
After the announcement of the WhiteWave Spinoff, DAVIS continued to provide WALTERS with Inside Information about the forthcoming WhiteWave IPO.  By October 25, 2012, the day the IPO was priced above expectations at $17 per share, WALTERS had increased his position in Dean Foods stock to more than 5.3 million shares, which were worth approximately $100 million.  By the end of August 2013, after WALTERS received shares of WhiteWave stock in a dividend made to Dean Foods shareholders in May 2013, WALTERS had sold all of his securities in Dean Foods and WhiteWave for gross proceeds of approximately $110 million.
WALTERS’s Insider Trading in Darden Restaurants, Inc.  
In or about August 2013, DAVIS received, pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement, a confidential investment plan (the “Investment Plan”) from an investment firm in New York, New York (“Investment Firm A”) related to Darden Restaurants, Inc. (“Darden”), a holding company that owned a number of restaurants.  The Investment Plan outlined Investment Firm A’s desire to separate one or more of Darden’s restaurant businesses to unlock additional value in the stock (the “Darden Inside Information”).  DAVIS provided this information to WALTERS, who, on August 20 and 21, 2012, purchased 625,000 shares of Darden worth approximately $30 million.
On October 9, 2013, a national newspaper published an article about a significant investment in Darden by Investment Firm A, among others, with the intent to separate Darden into two companies.  At the end of the trading day, Darden’s stock price had increased from $46.28 per share to $49.57, resulting in unrealized profits for WALTERS of approximately $1 million.
*                      *                      *
WALTERS, 69, is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, four counts of securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and four counts of wire fraud.  Count One carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.  Counts Two through Ten each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.  The charges also carry a maximum fine of $5 million, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense.
On May 16, 2016, DAVIS, 67, pled guilty before Judge Castel to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, four counts of securities fraud, four counts of wire fraud, one count of obstruction of justice, and one count of perjury.  Counts One and Twelve each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison.  Counts Two through Eleven each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.  The charges also carry a maximum fine of $5 million, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense.
The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentences for the defendants will be determined by the judge.
Mr. Bharara praised the work of the FBI and the Postal Inspection Service, and thanked the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) for their assistance.  He also thanked the Las Vegas offices of the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation Division.
The charges were brought in connection with the President’s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force.  The task force was established to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes.  With more than 20 federal agencies, 94 U.S. attorneys’ offices, and state and local partners, it is the broadest coalition of law enforcement, investigatory and regulatory agencies ever assembled to combat fraud.  Since its formation, the task force has made great strides in facilitating increased investigation and prosecution of financial crimes; enhancing coordination and cooperation among federal, state and local authorities; addressing discrimination in the lending and financial markets; and conducting outreach to the public, victims, financial institutions and other organizations.  Since fiscal year 2009, the Justice Department has filed over 18,000 financial fraud cases against more than 25,000 defendants.  For more information on the task force, please visit www.StopFraud.gov.
This case is being handled by the Office’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brooke E. Cucinella and Daniel S. Goldman are in charge of the prosecution.  
The allegations contained in the Indictment are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
 

[1] As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment and the description of the Indictment set forth herein constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.

The History of the Walters Art Museum

William T. Walters' Picture Gallery
 Baltimore, 1884
As you walk through the galleries of the Walters Art Museum, you may be struck by the remarkable beauty and breadth of its collection. More remarkable still, is the fact that this collection was born of the artistic interest and public-mindedness of just two men: William Thompson Walters and his son, Henry. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the two Baltimoreans assembled a diverse range of artwork from around the world—including everything from European master paintings and decorative arts to Greek and Roman antiquities and Far Eastern ceramics. Together, they collected nearly 22,000 works of art, and in doing so, they built the foundation for a museum that offers a one of- a-kind survey of 55 centuries of art.
Today, the collection has grown to more than 35,000 objects. From ancient Egyptian mummy masks and medieval armor, to 19th-century French impressionism and turn-of-the-century art deco, you will see significant works of art from around the world. 
The Walters' redesigned galleries present the museum’s world-class collections to their fullest potential. Our installations evoke the original manner in which the art was displayed, and in turn, provide greater insights into the art and a more personal and rewarding viewer experience.
William & Henry Walters
William Thompson Walters was born on May 23, 1819, in the small mining town of Liverpool, Pennsylvania. The first of eight children, William was brought up with little education and little chance at commercial success. In search of a better life, he moved to the economically booming center of Baltimore at the age of 21. He entered the wholesale liquor trade, but also prospered through investments in East Coast railroads. At age 26, he married Ellen Harper; together the couple had three children: William, Jr., who died in early childhood; Henry, born in 1848; and Jennie, born in 1853. 
Following the lead of other prosperous Baltimoreans, William moved his wife and children from the crowded downtown area to the fashionable, park-like setting of 65 Mount Vernon Place (now 5 West Mount Vernon Place). At the dawn of the Civil War, William, who had mixed loyalties, thought it best to take his family away from the United States. They arrived in Paris in the summer of 1861. During this time, he and his wife started acquiring European works of art. From artists, dealers and exhibitions throughout France, Switzerland, Italy and England, William and Ellen began building the collection that would become the museum we have today.
Sadly, tragedy struck the Walters family shortly after they arrived in Europe. While on a trip to London in November 1862, Ellen contracted pneumonia and died quickly, at the age of 40. William, perhaps to console himself, turned to collecting with even more vigor. At the end of the war, in 1865, he returned to Baltimore with his children. In the spring of 1874, in his first attempt to bring art to the public, William opened his house to visitors every Wednesday in April and May, charging a 50-cent admission fee, which he donated to the Baltimore Association for the Improvement in the Condition of the Poor. These openings became an annual event in 1878 and were eagerly anticipated by Baltimore's residents.
When William died in 1894, he bequeathed his collection to his son. Henry Walters would not only follow in his father's footsteps in business—investing and managing railroads—but would carry on the family interest in art as well. He greatly expanded the scope of acquisitions, including his astounding purchase of the contents of a palace in Rome that contained over 1,700 pieces. This acquisition added Roman and Etruscan antiquities, early Italian paintings, and Renaissance and Baroque works of art to his holdings. Although he spent little time in his native city, Henry continued the work his father had begun by opening his collection to the public. In 1900, he bought three houses on Charles Street adjoining a property he already owned. Henry had the site transformed into a palazzo-like building, which opened to the public in 1909. He died in 1931, bequeathing the building and its contents to the mayor and city council of Baltimore "for the benefit of the public." The Walters Art Gallery, now the Walters Art Museum, opened its doors for the first time as a public institution on November 3, 1934.
—To learn more about the Walters' history, read William and Henry Walters, The Reticent Collectors, by William R. Johnston, Curator Emeritus of 18th- and 19th- Century Art. The book is available at the Museum Store.
