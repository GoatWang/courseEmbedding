HI,
I have a scenario where I need to leverage FileNet search engine and display search results in SharePoint.
If i configure Federated Locations in SharePoint central administration, can I display SharePoint content and FileNet content in same search results web part?
Thanks, kesari suresh

No not in the same web part you can display the search result for sharepoint content but definitely in same search result page using a federated web part you have to show the contents of the external web sites and in the by default web part you can show
 the content of your sharepoint site

Thanks for the quick response.
In a scenario where I create a custom Federated search connector where I do not crawl the source repositorty but leverage its search engine to retrieve results, can i retain the individual document's security from its source repository?
Thanks,kesari suresh

							EntrustSecuring Digital Identities & Information 



Federated Identity
As is the case for its local identities, an enterprise must be able to manage the federated identities used in transactions with employees, partners, and customers. Fundamentally, the enterprise must be able to create (and destroy) a federated identity, and specify what internal resources this federated identity can access.
The demands of federated identity management are consequently the same as for managing local identities within the enterprise boundary, complicated by the issues of interoperability and the privacy concerns inherent in the flow of identity data. Entrust delivers federated identity management via the Entrust GetAccess product suite.

Federated Identity Explained
As originally conceived, the Internet was anonymous. However, while still relevant, anonymity is not supportive of using the Internet for commercial activity — where there is often the need to uniquely identify participants to ensure that suppliers and customers can exchange goods and services and that the appropriate parties can be billed. To address this requirement, Internet identity systems have emerged, ranging from those maintained by merchants to support their B2C transactions to those established within enterprises for employees.
These identity systems are generally not interoperable, identity information held in one system is not generally consumable by another. This lack of interoperability inhibits many emerging business scenarios, including businesses joining together to provide affiliated services to consumers and collaborations and B2B transactions among business partners.
Federated identity addresses this interoperability issue and enables organizations to share trusted identities across the boundaries that separate them. The details and complexity of the identity systems of each are hidden from the other through standards for XML messaging. The OASIS SAML TC , the Liberty Alliance, and WS-Federation are current proposals for these standards.
