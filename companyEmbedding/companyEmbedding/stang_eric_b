Eric B. Stang Named CEO of Ooma
 
Palo Alto, CA - Thursday, January 8th, 2009 
Ooma, Inc. today announced the appointment of Eric B. Stang as President and Chief Executive Officer, and member of the Board of Directors. Effective immediately, Mr. Stang will lead ooma’s overall business activities including product strategy, brand and partnership development, and expansion of the Company’s presence in retail and consumer channels.
“Eric is a proven leader with a wealth of experience building some of the most successful businesses in the consumer products, semiconductors, scientific computer and medical technology industries,” said Tim Weingarten, General Partner of Worldview Technology Partners.
”We are thrilled to welcome Eric to ooma and believe his previous work leading companies through rapid growth, expanding sales and building exceptional brand awareness is critical as ooma takes a leadership position in the competitive consumer electronics industry,” added Andrew Frame, founder and chairman of the board of ooma.
Stang joins ooma from Reliant Technologies, a medical technology company, where he served as President and CEO and member of the board of directors. Prior to Reliant Technologies, Stang acted as Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chairman of the Board of Directors at Lexar, now a subsidiary of Micron. During his seven years at Lexar, Stang played a leadership role in taking the company public, effectively enacted a turnaround strategy, led its growth and entry into new markets, oversaw the development of a consumer brand, and established Lexar products in more than 70,000 storefronts worldwide with revenues in excess of $850 million. Under his leadership, Lexar also became one of the 50 largest public technology companies in Silicon Valley, before its acquisition by Micron.
“ooma is reshaping the way consumers think about traditional phone service,” said Stang. “I am thrilled to join a company that is poised for rapid growth and customer adoption. I look forward to taking the company into new product applications and services, growing our healthy retail partnerships and building upon a successful foundation of product quality and innovation.”
Rich Buchanan, previously interim CEO, will return to his role as Chief Marketing Officer at ooma.

      retail partnerships and building upon a successful foundation of product
