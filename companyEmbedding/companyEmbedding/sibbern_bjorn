An Interview with Bjorn Sibbern of NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen


An Interview with Bjørn Sibbern, President of NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen
Bjørn  Sibbern has been president of NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen since April of  2008. He was the chief executive of E*Trade Bank in Denmark from  2006-2008, and before that he was vice president of customers and  company service at OMX. He spoke with Sarah Rudolph about the Nordic  markets and about the new Genium Inet platform the exchange launched  Monday, which one news story called “the world’s fastest trading  system.” 
Q: Could you tell us a bit about NASDAQ OMX  Copenhagen? What options products do you offer, and what kind of traders  trade there? 
A: In the Danish derivatives market, the most interesting options product is options in large cap  names. That is probably typical for most exchanges. The most heavily  traded name is Vestas Wind Systems, the largest windmill company in the  world. Another is Novo Nordisk, a pharmaceutical company that  specializes in insulin products. That is the highest cap company on  which options are traded. 
Q: Is there a lot of interest in options in Denmark?
A:  I think there is great potential, but traditionally the interest has  been in the cash products. The tax for derivatives has been pretty high,  both from a retail and an institutional perspective. So there has not  been a big tradition of trading options compared to our neighbor Sweden,  for example, which has a much bigger market because of lower taxation  and tradition. But we have seen recent changes in the tax scheme in  Copenhagen, so we have high expectation for growth in the derivatives  market. And investors are becoming better at understanding how you can  use options, in particular for hedging. That is becoming more and more  relevant for investors.
The Danish derivatives market is traded  together with the Swedish and Finnish products on the same platform,  with the same clearing; we have combined the three markets. We currently  have 90 members connected to the Nordic platform. 
Q: What is your most popular product in general at the exchange?
The C20 index is our popular index, similar to the S&P 500 in the U.S. It is the most traded in Copenhagen. In Sweden it is the S30 index. 
Q: Can you trade options on those indexes?
A:  You can, but I think on the index side there is more trading in  futures. In the equity products there is more trading in single name  options than futures.
Q: What technology is NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen currently using, and what are your technology plans for the future?
A:  We just launched a new platform on October 25 called Genium Inet. The  reason for the launch is, of course, that it is much faster – 25 times  faster than the existing system. Speed is one of the main drivers, but  we also believe the new platform is more reliable and more flexible in  functionalities. There is also an enormous increase in capacity. The  system can handle much bigger volume. All that is very important for our  high frequency traders. So now we can move our fixed income and  derivatives onto the same platform. 
I should also mention that  Genium Inet is a system we have sold to other exchanges. NASDAQ OMX has  sold trading systems to more than 60 exchanges around the world – either  trading systems or clearing systems. We are a big system provider  around the world. We have sold Genium Inet to the Australian Stock  Exchange and the Singapore Exchange.
Q: MarketsWiki is holding an event on October 27 called “A World of Opportunity” about accessing international markets. How do you see foreign markets reaching out internationally? 
A:  We have doubled the number of our derivative members in the past year,  and I think the reason behind this development is that the world is  becoming more international. It is extremely important for NASDAQ OMX in  the Nordic market to make sure businesses around the world have easy  and cheap access to trade our markets. We spend a lot of time on  infrastructure to make sure it’s reliable and fast and make sure we  reach a global investor base. 
Q: What specific efforts do you make to reach a global investor base?
A:  We spend lot of time trying to add new members to our platforms. The  key is to have interesting products. Our biggest product is the Swedish  Index product. We try to make sure banks and brokers connect to our  markets by securing ECNs and having strong products on the platform. 
Also the fact we are a part of NASDAQ and have access to the US market gives us a great upside. 
Q: What are the regulatory or other obstacles facing U.S. and European citizens who are interested in accessing your exchange?
A:  It’s not easy for US citizens to access the exchange. Currently,  financial institutions in the US cannot have direct electronic access to  trade options. Investors around the world go through Nordic banks or  through banks and brokers in the UK — which are often subsidiaries of  US banks. Half of our member base comes from outside the Nordic  countries, when we look at options and derivatives. 
If and when the SEC issues a no-action relief, our options can be traded by qualified US customers.

Stock market records

 The Danish stock market gears up for a spring-time surge in listings
- a surge that may well be stronger and more wholesome than ever before.
February was nothing short of remarkable. In terms of the number of trades completed, it goes down as the most active month ever on the stock market. Never before have so many share trades been completed in one month.
This equates to a daily trade figure of over DKK 5 billion, deriving from over 80,000 trades a day.
Why is this remarkable? Because the stock market acts as a daily opinion poll. The key to the reliability of this poll is the steadily increasing level of activity which is a good indicator of the trust in the market, in Danish companies and in the economy as a whole.
We are all shareholders, in one way or another, and we all have a stake in an active and effective stock market as it represents a unique cog in the socio-economic ‘wheel’.
On the one hand, it ensures that Danes are able to share in the success of Danish companies and, on the other; it makes it possible for Danish companies to make long-term investments. No other model apart from this hundred-year-old, tried and tested stock exchange model, allows the Danish people to become stakeholders in Denmark’s future, and no other model gives companies such good conditions for sourcing capital.
Warming up for listings
What we have witnessed in the last few months has been the warm-up ahead of the coming months’ listings, where a longer period of higher pricing levels and less uncertainty with regard to direction has made the market particularly attractive to new companies.
From an investor’s point of view, it may be worth considering whether or not to participate in new share issues. According to an experiment conducted by our analysts, investors would have achieved far higher returns on their investments by participating in the last five listings on the stock exchange.
 
 
We call this experiment the Twin test, and we have conducted it in two stages:
1. covering the period from the company’s initial stock market introduction to the end of 2013.
2. covering the period from the company’s initial stock market introduction and one month onwards.
Starting with the latter, the comparison shows that if an investor invests a sum, e.g. 1 per cent of the total share capital issued, and sold it a month after listing, they would, after having participated in the last five listings, achieve a return of 18.2 per cent.
If we imagine that this investor had a twin, who in the same period, at each IPO, invested exactly the same amount in the Copenhagen Benchmark Index instead of in the newly listed company, the total return would have been 2.6 per cent.
The tables below show how great a return an investor saw by investing in a listing compared with what the same investment would have yielded in the Copenhagen Benchmark Index.
 
 

As we can see, not all new listings have been equally successful, but the experiment shows that overall, it has paid to participate in the last five listings on NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen.
Now that several large organisations have set their sights on the Danish stock market, investors will have ample opportunity to participate in new listings.
Welcome to NASDAQ OMX



Interview with  Bjorn Sibbern

December 2013
What have you been doing this week?
I spoke to Børsen about our new Intraday Auction for Mid, Small Cap segments and First North to improve liquidity for investors and companies alike. And Wednesday we hosted Margrethe Vestager at Børsforum where we asked her and a prominent allstar panel of speakers the question: Why do we need a strong Danish Marketplace? The answer created a great debate in the audience and kicked off the public leg of the Danish IPO Task Force to improve listing climate for SMEs. We have one of the strongest marketplaces and it seems obvious that we use it to create more growth for SMEs.
 
Did you have a nice summer, what have you done?
I spent two weeks on Playitas. Sports and free time with family. Besides vacation this summer was a bit busier than usual. We saw higher trading activity not least thanks to June’s listing of Matas, which became the sixth largest IPO of the quarter in Europe and received 15,000 new shareholders.

Where do you prefer to travel on your free time?
With over 100 travel days a year I have no preferences – besides spending time with family and doing sports.

How do you like to  revitalize?
I would say running and playing golf.

Which qualifications do you see as the most important among your colleague?
The two most important are commitment and ability to execute. The ability to move a project from A to B.

Your favourite dish?
Risotto

Your favourite  interests?
Sports.

Which are the hardest challenges for your economy today?
The challenges for the Danish economy is the slow growth in BNP. If we as an economy were better at using the dynamics of the Danish equity market, more companies would be able to raise capital for growth and jobs.

What’s your opinion about the  local exchange role/mission in your economy?
The role of the exchange is to provide a marketplace where investors – ordinary citizens like you and me – can invest our savings in listed companies. It is this ability that has made it possible for listed company to raise capital for growth and jobs since 1808 where we were given status as regulated market place for trading equity.

Which challenges do you think will be the hardest for the local exchange?
On the Danish exchange we have seen a remarkeable increase in turnover and we have had three IPOs among the biggest introductions since 2008. But it is still dificult for small companies to access funding. Together with market participants, we need to have a look at how we improve this channel for SMEs and how we use the great potential and momentum we have on the Copenhagen exchange to open the doors for small companies for more liquidity. A case in point is our introduction of a midday auction at year end to improve liquidity in the smaller segments, among other initiatives that we are working on with market participants.

What are you most proud of at work?
Besides maximising the effeciency of the marketplace so that liquidity and shorter spreads have lowered the cost of trading, and the fact that we have had three of the biggest IPOs in the Nordics, I am very proud of the fact that we in december 2012 launched First North Bond Market – an alternative marketplace for issuing corporate bonds for smaller and midsized unlisted companies. That is an attempt at broadening the road to financing and funding for Danish companies as well as contribute to make it easier to diversify investments.
I want to be the forthcoming, CEO do you have any advice for me?
Hard work beats talent!

What do you wish for Christmas?
I look forward to spend time with my family.

What is your New year’s eve resolution? 
My new year’s resolution is to work hard at taking the good momentum we have on the Copenhagen exchange to build a broader equity culture in Denmark. In Denmark there is a lot of passive capital in bank accounts at practically no interest rate. This saved capital should be activated to provide greater yields and provide greater funding opportunities for Danish companies and Danish growth. And then I aim at cutting my marathon time with 13 minutes to 3.30 Hrs.

Inside Nasdaq: Bjorn Sibbern, Global Information Services, Nasdaq





 






Inside Nasdaq: Bjorn Sibbern, Global Information Services, Nasdaq
Bjorn Sibbern was named Executive Vice President of Global Information Services at Nasdaq last November and has hit the ground running- managing the company’s largest business unit by revenue. He currently resides in his hometown of Copenhagen, but will be relocating to New York City later this month. A Nasdaq veteran, we sat down with Bjorn to learn more about his career and vision for Information Services this year and beyond.Q: You’ve held a number of key roles in the past decade at Nasdaq, can you share with us more about your storied career trajectory?A: I’ve had the pleasure and opportunity to work at Nasdaq for nine years and most recently led and grew our Global Commodities business from Denmark, while also serving as President of the Copenhagen Exchange. Prior, I headed our Nordic Cash Equities and Derivatives Markets. One of my proudest accomplishments was championing the launch and operations of our Futures Exchange (NFX) two years ago. A fun fact that you may not know about me is that I was once a Nasdaq market data customer while serving as the CEO of E*Trade Bank Denmark. It was a positive experience and today I am excited to make the data journey full circle and to now lead our Information Services business that focuses on market data and index products and services.Q: Can you tell us more about the Information Services group- where do you see opportunities to grow the business in 2017?A: Nasdaq Information Services is composed of our Market Data and Index business that provides market data solutions and index benchmarks across all asset classes worldwide. It is one of the company’s largest business units by revenue – representing 22 percent net revenue – and is supported by approximately 120 employees. We offer market data for 90+ solutions and 43,000+ indexes that reach thousands of investment professionals. Having just wrapped up my third month on the job, I see three ways to grow our data and index business this year and beyond. First, by upgrading existing products to provide more value for customers. Second, by building new data & index products and secure further global expansion. And third, by experimenting with machine learning in our Innovation Lab to build analytic products of the future, that we can share with customers today.Q: Technology continues to disrupt the financial services industry- how and what sorts of technologies are disrupting your business?A: Our business is approaching an inflection point where technology is changing the way we think about data and interact with analytics. We are always looking for ways to expand beyond our core data products and are experimenting with advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to develop products that help customers glean stronger insights to make better decisions. In November, we launched Nasdaq Trading Insights – the first product suite to debut from our Innovation Lab – designed to help traders better understand how they perform in the market, how the market behaves, and how they can adjust their strategies to be more successful. We have plans to expand the suite with additional components, including separate products focused on third-party and options data later this year.Q: What index and ETF trends do you see emerging in 2017? What are some index and ETF growth opportunities for Nasdaq?A: The overall trend from active to passive index investing will continue. Last year, approximately 80 percent of active managers failed to meet their benchmark, compared to 60 percent the year prior. Smart beta assets under management (AUM) will continue to grow and chip away from mutual fund AUM. This trend has been strong in the US for years, and we are starting to see these patterns pick up momentum in Europe and in Asia. Our index business is well positioned to continue to take advantage of this trend. We see tremendous opportunity to help asset managers launch ETFs based off our indexes around the world in three ways: by proactively presenting new strategies they may not have thought of, helping them bring to life their own ideas, or by partnering to create something exciting for the investment community.
