RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Real Estate Securities Risk: Real estate securities such as REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) may be affected by economic downturns and changes in real estate values, rents, property taxes, interest rates and tax laws, in addition to geographical concentration risks.Concentration Risk: The fund’s investments are concentrated in issuers of one or a few specific economic sectors,  so the fund may be subject to more risks than if it were broadly diversified across the economy.Common Stock Risk: Common stock returns often have experienced significant volatility.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Leverage Risk: The fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share NAV, market price, and distributions.  Leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative. Leverage is intended to increase common share net income, but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.  Different forms of leverage, including swaps, may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk. Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Foreign Investment Risk: Investments in non-U.S securities involve special risks not typically associated with domestic investments including currency risk, if not hedged - the risk that changes in exchange rates will affect the value of the fund’s investments, as well as adverse political, social and economic developments. These risks often are magnified in emerging markets.Preferred Securities Risk: Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






†† Managed Distribution Policy

				Historical distribution sources have included net investment income, realized gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time which may be viewed at nuveen.com/CEFdistributions. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholders’ 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year. You should not draw any conclusions about a fund’s past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate.
			

				Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.

Objective
The fund's investment objective is a high level of current income and long-term capital appreciation.


Highlights
Potential for enhanced portfolio returns and portfolio diversification through the use of commercial real estate investments offers the potential for:
		

High level of current income  and capital appreciation.
Diversification from equity and debt investments across the capital structure and around the world.
Rising income over time from investments in infrastructure and real estate.
Access to an investment team with significant real asset management experience.




Investment Strategy

			The fund will invest at least 80% of its managed assets in securities or other instruments that provide investment exposure to real assets.  The fund will focus on infrastructure and real estate companies’ securities and may also invest in other real asset related investments including whole loans. The fund will actively manage the portfolio allocation among infrastructure and real estate companies, with flexibility to invest across the capital structure—in any type of equity and debt securities offered by a particular company. All of the fund’s debt may be rated lower than investment grade (Ba1/BB+ or worse by S&P, Moody's, or Fitch), but no more than 10% of the fund’s managed assets may be invested in securities rated CCC+/Caa1 or lower at any time. The fund may invest up to 75% of its managed assets in non-U.S. issuers. The fund may also opportunistically writes call options primarily on securities issued by real asset related companies, seeking to enhance its risk-adjusted total returns over time. The fund uses leverage.

Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Whole Loan Risk: The fund invests in individual loans, which may be relatively illiquid and more difficult to value, and which subject the fund to credit and default risk associated with the individual borrower.Foreign Investment Risk: Investments in non-U.S securities involve special risks not typically associated with domestic investments including currency risk, if not hedged - the risk that changes in exchange rates will affect the value of the fund’s investments, as well as adverse political, social and economic developments. These risks often are magnified in emerging markets.Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) Risk: Investing in MBS entails various risks, including credit risks inherent in the underlying collateral, the risk that the servicer fails to perform its duties, liquidity risks, interest rate risks, structure risks, and geographical concentration risks.Preferred Securities Risk: Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk.Call Risk or Prepayment Risk: Issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled, forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities.Convertible Securities Risk: Convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than non-convertible fixed-income securities of similar credit quality.Call Option Risk: The value of call options sold (written) by the fund will fluctuate. The fund may not participate in any appreciation of its equity portfolio as fully as it would if the fund did not sell call options. In addition, the fund will continue to bear the risk of declines in the value of its equity portfolio.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.
