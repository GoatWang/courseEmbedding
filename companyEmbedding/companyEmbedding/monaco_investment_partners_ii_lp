CUSIP No. 549333300 
 
Series A Preferred Stock
The holders of record of shares of Series
A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company and are entitled to
one hundred (100) votes for each share of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is redeemable at $1.00
per share. The Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to a 10% annual dividend, payable as, when and if, declared by the Board of
Directors, payable on the first day of April, July, October and January.
Per the terms of the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Designations relating to the Series A Preferred Stock, subject to the availability of authorized and unissued shares
of Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock may, by written notice to the Company: 


 
● 
elect to convert all or any part of such holder’s shares of Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock at a conversion rate of the lower of:

 
 
(a) $25.00 per share; or

 
 
(b) at the lowest price the Company has issued stock as part of a financing.

 
●
convert all or part of such holder’s shares (excluding any shares issued pursuant to conversion of unpaid dividends) into debt obligations of the Company, secured by a security interest in all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, at a rate of $25.00 of debt for each share of Series A Preferred Stock.

 
●
elect to convert all or any part of such holder’s shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock, at a conversion rate of two (2) shares of Series A Preferred Stock for every one (1) share of Series C Preferred Stock.

 
On February 28, 2014, the Company’s
Series A Preferred Stock shareholders agreed to authorize a change to the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred
Stock in Nevada to lock the conversion price to the lower of (a) a fixed price of $0.50 per share (two shares of Common Stock for
every one share of Series A Preferred Stock); and (b) the lowest price the Company has issued stock as part of a financing after
January 1, 2006.
In the event of any liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of this Company, either voluntary or involuntary (any of the foregoing, a “liquidation”), holders
of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of this
Company to the holders of the common Stock or any other series of Preferred Stock by reason of their ownership thereof an amount
per share equal to $1.00 for each share (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits with respect to such shares)
of Series A Preferred Stock held by each such holder, plus the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not declared)
from the beginning of the dividend period in which the liquidation occurred to the date of liquidation. Additionally, each holder
of Series A Preferred Stock holds a security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets in order to secure its
obligations in connection with such Series A Preferred Stock.
Except for transfers to family members,
or trusts for the benefit of Series A Preferred Stock holders, no holder of Series A Preferred Stock is able to transfer his/her/its
shares of Series A Preferred Stock. These shares are owned by a) William Kerby, CEO and Chairman of the Company, b) the Monaco
Investment Partners II, LP, of which Donald Monaco, a Director of the Company, is the Managing Partner, and c) the Donald P. Monaco
Insurance Trust, which Donald Monaco, a Director of the Company, is the Trustee.

Guiding Principles
The  overall objective of TMRS’ Investment program is to ensure that members,  retirees, and beneficiaries are provided the benefits they have been promised by  their employers at a reasonable and predictable cost to the employers. Assets will be invested with a total  return posture, given appropriate consideration for portfolio volatility (risk)  and liquidity. Total return includes dividends, interest, and  realized and unrealized capital appreciation


General Objectives 
TMRS investments are held in trust for the exclusive benefit of members and invested under the provisions of the TMRS Act. The investment statutory guidelines for TMRS are found in the Texas Government Code, Sections 855.301 through 855.303. 

Investments are made with the degree of judgment and care,  under the circumstances, that persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence  exercise in the management of their own affairs, considering the probable  income from the securities and probable safety of their capital and in  consideration of the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other  circumstances of the trust. Investment and management decisions respecting  individual assets will be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the investment  portfolio as a whole and as a part of an overall investment strategy having  risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the trust.

2011 Investment Update
In 2011, TMRS continued implementing the following strategic target allocations which were adopted by the Board in June 2009, with implementation to occur over a multi-year period (see pie charts.)
There were several initiatives during 2011 aimed at continuing our progress toward the target allocations, including monthly commitments to U.S. and international equity index funds.  By the end of 2011, the equity target allocations were met with 40% of the fund invested in passively managed equity index funds (20% in domestic equities and 20% in international equities). TMRS began funding its real estate target allocation by committing $200 million to real estate limited partnerships and funding $97 million.  With the assistance of TMRS’ real estate consultant, ORG, TMRS will continue to seek out and fund additional real estate investments over the next few years in order to meet its 10% target.  In addition, TMRS funded its 5% target allocation to the real return asset class through investment in global inflation-linked bonds.  Assets allocated to fixed income managers totaled 54.2% and will gradually move to the 35% target allocation as fixed income funds other asset classes.  
 The Board will continue to authorize implementation to the strategic target allocations in stages. To ensure that the risk tolerance remains appropriate, the target allocations will be reviewed at least annually for reasonableness relative to significant economic and market changes or changes to the Board’s long-term goals and objectives.
2011 Returns
The overall one-year rate of return on the $18.5 billion investment portfolio was 2.41% with fixed income the best performing asset class, earning 7.99%, while the return on equities was 1.03% domestic and -13.35% international.
