Corporate Overview. 





    


Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation (AMI) is a Kennewick, Washington-based late stage development
    company engaged primarily in the development of brachytherapy devices for therapeutic applications. AMI's focus is on transitioning to full operations upon receipt, if any, of FDA clearance for
    its patented brachytherapy cancer products. Brachytherapy uses radiation to destroy cancerous tumors by placing a radioactive isotope inside or next to the treatment area.


 


Since late 2013, AMI has focused its resources on developing a proposed line of brachytherapy products and
    on endeavoring to secure FDA clearance with respect to the initial proposed brachytherapy product. AMI’s proposed brachytherapy products incorporate patented technology developed for Battelle
    Memorial Institute (“Battelle”) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a leading research institute for government and commercial customers. Battelle has granted AMI an exclusive license to
    patents covering these developments for manufacturing, processing and applications for medical isotopes (the “Battelle License”).


 


A prominent team of radiochemists, scientists and engineers, collaborating with strategic partners,
    including national laboratories, universities and private corporations, lead AMI’s development efforts. AMI has been recognized as a leader in the development of new isotope technologies by
    local, state and federal agencies.


 


The Company’s overall objective is to empower physicians, medical researchers, and ultimately, patients, by
    providing them with essential radionuclides that, until now, have not been practical or economical to produce, in an effort to detect, manage, and cure human disease, and improve the lives of
    patients.  The Company’s shorter-term objective is to obtain regulatory approval for its brachytherapy products and to then commercialize those products.

Brachytherapy 

Brachytherapy.


     


    Brachytherapy is the use of radiation to destroy cancerous tumors by placing a radiation source inside or next to the treatment area.  According to
    Global Industry Analysts, by 2016 the U.S. brachytherapy market will reach $2 billion.  It is estimated that the U.S. market represents approximately
    half of the global market.  AMIC believes there are significant opportunities in prostate, breast, liver, pancreatic, head and neck
    cancers.  The 2013 U.S. estimated new cases according to the American Cancer Society are 240,000 prostate cancer, 235,000 breast cancer and 31,000
    liver cancer.


     


Brachytherapy Market


     


    Reliable sources estimate that annual sales of brachytherapy products exceed $1 billion, about half of which are in the United States. The size of the U.S. brachytherapy market for prostate
    cancer brachytherapy is somewhere between $90 million and $130 million per year. The market for liver and breast cancer combined is comparable.

      Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation (AMI)    is a late stage development company engaged primarily in the development of brachytherapy devices and medical isotopes for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.  AMI's focus is on transitioning to full operations upon receipt of FDA clearance for its patented Y-90 brachytherapy product, RadioGel™      What is Brachytherapy?  Brachytherapy is the use of radiation to destroy cancerous tumors by placing a radiation source inside or next to the treatment area.  According to Global Industry Analysts, by 2016 the U.S. brachytherapy market will reach $2 billion.  It is estimated that the U.S. market represents approximately half of the global market.  AMI believes there are significant opportunities in prostate, breast, liver, pancreatic, head and neck cancers.  The 2013 U.S. estimated new cases according to the American Cancer Society are 240,000 prostate cancer, 235,000 breast cancer and 31,000 liver cancer.  What is RadioGel™?  The Y-90 RadioGel™ device is a brachytherapy device comprising highly insoluble Y-90 particles delivered by needle injection using a water-polymer composite for high-dose treatment of non-resectable solid tumors that cannot be treated effectively by any other means. It is designed for maximum safety: to deliver a high, pure-beta radiation dose to target (tumor) tissue, with comparatively small-to-negligible radiation doses to adjacent normal tissues, and with negligible radiation dose to any major organ or tissue in the body. Two key design characteristics of the Y-90 RadioGel™ device that influence safety and efficacy are (1) the ability to place Y-90 particles directly into tumor tissue via injection and (2) yttrium-90 containment within the tumor after injection. Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation has obtained an exclusive license to eight (8) patents related to the Y-90 RadioGel™ device technology for use in high-dose radiation therapy. The license was granted by *Battelle pursuant to an option between Battelle and AMI announced in February 2011. The Agreement grants AMI an exclusive license to make, have made, use and sell the Y-90 RadioGel™ device Yttrium-90 is a well-established medical isotope with many applications in cancer treatment. The combination of insoluble Yttrium-90 particles and the polymer gel carrier offers physicians an opportunity to deliver a safe, effective treatment option at a low cost.  What are the advantages of RadioGel™?  Based upon its studies and analyses, or general application of experience with current brachytherapy devices and Yttrium-90, AMI believes that its brachytherapy products are likely to offer the following benefits, among others, for patients and medical professionals: •Maximizing Therapeutic Index: The short-range beta particles emitted by Y-90 deliver radiation energy within a tight range. This enables radiation to be selectively delivered to target tissues while minimizing radiation dose to nearby normal tissues. High therapeutic indices imply that more radiation energy may be imparted to target tissues, with less radiation reaching adjacent normal tissues. •Half Life: Y-90 has a half-life of just 2.7 days. Many traditional brachytherapy products use isotopes with longer half-lives such as 9.7 days for cesium-131, and sixty days for iodine-125. •Optimized Delivery Method: Current brachytherapy devices place permanent metal seeds in the prostate by using up to 30 large needles. By contrast, AMI’s Y-90 RadioGel™ device is designed to be administered in a minimally invasive procedure with small-gauge needles. •No Permanent Seeds Remaining: Current brachytherapy devices place permanent metal seeds in the tumor. AMI’s Y-90 RadioGel™ device utilizes a biodegradable, non-toxic polymer that is ultimately absorbed by the body. This eliminates the possibility of a long-term seed migration or other problems that may sometimes arise when seeds remain in the body. •Good Safety Profile: Many traditional brachytherapy devices utilize isotopes that emit x-rays (akin to gamma radiation). X-rays or gamma radiation travels within and outside of the body and have long half-lives. AMI’s brachytherapy products use the Yttrium-90 isotope, which is a beta-emitter. The Yttrium-90 beta-emissions travel only a short distance and has a short half life of 2.7 days. •Potential Lower Cost: Yttrium-90 supplies are readily accessible and are relatively inexpensive. The elimination of the metal or glass enclosures used in traditional brachytherapy seeds greatly reduces manufacturing costs.  What is the market for RadioGel™?  Reliable sources estimate that annual sales of brachytherapy products exceed $2 billion, about half of which are in the United States. The size of the U.S. brachytherapy market for prostate cancer brachytherapy is somewhere between $90 million and $130 million per year. The market for liver and breast cancer combined is comparable.   What are the steps for FDA clearance?  AMI met at the FDA offices to discuss next steps, expectations and required testing to progress towards obtaining marketing clearance for the Y-90 RadioGel™ device. The FDA and AMI team are working closely in order to obtain all appropriate data and benchmarks the FDA requires in order to proceed with providing final clearance for marketing the device in the United States.  In August, AMI announced a partnership with IsoTherapeutics Group, a third-party radiopharmaceutical R&D company, to provide commercialization support and conduct additional studies as requested by the FDA for the Y-90 RadioGel™ device. IsoTherapeutics has completed the first stage of the project, comprised of tech transfer, manufacturing and in vitro testing. The next stage, comprised of additional in vitro and in vivo testing. Upon completion of these studies AMI anticiptes submittal (direct de novo) for FDA clearance for full commercialization in the U.S.   Are there other markets for RadioGel™?  On March 15th, 2016, AMI announced the formation of a new, wholly-owned subsidiary, IsoPet Solutions Corporation, to focus on the vibrant and expanding veterinary oncology market. The IsoPet Solutions division will focus on bringing AMI’s yttrium-90 brachytherapy products to veterinary oncologists to treat dogs and cats suffering from tumor cancers. There are over 150 million pet dogs and cats, with over 1/3 of the households in the US owning at least one dog, and just under 1/3 owning at least one cat.  IsoPet Solutions is establishing the infrastructure necessary to provide product to veterinary clinics including regulatory clearances and compliance. The division will also provide product awareness and education to veterinary oncologists. AMI expects the initial treatments to be coordinated through the Chair of the Company’s Veterinary Medicine Advisory Board, Dr. Alice Villalobos and anticipate offering RedioGel™ for vet treatments.

Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. (OTC Pink: ADMD) is engaged within the research, production, and distribution of medical isotopes. Shares of the medical company are rallying 10%, through early trading on Wednesday, May 24, 2017. Over the past month, Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. has seen average daily volume of 206,677 shares. However, volume of 792,153 shares or dollar volume of $102,187, has already exchanged hands on Wednesday.
Shares of Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. are rallying today, after the company released updates on its veterinarian product line. The company announced that its first cat test subject of the new cancer treatment continues to respond well to the treatment, no side effects and is alive and well. A second cat with cancer has been treated with the cancer isotope treatments and will continued to be monitored in the coming weeks. Here is the full press release detailing of the veterinarian cancer treatments:
Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. Press Release:
KENNEWICK, WA / ACCESSWIRE / May 23, 2017 / Advanced Medical Isotope Corp.(OTC PINK: ADMD).
Dear shareholders,
This letter is to inform you of the progress on our veterinarian market activities (IsoPet).
I have been asked about the status of our first cat that was injected in November at Washington State University to treat feline sarcoma. That cat is alive and well after an objective response without any negative side effects. This first treatment, at a relatively low dose, tested our procedures and provided valuable clinical experience.
On May 12, we treated a second cat at Washington State University with a large sarcoma, escalating the therapy dose by about 50 percent. The cat has been returned to her owner and we will monitor the progress on response to therapy over the next several weeks. Results of these early clinical studies will help us to respond to questions posed by the FDA on therapeutic efficacy and safety. The detailed procedures that we are refining with these cat therapies are the same that we will be using to treat human skin cancer. Both are tumors at the surface of the skin.
We will initiate pre-clinical tests in surrogate tumor tissue at Colorado State University this month to complete their safety review and evaluation requirements for first clinical therapeutic use, anticipated in June. Likewise, the independent safety review at University of Missouri will be completed in a month, with first therapy to follow in June. We will next assess the University of California at Davis, which has the reputation of being a premier veterinary teaching center in the United States.
On the financial side, as discussed in our 10-Q, we successfully raised additional interim capital to retire some maturing debt and exchanged the remaining maturing debt that was outstanding for debentures that mature in May of 2018. This removes the near term uncertainty and now allows AMI to fully focus on execution of our plan for an uplisting later in the year.
We timely filed our 10-Q with the SEC and we anticipate holding an annual shareholder meeting in late June or early July. Since the 10-Q is now in the public domain, I have purchased another 100,000 shares of stock since, in my opinion, the stock is undervalued by a significant margin.
Mike Korenko
CEO
Advanced Medical Isotope Corp.

 News | January 08, 2016  
 Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. Progressing Toward FDA Y-90 RadioGel Device Clearance 
 Company will seek class II medical device classification from FDA pending additional in vitro testing
  


 




January 8, 2016 — In November, Advanced Medical Isotope Corp. (AMIC) announced its progress in seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for marketing of its lead product, the Y-90 RadioGel brachytherapy device.
CEO Jim Katzaroff and the lead scientific and medical advisory team from AMIC met at the FDA offices to discuss next steps, expectations and required testing to progress towards obtaining marketing clearance for the Y-90 RadioGel device. The FDA and AMIC team are working closely in order to obtain all appropriate data and benchmarks the FDA requires in order to proceed with providing final clearance for marketing the device in the United States. AMIC intends to seek classification and clearance as a class II medical device through a de novo application.
In August, AMIC announced a partnership with IsoTherapeutics Group, a third-party radiopharmaceutical research and development company, to provide commercialization support and conduct additional studies as requested by the FDA for the Y-90 RadioGel device. AMIC announced that IsoTherapeutics has completed the first stage of the project, comprised of tech transfer, manufacturing and in vitro testing. The next stage, comprised of additional in vitro and in vivo testing, commenced shortly after.
The Y-90 RadioGel device is one of several Y-90 brachytherapy products in development by AMIC that may provide a safer, quicker and less expensive treatment to certain cancers, including tumors deemed inoperable. According to Global Industry Analysts, by 2016 the U.S. brachytherapy market will reach $2 billion. It is estimated that the U.S. market represents approximately half of the global market. AMIC believes there are significant opportunities in prostate, breast, liver, pancreatic, head and neck cancers with its Y-90 product suite.

Baloney. What is the proof that product "works". No testing has been done. Get real.  They do NOT meet the requirements of any major exchange. Just where to you think they are uplisting to? Hope and blind faith gets you were this POS is after 10 years.

RICHLAND, WA / ACCESSWIRE / July 11, 2017 / Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation ("AMI") (OTC PINK: ADMD), a late stage radiation oncology focused medical device company today announced that a new proprietary process has been developed that significantly improves originally licensed technology on the company's Y-90 RadioGel? device.
After five months of effort, the AMI team have finalized an improved manufacturing process for our yttrium phosphate particles. We conducted more than thirty process development runs to achieve the most cost-effective process to reproducibly give us the small particles that we desire.
Small particles perfuse further into the tumor and reduce the number of injections required for dose coverage in large tumors. In parallel, we concentrated on reducing the time and cost required for manufacturing and increasing the batch yield. As an example, one production step was reduced from 20 hours to just an hour. Product yield increased from 80% to 99.99%. The process is elegantly simple, but based on fundamental understanding of the underlying chemistry involved.
IsoTherapeutics, a key manufacturing and testing contractor, did a very professional job working with our team to explore all of the key manufacturing variables.
AMI Interim CEO and President Dr. Mike Korenko stated, "This is a significant improvement over the technology that was originally licensed to AMI from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. This new proprietary process is an important part of our intellectual property and will reduce our manufacturing costs to position AMI to make a profit on future sales.
The manufacturing process has now been institutionalized in a formal Standard Operating Procedure, which is needed to ensure a safe reproducible product for animal and human therapy and it is the protocol required by the Food and Drug Administration."
Dr. Korenko added, "This accomplishment required a great deal of effort and is a major step in executing our business plan, which I outlined in my first letter to Shareholders January 2017."
AMI previously created the Standard Operating Procedures for the hydrogel (RadioGel?). We are now working on the Quality Assurance and Quality Control Plans and to convert all process activities to GMP (Good Manufacturing Processes) which is a FDA requirement. This will complete the entire disciplined manufacturing process requirements.
About Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation
The strategic market sector of Advanced Medical Isotope Corporation (ADMD) is isotope applications. Currently, the company is engaged in the development of RadioGelTM, an Yttrium-90 based brachytherapy device, for the treatment of tumors. Brachytherapy uses radiation to destroy cancerous tumors by placing a radioactive isotope inside the treatment area.
The company is engaging the FDA for permission to use RadioGel for the treatment of advanced basal and squamous skin cancers. The IsoPet Solutions division is focused on demonstrating the safety and therapeutic effectiveness for different animal cancers in four different university veterinary hospitals. After this demonstration phase the plan is to sell RadioGelTM to the private animal clinics.
The Company currently is outsourcing material aspects of manufacturing of its product in the United States and intends to enter into licensing arrangements outside of the United States for the manufacturing and distribution of RadioGelTM in other countries. For more information, please visit our websites: www.isotopeworld.com and www.isopetsolutions.com.
About RadioGel?
AMI is developing a brachytherapy and topical cancer treatment product called RadioGel?.
RadioGel? is a hydrogel liquid containing tiny Yttrium-90 phosphate particles which may be injected into a tumor. This hydrogel liquid is maintained at a temperature below body temperature but begins to gel, harden, once it is injected into the body and as the temperature increases up to body temperature, thereby locking the particles in place. The particles emit a very high concentrated and contained beta irradiation to kill the tumor. The beta radiation has a short penetration distance so there is minimal collateral damage outside of the injected area.
RadioGel? also has a short half-life - after 10 days only about 5% of the radiation remains; as opposed to other available options that would 50% after 10 days. This is an outpatient treatment much safer to the personnel treating the patient than competing brands and the patient can go home immediately after with no risk to any family members.
