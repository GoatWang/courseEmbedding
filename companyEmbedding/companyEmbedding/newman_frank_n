It wasn't supposed to end this way.When Frank N. Newman took over the Bankers Trust Corporation three years ago he vowed to rein in the New York bank's vaunted trading operation -- widely viewed as populated by free-wheeling hot shots more interested in making big bets on the direction of financial markets than with the well-being of their clients -- and he regularly proclaimed his determination to maintain Bankers Trust's independence.Now, undone by huge trading losses and nasty internal strife at the eighth-largest bank in the country, Mr. Newman, 56, has been forced into an act he firmly opposed as recently as five months ago: the sale of Bankers Trust. Yesterday, in a move that has been widely anticipated for more than a week, Deutsche Bank, the German banking giant, formally announced plans for a $10.1 billion acquisition of Bankers Trust.''Frank will go down in history as the person who sold Bankers Trust,'' said Raphael Soifer, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman. ''Frank is partially the victim of circumstance, but as the bank evolved under him, with an emphasis on emerging markets, trading in Eastern Europe and Asia, junk bonds, and initial public offerings, he left Bankers Trust particularly vulnerable to the global financial turmoil of the last year.''Mr. Newman, who declined repeated requests for an interview, is certainly not the only victim of the upheaval that has ripped through international banks in an unusually tumultuous year. Some chief executives, like Mathis Cabiallavetta of UBS in Switzerland, and Martin Taylor, the chief executive of Barclays, Britain's biggest bank, lost their jobs after huge trading losses materialized. In other cases, as in the ousters of James B. Dimon, Citigroup's president, and David Coulter, the president of BankAmerica, trading losses provided a convenient excuse for departures that were the result of more deep-seated corporate frictions.

As were many of his counterparts in the banking world, Mr. Newman was blind-sided this summer by trading losses that snowballed after Russia devalued its currency and declared a debt moratorium in mid-August. Unlike them, he has not lost his job. Continue reading the main story

But while Mr. Newman will join the board of Deutsche Bank and have a senior position in the investment banking unit created by Deutsche's purchase of Bankers Trust, he is not expected to wield significant managerial control in the new entity.''If the third quarter hadn't happened, I would have characterized Newman's legacy as having led a significant turnaround in the company's fortunes,'' said Diane Glossman, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Holdings. ''He did a remarkable amount of work in a short period of time, but then his time ran out.''The clock started ticking for Mr. Newman in July.At the time, Mr. Newman's position was relatively strong. Desiring to keep the bank intact, he had recently spurned overtures from the Bank of New York, Mellon Bank and the State Street Corporation to sell Bankers Trust's valuable business as a securities custodian.And in a June interview, around the same time Deutsche Bank first privately floated the idea of a merger, Mr. Newman firmly asserted that Bankers Trust would remain independent.''We are proponents of the idea that bigger is not necessarily better,'' he said at the time. ''We're trying to find markets where we can add value.''Nonetheless, Mr. Newman accepted an invitation in July from a senior Deutsche Bank investment banker and board member, Ronaldo Schmitz, to dine at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan. They revisted the possibility of a merger, according to executives later involved in the transaction, though people close to Mr. Newman said he was noncomittal at that meeting.Mr. Newman had every reason to believe then that he did not have to rush into a marriage with Deutsche Bank, a plodding financial behemoth that had been badly bruised by previous, ill-considered forays into investment banking -- an arena where Bankers Trust was making inroads. Mr. Newman still enjoyed strong support from his board and he had managed to steer Bankers Trust away from an overreliance on trading.

Big banks long ago branched away from the traditional business of making loans to corporations and began trading stocks, bonds, currencies and more exotic financial products known as derivatives. Bankers Trust, founded in 1903 to handle the trust business of other large banks, had transformed itself in the late 1980's and 1990's into one of the most aggressive and innovative trading shops on Wall Street.But a series of derivatives scandals a few years ago wreaked financial havoc on the bank and led to the departure of Charles Sanford as its chairman and the ascent of Mr. Newman to that position.Mr. Newman's credentials -- he had been the chief financial officer of Wells Fargo and BankAmerica before serving as a top official in the Treasury Department from 1993 to 1995 -- were seen as the balm needed to restore credibility to Bankers Trust's damaged reputation.Yet Mr. Newman, who had no experience as a trader or an investment banker, never entirely fit in at Bankers Trust. He is respected for his analytical abilities and methodical planning, but he was widely criticized within Bankers Trust for being aloof and awkward in social settings. Mr. Newman also relied on a small group of advisers from the West Coast, especially the chief financial officer, Richard H. Daniel, a move that alienated some senior executives. And, as befalls any executive seeking to reshape a company, Mr. Newman also made enemies among traders who resented the cutbacks he made in their business.

Even with these tensions, Mr. Newman succeeded in making important changes at Bankers Trust despite the financial mess he inherited. ''He came into a company that was very beaten down and so focused on derivatives products that it had lost its competitive edge,'' observed Judah Kraushaar, a Merrill Lynch analyst.In 1993, 72 percent of Bankers Trust's profits came from trading. Last year, only 16 percent did. And as he guided Bankers Trust more deeply into overseas markets and allowed the firm's junk bond business to expand, Mr. Newman also bolstered the company's presence in investment banking last year by buying Alex. Brown & Sons, a small but well-regarded regional brokerage firm with an important role in underwriting technology companies.Despite an uneven performance earlier this year, Mr. Newman was still well positioned to keep Deutsche Bank at a distance until the torrent of ill will unleashed by the Alex. Brown acquisition and substantial trading losses in July and August combined to weaken his standing. At that point, insiders say, he began to lose the ability to determine his own fate.Many Alex. Brown employees grumbled that the sale of their firm left them in a financial nether world. They were no longer an independent regional brokerage firm, yet they were trapped inside a bank that still lacked the heft to compete with the most powerful Wall Street investment firms. Several senior executives left Alex. Brown, and many of those who stayed were unhappy, bankers said, particularly Mayo Shattuck, a longtime Alex. Brown employee who became co-head of Bankers Trust's investment banking unit.Mr. Shattuck, who is scheduled to play a senior role in Deutsche Bank's new investment banking operation created by the Bankers Trust acquisition, is said by colleagues to have been among the most vocal critics of Mr. Newman. Mr. Shattuck did not return calls seeking comment.

Meanwhile, in newspapers and magazines, reports began to appear  this summer of Mr. Newman's fondness for glittering parties and expensive corporate perks. Mr. Newman's supporters attributed them to disgruntled employees trying to smear his reputation. Nonetheless, it was clear that several members of the bank's board were not pleased with the publicity surrounding Mr. Newman's spending and fondness for a phalanx of private security guards.  One person close to the board, and a supporter of Mr. Newman, said some board members were ''poisoned'' against Mr. Newman by the turmoil at Alex. Brown and by unwanted public interest in his spending habits.All this unrest might have been smoothed over had it not been for hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses that beginning in July hit Bankers Trust, including an embarrassing disclosure of a big hedge fund loss related to Russia. Ultimately, the bank posted a third-quarter loss of $488 million and, despite Mr. Newman's reputation for risk aversion, disclosed that its sophisticated models to manage risk-taking had failed to perform effectively.''Frank made the promise to reduce the risk profile of Bankers Trust but look what happened in the third quarter,'' said Mr. Soifer, the analyst at Brown Brothers.As Bankers Trust's stock price fell, the bank was roiled by internal accusations that Mr. Newman had allowed its risky junk bond portfolio to balloon, senior employees said.Deutsche Bank, which had dubbed its takeover campaign ''Osprey'' after the black-and-white bird of prey, stopped considering a purchase of the San Francisco brokerage firm, Hambrecht & Quist and began circling Bankers Trust more closely.With Bankers Trust's financial position severely weakened, Mr. Newman was forced to take the takeover proposal much more seriously. He held talks with Deutsche Bank's chairman, Rolf Breuer, at an International Monetary Fund conference in Washington in September and followed up with a meeting at Mr. Breuer's Frankfurt home in October.When Bankers Trust reported its big loss for the quarter on Oct. 22, Deutsche Bank made its move. It quickly offered $93 a share for the beleaguered bank. Details of the transaction were worked out by investment bankers from Goldman,  Sachs, which was advising Deutsche Bank, and by Jeffery A. Goldstein, an investment banker with Bankers Trust. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter  was also hired as an outside adviser to Bankers Trust.Mr. Newman's future is hazy. In a news conference yesterday, Mr. Breuer said that Mr. Newman's duties would involve overseeing the integration of the two companies, helping to negotiate regulatory hurdles in the United States and dealing with claims stemming from Deutsche Bank's involvement with the Nazis  during the Holocaust.''My sense is that Frank will just be a transitional figure,'' Mr. Soifer said, ''and he'll be there for only a few years.''

Description

                    Why is China booming while the American economy lags?  Despite a globally challenging economic environment, production in China has grown significantly every year, for the past twenty years. America's GDP, by contrast, fell during the serious recession of 2008-9, and is now struggling to achieve even tepid growth. Why should this be?  Over the last decade, economic thought and attitudes in the West have increasingly diverged from the underlying views in China, and significant contrasts have developed. Six Myths that Hold Back America analyzes key statements of accepted economic views in the U.S. to determine which have real basis in the U.S. financial system, and which are really just myths.  Refreshing, stimulating, independent thinking--Frank Newman draws upon a wealth of practical experience in the private and public sectors, including his time as CEO of major banks in the U.S. and China, and in his role as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. This experience at home and abroad helps him dissect a series of common economic beliefs and develop conclusions that deeply challenge conventional assumptions about the American economy.show more

Back cover copy

                            Why is China booming while the American economy lags? Despite a globally challenging economic environment, production in China has grown significantly every year, for the past twenty years. America s GDP, by contrast, fell during the serious recession of 2008-9, and is now struggling to achieve even tepid growth. Why should this be? Over the last decade, economic thought and attitudes in the West have increasingly diverged from the underlying views in China, and significant contrasts have developed. "Six Myths that Hold Back America" analyzes key statements of accepted economic views in the U.S. to determine which have real basis in the U.S. financial system, and which are really just myths. Refreshing, stimulating, independent thinkingFrank Newman draws upon a wealth of practical experience in the private and public sectors, including his time as CEO of major banks in the U.S. and China, and in his role as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. This experience at home and abroad helps him dissect a series of common economic beliefs and develop conclusions that deeply challenge conventional assumptions about the American economy."show more

Flap copy

                            "Six Myths that Hold Back America: And What America Can Learn from the Growth of China s Economy" offers a bold new view of today s major economic challenges. Drawing upon his experience as a senior U.S. Treasury official and bank executive, Frank Newman makes a step-by-step case for a new approach to U.S. economic policyone that will address key problems of America now, and in the future. In rediscovering its potential, America must shake its mistaken faith in economic myths. The U.S. is not being bankrolled by Asian nations. It is not drowning in a consumption-driven economy. It does not need to be shackled by fears of a budget deficit. Using illustrations of how the money system actually works, this book exposes the economic misunderstandings that have stagnated growth in the West, and reveals the very different views underpinning the East s ascension."show more

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
