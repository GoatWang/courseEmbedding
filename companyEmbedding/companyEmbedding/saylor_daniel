Where?My current locationSearchHomeRaleigh, NCSaylor DanielRaleigh, NC Saylor DanielAbout Search ResultsAbout Search ResultsYP - The Real Yellow PagesSM - helps you find the right local businesses to meet your specific needs. Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your food collection!Error when adding to food collectionThis business was removed from the food collection1. Daniel's Restaurant & Catering(91)BBB Rating: A+1430 Nc Highway 55 WApex, NC 27523(919) 303-1006PizzaCaterersItalian RestaurantsWebsiteMenuJust had Daniels prepare food for 60 people at my home, at the end of the day the verdict was unanimous...the food was awesome!!!

I have read and understand the plagiarism policy as outlined in the syllabus and the sections in
the Student Bulletin relating to the III Honesty/Cheating Policy. By affixing this statement to the
title page of my paper, I certify that I have not cheated or popularized in the process of
completing this assignment. If it is found that cheating and/or plagiarism did take place in the
writing of this paper, I understand the possible consequences of the act/s, which could include
expulsion from Indiana Wesleyan University.

Subject title
Gillette Male Razor evaluation
Introduction
“In the first five months of 2015, online sales amounted to $141 million”, (NG & Ziobro, 2015). 
“The shift in shopping habits has caught market leader Gillette off balance”, (NG & Ziobro, 
2015). This has caused a need to evaluate the market in which razors are sold to our consumers.
