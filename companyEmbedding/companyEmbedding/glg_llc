Case 4:14-cv-00153-DLH-CSM Document 1 Filed 12/02/14 Page 3 of 7

A. 

U.S. Patent No. 7,708,131. 

FACTUAL BACKGROUND 

10. 

GLG Farms is the owner of all right, title, and interest in U.S. Patent No. 

7,708,131 filed on September 2, 2008, issued on May 4, 2010 and entitled “Swing Auger Hopper 

Drive” (“the ‘131 patent”). 

11. 

12. 

13. 

A true and correct copy of the ‘131 patent is attached hereto as Exhibit A. 

Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §282, the ‘131 patent is presumed valid. 

GLG Farms has given notice to the public that the apparatus made and sold under 

the ‘131 patent is patented by marking such apparatus in accordance with the provisions of 35 

U.S.C. § 287. 



B. 

The Infringing Products. 

14. 

On information and belief, Brandt manufacturers swing augers including the HP 

Swing Away Auger and the XL Swing Away Auger. 

15. 

16. 

On information and belief, Brandt manufactures the EZSwing Hopper Mover. 

On information and belief, the EZSwing Hopper Mover is available on all Brandt 

Swing Away Augers including the HP Swing Away Auger and the XL Swing Away Auger. 

17. 

On information and belief, Brandt makes, uses, offers for sale or sells in the 

United States, or imports into the United States, swing augers that include the EZSwing Hopper 

Mover. 

18. 

On information and belief, Brandt exhibited the EZSwing Hopper Mover at the 

2014 National Farm Machinery Show held in Louisville, Kentucky on February 12, 2014. 

3 





Case 4:14-cv-00153-DLH-CSM Document 1 Filed 12/02/14 Page 4 of 7

19. 

On information and belief, Brandt exhibited the HP Swing Away Auger with the 

EZSwing Hopper Mover at the 2014 Big Iron Farm Show held in West Fargo, North Dakota on 

September 9, 2014. 

20. 

A true and correct copy of photographs of the HP Swing Away Auger with the 

EZSwing Hopper Mover exhibited by Brandt at the 2014 Big Iron Farm Show is attached hereto 

as Exhibit B. 



C. 

Infringement of the ‘131 Patent. 

21. 

On information and belief, Brandt has been aware of the ‘131 patent by at least 

March 1, 2014. 

22. 

On information and belief, Brandt has been and still is infringing the ‘131 patent 

in this District and elsewhere in the United States without leave or license of GLG Farms and in 

violation of GLG Farms’ rights. 

23. 

The swing augers manufactured, marketed, offered for sale, sold and imported 

into the United States by Brandt, including the HP Swing Away Auger with the EZSwing 

Hopper Mover, fall within the scope of and infringe at least Claim 1 of the ‘131 patent. 

24. 

Such infringement is injurious to GLG Farms in that it is diverting from GLG 

Farms to Brandt’s customers who would otherwise buy GLG Farms’ products at the prices 

charged by GLG Farms. 

25. 

On information and belief, such infringement is, and at all times herein has been 

deliberate, willful, intentional, and with full knowledge of the existence and validity of the ‘131 

patent. 

4 





Case 4:14-cv-00153-DLH-CSM Document 1 Filed 12/02/14 Page 5 of 7

26. 

Because the damages GLG Farms has sustained and will incur in the future on 

account of Brandt’s infringement are uncertain and impossible to calculate accurately, GLG 

Farms has no adequate remedy at law. 



COUNT I 

PATENT INFRINGEMENT 

27. 

GLG Farms realleges and incorporates the above paragraphs as though fully 

stated herein. 

28. 

This cause of action is for patent infringement under the patent laws of the United 

States. 35 U.S.C. § 271 et seq. 

29. 

30. 

GLG Farms has satisfied the notice provisions of 35 U.S.C. §287. 

Brandt has been and/or is directly infringing and/or inducing infringement of 

and/or contributorily infringing the ‘131 patent by, among other things, making, using, offering 

to sell or selling in the United States, or importing into the United States, products that are 

covered by at least Claim 1 of the ‘131 patent, including, by way of example and not limitation, 

the HP Swing Away Auger shown in Exhibit B. 

31. 

GLG Farms has been damaged by Brandt’s infringing activities and will continue 

to be damaged by the infringing activities of Brandt. 

32. 

On information and belief, Brandt has willfully and deliberately conducted the 

infringing activities described above, and GLG Farms therefore seeks an assessment of increased 

damages pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §285. 

5
