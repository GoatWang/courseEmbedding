How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Stewart, Robert Jr carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Stewart, Robert Jr currently holds license STEWARJ994MG (Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Stewart, Robert Jr



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Stewart, Robert Jr



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are not Bella and Edward. As the actress explains in T's Aug. 21st Women's Fashion issue, dating her Twilight co-star—earning them the nickname "Robsten"—taught her a lesson in what happens when her personal and professional identities merged. "People wanted me and Rob to be together so badly that our relationship was made into a product. It wasn't real life anymore. And that was gross to me," Stewart says. "It's not that I want to hide who I am or hide anything I'm doing in my life. It's that I don't want to become a part of a story for entertainment value."Stewart understands that as an actress in high-profile films, audiences will be interested in her love life. But she's careful to only show them so much. "I'm not the typical showman. But at the same time, I want so badly to expose myself," the 26-year-old actress says. "I want to be understood and I want to be seen, and I want to do that in the rawest, purest, most naked way I can."It wasn't until recently, in fact, that Stewart confirmed she was dating visual-effects producer Alicia Cargile. "I would never talk about any of my relationships before, but once I started dating girls it seemed like there was an opportunity to represent something really positive," the Café Society actress tells the magazine. "I still want to protect my personal life, but I don't want to seem like I'm protecting the idea, so that does sort of feel like I owe something to people."

5 Things to Know About Kristen Stewart's Girlfriend Alicia Cargile












Karim Sadli

Though she didn't hide her affections for Cargile in public, Stewart shied away from discussing their coupling for some time. It's understandable, given that she suffered from "debilitating physical anxiety" during her teens and early 20s. Today, Stewart's feelings towards fame are "no longer negative or fear-based," she tells T. "I do think that's because of the storms I have weathered. It's not that they make you stronger or calloused—but they do make you a human."For more from Stewart, pick up T magazine, on newsstands Aug. 21.

Kristen Stewart starred alongside Robert Pattinson in the popular "Twilight" movies, and to the delight of the franchise's fans, began dating him in real life too.

However, the actress told The New York Times’ T Magazine, the excessive attention made her uncomfortable.

They split in 2013, months after Stewart was photographed kissing director Rupert Sanders.

“People wanted me and Rob to be together so badly that our relationship was made into a product. It wasn’t real life anymore. And that was gross to me," she said. "It’s not that I want to hide who I am or hide anything I’m doing in my life. It’s that I don’t want to become a part of a story for entertainment value."

These days, Stewart, 26, who is promoting her new movie, "Personal Shopper," is dating Alicia Cargile, a visual-effects producer. The two have been together for three years, and Stewart told the magazine that they're in love.

“I would never talk about any of my relationships before, but once I started dating girls it seemed like there was an opportunity to represent something really positive,” she said. “I still want to protect my personal life, but I don’t want to seem like I’m protecting the idea, so that does sort of feel like I owe something to people.”

Kristen Stewart: 'Robert Pattinson Relationship Turned into a Product'






Kristen Stewart: 'Robert Pattinson Relationship Turned into a Product'

Posted 02/01/2017                            2693

Kristen Stewart has said that her relationship with Robert Pattinson was ‘made into a product’ thanks to Twilight fans.
 
Kristen Stewart starred alongside Robert Pattinson in the popular "Twilight" movies, and to the delight of the franchise's fans, began dating him in real life too. The Twilight stars famously dated for five years after meeting on the set of the vampire drama in 2008. They split in 2013, months after the actress' infamous fling with her married Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders came to light in the summer of 2012.

During an interview with T Magazine, Stewart brought up her time with Pattinson, and the highly capitalized commodity that was their relationship.
“People wanted me and Rob to be together so badly that our relationship was made into a product,” she told the magazine. “It wasn’t real life anymore.”
She went on to say that the media attention was “gross” to her. ”I don’t want to become a part of a story for entertainment value,” Stewart added. The couple dealt with an extreme amount of attention, particularly when Stewart’s cheating on Pattinson, and subsequent public apology.

Stewart understands that as an actress in high-profile films, audiences will be interested in her love life. But she's careful to only show them so much. "I'm not the typical showman. But at the same time, I want so badly to expose myself," the 26-year-old actress says. "I want to be understood and I want to be seen, and I want to do that in the rawest, purest, most naked way I can."
Following a brief (but well-dressed) relationship with St. Vincent, Kristen Stewart is now reportedly dating Stella Maxwell. The duo were first spotted out together last month in Savannah, Georgia, where Stewart has been filming her upcoming film Lizzie, based on accused murderer Lizzie Borden. And on Monday, January 30, they were photographed stopping by a Los Angeles liquor store while reportedly on their way to LAX.

Maxwell was famously last linked to Miley Cyrus prior to the “Wrecking Ball” singer, 24, rekindling her relationship with Liam Hemsworth.

Stewart Robert Calvin Jr

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Stewart Robert Calvin Jr carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.
Stewart Robert Calvin Jr currently holds license CGC046453, CCC056821 (Certified General Contractor, Certified Roofing Contractor), which was Inactive when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Stewart Robert Calvin Jr



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Stewart Robert Calvin Jr



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Stewart Robert Calvin Jr



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

MoviesKristen Stewart Says Her Relationship with Ex Robert Pattinson 'Was Made into a Product'By Jodi Guglielmi•@JodiGug3Posted on August 17, 2016 at 3:15pm EDT

Venturelli/WireImage



Kristen Stewart is coming clean about why her relationship with Robert Pattinson didn’t work out. 
In a new interview with The New York Times Style Magazine, Stewart reveals that the excessive media attention surrounding her relationship with her Twilight costar ultimately contributed to their breakup. 
“People wanted me and Rob to be together so badly that our relationship was made into a product,” she said. “It wasn’t real life anymore. And that was gross to me. It’s not that I want to hide who I am or hide anything I’m doing in my life. It’s that I don’t want to become a part of a story for entertainment value.”
Stewart, 26, and Pattinson, 30, famously dated after meeting on the set of Twilight and seemed to be going strong until photos emerged of her kissing her married Snow White and the Hunstman director Rupert Sanders while she was dating Pattinson. The couple reconciled shortly after but ultimately called it quits in 2013. 
Robert Pattinson and Kristen StewartSteve Granitz/WireImageLooking back, Stewart says she’s learned to grow from her mistakes.
“I do think that’s because of the storms I have weathered,” she said. “It’s not that they make you stronger or calloused – but they do make you a human.”

The famously private actress has been more open about her personal life recently, gushing about her relationship with girlfriend Alicia Cargile. Stewart said she’s more willing to talk about her relationship with Cargile because of the positive message of acceptance it represents. 
Alicia Cargile (L) and Kristen StewartAKM-GSI“I would never talk about any of my relationships before, but once I started dating girls it seemed like there was an opportunity to represent something really positive,” she explained. “I still want to protect my personal life, but I don’t want to seem like I’m protecting the idea, so that does sort of feel like I owe something to people.”
Of Cargile, Stewart says, “I love her so much.”
