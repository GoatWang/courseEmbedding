George Edward Wade

















		Showing the single product	

George Edward Wade (British, 1853-1933) was the youngest of six sons and one of 14 children of the Reverend Nugent Wade, Rector of St Anne’s, Soho. He was educated at Charterhouse and was reading for the Bar, when ill-health enforced a period of recuperation in Italy. While there here he took up painting under the guidance Sir Coutts Lindsay (1824-1913) a veteran of the Crimea and, with his wife, co-founder of the Grosvenor Gallery.  Wade, however, found himself increasingly dissatisfied with painting, and turned to sculpture.
He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1889 and in 1891 he took over the studio of the royal sculptor Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm. Wade’s long and varied career included the production of many well known public works. These included the Norwich Boer War Memorial (1904), copies of his bronze statue of King Edward VII for Madras, Reading, and Hong Kong. His marble statue of Queen Victoria (1902) in the gardens of the Presidential Residence in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and another for Allahabad, India. A colossal bronze statue of the Duke of Connaught for Hong Kong; Sir William Rose Mansfield, first Baron Sandhurst for Bombay and a Cameron Highlander for Inverness. He executed the impressive 50 foot tall monument to Sir John A Macdonald (1895) which stands beneath its ornate portico at Montreal in Canada. Copies were produced for both Hamilton and Kingston in Canada. For India he produced a portrait statue King George V to coincide with e royal visit of 1911. He produced the monolithic Pietermaritzburg War Memorial in South Africa. He sculpted the equestrian statues of Sir Chandra Shamshere Yung for Nepal and Field Marshal Earl Haig for the esplanade of Edinburgh Castle. In 1929 he sculpted Salvation Army General and Mrs Booth for Champion Park, Denmark Hill, London. He designed a children’s fountain for the Women’s World Temperance Movement Association, a copy of which stands in Temple Gardens, Embankment, London.
‘The popularity of Wade’s sculpture was probably due not only to the fact that that it was always comprehensible but that it was both ennobling and restrained in equal measure.’ His last work was the Stourbridge War Memorial which was inaugurated in 1931. In private life Wade was a keen golfer, designed houses for his friends and tried his hand at airplane design. He died at home at Hyde Park Street in London on 5 February 1933. In 1869 Wade married Isabella Mary Josephine, daughter of Lieutenant-General J. M. Macintyre, R.A. and they had two daughters.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

 Detroit Trip with Sir Richard Branson

Last week ended with a trip to Detroit to celebrate Virgin Atlantic’s inaugural flight from Heathrow to Detroit. It has been one of the most surreal and intense few days of my life.

This great classic work contains
	    362 magnificent hand colored

	    page. These prints typically sell for 100's of dollars
	    EACH.

George Edwards (1694-1773), was one of the leading etchers,
	    colourists and commentators on natural history of the eighteenth century.
	    

The story of this talented and complex man is told against the rich
	    background of a time of exciting scientific discovery when the nobility and
	    learned men from many disiplines, especially from medicine were enquiring
	    into nature by travelling, collecting and recording natural objects particularly
	    birds and animals.

He was a good friend of Mark Catesby, who created the first American
	    ornithology, and of Sir Hans Sloane, the founder of the British Museum. 

Edwards produced his impressive volumes almost single-handedly, for
	    not only did he create the drawings upon which the prints are based, but
	    he also etched the copper plates, did his own coloring and wrote the text.
	    

The book is illustrated by eighteenth century engravings and includes
	    362 beautiful colour plates as well as his discriptions.
