(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and the notes thereto of the United States Brent Oil Fund, LP ("BNO") included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  Forward-Looking Information  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q, including this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause BNO's actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe BNO's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words "may," "will," "should," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "intend" or "project," the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and BNO cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. BNO's actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.  BNO has based the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q on information available to it on the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and BNO assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although BNO undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that BNO may make directly to them or through reports that BNO in the future files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  Introduction  BNO, a Delaware limited partnership, is a commodity pool that issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc (the "NYSE Arca"). The investment objective of BNO is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share net asset value ("NAV") to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of Brent crude oil, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for Brent crude oil traded on the ICE Futures Exchange ("ICE Futures") that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the "Benchmark Futures Contract"), less BNO's expenses. "Near month contract" means the next contract traded on the ICE Futures due to expire. "Next month contract" means the first contract traded on the ICE Futures due to expire after the near month contract. It is not the intent of BNO to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of Brent crude oil or any particular futures contract based on Brent crude oil. It is not the intent of BNO to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day. The general partner of BNO, United States Commodity Funds LLC ("USCF"), believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts (as defined below) and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments (as defined below).  BNO invests in futures contracts for crude oil, diesel-heating oil, gasoline, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the ICE Futures, the New York Mercantile Exchange (the "NYMEX"), or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, "Futures Contracts") and other crude oil-related investments such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for crude oil, cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter transactions that are based on the price of crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, "Other Crude Oil-Related Investments"). For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments collectively are referred to as "Crude Oil Interests" in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  BNO seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments such that daily changes in its per share NAV, measured in percentage terms, will closely track the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract, also measured in percentage terms. USCF believes the daily changes in the price of the Benchmark Futures Contract have historically exhibited a close correlation with the daily changes in the spot price of Brent crude oil. It is not the intent of BNO to be operated in a fashion such that the per share NAV will equal, in dollar terms, the spot price of Brent crude oil or any particular futures contract based on Brent crude oil. It is not the intent of BNO to be operated in a fashion such that its per share NAV will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day. USCF believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in Futures Contracts and Other Crude Oil-Related Investments.  Regulatory Disclosure  Impact of Accountability Levels, Position Limits and Price Fluctuation Limits. Futures contracts include typical and significant characteristics. Most significantly, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC") and the futures exchanges have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by BNO is not) may hold, own or control. The net position is the difference between an individual's or firm's open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity. In addition, most U.S.-based futures exchanges, such as the NYMEX, limit the daily price fluctuation for futures contracts. Currently, the ICE Futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by U.S.-based futures exchanges and also limits the maximum daily price fluctuation, while some other non-U.S. futures exchanges have not adopted such limits.  The accountability levels for the Benchmark Futures Contract and other Futures Contracts traded on the NYMEX are not a fixed ceiling, but rather a threshold above which the NYMEX may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor's positions. The current accountability level for any one-month in the Benchmark Futures Contract is 10,000 net contracts. In addition, the NYMEX imposes an accountability level for all months of 20,000 net futures contracts for investments in futures contracts for oil. If BNO and the Related Public Funds (as defined below) exceed these accountability levels for investments in the futures contracts for oil, the NYMEX and ICE Futures will monitor BNO's and the Related Public Funds' exposure and may ask for further information on their activities, including the total size of all positions, investment and trading strategy, and the extent of liquidity resources of BNO and the Related Public Funds. If deemed necessary by the NYMEX and/or ICE Futures, BNO could be ordered to reduce its aggregate net position back to the accountability level. In contrast, the position limits for the ICE Futures maintain that when 100 lots or more are traded, the activity must be reported to the exchange on a daily basis. ICE Futures also maintains that an Expiration Limit of 6,000 lots, long or short, will apply for the five business days up to and including the expiration date. As of March 31, 2014, BNO held 240 Futures Contracts traded on the ICE Futures Europe and did not hold any Futures Contracts for Brent crude oil traded on the NYMEX. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, BNO did not exceed accountability levels imposed by the ICE Futures and the NYMEX.  Position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express CFTC authority to do so. In addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time, the NYMEX and the ICE Futures impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire. It is unlikely that BNO will run up against such position limits because BNO's investment strategy is to close out its positions and "roll" from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract beginning two weeks from expiration of the contract. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, BNO did not exceed any position limits imposed by the ICE Futures and the NYMEX.  The regulation of commodity interest trading in the United States and other countries is an evolving area of the law, as exemplified by the various discussions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the CFTC, the National Futures Association (the "NFA"), the futures exchanges, clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies.  Futures Contracts and Position Limits  The CFTC is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges and markets. The CFTC, however, has adopted regulations relating to the marketing of non-U.S. futures contracts in the United States. These regulations permit certain contracts on non-U.S. exchanges to be offered and sold in the United States.  On November 5, 2013, the CFTC proposed a rulemaking that would establish specific limits on speculative positions in 28 physical commodity futures and option contracts as well as swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts in the agriculture, energy and metals markets (the "Position Limit Rules"). On the same date, the CFTC proposed another rule addressing the circumstances under which market participants would be required to aggregate their positions with other persons under common ownership or control (the "Proposed Aggregation Requirements"). Specifically, the Position Limit Rules would, among other things: identify which contracts are subject to speculative position limits; set thresholds that restrict the number of speculative positions that a person may hold in a spot month, individual month, and all months combined; create an exemption for positions that constitute bona fide hedging transactions; impose responsibilities on designated contract markets ("DCMs") and swap execution facilities ("SEFs") to establish position limits or, in some cases, position accountability rules; and apply to both futures and swaps across four relevant venues: over-the-counter ("OTC"), DCMs, SEFs as well as non-U.S. located platforms. Until such time as the Position Limit Rules are adopted, the regulatory architecture in effect prior to the adoption of the Position Limit Rules will govern transactions in commodities and related derivatives (collectively, "Referenced Contracts"). Under that system, the CFTC enforces federal limits on speculation in agricultural products (e.g., corn, wheat and soy), while futures exchanges enforce position limits and accountability levels for agricultural and certain energy products (e.g., oil and natural gas). As a result, BNO may be limited with respect to the size of its investments in any commodities subject to these limits. Finally, subject to certain narrow exceptions, the Position Limit Rules require the aggregation, for purposes of the position limits, of all positions in the 28 Referenced Contracts held by a single entity and its affiliates, regardless of whether such position existed on U.S. futures exchanges, non-U.S. futures exchanges, in cleared swaps or in over-the-counter swaps. Under the CFTC's existing position limits requirements and the Position Limit Rules, a market participant is generally required to aggregate all positions for which that participant controls the trading decisions with all positions for which that participant has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest in an account or position, as well as the positions of two or more persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or understanding. At this time, it is unclear how the Proposed Aggregation Requirements may affect BNO, but it may be substantial and adverse. By way of example, the Proposed Aggregation Requirements in combination with the Position Limit Rules may negatively impact the ability of BNO to meet its investment objectives through limits that may inhibit USCF's ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of BNO. See "Commodity Interest Markets - Regulation" in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information.  Based on its current understanding of the final position limit regulations, USCF does not anticipate significant negative impact on the ability of BNO to achieve its investment objective.  "Swap" Transactions  The Dodd-Frank Act imposes regulatory requirements on certain "swap" transactions that BNO is authorized to engage in that may ultimately impact the ability of BNO to meet its investment objective. On August 13, 2012, the CFTC and the SEC published joint final rules defining the terms "swap" and "security-based swap." The term "swap" is broadly defined to include various types of over-the-counter derivatives, including swaps and options. The effective date of these final rules was October 12, 2012.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of "swap" be executed on organized exchanges or "swap execution facilities" and cleared through regulated clearing organizations or "derivative clearing organizations" ("DCOs"), if the CFTC mandates the central clearing of a particular contract. On November 28, 2012, the CFTC issued its final clearing determination requiring that certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps be cleared by registered DCOs. This is the CFTC's first clearing determination under the Dodd-Frank Act and became effective on February 11, 2013. Beginning on March 11, 2013, "swap dealers," "major swap participants" and certain active funds were required to clear certain credit default swaps and interest rate swaps; and beginning on June 10, 2013, commodity pools, certain private funds and entities predominantly engaged in financial activities were required to clear the same types of swaps. As a result, if BNO enters into or has entered into certain interest rate and credit default swaps on or after June 10, 2013, such swaps will be required to be centrally cleared. Determination on other types of swaps are expected in the future, and, when finalized, could require BNO to centrally clear certain over-the-counter instruments presently entered into and settled on a bi-lateral basis. If a swap is required to be cleared, the initial margin will be set by the clearing organizations, subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines. Initial and variation margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into uncleared swaps and capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into both cleared and uncleared trades will be set by the CFTC, the SEC or the applicable Prudential Regulator.  The Dodd-Frank Act also requires that certain swaps determined to be available to trade on a SEF must be executed over such a facility. On June 5, 2013, the CFTC published a final rule regarding the obligations of SEFs, including the obligation for facilities offering multiple person execution services to register as a SEF by October 2, 2013. Based upon applications filed by several SEFs with the CFTC, the CFTC has determined that certain interest rate swaps and credit default index swaps are available to trade on SEFs and beginning on February 15, 2014, certain interest rate swaps and credit default index swaps must be executed on a SEF.  On November 14, 2013, the CFTC's Division of Clearing and Risk, Division of Market Oversight and Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight published guidance with respect to the application of certain CFTC rules on SEFs. That guidance clarified that SEFs could not restrict access to participants who are permitted to trade swaps and that SEFs may not require participants to have breakage agreements in place with other counterparties.  On April 11, 2013, the CFTC published a final rule to exempt swaps between certain affiliated entities within a corporate group from the clearing requirement. The rule permits affiliated counterparties to elect not to clear a swap subject to the clearing requirement if, among other things, the counterparties are majority-owned affiliates whose financial statements are included in the same consolidated financial statements and whose swaps are documented and subject to a centralized risk management program. However, the exemption does not apply to swaps entered into by affiliated counterparties with unaffiliated counterparties.  On November 14, 2013, the CFTC published final regulations that require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for futures commission merchants ("FCMs"). The rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected, customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business, FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner, the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard the continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner.  On April 5, 2013, the CFTC's Division of Clearing and Risk issued a letter granting no-action relief from certain swap data reporting requirements for swaps entered into between affiliated counterparties. In general, the letter grants relief from, among others: real-time, historical and regular swap reporting (under Part 43, Part 45 and Part 46 of the CFTC's regulations, respectively).  On November 6, 2013, the CFTC published a final rule that imposes requirements on swap dealers and major swap participants with respect to the treatment of collateral posted by their counterparties to margin, guarantee, or secure uncleared swaps. In other words, the rule places restrictions on what swap dealers and major swap participants can do with collateral posted by BNO in connection with uncleared swaps.  In addition to the rules and regulations imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act, swap dealers that are European banks may also be subject to European Market Infrastructure Regulation ("EMIR"). These regulations have not yet been fully implemented.  General Regulation Applicable to BNO  On August 12, 2013, the CFTC issued final rules establishing compliance obligations for commodity pool operators ("CPOs") of investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act") that are required to register due to recent changes to CFTC Regulation  As the regulatory requirements are constantly evolving, it is difficult to predict the effect any regulatory changes may have on BNO.  Price Movements  Brent crude oil futures prices exhibited moderate daily swings along with a downward trend during the three months ended March 31, 2014. The price of the Benchmark Futures Contract started the period at $110.80 per barrel. The Benchmark Futures Contract reached its high for the period on March 3, 2014 at $111.09 per barrel and reached its low for the period on February 4, 2014 when the price dropped to $105.32 per barrel. The period ended with the Benchmark Futures Contract at $107.76 per barrel, down approximately 2.74% over the period. BNO's per share NAV began the period at $43.81 and ended the period at $43.06 on March 31, 2014, a decrease of approximately 1.71% over the period. BNO's per share NAV reached its high for the period on March 3, 2014 at $44.29 and reached its low for the period on January 14, 2014 at $41.86. The Benchmark Futures Contract prices listed above began with the February 2014 contract and ended with the May 2014 contract. The decrease of approximately 2.74% on the Benchmark Futures Contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding Futures Contracts. An investment in Futures Contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to simulate such a result. Furthermore, the change in the nominal price of these differing crude oil Futures Contracts, measured from the start of the period to the end of the period, does not represent the actual benchmark results that BNO seeks to track, which are more fully described below, in the section titled "Tracking BNO's Benchmark."  Historically, the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation, with backwardation being in place roughly as often as contango since oil futures trading started in 1982. In recent years, U.S. crude oil markets experienced long periods of contango, while Brent crude oil moved into a state of backwardation in 2011. During the three months ended March 31, 2014, U.S. based West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil and Brent crude were predominantly in backwardation. Contango means that the price of the near month crude oil Futures Contract was below the price of the next month crude oil Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration. Backwardation means that the price of the near month crude oil Futures Contract was above the price of the next month crude oil Futures Contract, or contracts further away from expiration. For a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns, see "Term Structure of Crude Oil Prices and the Impact on Total Returns" below.  Valuation of Futures Contracts and the Computation of the Per Share NAV  The per share NAV of BNO's shares is calculated once each NYSE Arca trading day. The per share NAV for a particular trading day is released after 4:00 p.m. New York time. Trading during the core trading session on the NYSE Arca typically closes at 4:00 p.m. New York time. BNO's administrator uses the ICE Futures settlement price (a weighted average price of trades during a three minute settlement period from 2:27 p.m. to 2) for the contracts held on the ICE Futures, but calculates or determines the value of all other BNO investments, including NYMEX contracts or other futures contracts, as of the earlier of the close of the NYSE Arca or 4:00 p.m. New York time.  Results of Operations and the Crude Oil Market  Results of Operations. On June 2, 2010, BNO listed its shares on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol "BNO." On that day, BNO established its initial offering price at $50.00 per share and issued 200,000 shares to the initial authorized purchaser in exchange for $10,000,000 in cash.  Since its initial offering of 50,000,000 shares, BNO has not registered any subsequent offerings of its shares. On August 26, 2013, BNO executed a 2-for-1 forward share split for all shareholders of record as of the close of markets on August 26, 2013. The 2-for-1 forward share split was payable after the close of markets on August 28, 2013. BNO began trading at its post-split price on August 29, 2013. As a result of the forward share split, every one pre-split share of BNO was automatically exchanged for two post-split shares. Immediately prior to the forward share split, there were 450,000 shares of BNO issued and outstanding, representing a per share NAV of $89.92. After the forward share split, the number of issued and outstanding shares of BNO increased to 900,000, and the per share NAV decreased to $44.96. As of March 31, 2014, BNO had issued 6,500,000 shares, 600,000 of which were outstanding. As of March 31, 2014, there were 43,500,000 shares registered but not yet issued.  More shares may have been issued by BNO than are outstanding due to the redemption of shares. Unlike funds that are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, shares that have been redeemed by BNO cannot be resold by BNO. As a result, BNO contemplates that additional offerings of its shares will be registered with the SEC in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions.  As of March 31, 2014, BNO had the following authorized purchasers: Citadel Securities LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., JP Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corporation, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Nomura Securities International Inc., Virtu Financial Capital Markets and Virtu Financial DB LLC.  For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013  As of March 31, 2014, the total unrealized loss on Futures Contracts owned or held on that day was $247,600 and BNO established cash deposits and investments in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less ("Treasuries") and money market funds that were equal to $28,262,070. BNO held 78.17% of its cash assets in overnight deposits and investments in money market funds at its custodian bank, while 21.83% of the cash balance was held as investments in Treasuries and margin deposits for the Futures Contracts purchased at the FCM. The ending per share NAV on March 31, 2014 was $43.06.  By comparison, as of March 31, 2013, the total unrealized gain on Futures Contracts owned or held on that day was $77,060, and BNO established cash deposits and investments in Treasuries and money market funds that were equal to $45,755,168. BNO held 93.26% of its cash assets in overnight deposits and investments in money market funds at its custodian bank, while 6.74% of the cash balance was held as investments in Treasuries and margin deposits for the Futures Contracts purchased at the FCM.

The above frequency distribution chart presents information about the difference between the daily market price for shares of the Fund and the Fund's reported net asset value. The amount that the fund's market price is above the reported NAV is called the premium. The amount that the fund's market price is below the reported NAV is called the discount. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The horizontal axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed in basis points. The vertical axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated.
 
* A basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1% and is used to denote the change in a financial instrument.

USCF Launches The United States 3X Oil Fund and The United States 3X Short Oil Fund (Tickers:  USOU, USOD)






Jul 20, 2017, 9:15am EDT














OAKLAND, Calif., July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, USCF launched the United States 3X Oil Fund (USOU) and the United States 3X Short Oil Fund (USOD).  Both funds are exchange-traded products that issue shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.  USOU seeks a return that is 300% of the return of the West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") light, sweet crude oil futures contract and USOD seeks a return that is -300% of the return of the WTI light, sweet crude oil futures contract.



"Over a decade ago, USCF pioneered the single commodity exchange-traded fund with the launch of the United States Oil Fund (USO).  Our new 3X long and 3X short oil funds offer traders and professionals with strong convictions the opportunity to take more concentrated positions in crude oil," said John Love, President and Chief Executive Officer of USCF.  
USOU and USOD expand the suite of oil-based products offered by USCF.  USCF's existing oil-based exchange traded products include the:
United States 3X Oil Fund (USOU)United States Oil Fund (USO)United States Brent Oil Fund (BNO)United States 12-Month Oil Fund (USL)United States Short Oil Fund (DNO)United States 3X Short Oil Fund (USOD)
About USCFUSCF operates on the leading edge of product innovation as an asset management firm offering exchange-traded products (ETPs), exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. The firm broke new ground with the launch of the first oil ETP, the United States Oil Fund, LP (USO), in 2006. Over the next decade, USCF designed and issued thirteen more specialty products across commodity and equity asset classes. USCF currently manages approximately $4 billion in assets from its headquarters in Oakland, California.

Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement made herein. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release.

Leveraged and inverse exchange-traded products pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying benchmark over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.
Commodity ETP Disclosures:Download a copy of a Fund's Prospectus by clicking one of the following: ( USO, USOU, USL, DNO, USOD, UNG, UNL, UGA, UHN, BNO, USCI, CPER, USAG). Please read any Prospectus carefully before investing.
These Funds are not mutual funds or any other type of Investment Company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and are not subject to regulation thereunder.
Commodity trading is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Commodities and futures generally are volatile and are not suitable for all investors. Investing in commodity interests subject each Fund to the risks of its related industry. An investor may lose all or substantially all of an investment. These risks could result in large fluctuations in the price of a particular Fund's respective shares. Funds that focus on a single sector generally experience greater volatility. For further discussion of these and additional risks associated with an investment in the Funds please read the respective Fund Prospectus before investing.

BNO Fund Description
The United States Brent Oil Fund tracks the Brent oil spot price using near-month ICE futures contracts.
  
BNO FactSet Analytics Insight
BNO offers viable exposure to Brent oil, an alternative to the WTI benchmark with significant differences. Brent spot prices have been higher than WTI for some time (although the gap has narrowed considerably recently), and the short end of the futures curve on Brent has historically sloped up rather than down. This last point sounds granular, but is in fact a key driver of return differences. BNO charges 116 bps and can be fairly traded with some effort. Investors get a K-1 rather than a 1099, and are taxed at a blended long-term and short-term rate.

Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.
