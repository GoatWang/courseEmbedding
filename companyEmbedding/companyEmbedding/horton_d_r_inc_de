The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and related notes included in this quarterly report and with our
annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Some of
the information contained in this discussion and analysis constitutes
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results
could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include,
but are not limited to, those described in the "Forward-Looking Statements"
section following this discussion.



BUSINESS


D.R. Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the United States as
measured by number of homes closed and revenues. We construct and sell homes
through our operating divisions in 79 markets in 26 states, under the names of
D.R. Horton, America's Builder, Emerald Homes, Express Homes, Freedom Homes and
Pacific Ridge Homes. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "D.R.
Horton," the "Company," "we" and "our" used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.

Our business operations consist of homebuilding, financial services and other
activities. Our homebuilding operations primarily include the construction and
sale of single-family homes with sales prices generally ranging from $100,000 to
more than $1,000,000, with an average closing price of $295,200 during the nine
months ended June 30, 2017. Approximately 89% of our home sales revenues in the
nine months ended June 30, 2017 were generated from the sale of single-family
detached homes, with the remainder from the sale of attached homes, such as
townhomes, duplexes, triplexes and condominiums. We owned approximately 400
attached and detached residential rental homes in our homebuilding operations at
June 30, 2017 compared to 600 at September 30, 2016.

On June 29, 2017, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Forestar
Group Inc. (Forestar), a publicly-traded residential real estate development
company, to acquire 75% of the currently outstanding shares of Forestar for
$17.75 per share in cash or approximately $560 million of total cash
consideration. Forestar stockholders will have the right to receive cash or
retain their shares of the surviving entity as described in Note A. The
transaction is expected to close during our first quarter of fiscal 2018,
subject to the approval of Forestar shareholders and other customary closing
conditions. The transaction is a component of our strategy to expand
relationships with land developers and increase the optioned portion of our land
and lot position to enhance operational efficiency and returns.

Our financial services operations provide mortgage financing and title agency
services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our
100% owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily to our
homebuyers and generally sells the mortgages it originates and the related
servicing rights to third-party purchasers. DHI Mortgage originates loans in
accordance with purchaser guidelines and sells substantially all of its mortgage
production shortly after origination. Our subsidiary title companies serve as
title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies, examination and
closing services, primarily to our homebuyers.

In addition to our core homebuilding and financial services operations, we have
subsidiaries that engage in other business activities. These subsidiaries
conduct insurance-related operations, construct and own income-producing rental
properties, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and
improvements and own and operate oil and gas related assets. At June 30, 2017,
assets totaling $120.1 million associated with these subsidiaries were included
in the Financial Services and Other section of our balance sheet.

OVERVIEW


During the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, demand for new homes continued
to reflect the stable to moderately improved trends we experienced across most
of our operating markets in fiscal 2016. We continue to see varying levels of
strength in new home demand and home prices across our markets, with demand in
each market generally reflecting the relative strength of each market's economy,
as measured by job growth, household incomes, household formations and consumer
confidence.

Our position as the largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder in the
United States provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales.
In recent years, we have focused on expanding our product offerings to
consistently include a broad range of homes for entry-level, move-up and luxury
buyers across most of our markets. Our affordable entry-level homes have
experienced very strong demand from homebuyers, as the entry-level segment of
the new home market remains under-served, with low inventory levels relative to
demand. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we have been introducing
affordable homes in communities designed for active adult buyers seeking a
low-maintenance lifestyle. We plan to continue to expand our product offerings
across more of our operating markets.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the number and value of our net sales
orders increased 11% and 13%, respectively, compared to the prior year quarter,
and the number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 16% and 17%,
respectively. Our pre-tax income in the third quarter was $444.5 million
compared to $378.6 million in the prior year quarter, and our pre-tax operating
margin was 11.8% compared to 11.7%.

We believe our business is well positioned for the future because of our broad
geographic footprint and diverse product offerings, our ample supply of finished
lots, land and homes, our strong balance sheet and liquidity and our experienced
personnel across our operating markets. We remain focused on growing our
profitability, generating positive annual cash flows from operations and
managing our product offerings, pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to
optimize the return on our inventory investments.

We believe that housing demand in our individual operating markets is tied
closely to each market's economy; therefore, we expect that housing market
conditions will vary across our markets. If the U.S. economy continues to
improve, we expect to see slow to moderate growth in housing demand,
concentrated in markets where job growth is occurring. The pace and
sustainability of new home demand and our future results could be negatively
affected by weakening economic conditions, decreases in the level of employment
and housing demand, decreased home affordability, significant increases in
mortgage interest rates or tightening of mortgage lending standards.

STRATEGY


Our operating strategy focuses on leveraging our financial and competitive
position to increase the returns on our inventory investments and generate
strong profitability and cash flows, while managing risk. This strategy includes
the following initiatives:
•       Maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position and
        controlling our level of debt.


•       Allocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our
        operating markets to diversify our geographic risk.


•       Offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of
        entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury homebuyers based on
        consumer demand in each market.


•       Modifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices and sales incentives
        as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand.
•       Managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in
        each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to
        capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold,
        completed homes in inventory.


•       Investing in land and land development and pursuing opportunistic
        acquisitions of homebuilding companies in desirable markets, while
        controlling the level of land and lots we own in each of our markets
        relative to the local new home demand.
•       Increasing the amount of land and finished lots controlled through option
        purchase contracts by expanding relationships with land developers across
        the country.
• Controlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors.
•       Improving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales and
        other key operational activities.
•       Controlling our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense
        infrastructure to match production levels.




We believe our operating strategy, which has produced positive results in recent
years, will allow us to maintain and improve our competitive position, financial
performance and balance sheet strength. However, we cannot provide any
assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful, and
we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market
conditions.

Net Sales Orders

The value of net sales orders increased 13% to $3.9 billion (13,040 homes) for
the three months ended June 30, 2017 from $3.4 billion (11,714 homes) in the
prior year period, with increases in most of our regions. The value of net sales
orders increased 15% to $10.8 billion (36,272 homes) for the nine months ended
June 30, 2017 from $9.4 billion (32,070 homes) in the prior year period, with
increases in all of our regions. The increases in the value of sales orders were
primarily due to increases in volume and to a lesser extent, increases in
selling prices in most regions.

The number of net sales orders increased 11% and 13% in the three and nine
months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.
The overall increase in our net sales orders reflects the continued stable to
moderately improved market conditions in most of our markets. Our Phoenix market
contributed the most to the higher volume in our Southwest region and our North
Carolina markets contributed most to the higher volume in our East region. The
decrease in volume in our Midwest region was due to lower sales in our Chicago
and Denver markets during the quarter. Our sales order cancellation rates
(cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period) remained
consistent with the prior year periods.


We believe our business is well positioned to continue to generate increased
sales volume; however, our future sales volumes will depend on the economic
strength of each of our operating markets and our ability to successfully
implement our operating strategies in each market.

Sales Order Backlog

Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the
end of the period. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject
to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their
existing homes, which can result in cancellations. A portion of the contracts in
backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations.

Home Sales Revenue

Revenues from home sales increased 17% to $3.7 billion (12,497 homes closed) for
the three months ended June 30, 2017 from $3.1 billion (10,739 homes closed) in
the prior year period. Revenues from home sales increased 18% to $9.6 billion
(32,586 homes closed) for the nine months ended June 30, 2017 from $8.1 billion
(28,062 homes closed) in the prior year period. The overall increase in home
sales revenues reflects the continued stable to moderately improved market
conditions in most of our markets.

The number of homes closed increased 16% in both the three and nine months ended
June 30, 2017 compared to the prior year periods due to increases in all of our
regions. Our Phoenix, Florida and South Carolina markets contributed the most to
higher closings volumes in our Southwest, Southeast and East regions,
respectively. The average selling price of homes closed during the three and
nine months ended June 30, 2017 was $293,100 and $295,200, respectively, up
slightly from the prior year periods.

Home Sales Gross Profit


Gross profit from home sales increased 15% to $725.4 million in the three months
ended June 30, 2017 from $632.2 million in the prior year period and decreased
50 basis points to 19.8% as a percentage of home sales revenues. The 50 basis
point decrease in home sales gross profit percentage resulted from decreases of
60 basis points due to an increase in warranty and construction defect expenses
as a percentage of home sales revenues, 20 basis points due to the average cost
of our homes closed increasing by more than the average selling price and 10
basis points related to an increase in the amount of purchase accounting
adjustments for recent acquisitions. These decreases were partially offset by an
improvement of 40 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of
capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenues.

Gross profit from home sales increased 17% to $1.9 billion in the nine months
ended June 30, 2017 from $1.6 billion in the prior year period and decreased
30 basis points to 19.8% as a percentage of home sales revenues. The 30 basis
point decrease in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from decreases
of 60 basis points due to an increase in warranty and construction defect
expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues and 10 basis points related to
an increase in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments for recent
acquisitions. These decreases were partially offset by improvements of 30 basis
points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and
property taxes and 10 basis points due to the average selling price of our homes
increasing by more than the average cost.

We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of
our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust
to local market conditions. Our gross profit margins have remained relatively
stable in recent years and based on current market conditions, we expect
continued stability; however, our gross profit margins could fluctuate in future
periods.


Land Sales and Other Revenues


Land sales and other revenues were $22.2 million and $56.9 million in the three
and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, and $30.1 million and $65.2
million in the comparable periods of 2016. We continually evaluate our land and
lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur
based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. We generally
purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them. However,
some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we
may sell to commercial developers. We may also sell residential lots or land
parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons. As of June 30,
2017, we had $11.5 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the
next twelve months.

  Table of Contents
Inventory and Land Option Charges


At June 30, 2017, we reviewed the performance and outlook for all of our
communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and
performed detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary. We
performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities and land inventories
with a combined carrying value of $75.0 million and recorded impairment charges
of $1.0 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017 to reduce the
carrying value of impaired communities to their estimated fair value. During the
nine months ended June 30, 2017, impairment charges totaled $10.4 million. There
were $5.2 million and $8.9 million of impairment charges recorded in the three
and nine months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.

As we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize
returns and cash flows, we may modify our pricing and incentives, construction
and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities
and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities
being evaluated for potential impairment. Also, if housing or economic
conditions weaken in specific markets in which we operate, or if conditions
weaken in the broader economy or homebuilding industry, we may be required to
evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. These evaluations
could result in additional impairment charges.

During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, we wrote off $4.4 million
and $9.5 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition
costs related to land option contracts that we have terminated or expect to
terminate. Earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs for the three and
nine months ended June 30, 2016 were $2.9 million and $7.1 million,
respectively.


Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense


SG&A expense from homebuilding activities increased 11% to $309.5 million and
12% to $872.4 million in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017,
respectively, from $279.3 million and $778.4 million in the prior year periods.
As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A expense decreased 50 basis points
to 8.4% and 9.0% in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively,
from 8.9% and 9.5% in the prior year periods. This improvement in SG&A expense
as a percentage of revenues was achieved primarily through leverage of our fixed
overhead costs resulting from the increase in homebuilding revenues.

Employee compensation and related costs represented 73% and 71% of SG&A costs in
the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to 69% in
both prior year periods. These costs increased 17% to $226.5 million and 15% to
$615.7 million in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively,
due to increases in the number of employees and the amount of incentive
compensation as compared to the prior year periods. Our homebuilding operations
employed 5,870 and 5,172 employees at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


We attempt to control our SG&A costs while ensuring that our infrastructure
adequately supports our operations. We expect our SG&A expense as a percentage
of homebuilding revenues to be lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016.
Interest Incurred


We capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and
construction (active inventory). Capitalized interest is charged to cost of
sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. Interest incurred
decreased 8% to $32.4 million and 16% to $99.4 million in the three and nine
months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.
These decreases were due to decreases in our average debt of 6% and 12% in the
three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, and lower average
interest rates on outstanding debt during the periods. Interest charged to cost
of sales was 1.3% and 1.4% of total cost of sales (excluding inventory and land
option charges) in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively,
compared to 1.7% and 1.8% in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively.


Other Income


Other income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations was
$1.3 million and $7.8 million in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017,
respectively, compared to $1.9 million and $11.2 million in the prior year
periods. Other income in the nine-month period of fiscal 2016 includes a $4.5
million gain from the sale of an investment in debt securities. Other income
consists of interest income, rental income and various other types of ancillary
income, gains, expenses and losses not directly associated with our homebuilding
operations. The activities that result in this ancillary income or expense are
not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.

(1)    Expenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of interest
       and property taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales
       or expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our corporate
       office. The amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes is
       allocated to each segment based on the segment's cost of sales, while
       expenses associated with the corporate office are allocated to each
       segment based on the segment's inventory balances.




East Region - Homebuilding revenues increased 23% and 16% in the three and nine
months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the prior year periods,
primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed in our South Carolina
markets. The region generated pre-tax income of $54.2 million and $106.4 million
in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to
$40.3 million and $90.6 million in the prior year periods. Pre-tax income was
reduced by inventory impairment charges of $5.8 million in the nine months ended
June 30, 2017 and by $4.2 million and $7.4 million in the three and nine months
ended June 30, 2016, respectively. Gross profit from home sales as a percentage
of home sales revenue (home sales gross profit percentage) decreased by 90 and
30 basis points in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively,
compared to the prior year periods, due to the average cost of homes increasing
by more than the average selling price. The decrease in the three-month period
was also due to higher warranty and construction defect costs in the current
year. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A expenses decreased by 20
basis points and increased by 10 basis points in the three and nine months ended
June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.

INVENTORIES, LAND AND LOT POSITION AND HOMES IN INVENTORY


We routinely enter into land/lot option contracts to purchase land or developed
residential lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with
planned development or anticipated new home demand. We also purchase undeveloped
land that generally is vested with the rights to begin development or
construction work, and we plan and coordinate the development of our land into
residential lots for use in our homebuilding business. We manage our inventory
of owned land and lots and homes under construction relative to demand in each
of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new
home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in
inventory.

     option purchase contracts at June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 was $4.5
     billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, secured by earnest money deposits of
 $201.0 million and $167.0 million, respectively. Our lots controlled under
     land and lot option purchase contracts exclude approximately 300 and 700
     lots at June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, respectively, representing
     lots controlled under lot option contracts for which we do not expect to
     exercise our option to purchase the land or lots, but the underlying
     contracts have yet to be terminated. We have reserved the deposits related
     to these contracts.
(3)  Homes in inventory include approximately 1,600 model homes at both June 30,
     2017 and September 30, 2016. Approximately 12,800 and 11,800 of our homes in
     inventory were unsold at June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, respectively.
     At June 30, 2017, approximately 3,600 of our unsold homes were completed, of
     which approximately 400 homes had been completed for more than six months.
     At September 30, 2016, approximately 3,500 of our unsold homes were
     completed, of which approximately 500 homes had been completed for more than
     six months.

Mortgage Loan Activity

The volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to
the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations. In the three and nine
months ended June 30, 2017, the volume of first-lien loans originated or
brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers increased 13% and 21%, respectively,
primarily as a result of the 16% increase in the number of homes closed by our
homebuilding operations in both periods, combined with a slight increase in our
mortgage capture rate (the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding
operations for which DHI Mortgage handled the homebuyers' financing) in the
nine-month period. Our mortgage capture rate was 55% and 56% in the three and
nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to 56% and 54% in the
prior year periods.

Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 95% of DHI Mortgage
loan originations in both the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017 compared
to 92% in both prior year periods. These rates reflect DHI Mortgage's consistent
focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations.

The number of loans sold increased 6% and 17% in the three and nine months ended
June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. Virtually all
of the mortgage loans held for sale on June 30, 2017 were eligible for sale to
the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or the Government National Mortgage
Association (Ginnie Mae). Approximately 87% of the mortgage loans sold by DHI
Mortgage during the nine months ended June 30, 2017 were sold to three major
financial entities, one of which purchased 46% of the total loans sold.


Financial Services and Other Revenues and Expenses


Revenues from our financial services and other operations increased 11% to $91.9
million and 25% to $256.9 million in the three and nine months ended June 30,
2017, respectively, from $83.1 million and $205.4 million in the prior year
periods, while the number of loan originations increased 9% and 18% during the
same periods. Revenues increased at a higher rate than origination volume in the
nine-month period primarily due to improved loan sale execution in the secondary
market and increased revenue from title operations.

Our mortgage operations revenues were reduced by $0.7 million and $2.6 million
in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, and by $0.7
million and $2.7 million in the prior year periods, to increase our loss
reserves for estimated future recourse obligations and other mortgage loans, and
to adjust certain mortgage loans held for sale to fair value. Our loss reserves
for loan recourse obligations are estimated based upon analysis of the volume of
mortgages originated, loan repurchase requests received, actual repurchases and
losses through the disposition of such loans or requests and discussions with
our mortgage purchasers. Actual losses on mortgage loans may differ from our
estimates, which may result in future changes to our loss reserves.

General and administrative (G&A) expense from financial services and other
operations increased 13% to $65.0 million and 17% to $183.1 million in the three
and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, from $57.5 million and $157.1
million in the prior year periods. These increases were primarily due to
increases in employee related costs due to both increased volume and the cost of
compliance with mortgage industry regulations. Our financial services and other
operations employed 1,812 and 1,548 employees at June 30, 2017 and 2016,
respectively.

As a percentage of financial services and other revenues, G&A expense was 70.7%
and 71.3% in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively,
compared to 69.2% and 76.5% in the prior year periods. Fluctuations in financial
services G&A expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur, as
some components of revenue may fluctuate differently than loan volumes, and some
expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the
amount of revenue earned.


Interest and other income, net of other expense, included in our financial
services and other operations consists primarily of the interest income of our
mortgage subsidiary.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATED
Income before Income Taxes
Pre-tax income for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017 was $444.5
million and $1.1 billion, respectively, compared to $378.6 million and $920.4
million for the prior year periods. The increase in our operating income is
primarily due to higher revenues from increased home closings.
Income Taxes


Our income tax expense for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017 was
$155.5 million and $391.4 million, respectively, compared to $128.8 million and
$317.8 million in the prior year periods. Our effective tax rate was 35.0% and
35.1% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared
to 34.0% and 34.5% in the prior year periods. The effective tax rate for all
periods includes an expense for state income taxes, reduced by tax benefits for
the domestic production activities deduction and federal energy tax credits.

We previously filed three requests for advance consent for a change in tax
accounting method with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) relating to changes in
the timing of income and expense recognition for tax purposes. We agreed to and
signed consent agreements for two of the three requests during the quarter ended
June 30, 2017. The impact of the approved tax accounting method changes on our
consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2017 was a reduction in income
taxes payable of $58.2 million, a reduction in deferred tax assets of $63.5
million and income tax expense of $5.3 million. The third request for advance
consent for a change in tax accounting method will be recognized in the period
in which a consent agreement is issued by the IRS and agreed to and signed by
us.

At June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, we had deferred tax assets, net of
deferred tax liabilities, of $394.1 million and $486.6 million, respectively,
partially offset by valuation allowances of $10.4 million and $10.3 million,
respectively. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of
future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these
future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of
operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state
tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our
deferred tax assets.

When assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it
is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will
not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods. We record a valuation
allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance for both
periods relates to our state deferred tax assets for net operating loss (NOL)
carryforwards. As of June 30, 2017, we believe it is more likely than not that a
portion of our state NOL carryforwards will not be realized because some state
NOL carryforward periods are too brief to realize the related deferred tax
assets. We will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in
determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining
state NOL carryforwards.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY


We have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services and other
operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under bank
credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. Our current levels of
cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the
operational flexibility to adjust to changes in homebuilding market conditions
and allow us to increase our investments in homes, finished lots, land and land
development to expand our operations and grow our profitability.

At June 30, 2017, our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital (homebuilding
notes payable divided by total equity plus homebuilding notes payable) was 24.8%
compared to 29.2% at September 30, 2016 and 30.0% at June 30, 2016. Over the
long term, we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital
below 40%, and we expect it to remain significantly lower than 40% throughout
fiscal 2017 and 2018. We believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total
capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding
operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders. We
exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately
capitalized, and its obligation under its repurchase facility is substantially
collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our
homebuilding entities.

We believe that our existing cash resources, our revolving credit facility and
our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our
near-term working capital needs. We expect to have the cash on hand and other
immediately available capital to fund the approximately $560 million cash
consideration for the proposed Forestar merger. We regularly assess our
projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt
obligations, and support other general corporate and operational needs, and we
regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. We have an
automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the
SEC in August 2015, registering debt and equity securities which we may issue
from time to time in amounts to be determined. As market conditions permit, we
may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or
obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or
provide additional liquidity.


Capital Resources - Homebuilding
Cash and Cash Equivalents - At June 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents of our
homebuilding segment totaled $460.8 million.


Bank Credit Facility - We have a $975 million senior unsecured revolving credit
facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of
the facility to $1.25 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of
additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of
letters of credit with a sublimit equal to approximately 50% of the revolving
credit commitment. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the
available borrowing capacity. The interest rate on borrowings under the
revolving credit facility may be based on either the Prime Rate or London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin, as defined in the
credit agreement governing the facility. The maturity date of the facility is
September 7, 2020. Borrowings and repayments under the facility were $700
million during the three months ended June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2017, there
were no borrowings outstanding and $75.1 million of letters of credit issued
under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $899.9
million.

Our revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and
activities, including requiring the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible
net worth, a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a
borrowing base restriction if our ratio of debt to tangible net worth exceeds a
certain level. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement
governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to
comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate
the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any
outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. In addition,
the credit agreement governing the facility imposes restrictions on the creation
of secured debt and liens. At June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of
the covenants, limitations and restrictions of our revolving credit facility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Table of Contents


Secured Letter of Credit Agreement - We have a secured letter of credit
agreement which requires us to deposit cash, in an amount approximating the
balance of letters of credit outstanding, as collateral with the issuing bank.
The amount of cash restricted for letters of credit issued under this agreement
totaled $2.8 million and $2.9 million at June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016,
respectively, and is included in homebuilding restricted cash in our
consolidated balance sheets.

Public Unsecured Debt - On May 15, 2017, we repaid the $350 million principal
amount of our 4.75% senior notes, which were due on that date. The indenture
governing our senior notes imposes restrictions on the creation of secured debt
and liens. At June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the limitations
and restrictions associated with our public debt obligations.


Repurchases of Common Stock - During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we
repurchased 1,850,000 shares of our common stock for $60.6 million.


Debt and Equity Repurchase Authorizations - Effective August 1, 2016, our Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities
and $100 million of our common stock effective through July 31, 2017. The full
amount of the debt securities authorization was remaining at June 30, 2017.
Repurchases of common stock through June 30, 2017 reduced the stock repurchase
authorization to $39.4 million. In July 2017, our Board of Directors authorized
the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities and $200 million of our
common stock effective through July 31, 2018, which replaced the previous
authorizations.


Capital Resources - Financial Services and Other
Cash and Cash Equivalents - At June 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents of our
financial services and other operations totaled $51.6 million.


Mortgage Repurchase Facility - Our mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, has a
mortgage repurchase facility that is accounted for as a secured financing. The
mortgage repurchase facility provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by
facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible
loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties,
thereby becoming purchased loans. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation
to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in
the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 60 days in
accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. In February 2017,
the mortgage repurchase facility was amended to increase its capacity to $600
million and extend its maturity date to February 23, 2018. The capacity of the
facility increases, without requiring additional commitments, to $725 million
for approximately 30 days at each quarter end and to $800 million for
approximately 45 days at fiscal year end. The capacity of the facility can also
be increased to $1.0 billion subject to the availability of additional
commitments.

As of June 30, 2017, $584.5 million of mortgage loans held for sale with a
collateral value of $564.1 million were pledged under the mortgage repurchase
facility. As a result of advance paydowns totaling $90.7 million, DHI Mortgage
had an obligation of $473.4 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase
facility at June 30, 2017 at a 3.3% annual interest rate.

The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any
of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. The facility contains
financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary's minimum required tangible
net worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its
minimum required liquidity. These covenants are measured and reported to the
lenders monthly. At June 30, 2017, DHI Mortgage was in compliance with all of
the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.

In the past, our mortgage subsidiary has been able to renew or extend its
mortgage credit facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms
prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through
amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes
of mortgages held for sale. The liquidity of our financial services business
depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase
facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.

Operating Cash Flow Activities


In the nine months ended June 30, 2017, net cash used in operating activities
was $190.8 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $88.6
million in the prior year period. We used $870.9 million of cash to increase our
construction in progress and finished home inventory compared to $879.1 million
used in the prior year period. The cash used in both periods increased our
number of homes under construction to support an expected increase in sales and
closings volumes. Cash used to increase residential land and lots inventory was
$352.2 million compared to $151.3 million of cash provided by a decrease in
residential land and lots inventory in the prior year period. The most
significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both periods was
net income.


Investing Cash Flow Activities


In the nine months ended June 30, 2017, net cash used in investing activities
was $121.0 million compared to $27.2 million in the prior year period. We used
$103.5 million and $65.2 million in the nine months ended June 30, 2017 and
2016, respectively, to purchase and construct property and equipment, including
office buildings, rental properties, model home furniture and office and
technology equipment to support our operations. During the current year period,
we purchased $8.8 million of debt securities which were secured by residential
real estate, and in the prior year period, we sold a previous investment in debt
securities for proceeds of $35.8 million. Additionally, we paid $4.1 million
during the current year period to complete our purchase of the homebuilding
operations of Wilson Parker Homes, acquired in September 2016.


Financing Cash Flow Activities


We expect the short-term financing needs of our operations will be funded with
existing cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our
homebuilding and financial services credit facilities. Long-term financing needs
for the growth of our operations have historically been funded with the issuance
of senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets.

During the nine months ended June 30, 2017, net cash used in financing
activities was $479.0 million, consisting primarily of note repayments, payments
of cash dividends and repurchases of common stock, partially offset by note
proceeds. Note repayments of $1.1 billion included our repayment of the $350
million principal amount of our 4.75% senior notes at maturity and repayments of
amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility of $700 million. Proceeds from
notes payable of $700.4 million included draws of $700 million on the revolving
credit facility and borrowings of $0.4 million under our mortgage repurchase
facility. We also used cash to repurchase 1,850,000 shares of our common stock
for $60.6 million during the period. During the nine months ended June 30, 2016,
net cash used in financing activities was $538.4 million, consisting primarily
of note repayments and payments of cash dividends. Note repayments of $543.9
million included our repayment of $170.2 million principal amount of our 5.625%
senior notes and $372.7 million principal amount of our 6.5% senior notes at
maturity.

During the three months ended June 30, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a
quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share, which was paid on May 19,
2017 to stockholders of record on May 5, 2017. In July 2017, our Board of
Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable
on August 23, 2017 to stockholders of record on August 9, 2017. Quarterly cash
dividends of $0.08 per common share were approved and paid in the comparable
quarters of fiscal 2016. The declaration of future cash dividends is at the
discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things,
our future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, financial condition and
general business conditions.

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS, COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET
ARRANGEMENTS


Our primary contractual cash obligations are payments under our debt agreements
and lease payments under operating leases. We expect to fund our contractual
obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our
existing cash resources, cash flows generated from profits, our homebuilding and
financial services credit facilities or other bank financing, and the issuance
of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market
conditions may permit.

At June 30, 2017, our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit
of $77.9 million and surety bonds of $1.2 billion, issued by third parties to
secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our performance
obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be
completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the
applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the
related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter,
leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have no material third-party
guarantees.

Our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending
activities of our mortgage operations. Further discussion of these commitments
is provided in Item 3 "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk" under Part I of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

We enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for
the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant
lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks
associated with land ownership and development. Among our land and lot option
purchase contracts at June 30, 2017, there were a limited number of contracts,
representing $30.1 million of remaining purchase price, subject to specific
performance provisions which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon
the land sellers meeting their contractual obligations. Further information
about our land option contracts is provided in the "Inventories, Land and Lot
Position and Homes in Inventory" section included herein.

On June 29, 2017, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Forestar
Group Inc. (Forestar), a publicly-traded residential real estate development
company, to acquire 75% of the currently outstanding shares of Forestar for
$17.75 per share in cash or approximately $560 million of total cash
consideration. Forestar stockholders will have the right to receive cash or
retain their shares of the surviving entity as described in Note A. The
transaction is expected to close during our first quarter of fiscal 2018,
subject to the approval of Forestar shareholders and other customary closing
conditions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

As disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2016, our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue
recognition, inventories and cost of sales, business acquisitions, goodwill,
warranty claims, legal claims and insurance, income taxes, stock-based
compensation and fair value measurements. Since September 30, 2016, there have
been no significant changes to those critical accounting policies.

As disclosed in our critical accounting policies in our Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2016, our reserves for construction defect claims
include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims.
At both June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, we had reserves for approximately
140 pending construction defect claims, and no individual existing claim was
material to our financial statements. During the nine months ended June 30,
2017, we established reserves for approximately 60 new construction defect
claims and resolved 60 construction defect claims for a total cost of $36.1
million. At June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we had reserves for
approximately 155 and 185 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and
no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. During
the nine months ended June 30, 2016, we established reserves for approximately
55 new construction defect claims and resolved 85 construction defect claims for
a total cost of $31.8 million.



SEASONALITY


Although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal
patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close
more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and
fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal nature of our business can also
cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in both our
homebuilding and financial services operations. As a result of seasonal
activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end
of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance
of our fiscal year.

        in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase

        industries;
•       our ability to effect our growth strategies, acquisitions or investments
        successfully, including the proposed Forestar merger;
• the effects of the loss of key personnel; and

for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, including the section entitled
"Risk Factors," which is filed with the SEC.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and related notes included in this quarterly report and with our
annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Some of
the information contained in this discussion and analysis constitutes
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results
could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include,
but are not limited to, those described in the "Forward-Looking Statements"
section following this discussion.



BUSINESS


D.R. Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the United States as
measured by number of homes closed and revenues. We construct and sell homes
through our operating divisions in 79 markets in 26 states, under the names of
D.R. Horton, America's Builder, Emerald Homes, Express Homes, Freedom Homes and
Pacific Ridge Homes. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "D.R.
Horton," the "Company," "we" and "our" used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries.

Our business operations consist of homebuilding, financial services and other
activities. Our homebuilding operations primarily include the construction and
sale of single-family homes with sales prices generally ranging from $100,000 to
more than $1,000,000, with an average closing price of $295,200 during the nine
months ended June 30, 2017. Approximately 89% of our home sales revenues in the
nine months ended June 30, 2017 were generated from the sale of single-family
detached homes, with the remainder from the sale of attached homes, such as
townhomes, duplexes, triplexes and condominiums. We owned approximately 400
attached and detached residential rental homes in our homebuilding operations at
June 30, 2017 compared to 600 at September 30, 2016.

On June 29, 2017, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Forestar
Group Inc. (Forestar), a publicly-traded residential real estate development
company, to acquire 75% of the currently outstanding shares of Forestar for
$17.75 per share in cash or approximately $560 million of total cash
consideration. Forestar stockholders will have the right to receive cash or
retain their shares of the surviving entity as described in Note A. The
transaction is expected to close during our first quarter of fiscal 2018,
subject to the approval of Forestar shareholders and other customary closing
conditions. The transaction is a component of our strategy to expand
relationships with land developers and increase the optioned portion of our land
and lot position to enhance operational efficiency and returns.

Our financial services operations provide mortgage financing and title agency
services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our
100% owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily to our
homebuyers and generally sells the mortgages it originates and the related
servicing rights to third-party purchasers. DHI Mortgage originates loans in
accordance with purchaser guidelines and sells substantially all of its mortgage
production shortly after origination. Our subsidiary title companies serve as
title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies, examination and
closing services, primarily to our homebuyers.

In addition to our core homebuilding and financial services operations, we have
subsidiaries that engage in other business activities. These subsidiaries
conduct insurance-related operations, construct and own income-producing rental
properties, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and
improvements and own and operate oil and gas related assets. At June 30, 2017,
assets totaling $120.1 million associated with these subsidiaries were included
in the Financial Services and Other section of our balance sheet.

OVERVIEW


During the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, demand for new homes continued
to reflect the stable to moderately improved trends we experienced across most
of our operating markets in fiscal 2016. We continue to see varying levels of
strength in new home demand and home prices across our markets, with demand in
each market generally reflecting the relative strength of each market's economy,
as measured by job growth, household incomes, household formations and consumer
confidence.

Our position as the largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder in the
United States provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales.
In recent years, we have focused on expanding our product offerings to
consistently include a broad range of homes for entry-level, move-up and luxury
buyers across most of our markets. Our affordable entry-level homes have
experienced very strong demand from homebuyers, as the entry-level segment of
the new home market remains under-served, with low inventory levels relative to
demand. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we have been introducing
affordable homes in communities designed for active adult buyers seeking a
low-maintenance lifestyle. We plan to continue to expand our product offerings
across more of our operating markets.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the number and value of our net sales
orders increased 11% and 13%, respectively, compared to the prior year quarter,
and the number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 16% and 17%,
respectively. Our pre-tax income in the third quarter was $444.5 million
compared to $378.6 million in the prior year quarter, and our pre-tax operating
margin was 11.8% compared to 11.7%.

We believe our business is well positioned for the future because of our broad
geographic footprint and diverse product offerings, our ample supply of finished
lots, land and homes, our strong balance sheet and liquidity and our experienced
personnel across our operating markets. We remain focused on growing our
profitability, generating positive annual cash flows from operations and
managing our product offerings, pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to
optimize the return on our inventory investments.

We believe that housing demand in our individual operating markets is tied
closely to each market's economy; therefore, we expect that housing market
conditions will vary across our markets. If the U.S. economy continues to
improve, we expect to see slow to moderate growth in housing demand,
concentrated in markets where job growth is occurring. The pace and
sustainability of new home demand and our future results could be negatively
affected by weakening economic conditions, decreases in the level of employment

STRATEGY


Our operating strategy focuses on leveraging our financial and competitive
position to increase the returns on our inventory investments and generate
strong profitability and cash flows, while managing risk. This strategy includes
the following initiatives:
•       Maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position and
        controlling our level of debt.


•       Allocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our
        operating markets to diversify our geographic risk.


•       Offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of
        entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury homebuyers based on
        consumer demand in each market.


•       Modifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices and sales incentives
        as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand.
•       Managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in
        each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to
        capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold,
        completed homes in inventory.


•       Investing in land and land development and pursuing opportunistic
        acquisitions of homebuilding companies in desirable markets, while
        controlling the level of land and lots we own in each of our markets
        relative to the local new home demand.
•       Increasing the amount of land and finished lots controlled through option
        purchase contracts by expanding relationships with land developers across
        the country.
• Controlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors.
•       Improving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales and
        other key operational activities.
•       Controlling our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense
        infrastructure to match production levels.




We believe our operating strategy, which has produced positive results in recent
years, will allow us to maintain and improve our competitive position, financial
performance and balance sheet strength. However, we cannot provide any
assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful, and
we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market
conditions.

Net Sales Orders

The value of net sales orders increased 13% to $3.9 billion (13,040 homes) for
the three months ended June 30, 2017 from $3.4 billion (11,714 homes) in the
prior year period, with increases in most of our regions. The value of net sales
orders increased 15% to $10.8 billion (36,272 homes) for the nine months ended
June 30, 2017 from $9.4 billion (32,070 homes) in the prior year period, with
increases in all of our regions. The increases in the value of sales orders were
primarily due to increases in volume and to a lesser extent, increases in
selling prices in most regions.

The number of net sales orders increased 11% and 13% in the three and nine
months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.
The overall increase in our net sales orders reflects the continued stable to
moderately improved market conditions in most of our markets. Our Phoenix market
contributed the most to the higher volume in our Southwest region and our North
Carolina markets contributed most to the higher volume in our East region. The
decrease in volume in our Midwest region was due to lower sales in our Chicago
and Denver markets during the quarter. Our sales order cancellation rates
(cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period) remained
consistent with the prior year periods.


We believe our business is well positioned to continue to generate increased
sales volume; however, our future sales volumes will depend on the economic
strength of each of our operating markets and our ability to successfully
implement our operating strategies in each market.

Sales Order Backlog

Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the
end of the period. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject
to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their
existing homes, which can result in cancellations. A portion of the contracts in
backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations.

Home Sales Revenue

Revenues from home sales increased 17% to $3.7 billion (12,497 homes closed) for
the three months ended June 30, 2017 from $3.1 billion (10,739 homes closed) in
the prior year period. Revenues from home sales increased 18% to $9.6 billion
(32,586 homes closed) for the nine months ended June 30, 2017 from $8.1 billion
(28,062 homes closed) in the prior year period. The overall increase in home
sales revenues reflects the continued stable to moderately improved market
conditions in most of our markets.

The number of homes closed increased 16% in both the three and nine months ended
June 30, 2017 compared to the prior year periods due to increases in all of our
regions. Our Phoenix, Florida and South Carolina markets contributed the most to
higher closings volumes in our Southwest, Southeast and East regions,
respectively. The average selling price of homes closed during the three and
nine months ended June 30, 2017 was $293,100 and $295,200, respectively, up
slightly from the prior year periods.

Home Sales Gross Profit


Gross profit from home sales increased 15% to $725.4 million in the three months
ended June 30, 2017 from $632.2 million in the prior year period and decreased
50 basis points to 19.8% as a percentage of home sales revenues. The 50 basis
point decrease in home sales gross profit percentage resulted from decreases of
60 basis points due to an increase in warranty and construction defect expenses
as a percentage of home sales revenues, 20 basis points due to the average cost
of our homes closed increasing by more than the average selling price and 10
basis points related to an increase in the amount of purchase accounting
adjustments for recent acquisitions. These decreases were partially offset by an
improvement of 40 basis points due to a decrease in the amortization of
capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenues.

Gross profit from home sales increased 17% to $1.9 billion in the nine months
ended June 30, 2017 from $1.6 billion in the prior year period and decreased
30 basis points to 19.8% as a percentage of home sales revenues. The 30 basis
point decrease in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from decreases
of 60 basis points due to an increase in warranty and construction defect
expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues and 10 basis points related to
an increase in the amount of purchase accounting adjustments for recent
acquisitions. These decreases were partially offset by improvements of 30 basis
points due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and
property taxes and 10 basis points due to the average selling price of our homes
increasing by more than the average cost.

We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of
our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments and adjust
to local market conditions. Our gross profit margins have remained relatively
stable in recent years and based on current market conditions, we expect
continued stability; however, our gross profit margins could fluctuate in future
periods.


Land Sales and Other Revenues


Land sales and other revenues were $22.2 million and $56.9 million in the three
and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, and $30.1 million and $65.2
million in the comparable periods of 2016. We continually evaluate our land and
lot supply, and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur
based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets. We generally
purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them. However,
some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we
may sell to commercial developers. We may also sell residential lots or land
parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons. As of June 30,
2017, we had $11.5 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the
next twelve months.

  Table of Contents
Inventory and Land Option Charges


At June 30, 2017, we reviewed the performance and outlook for all of our
communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and
performed detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary. We
performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities and land inventories
with a combined carrying value of $75.0 million and recorded impairment charges
of $1.0 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017 to reduce the
carrying value of impaired communities to their estimated fair value. During the
nine months ended June 30, 2017, impairment charges totaled $10.4 million. There
were $5.2 million and $8.9 million of impairment charges recorded in the three
and nine months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.

As we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize
returns and cash flows, we may modify our pricing and incentives, construction
and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities
and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities
being evaluated for potential impairment. Also, if housing or economic
conditions weaken in specific markets in which we operate, or if conditions
weaken in the broader economy or homebuilding industry, we may be required to
evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. These evaluations
could result in additional impairment charges.

During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, we wrote off $4.4 million
and $9.5 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition
costs related to land option contracts that we have terminated or expect to
terminate. Earnest money and pre-acquisition cost write-offs for the three and
nine months ended June 30, 2016 were $2.9 million and $7.1 million,
respectively.


Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense


SG&A expense from homebuilding activities increased 11% to $309.5 million and
12% to $872.4 million in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017,
respectively, from $279.3 million and $778.4 million in the prior year periods.
As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A expense decreased 50 basis points
to 8.4% and 9.0% in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively,
from 8.9% and 9.5% in the prior year periods. This improvement in SG&A expense
as a percentage of revenues was achieved primarily through leverage of our fixed
overhead costs resulting from the increase in homebuilding revenues.

Employee compensation and related costs represented 73% and 71% of SG&A costs in
the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to 69% in
both prior year periods. These costs increased 17% to $226.5 million and 15% to
$615.7 million in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively,
due to increases in the number of employees and the amount of incentive
compensation as compared to the prior year periods. Our homebuilding operations
employed 5,870 and 5,172 employees at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.


We attempt to control our SG&A costs while ensuring that our infrastructure
adequately supports our operations. We expect our SG&A expense as a percentage
of homebuilding revenues to be lower in fiscal 2017 than in fiscal 2016.
Interest Incurred


We capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and
construction (active inventory). Capitalized interest is charged to cost of
sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. Interest incurred
decreased 8% to $32.4 million and 16% to $99.4 million in the three and nine
months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.
These decreases were due to decreases in our average debt of 6% and 12% in the
three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, and lower average
interest rates on outstanding debt during the periods. Interest charged to cost
of sales was 1.3% and 1.4% of total cost of sales (excluding inventory and land
option charges) in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively,
compared to 1.7% and 1.8% in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively.


Other Income


Other income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations was
$1.3 million and $7.8 million in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017,
respectively, compared to $1.9 million and $11.2 million in the prior year
periods. Other income in the nine-month period of fiscal 2016 includes a $4.5
million gain from the sale of an investment in debt securities. Other income
consists of interest income, rental income and various other types of ancillary
income, gains, expenses and losses not directly associated with our homebuilding
operations. The activities that result in this ancillary income or expense are
not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.

(1)    Expenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of interest
       and property taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales
       or expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our corporate
       office. The amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes is
       allocated to each segment based on the segment's cost of sales, while
       expenses associated with the corporate office are allocated to each
       segment based on the segment's inventory balances.




East Region - Homebuilding revenues increased 23% and 16% in the three and nine
months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the prior year periods,
primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed in our South Carolina
markets. The region generated pre-tax income of $54.2 million and $106.4 million
in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to
$40.3 million and $90.6 million in the prior year periods. Pre-tax income was
reduced by inventory impairment charges of $5.8 million in the nine months ended
June 30, 2017 and by $4.2 million and $7.4 million in the three and nine months
ended June 30, 2016, respectively. Gross profit from home sales as a percentage
of home sales revenue (home sales gross profit percentage) decreased by 90 and
30 basis points in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively,
compared to the prior year periods, due to the average cost of homes increasing
by more than the average selling price. The decrease in the three-month period
was also due to higher warranty and construction defect costs in the current
year. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A expenses decreased by 20
basis points and increased by 10 basis points in the three and nine months ended
June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.

INVENTORIES, LAND AND LOT POSITION AND HOMES IN INVENTORY


We routinely enter into land/lot option contracts to purchase land or developed
residential lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with
planned development or anticipated new home demand. We also purchase undeveloped
land that generally is vested with the rights to begin development or
construction work, and we plan and coordinate the development of our land into
residential lots for use in our homebuilding business. We manage our inventory
of owned land and lots and homes under construction relative to demand in each
of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new
home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold, completed homes in
inventory.

Mortgage Loan Activity

The volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to
the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations. In the three and nine
months ended June 30, 2017, the volume of first-lien loans originated or
brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers increased 13% and 21%, respectively,
primarily as a result of the 16% increase in the number of homes closed by our
homebuilding operations in both periods, combined with a slight increase in our
mortgage capture rate (the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding
operations for which DHI Mortgage handled the homebuyers' financing) in the
nine-month period. Our mortgage capture rate was 55% and 56% in the three and
nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to 56% and 54% in the
prior year periods.

Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 95% of DHI Mortgage
loan originations in both the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017 compared
to 92% in both prior year periods. These rates reflect DHI Mortgage's consistent
focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations.

The number of loans sold increased 6% and 17% in the three and nine months ended
June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. Virtually all
of the mortgage loans held for sale on June 30, 2017 were eligible for sale to
the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or the Government National Mortgage
Association (Ginnie Mae). Approximately 87% of the mortgage loans sold by DHI
Mortgage during the nine months ended June 30, 2017 were sold to three major
financial entities, one of which purchased 46% of the total loans sold.


Financial Services and Other Revenues and Expenses


Revenues from our financial services and other operations increased 11% to $91.9
million and 25% to $256.9 million in the three and nine months ended June 30,
2017, respectively, from $83.1 million and $205.4 million in the prior year
periods, while the number of loan originations increased 9% and 18% during the
same periods. Revenues increased at a higher rate than origination volume in the
nine-month period primarily due to improved loan sale execution in the secondary
market and increased revenue from title operations.

Our mortgage operations revenues were reduced by $0.7 million and $2.6 million
in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, and by $0.7
million and $2.7 million in the prior year periods, to increase our loss
reserves for estimated future recourse obligations and other mortgage loans, and
to adjust certain mortgage loans held for sale to fair value. Our loss reserves
for loan recourse obligations are estimated based upon analysis of the volume of
mortgages originated, loan repurchase requests received, actual repurchases and
losses through the disposition of such loans or requests and discussions with
our mortgage purchasers. Actual losses on mortgage loans may differ from our
estimates, which may result in future changes to our loss reserves.

General and administrative (G&A) expense from financial services and other
operations increased 13% to $65.0 million and 17% to $183.1 million in the three
and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, from $57.5 million and $157.1
million in the prior year periods. These increases were primarily due to
increases in employee related costs due to both increased volume and the cost of
compliance with mortgage industry regulations. Our financial services and other
operations employed 1,812 and 1,548 employees at June 30, 2017 and 2016,
respectively.

As a percentage of financial services and other revenues, G&A expense was 70.7%
and 71.3% in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively,
compared to 69.2% and 76.5% in the prior year periods. Fluctuations in financial
services G&A expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur, as
some components of revenue may fluctuate differently than loan volumes, and some
expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the
amount of revenue earned.


Interest and other income, net of other expense, included in our financial
services and other operations consists primarily of the interest income of our
mortgage subsidiary.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATED
Income before Income Taxes
Pre-tax income for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017 was $444.5
million and $1.1 billion, respectively, compared to $378.6 million and $920.4
million for the prior year periods. The increase in our operating income is
primarily due to higher revenues from increased home closings.
Income Taxes


Our income tax expense for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017 was
$155.5 million and $391.4 million, respectively, compared to $128.8 million and
$317.8 million in the prior year periods. Our effective tax rate was 35.0% and
35.1% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared
to 34.0% and 34.5% in the prior year periods. The effective tax rate for all
periods includes an expense for state income taxes, reduced by tax benefits for
the domestic production activities deduction and federal energy tax credits.

We previously filed three requests for advance consent for a change in tax
accounting method with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) relating to changes in
the timing of income and expense recognition for tax purposes. We agreed to and
signed consent agreements for two of the three requests during the quarter ended
June 30, 2017. The impact of the approved tax accounting method changes on our
consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2017 was a reduction in income
taxes payable of $58.2 million, a reduction in deferred tax assets of $63.5
million and income tax expense of $5.3 million. The third request for advance
consent for a change in tax accounting method will be recognized in the period
in which a consent agreement is issued by the IRS and agreed to and signed by
us.

At June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, we had deferred tax assets, net of
deferred tax liabilities, of $394.1 million and $486.6 million, respectively,
partially offset by valuation allowances of $10.4 million and $10.3 million,
respectively. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of
future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these
future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of
operations or financial position. Also, changes in existing federal and state
tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our
deferred tax assets.

When assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it
is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will
not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods. We record a valuation
allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance for both
periods relates to our state deferred tax assets for net operating loss (NOL)
carryforwards. As of June 30, 2017, we believe it is more likely than not that a
portion of our state NOL carryforwards will not be realized because some state
NOL carryforward periods are too brief to realize the related deferred tax
assets. We will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in
determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining
state NOL carryforwards.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY


We have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services and other
operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under bank
credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. Our current levels of
cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the
operational flexibility to adjust to changes in homebuilding market conditions
and allow us to increase our investments in homes, finished lots, land and land
development to expand our operations and grow our profitability.

At June 30, 2017, our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital (homebuilding
notes payable divided by total equity plus homebuilding notes payable) was 24.8%
compared to 29.2% at September 30, 2016 and 30.0% at June 30, 2016. Over the
long term, we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital
below 40%, and we expect it to remain significantly lower than 40% throughout
fiscal 2017 and 2018. We believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total
capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding
operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders. We
exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately
capitalized, and its obligation under its repurchase facility is substantially
collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our
homebuilding entities.

We believe that our existing cash resources, our revolving credit facility and
our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our
near-term working capital needs. We expect to have the cash on hand and other
immediately available capital to fund the approximately $560 million cash
consideration for the proposed Forestar merger. We regularly assess our
projected capital requirements to fund growth in our business, repay debt
obligations, and support other general corporate and operational needs, and we
regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. We have an
automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the
SEC in August 2015, registering debt and equity securities which we may issue
from time to time in amounts to be determined. As market conditions permit, we
may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or
obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or
provide additional liquidity.


Capital Resources - Homebuilding
Cash and Cash Equivalents - At June 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents of our
homebuilding segment totaled $460.8 million.


Bank Credit Facility - We have a $975 million senior unsecured revolving credit
facility with an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of
the facility to $1.25 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of
additional bank commitments. The facility also provides for the issuance of
letters of credit with a sublimit equal to approximately 50% of the revolving
credit commitment. Letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the
available borrowing capacity. The interest rate on borrowings under the
revolving credit facility may be based on either the Prime Rate or London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin, as defined in the
credit agreement governing the facility. The maturity date of the facility is
September 7, 2020. Borrowings and repayments under the facility were $700
million during the three months ended June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2017, there
were no borrowings outstanding and $75.1 million of letters of credit issued
under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $899.9
million.

Our revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and
activities, including requiring the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible
net worth, a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a
borrowing base restriction if our ratio of debt to tangible net worth exceeds a
certain level. These covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement
governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. A failure to
comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate
the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any
outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. In addition,
the credit agreement governing the facility imposes restrictions on the creation
of secured debt and liens. At June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of
the covenants, limitations and restrictions of our revolving credit facility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Table of Contents


Secured Letter of Credit Agreement - We have a secured letter of credit
agreement which requires us to deposit cash, in an amount approximating the
balance of letters of credit outstanding, as collateral with the issuing bank.
The amount of cash restricted for letters of credit issued under this agreement
totaled $2.8 million and $2.9 million at June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016,
respectively, and is included in homebuilding restricted cash in our
consolidated balance sheets.

Public Unsecured Debt - On May 15, 2017, we repaid the $350 million principal
amount of our 4.75% senior notes, which were due on that date. The indenture
governing our senior notes imposes restrictions on the creation of secured debt
and liens. At June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the limitations
and restrictions associated with our public debt obligations.


Repurchases of Common Stock - During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we
repurchased 1,850,000 shares of our common stock for $60.6 million.


Debt and Equity Repurchase Authorizations - Effective August 1, 2016, our Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities
and $100 million of our common stock effective through July 31, 2017. The full
amount of the debt securities authorization was remaining at June 30, 2017.
Repurchases of common stock through June 30, 2017 reduced the stock repurchase
authorization to $39.4 million. In July 2017, our Board of Directors authorized
the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities and $200 million of our
common stock effective through July 31, 2018, which replaced the previous
authorizations.


Capital Resources - Financial Services and Other
Cash and Cash Equivalents - At June 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents of our
financial services and other operations totaled $51.6 million.


Mortgage Repurchase Facility - Our mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, has a
mortgage repurchase facility that is accounted for as a secured financing. The
mortgage repurchase facility provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by
facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible
loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties,
thereby becoming purchased loans. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation
to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in
the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 60 days in
accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. In February 2017,
the mortgage repurchase facility was amended to increase its capacity to $600
million and extend its maturity date to February 23, 2018. The capacity of the
facility increases, without requiring additional commitments, to $725 million
for approximately 30 days at each quarter end and to $800 million for
approximately 45 days at fiscal year end. The capacity of the facility can also
be increased to $1.0 billion subject to the availability of additional
commitments.

As of June 30, 2017, $584.5 million of mortgage loans held for sale with a
collateral value of $564.1 million were pledged under the mortgage repurchase
facility. As a result of advance paydowns totaling $90.7 million, DHI Mortgage
had an obligation of $473.4 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase
facility at June 30, 2017 at a 3.3% annual interest rate.

The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by D.R. Horton, Inc. or any
of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. The facility contains
financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary's minimum required tangible
net worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its
minimum required liquidity. These covenants are measured and reported to the
lenders monthly. At June 30, 2017, DHI Mortgage was in compliance with all of
the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.

In the past, our mortgage subsidiary has been able to renew or extend its
mortgage credit facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms
prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through
amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes
of mortgages held for sale. The liquidity of our financial services business
depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase
facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.

Operating Cash Flow Activities


In the nine months ended June 30, 2017, net cash used in operating activities
was $190.8 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $88.6
million in the prior year period. We used $870.9 million of cash to increase our
construction in progress and finished home inventory compared to $879.1 million
used in the prior year period. The cash used in both periods increased our
number of homes under construction to support an expected increase in sales and
closings volumes. Cash used to increase residential land and lots inventory was
$352.2 million compared to $151.3 million of cash provided by a decrease in
residential land and lots inventory in the prior year period. The most
significant source of cash provided by operating activities in both periods was
net income.


Investing Cash Flow Activities


In the nine months ended June 30, 2017, net cash used in investing activities
was $121.0 million compared to $27.2 million in the prior year period. We used
$103.5 million and $65.2 million in the nine months ended June 30, 2017 and
2016, respectively, to purchase and construct property and equipment, including
office buildings, rental properties, model home furniture and office and
technology equipment to support our operations. During the current year period,
we purchased $8.8 million of debt securities which were secured by residential
real estate, and in the prior year period, we sold a previous investment in debt
securities for proceeds of $35.8 million. Additionally, we paid $4.1 million
during the current year period to complete our purchase of the homebuilding
operations of Wilson Parker Homes, acquired in September 2016.


Financing Cash Flow Activities


We expect the short-term financing needs of our operations will be funded with
existing cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our
homebuilding and financial services credit facilities. Long-term financing needs
for the growth of our operations have historically been funded with the issuance
of senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets.

During the nine months ended June 30, 2017, net cash used in financing
activities was $479.0 million, consisting primarily of note repayments, payments
of cash dividends and repurchases of common stock, partially offset by note
proceeds. Note repayments of $1.1 billion included our repayment of the $350
million principal amount of our 4.75% senior notes at maturity and repayments of
amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility of $700 million. Proceeds from
notes payable of $700.4 million included draws of $700 million on the revolving
credit facility and borrowings of $0.4 million under our mortgage repurchase
facility. We also used cash to repurchase 1,850,000 shares of our common stock
for $60.6 million during the period. During the nine months ended June 30, 2016,
net cash used in financing activities was $538.4 million, consisting primarily
of note repayments and payments of cash dividends. Note repayments of $543.9
million included our repayment of $170.2 million principal amount of our 5.625%
senior notes and $372.7 million principal amount of our 6.5% senior notes at
maturity.

During the three months ended June 30, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a
quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share, which was paid on May 19,
2017 to stockholders of record on May 5, 2017. In July 2017, our Board of
Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable
on August 23, 2017 to stockholders of record on August 9, 2017. Quarterly cash
dividends of $0.08 per common share were approved and paid in the comparable
quarters of fiscal 2016. The declaration of future cash dividends is at the
discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things,
our future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, financial condition and
general business conditions.

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS, COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET
ARRANGEMENTS


Our primary contractual cash obligations are payments under our debt agreements
and lease payments under operating leases. We expect to fund our contractual
obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our
existing cash resources, cash flows generated from profits, our homebuilding and
financial services credit facilities or other bank financing, and the issuance
of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market
conditions may permit.

At June 30, 2017, our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit
of $77.9 million and surety bonds of $1.2 billion, issued by third parties to
secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our performance
obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be
completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the
applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the
related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter,
leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have no material third-party
guarantees.

Our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending
activities of our mortgage operations. Further discussion of these commitments
is provided in Item 3 "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk" under Part I of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

We enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for
the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant
lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks
associated with land ownership and development. Among our land and lot option
purchase contracts at June 30, 2017, there were a limited number of contracts,
representing $30.1 million of remaining purchase price, subject to specific
performance provisions which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon
the land sellers meeting their contractual obligations. Further information
about our land option contracts is provided in the "Inventories, Land and Lot
Position and Homes in Inventory" section included herein.

On June 29, 2017, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Forestar
Group Inc. (Forestar), a publicly-traded residential real estate development
company, to acquire 75% of the currently outstanding shares of Forestar for
$17.75 per share in cash or approximately $560 million of total cash
consideration. Forestar stockholders will have the right to receive cash or
retain their shares of the surviving entity as described in Note A. The
transaction is expected to close during our first quarter of fiscal 2018,
subject to the approval of Forestar shareholders and other customary closing
conditions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

As disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2016, our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue
recognition, inventories and cost of sales, business acquisitions, goodwill,
warranty claims, legal claims and insurance, income taxes, stock-based
compensation and fair value measurements. Since September 30, 2016, there have
been no significant changes to those critical accounting policies.

As disclosed in our critical accounting policies in our Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2016, our reserves for construction defect claims
include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims.
At both June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, we had reserves for approximately
140 pending construction defect claims, and no individual existing claim was
material to our financial statements. During the nine months ended June 30,
2017, we established reserves for approximately 60 new construction defect
claims and resolved 60 construction defect claims for a total cost of $36.1
million. At June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we had reserves for
approximately 155 and 185 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and
no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. During
the nine months ended June 30, 2016, we established reserves for approximately
55 new construction defect claims and resolved 85 construction defect claims for
a total cost of $31.8 million.



SEASONALITY


Although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal
patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close
more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and
fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal nature of our business can also
cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in both our
homebuilding and financial services operations. As a result of seasonal
activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end
of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance
of our fiscal year.

        in our ability to sell mortgage loans on attractive terms or an increase

        industries;
•       our ability to effect our growth strategies, acquisitions or investments
        successfully, including the proposed Forestar merger;
• the effects of the loss of key personnel; and

statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports
on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K should be consulted. Additional information about

for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, including the section entitled
"Risk Factors," which is filed with the SEC.
