      Fitch Affirms SLM Student Loan Trust 2003-7
    





May 22, 2015 12:32 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings affirms the SLM Student Loan Trust series 2003-7 senior 
      notes at 'AAAsf' and the subordinate notes at 'BBBsf'. The Rating 
      Outlook remains Stable for all the notes.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Collateral Quality: The trust collateral consists of 100% of 
      Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans. The credit quality 
      of the trust collateral is high, in Fitch's opinion, based on the 
      guarantees provided by the transaction's eligible guarantors and at 
      least 97% reinsurance of principal and accrued interest provided by the 
      U.S. Department of Education (ED). The current U.S. sovereign rating is 
      'AAA' with a Stable Outlook.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Credit enhancement is provided by excess 
      spread and overcollateralization. Additionally, the class A notes 
      benefit from subordination provided by the class B notes. As of March 
      2015, total parity is 100.00% and senior parity is 105.25% (both 
      percentages are excluding the reserve balance). Cash is being released 
      from the trust since it has reached is release threshold of 100% total 
      parity.
    

      Adequate Liquidity Support: Liquidity support is provided by a reserve 
      account. The reserve is sized equal to the greater of 0.25% of the 
      current pool balance and $3,761,650 floor. The current reserve balance 
      is at its floor.
    

      Acceptable Servicing Capabilities: Navient Solutions is the servicer of 
      this trust. In Fitch's opinion, Navient is an acceptable servicer of 
      FFELP student loans.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Since FFELP student loan ABS rely on the U.S. government to reimburse 
      defaults, 'AAAsf' FFELP ABS ratings will likely move in tandem with the 
      'AAA' U.S. sovereign rating. Aside from the U.S. sovereign rating, 
      defaults and basis risk account for the majority of the risk embedded in 
      FFELP student loan transactions. Additional defaults and basis shock 
      beyond Fitch's published stresses could result in future downgrades. 
      Likewise, a buildup of credit enhancement driven by positive excess 
      spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future 
      upgrades.
    

      Fitch has taken the following rating actions:
    

      SLM Student Loan Trust 2003-7:
    

      --Class A-5A affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-5B affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
