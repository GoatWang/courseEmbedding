William

in 1977 from the University of Notre Dame. He earned in 1982 a Master of
Business Administration from the prestigious Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania.



William
joined Sysco which is traded in the New York Stock Exchange as assistant
Treasurer at the firm’s corporate headquarters in 1987. He earned a promotion
in 1991 becoming the company treasurer. William was appointed a Vice President
in 1993 and held this position until 1994. 



In
1996 he joined Sysco Syracuse as CFO. He moved up the ranks becoming Senior
Vice President in 1998 and Executive Vice President in 2002. William
transferred to Sysco Charlotte as President and CEO in 2004. He went back to
Houston in 2007 and was appointed Executive Vice President and CFO of the
company. William served this role for two years and was then promoted to CEO in
March 2009; he joined the firm’s Board of Directors earlier in January 2009. Since
February 2010, William has also served as Sysco’s President. 



Outside
of Sysco, he has served since September 2011 on the Board of Directors of
Aristotle Holdings and Express Scripts. William also sits on the Board of
Directors of the Center for Houston’s Future which was founded by the Greater
Houston Partnership. 



Sysco
is a global leader in selling, marketing and distributing food products to
restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and
other customers who prepare meals away from home. The firm’s family of products
also includes equipment and supplies for foodservice and hospitality
industries.

distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products
to both independent and chain restaurants customer and other “away-from-home”
locations like healthcare and educational facilities.
