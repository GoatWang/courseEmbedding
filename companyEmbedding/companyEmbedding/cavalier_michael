at CAMFormulas

Vegan Glucosamine-MSM-CMO Joint Support Dietary Supplement Glucosamine is a naturally occuring compound found in the human body, e...specially in the fluid that is around the joints.* The glucosamine used in our product is derived from non-GMO corn rather than shellfish or other animals.

CMO used in our product is derived from plant sources rather than the usual beef tallow*. DEVA Glucosamine is perfect for vegans, vegetarians or people with shellfish allergies who would also like to benefit from glucosamine.* DEVA? Glucosamine-MSM-CMO is 100% vegan, vegetarian and is certified by the Vegan Society, the non-profit organization that actually invented the word "vegan".
