AMENDED AND RESTATED FIDELITY BOND PREMIUM SHARING AGREEMENT 
THIS AGREEMENT made as of December 31, 1995, amended and restated as of October 16, 2006, by and among the investment companies (the “Funds”) and affiliates of Eaton Vance Corp. (“EVC”) listed on the attached Schedule A (the “EV Parties”) (collectively, the “Insureds”). 
WHEREAS, Eaton Vance Management (“EVM”) and Boston Management and Research (“BMR”) act as investment adviser or administrator of the Funds, and may from time to time hereafter act as investment adviser or administrator of other funds; and Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc. (“EVD”) acts as principal underwriter or placement agent for the Funds, and may from time to time hereafter act as principal underwriter or placement agent for other funds. 
WHEREAS, all the parties hereto are named Insureds under an Investment Company Blanket Bond (the “Bond”) issued by one or more insurance companies (the “Insurer”), which may from time to time be amended or replaced. 
WHEREAS, the parties desire to establish (i) the criteria by which the annual premium shall be allocated among the parties, (ii) the basis upon which additional investment companies for which EVM or BMR may hereafter act as investment adviser or administrator and additional affiliates of EVC may from time to time be added as named insureds under the Bond and (iii) the criteria by which losses in excess of the face amount of the Bond shall be allocated among the parties.




NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed as follows:
1. The aggregate portion of the premium to be paid by the Funds and the EV Parties will be determined annually as follows. The minimum amount of coverage required as of December 31 of the preceding year (the “Mandatory Coverage Amount”) shall be calculated for each Fund and any EV Party for which such coverage is required (the “Mandatory Coverage Parties”). In order to prevent an unfair allocation of premium costs to those investment companies that are structured in Hub and Spoke format, it is essential that the Hub defray substantially all of the premium cost with its Spokes paying only nominal amounts of such cost. The amount of excess coverage will be computed by subtracting the aggregate Mandatory Coverage Amount from the face amount of the Bond. 40% of this excess coverage (the “Non-Mandatory Share”) will be deemed attributable to those EV Parties (the “Non-Mandatory Coverage Parties”), if any, that are not Mandatory Coverage
Parties. The remaining 60% of this excess coverage will be deemed attributable to the Mandatory Coverage Parties. 
The amount of the total premium allocated to the Non-Mandatory Coverage Parties will be determined by calculating the percentage of the total Bond coverage that is represented by the Non-Mandatory Share. This percentage will be multiplied by the aggregate amount of the Bond premium to determine the amount of the premium to be allocated to the Non-Mandatory Coverage parties. This amount may be allocated among the Non-Mandatory Coverage Parties as mutually agreed by them.

2. If the Insurer is willing without additional premium to add as an Insured under the Bond any investment company for which EVM or BMR hereafter is investment adviser or administrator or any affiliate of EVC not listed on Schedule A which qualifies as an insurable party pursuant to Rule 17g-1(b)(3) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the parties
 

hereto agree (a) that such addition may be made, (b) that such investment company may become a party to this Agreement and be included within the term “Funds”, and (c) that such affiliate may become a party to this Agreement and be included within the term “EV Parties”; provided that notice of such addition is given each Fund not less than ten (10) days before such addition becomes effective and further provided that in each case such investment company or affiliate shall have executed and delivered to the parties to this Agreement its written agreement to become a party hereto and to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Any Fund objecting to any such addition may withdraw from this Agreement and coverage under the Bond by written notice to all parties insured under the Bond not less than ten (10) days before the withdrawal. The withdrawing Fund shall be entitled to receive and EVM shall pay to the withdrawing Fund an amount equal to the
portion of the share of the premium on the Bond borne by the withdrawing Fund which is proportional to the unexpired term of the Bond for which a premium has been paid. 
3. In the event that the claims of loss of two or more Insureds under the Bond are so related that the Insurer is entitled to assert that the claims must be aggregated with the result that the total amount payable on such claims is limited to the face amount of the Bond, the following rules for determining, as among the claimants, the priority of satisfaction of the claims under the Bond shall apply:



A.      
All claims of the Funds and of any qualified profit sharing and/or retirement plan of Eaton Vance Management or subsidiaries of EVC (the “Plans”) which have been duly proved and established under the Bond shall be satisfied in full before satisfaction of any claims of any other parties. However, a Fund (a “Spoke”) which invests substantially all of its assets in another Fund (a “Hub”) is not entitled to recover on the Spoke’s claim to the extent that the Spoke’s actual covered loss is reduced by the satisfaction of the Hub’s claim. 

 

B.      
If the claims of the Funds and Plans which have been duly proved and established exceed the face amount of the Bond, the insurance shall be applied to those claims in the following manner: 

 

 
(i)      
First, the insurance shall be applied to the claim of each Fund and Plan up to its respective minimum fidelity bond requirement for the year in which the claim arose as determined pursuant to Rule 17g-1(d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 with respect to the Funds and pursuant to Section 412 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and any applicable regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the Plans; and 

 

 
(ii)      
The remaining amount of insurance then shall be applied to the unsatisfied claims of the Funds and Plans in proportion to the amounts of such unsatisfied claims. 

 

C.      
If after giving effect to Paragraph A there remains a portion of the insurance under the Bond available for the satisfaction of claims of parties other than the Funds and Plans which have been duly proved and established under the Bond, such remainder shall be applied as EVM shall determine. 

 
 

4. All parties hereto agree that any obligation assumed by a business or common law trust shall be limited to the assets of the trust, and the trustees, shareholders and agents of the trust shall not be liable thereon.
5. This Amended and Restated Fidelity Bond Premium Sharing Agreement shall become effective as of October 16, 2006.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have hereunto caused this Agreement to be executed by their officers, General Partners, Directors or Trustees hereunto duly authorized all as of the day and year first above written.
