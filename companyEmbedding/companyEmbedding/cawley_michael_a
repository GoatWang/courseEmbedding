Biography




	Michael Cawley concentrates his practice in the areas of insurance coverage, bad faith disputes, commercial litigation and professional liability matters. He has extensive trial and appellate experience in state, federal and bankruptcy court. Mr. Cawley’s experience includes the representation of insurers and insureds in all forms of insurance coverage disputes and the litigation and trial of complex professional liability cases. He is a member of the firm’s class action defense practice.

	Mr. Cawley is an experienced litigator and a Partner in the Philadelphia office of Gordon & Rees. He has had over 30 years of litigation experience in state and federal courts across the United States. He has handled product liability litigation involving such diverse products as handguns; disposable lighters, diving boards; pesticides; dairy equipment and medical devices. In addition to product liability claims, he has defended educational institutions against claims involving sexual molestation by school personnel to personal injury claims arising out of school sponsored athletic events. He has worked to defend physicians in brain damaged baby cases and has represented Emergency Room physicians against claims alleging medical malpractice. In addition, he has extensive insurance coverage and professional liability experience as well as being trained in Legal Project Management which employs strategies to assess, plan, manage and control legal work in collaboration with clients throughout the life of a case. Mr. Cawley is AV rated by Martindale Hubbel and is a Fellow of the American Bar Association.

	More recently, he has complemented the above practice areas by developing proficiency in litigation involving intellectual property, e-commerce and other technology-based claims and in drafting, reviewing and negotiating commercial agreements related to those industries including distribution agreements. Mr. Cawley has counseled and litigated consumer credit matters for lenders, including issues arising under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and has addressed other compliance issues dealing with federal and state laws governing consumer credit.  

Insurance Coverage / Reinsurance Disputes
	Mr. Cawley has provided insurance coverage advice to his insurer and policyholder clients on issues arising under multiple types of policies, including general liability, professional liability, directors and officers, property, and excess/umbrella liability policies. He is also experienced in reinsurance agreements and ERISA/non-ERISA issues involving life, health and disability matters.

	Mr. Cawley’s practice concentrates on the representation of insurers and insureds in coverage matters and related bad faith claims in state and federal courts. He has a comprehensive understanding of insurance industry underwriting and claims department practices as well as the relationship insureds have with their retail insurance brokers and the expectations each has with respect to the intent behind an insurance policy. This experience has enabled him to work closely with insurers and their insureds in developing strategies to resolve cases with excess liability potential through the use of hi-lo arbitrations, binding arbitration and other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.

	With respect to insurance coverage litigation, Mr. Cawley is keenly aware of the need to skillfully represent a client’s insurance coverage position since the consequences of coverage litigation are of critical importance to insurer and insured alike. Mr. Cawley has numerous reported decisions in both state and federal court regarding critical insurance coverage issues, including the landmark 2006 Pennsylvania Supreme Court opinion in Kvaerner Metals Div. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co. Mr. Cawley’s reported decisions in the insurance coverage field establish the depth of his knowledge of the insurance industry and the principles governing it.

Insurance Broker Liability
	As a complement to his insurance coverage practice, Mr. Cawley has extensive litigation and trial experience in representing some of the largest retail and wholesale insurance brokers and agents in litigation across the United States. He is routinely asked to counsel insurance agents and brokers in how to avoid error and omission litigation and to represent insurance agents and brokers before insurance departments. His combined knowledge of the insurance industry and the insurance brokerage business has resulted in brokers retaining him to represent their interests in matters ranging from claims that a broker engaged in price fixing to the procurement and placement of risks with carriers that later became insolvent.

	Mr. Cawley is an instructor with the Philadelphia Insurance Society where he offers a three-credit course on Insurance Broker Liability, which has been qualified for continuing legal education credits by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.

Product Liability
	During the 25 years Mr. Cawley has been practicing law, he has litigated cases involving both large and small medical device manufacturers. He also was involved in the defense of the manufacturer of the anti-obesity drug fen-phen. He has defended the interests of manufacturers of implanted spinal devices and manufacturers of food products charged with selling contaminated food products as well as successfully pursuing actions against third parties responsible for contaminating food products. Mr. Cawley’s experience as defense counsel for product manufacturers includes representing the manufacturers and distributors of a variety of products, including lighters, swimming pool products, space heaters and others.

Lawyers' Liability
	In defending attorneys charged with legal malpractice, Mr. Cawley is acutely aware of the significance of such claims. The defense of malpractice claims requires experience, integrity and judgment. In that regard, Mr. Cawley has represented lawyers in a variety of cases from the defense of an attorney charged with failing to file civil actions to the defense of a lawyer charged with multiple violations of state and federal laws while representing a major university. Mr. Cawley was a contributor to the American Bar Association’s 50-state survey entitled The Law of Lawyers Liability published in June 2012.

Employment
	Mr. Cawley has more than 15 years of experience representing employers in a variety of employment and labor issues. He has litigated before the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission as well as in the federal and state courts in matters ranging from sex discrimination brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; wrongful termination, age discrimination and hostile work environment claims brought pursuant to the common law; and violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

	In addition, Mr. Cawley has counseled employers in labor matters, including the preparation of a company’s policy prohibiting racial or sexual misconduct and the publication of such policy to employees. He has assisted in investigations into allegations of sexual harassment and/or racial discrimination made by employees against coworkers and/or an employer as well as situations involving employees, who while in the workplace have exhibited signs that they may be either a danger to themselves and/or to co-workers.

Directors & Officers Liability
	Mr. Cawley has litigation and trial experience in the representation of directors and officers in disputes involving the alleged violations of securities laws; derivative suits wherein shareholders allege that the directors and officers failed to properly manage a company and in so doing lost the ability to acquire other companies that would have assisted the company in meeting its strategic goals; and claims that the directors and officers routinely misrepresented the financial condition of the company.

	Mr. Cawley has defended the interests of directors and officers on the board of a regional waste management corporation that was confronted with claims of mismanagement, as well as an officer of an insurance subsidiary of a major financial institution in a binding American Arbitration Association proceeding.

	In addition to litigating director and officer cases, Mr. Cawley remains current on the law regarding corporate governance. Additionally, he is knowledgeable regarding insurance coverage issues under director and officer policies and how the protections of those policies will become increasingly relevant in light of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act.

Darigold, Inc. v. Dairy Solutions International, LLC et al., District Court of the Fourth Judicial District of the state of Idaho, Ada County, Case No.: CV OC 1007861.  On behalf of his client Darigold, Michael Cawley obtained a $10.6 million judgment on March 6, 2015 against Dairy Solutions International, LLC (“DSI”) in a contentious product recall litigation pursued in Idaho state court and which involved extensive discovery conducted in Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom.  Darigold pursued DSI for its liability arising out of the contamination of 23,000,000 pounds of butter processed through butter making equipment which DSI remanufactured and sold to Darigold. The damages sustained by Darigold included not only the actual losses sustained as a result of the contamination of the butter, but the costs associated with physically recalling the butter from Japan and the business interruption losses sustained by Darigold as a result of the contamination events.   

Alea London and Atrium Underwriters v. PA Child Care et al. (USDC) (MD of PA) Case No.: 3:09-cv-02256 and Alea London et al. v. Pa Child Care LLC Case No.: 12-2132 (3d Cir.).  In the now notorious “Kids for Cash” scandal which involved a scheme whereby the owner of a privately owned youth detention center in Northeastern Pennsylvania, PA Child Care LLC (“PACC”), bribed two prominent Luzerne County judges in exchange for the judges’ agreement to illegally incarcerate youths at PACC, Michael Cawley obtained summary judgment on behalf of  the insurers of PACC, Alea and Atrium.  The federal district court ruled that neither Alea or Atrium had any obligation to defend or indemnify PACC against a $100 million class action brought by youths who were illegally detained at PACC by the corrupt judges.  The Third Circuit affirmed the award of summary judgment agreeing with the trial court that the payment of bribes by PACC constituted a violation of a penal statute and, as such, the criminal conduct engaged in by PACC was specifically precluded from coverage under the Alea and Atrium personal injury coverages.

Save Our Local Environment (“SOLE”) v. Grand Central Sanitary Landfill (“GCSL”) et. al. (Northampton County, Pennsylvania). CCP, Northampton County No. 1995-c-78; Judgment for Defendant Grand Central Sanitary Landfill December 14, 1998. Mr. Cawley tried to verdict the first SLAPP (“Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation”) lawsuit in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The case involved charges that the client, a landfill operator and its successor company, wrongfully used civil proceedings against a citizens’ group in an effort to intimidate and deter the members of the group from exercising their First Amendment Right to protest a proposed expansion of the GCSL landfill. Prior to the trial, SOLE made a demand of $14 million from GCSL and the other defendants named in the litigation. After a seven-week trial in the Northampton County Court of Common Pleas, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants.

Reliance Insurance Company in Liquidation v. Mellon-Clair Odell and Mellon Insurance Services AAA# 14 195 Y 0014406. In this American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) matter, Mr. Cawley represented Mellon Insurance Services (“Mellon”) against claims brought by the Liquidator for Reliance Insurance Company (“Liquidator”) that Mellon had made material misrepresentations regarding a risk which owned and operated over 170 nursing homes in Texas. The Liquidator claimed that as a result of the alleged material misrepresentations made by Mellon, Reliance was (1) induced to underwrite hundreds of millions of dollars in excess coverage on the nursing home account and (2) that Reliance had to pay $7,600,000 under the policies to claimants who claimed to have been mistreated at the nursing home facilities. After hearings which spanned a two month period, the AAA panel found in favor of Mellon and dismissed the Liquidator’s claims.

Kvaerner Metals Division of Kvaerner U.S., Inc. et. al v. National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, PA. 589 Pa. 317; 908 A.2d 888; 2006 Pa. LEXIS 2064. In this 2006 landmark ruling, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the failure of an insured’s work product to meet the specifications required in a design-build contract for the construction of a coke oven battery does not meet the definition of “occurrence” since the failure to meet such contract specifications is not an “accident.”

Duff Supply Co., et. al. v. Crum & Forster Insurance Company 1997 WL 255483 (E.D. Pa.). In the representation of the policyholder, Mr. Cawley prevailed in establishing that Crum & Forster had an obligation to defend its insured-Duff Supply Co.-against allegations asserted in an underlying action that the insured engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment and gender based discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The federal district court agreed that the underlying action alleged a covered personal injury (i.e. defamation) and ordered that Crum & Forster was obligated to reimburse its insured all of the legal fees and expenses incurred in the defense of the underlying litigation.

Atlantic Mutual Ins. Corp. v. Brotech Corp. v. Lexington Ins. Co. 60 F.3d 813 (3d Cir. 1995), Third Circuit affirmed Trial Court's holding that “advertising activity” did not include the infringement of patents by Lexington's insured, Brotech.

Diamond International Corporation and National Union Fire Insurance Company v. Sulzer Brothers, Inc. and CNA Insurance Companies, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9820. In this action, Mr, Cawley represented the interests of Diamond International Company (“Diamond”). At issue was the interpretation of an indemnity agreement contained within an Asset Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) executed between Diamond and Sulzer Bros. (“Sulzer”) and whether that agreement required Sulzer to defend and indemnify Diamond against contingent liability claims. The federal district court concluded that Sulzer had the obligation to defend Diamond against all future claims arising out of the product line transferred under the Agreement and held that the phrase “including, but not limited to” constituted a broadly worded indemnity promise running from Sulzer to Diamond.

Assicuriazioni S.P.A. v. Public Service Mutual Ins. Co., 77 F.3d. 731 (3d 1996). Mr. Cawley represented Public Service Mutual Ins. Co. (“PSM”) which issued a comprehensive general liability policy to an insured which had insured its truckers liability risk through a Business Auto policy issued by Assicuriazioni S.P.A. He successfully argued before the Third Circuit that the district court’s holding that PSM had concurrent obligations with Assicuriazioni S.P.A. to cover the injuries sustained by a third-party catastrophically injured during the delivery of furniture from a retail store be reversed.

Weinstein Supply Co. v. Home Insurance Co. 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6661 (E.D of PA. 97-7195). Judge Clifford Scott Green granted Home's Motion for summary judgment on basis that a comprehensive general liability policy did not cover employment related practices claims against Weinstein Supply Co. since such claims did not allege an accident and were therefore not “occurrences”.

Reading Anthracite Coal Co. v. National Union Fire Insurance Co. 547 Pa. 756; 692 A.2d 566 (PA 1997). The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed the Schuylkill County trial court's award of summary judgment to National Union holding that a $1.8 million dollar business interruption claim of Reading Anthracite Company (RAC) was not covered under a first party property policy issued by National Union to RAC. The bad faith claim was subsequently dismissed on summary judgment as well in 2000 by the trial court.

Bonnie Bannon v. Property and Casualty Insurance Company of Hartford CCP, Philadelphia County, December Term 2008; No. 1019. The Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas Court granted Hartford’s Motion to Dismiss a bad faith claim as unsupported by the pleadings.

Lexington & Concord Abstract Co. v. The Hartford (E.D of PA #2:07-cv-03398-AB). After a Rule 16 Conference, the Plaintiff agreed to dismiss with prejudice all statutory bad faith and Unfair Insurance Practices Act claims which alleged that Hartford had improperly denied coverage for claims in an underlying action seeking return of real estate commissions and a return of escrow funds.

Phelps School v. Transportation Ins. 844 A.2d. 1296; 2003 Pa. Super. LEXIS 5694 (November 17, 2003). Holding that the exclusionary language in the Transportation Insurance Co. (CNA) policy issued to The Phelps School (“Phelps”) prohibiting coverage for sporting events “sponsored” by the school precluded coverage to Phelps for personal injuries sustained by a 14-year-old female rendered a paraplegic in a school-sponsored wrestling match with a 14-year-old male.
