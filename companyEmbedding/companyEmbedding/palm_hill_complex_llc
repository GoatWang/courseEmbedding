Our 65,000 sq. ft. facility is located in West Palm Beach, Florida within a short distance of Palm Beach International Airport. FME designs and manufactures low volume/high mix to medium and high volume products for the automotive, telecom, industrial, medical and high reliability military and aerospace markets. A combination of our ever expanding technical capabilities, years of practical application experience and a wide range of internal services that other manufacturers do not offer will give you the crucial advantage of getting your product to market faster, with the best quality and at the lowest total cost of ownership. Please explore the rest of our web site to find out how we can help you; or contact FME today to request more information about our company and the products and services we provide.


Our history dates back to the late 1970’s when this facility was part of a large, multi-national company that specialized in the telecommunications market. For years, this facility manufactured printed circuit boards, hybrid microcircuits, backplanes, electromechanical enclosures and injection molded connector shrouds; all in support of the company’s telecom business. When this facility was sold to another company in 1991, we began to support other market segments while continuing to manufacture products for the telecom industry.
In 2005, a small group of employees purchased the assets in this facility and started FME. Since then, FME has significantly grown our technical capabilities, resources, customer base, product mix, and facility space. Today, we design and manufacture products for the automotive, telecom, industrial, medical and high reliability military and aerospace markets. Our quality system is registered to ISO9001 for commercial products, TS16949 for automotive products and ISO13485 for medical products. We maintain ITAR registration and employees are certified to the IPC-A-610 acceptability standard.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
