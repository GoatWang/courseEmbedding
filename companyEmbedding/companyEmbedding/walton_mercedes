She advanced the company’s technology and proprietary IP as an inventor and guided development of products, services and brands based on the company’s IP. Using the company’s IP as a foundation, Mercedes directed commercialization of the company’s products and services throughout the world with new and existing strategic business partners. Mercedes’ leadership expanded the company’s global market presence.See moreSee lessMercedes would be an outstanding board member for a public or private board based on her seasoned judgment, strategic outlook and passionate comitment. I have worked with Mercedes over the course of several years as a Board Member of Norstan and as CEO of Cryo-Cell and found her to be a top-flight leader.  She balances pragmatism with vision, a rare combination in board members and CEO's today.  Her experience is vast, having successfully  led through a variety of complex governance challenges, including prioritizing among high growth investment options,  financial and operational restructurings, difficult shareholder factions, litigation and others. As important, she has always thrown great passion and energy at everything she has been involved in; she is the ultimate team player.

Walton sagen:I worked with Mercedes Walton by serving as outside intellectual property (IP) counsel to a Florida-based stem cell company. In her leadership role as the company’s CEO, Mercedes excelled as a visionary and innovator for the company. She advanced the company’s technology and proprietary IP as an inventor and guided development of products, services and brands based on the company’s IP. Using the company’s IP as a foundation, Mercedes directed commercialization of the company’s products and services throughout the world with new and existing strategic business partners. Mercedes’ leadership expanded the company’s global market presence.Mehr anzeigenWeniger anzeigenMercedes would be an outstanding board member for a public or private board based on her seasoned judgment, strategic outlook and passionate comitment. I have worked with Mercedes over the course of several years as a Board Member of Norstan and as CEO of Cryo-Cell and found her to be a top-flight leader.  She balances pragmatism with vision, a rare combination in board members and CEO's today.  Her experience is vast, having successfully  led through a variety of complex governance challenges, including prioritizing among high growth investment options,  financial and operational restructurings, difficult shareholder factions, litigation and others. As important, she has always thrown great passion and energy at everything she has been involved in; she is the ultimate team player.

They had exactly what I wanted in a NEW car, with the features I want but needed to see if we could come together on a price. The first sales men we worked with seemed clueless and were rude as well as unprofessional. Now when I say that I am not sure if he was just so new that he was so naive enough to tell us what the management said to him. I can give you an example, "we have what you want, now that we know what you want if you go to another dealer, we will not work with that dealer by sending this car there, so you either buy it from us and do not buy one". To say the least we felt trapped, we called every dealership in a 200 mile radius to try and find the car we wanted. No one had it, guess we either suck up our pride or look at something else. I am extremely picky, so we sucked up the pride. So we make an appointment to pick up the car, car was not ready, nothing was done, wasn't even washed. Not putting his name here because well you can probably pick him out of a line up very easily. Showed up and decided we no longer wanted to work with the first salesmen. We can suck up our pride but doesn't mean we want to talk to him again. This time Todd Siegrist came to our help. THANK GOD. Todd Siegrist was awesome, by the time we were complete with all the paperwork, car was fixed and ready to go, he showed us what the car could do, all the new updated equipment etc. I would have brought him and his family home for dinner. Great salesmen, good sense of humor, patient, did not try and sell us anything more than the car, very laid back and relaxed. Todd made us happy we came back, happy we did add the extra items, happy we asked for a different salesman, happy enough to come back and recommend Todd to friends and family with NO reservations.  He even connected my phone to the new car, showed me how to use my music with the car. Would happily spend my money with him again when we need a car. To Gary Smith Honda -  Todd saved the company's image in our eyes. He should get full credit for the sale, for the small amount of time we spent with the other salesmen, he should have only gotten a hourly wage and no commission. He almost lost the sale and caused us to tell everyone how bad it was with him and Gary Smith. Todd Siegrist needs a raise, salesmen of the month, or any type of pat on the pack you provide to motivate your salesmen. I LOVE MY CAR, I love the color, the style the leather everything....... Proud owner of 2013 Honda Accord V6  EX-L  Buy your next car with Todd Siegrist at Gary Smith Honda.Sonshine Motorspjelpoeta ratedI believe in honest feedback and review. I bought a vehicle from Sonshine Motors (a Jetta) about a month ago. Firstly, customer service is very good because they are trying to get you into a reliable car with reliable payments without credit.  Secondly, the cars are average to very good. We fell in love with our car the moment they let us test drive it.  However, what made me give them this perfect review is the honesty.  Our vehicle had a slight mechanical failure on the transmission, that was actually a factory defect according to the shop, but was simply past it's warranty.  Russ was a gentleman by covering for the repair costs, even though what you buy is &quot;as is&quot;, just because we had just bought the car.  This does not mean that their vehicles are bad because they have great vehicles, but is not their fault if one or two have faults because they are used vehicles and it can happen anywhere. I would recommend this business to others.  If you have less than perfect credit and need a reliable car from people who keep their word, go see for yourself. Also, they constanlty updated their inventory so if you don't see something you like, come back another day. Hampton Hyundaimax.hertweck ratedHyundai serviceI'm writing this review because I saw some negative reviews for Hampton Hyundau. This year I took my Genesus to Hampton. I was a new resident in the area and had apprehension about the visit due to reviews I had read.Upon arrival, I met a service advisor Rachel, who was the most friendly, accommodating representative I have met in my dealings with auto dealerships. She went out of her way to insure my problem was resolved, arranged for a car rental and followed up to be certain the problem was taken care of. I really appreciated the attention I was given. I'm now happy that I live in the gulf coast area so that I can have a service department I can depend on. Thank you, Rachel. Sonshine Motorsjjess423 ratedGood service and people Just wanted to leave a review in response to some of the bad ones. I know everyone has good and bad experiences but I bought my car a few days ago, on my way home the car started acting funny, I called the dealership the next day, they came and towed it, fixed the alternator and brakes and didn't charge me a dime. These people are honest and if you call or go to the office with a genuine concern and a good attitude they will help you. I didn't have a warranty and I'm on such a fixed budget I was so woried about the repairs as a single mom I just don't have extra money. Overall a real good experience from the sales man and manager. Sonshine MotorsJames P. ratedI am the first person to read reviews about a business before I do business with them, I read mixed reviews about Sonshine Motors some good, some bad, some horrible. most of the bad ones seemed to come from people who obviously didn't pay their bills on time. Since I couldn't get financed anywhere else due to my bad credit I came to them, I just want to say thank you for the awesome service, and helping me find a vehicle with payments that I can afford. my car is still running great 4 months after ive had it with no issues. thanks again guysGary Smith HondaNancy D. ratedFrank Devoid, and I went to Gary Smith Honda today and had a wonderful experience. We drove home with a new Pilot. I have to say is this was a smooth enjoyable purchase. What a wonderful anniversary gift and Gary Smith Honda made it all possible. Thank you to all these great folks involved at Gary Smith for making this all happen..  I highly recommend this dealership.  If you wnat to have a relaxing, stress free experience.Sonshine Motorscalliejon228 ratedI would recomend this dealership to anyone with bad credit looking for a vehicle i got into a 05 saturn for only 800 down they didnt check my credit and gave me pretty fair payments. overall its a decent dealership, atleast in fort walton. ive been to a couple of dealerships in the area and this was the one with the cheapes down paymentSonshine Motorscodddycarv21 ratedI WOULD also recommend this business. I purchased a car back in November and had some issues with the vehicle, they put me in another car with NO MORE MONEY DOWN from me. That really impressed me that they tried real hard to make me feel valued. Sonshine Motorscehamm ratedreceived excellent serviceCalled inquiring about cars available with my down payment and budget. Was given options and when I came in they were exactly as described.  Was given quick friendly service the whole time. Will definitely recommend and use again in the future. Sonshine Motorssheshejames ratedThese people have been fabulous to me......just bought my car today, so far very pleased with service, staff, and the car. they didnt have just a lot of cars to choose from but what I got was a good deal. they have my recommendation.

On a recent trip down to the beaches our Mercedes SLK had issues with miss firing cylinders. Brought the car into ZT and Marty Depue took great care in insuring that the issue was a minor glitch in the software. I have the utmost appreciation for the staff and service I received while there.
