 LLC Vs. C Corp Vs. S Corp Tax Advantages for Real Estate | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  LLC Vs. C Corp Vs. S Corp Tax Advantages for Real Estate  by Terry Lane        Tax treatment of real estate varies based on how long the property is owned, which sometimes gives advantages to LLCs and S-corps. Creatas/Creatas/Getty Images   Related Articles  1 [Corporation Buy Residential Property] | Can an S Corporation Buy Residential Property? 2 [Using LLCs] | The Advantages of Using LLCs for Rental Properties 3 [Corporation Passive Income Restrictions] | S Corporation Passive Income Restrictions 4 [Holding Real Property] | The Advantages and Disadvantages of Having an LLC and Holding Real Property    By incorporating, a small business can gain more protection from lawsuits or possibly lower its taxes, while choosing among different structures that can help with the management and organization of the company. In general, a real estate investor is treated as a sole proprietorship, in which all the profits from property investments can be taxed as income. For real estate investors, incorporating can protect an individual's credit rating if a property is foreclosed upon, suffers investment losses or is the subject of a lawsuit. Rental-property ownership carries some legal risks, including environmental contamination, fire protection and slip-and-fall liabilities.        Capital Gains vs. Ordinary Income Real estate investments are taxed differently depending upon how long the owner holds the property. If held longer than one year, the investor pays a "capital gains" tax on the profits. If held less than one year, the profits are treated as "ordinary income," requiring the investor to pay income tax and self-employment taxes, which are significantly higher than capital gains taxes. In some cases, investors can avoid these taxes through incorporation, but with that comes other obligations and requirements that could reduce the value of the tax savings. Limited Liability Companies A limited liability company, LLC, requires the least amount of paperwork and lowest fees to register and is well-suited for small businesses, especially single-owner ventures like real estate investments. With an LLC, the small business to continue to file taxes as though it were a sole-proprietorship or partnership while gaining some legal protections that unincorporated businesses don't have. However, the members of an LLC have to pay taxes on all profits as though it were income, which could expose the owners to high employment taxes. S-Corps and Flipping Successful small businesses will often choose a corporate tax structure to shield it from some taxes, with the S corporation and C corporation being the most common. In an S-corp, shareholders who work for the company can be paid a salary from the company and distribute all profits between shareholders as a dividend, which would be taxed as a capital gain and not be subject to employment taxes. The S-corp structure helps investors that "flip" properties by holding them less than one year. By filing as an S-corp, the investor could pay himself a fair salary, which is subject to income tax, and distribute the rest of the corporate profits as dividends that are taxed as a capital gain. Also, an LLC can elect to be taxed like an S-corp. C-Corps and Double Taxation Shareholders in a C-corp face potential double-taxation, as the corporation has to pay taxes on its profits, which are taxed again when shareholders receive distributions of these profits and have to report them as income. Because of this, real estate investors often choose to be taxed like an LLC or S-corp. However, the Bigger Pockets real estate blog cautions that while there are some taxes to be saved with an S-corp, it also comes with more IRS scrutiny and can make an audit more likely. Also, it can be easier for a C-corp to qualify for bank financing, because the individual's credit history isn't reviewed, like it would be with an S-corp.
