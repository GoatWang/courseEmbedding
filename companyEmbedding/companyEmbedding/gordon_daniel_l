Klein-Gordon inner product

Studying the scalar field and Klein-Gordon equation in quantum field theory I came across this definition for the inner product in the space of the solutions of the K.G. equation:
$$\langle \Phi_1 | \Phi_2 \rangle = i\int \mathrm{d}\vec{x}(\Phi_1 ^* \overleftrightarrow{\partial_0}\Phi_2) = i\int \mathrm{d}\vec{x} (\Phi_1 ^* \partial_0\Phi_2 -  \Phi_2 \partial_0\Phi_1^*)  $$
I see that this definition should be invariant under Poincaré transformations, but I couldn't prove it. Do you know some references about this?
Moreover I couldn't find the reason why such a scalar product is introduced. Aren't there other possible scalar products? Why choose this one?

Something to think about: consider the current $J_\mu = i\Phi_1^* \partial_\mu \Phi_2 - i\Phi_2 \partial_\mu \Phi_1^*$ and maybe set $\mu = 0$... What can you say about $J_\mu$?

The Klein-Gordon inner product is a natural construction for functions defined on the mass hyperboloid $k^2=m^2$, because if you write your function in momentum space,
$$
\phi(x)\sim \int\widetilde{\mathrm dk}\ \mathrm e^{-ikx}a(k)+\text{h.c.}
$$
with $\widetilde{\mathrm dk}$ the measure on $k^2=m^2$, then the Fourier coefficients become (ref. 1, sec 3-1-2)
$$
a(k)=\langle\phi,\exp_k\rangle
$$
where $\exp_k(x)\equiv\mathrm e^{-ikx}$.
The philosophy is the same as in the standard Fourier transform (or other integral transforms, i.e., changes of basis), where you can recover the function in momentum space by a suitable scalar product with the exponential function (or whichever basis you use in your space of functions). In general, the form of the inner product is dictated by the form of the integral transform.
One should point out that, even if $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ is a natural construction, the real reason we define this particular integral is that it appears in the proof of the LSZ formula for scalars (ref. 1, sec 5-1-4).

Klein Gordon inner product








up vote

Define the Klein Gordon inner product as
$$(\psi_1,\psi_2)_{KG} = i\int d^3x \, \psi_1^*\,\partial{t}\,(\psi_2) - \partial{t}\,(\psi_1^*)\,\psi_2 \, .$$
It can be shown that for the one particle wavefunctions \begin{align}
\psi_1(t,\vec{x}) &= \exp(-iE_{p_1}t + i\vec{p_1}\cdot\vec{x}) \\ \text{and} \quad \psi_2(t,\vec{x})&=\exp(-iE_{p_2}t + i\vec{p_2}\cdot\vec{x})
\end{align}
that
$$(\psi_1^*,\psi_2)_{KG} = 0 \, .$$
By superposition, I would expect this to imply that for any $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$,
$(\psi_1^*,\psi_2)_{KG} = 0$.
However, I am sure that this cannot be the case, since with this you could show that the Klein-Gordon inner product for any two functions would be zero, i.e.
$$(\psi_1,\psi_2)_{KG} = 0$$
for all $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$, since I could just pick $\psi_1$ to be the complex conjugate of some other function. Does anyone see a quick resolution to this?

The correct inner product is proportional to a Dirac delta, viz. $\left( \psi_1,\,\psi_2 \right)_{KG}=\left( 2\pi\right)^3 2E_{p_1}\delta^3\left( \mathbf{p}_1 - \mathbf{p}_2\right)$.
You have only considered positive-energy wavefunctions; you may wish to look at what happens when one or both are negative-energy instead, since the most general solution of the KG equation superposes both energy sectors. You should find for example that $\left( \psi^\ast,\,\psi^\ast \right)_{KG}=-\left( \psi,\,\psi \right)_{KG}$ for any solution $\psi$.

I see now that the single particle wavefunctions which I have provided are only basis functions for the positive energy sector.  If I conjugate a function from the positive energy sector, I get a function in the negative energy sector.  Intuitively it makes sense that the "overlap" of a function in negative energy sector with a function in the positive energy sector is zero, which is exactly what is being calculate in the fourth expression.  Thanks for the input.

Meeting Description
The 2014 Gordon Research Conference on Marine Natural Products will highlight progressive research on the chemistry and biology of natural product chemicals from the marine environment. Featured topics will include advances in molecular characterization, biomedical applications, biotechnology, genomics, chemical ecology, molecular pharmacology, and chemical biology to reflect the ever-evolving breadth of this dynamic field. The conference will feature outstanding investigators from academia, industry and the government, and will provide opportunities for junior scientists and graduate students to present their work in poster format. Some poster presenters will be selected for short talks. One of the hallmarks of this biennial conference is its friendly and collegial atmosphere that facilitates the exchange of ideas with leaders in the field that often lead to cross-disciplinary collaborations. We look forward to your participation.

This GRC was held in conjunction with the "Marine Natural Products" Gordon Research Seminar (GRS). Refer to the associated GRS program page for more information.

Daniel Gordon approaches photography with the 
sensibilities and concerns of an object maker, and the relationship 
between sculptural and photographic forms is a major force at play in 
his work. He calls our attention to the surface of the paper, 
emphatically challenging the notion of a photograph as a window into the
 world. The imperfections visible in his constructions are the 
antithesis of the glossy perfection of so much photography today. 
Instead he shares an affinity with painters or sculptors - those that 
spend time making things in the studio.Text extract by Eva Respini Associate Curator Museum of Modern ArtCHOSEN BEST PHOTOBOOK OF 2013NY TIMES BLOGGUARDIAN
