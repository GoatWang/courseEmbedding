June 03, 2013
Wiley Names John Kritzmacher as Chief Financial Officer
Hoboken, N.J.


John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (NYSE: JWa and JWb), a global provider of knowledge and knowledge-based services in the areas of research, professional development, and education, today named John Kritzmacher, former CFO of Lucent Technologies and Global Crossing, as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective July 1, 2013. Mr. Kritzmacher will be responsible for all of Wiley's global finance functions and activities, business development, mergers and acquisitions, and investor relations. As previously announced, Ellis Cousens, Wiley's current CFO and Chief Operations Officer, will retire at the end of fiscal year 2014. Until his planned retirement he will retain responsibility for certain global operations and oversee the company’s $80 million restructuring program. In his prior CFO positions, Mr. Kritzmacher, 52, played an integral role in Lucent's restructuring and 2006 merger with Alcatel, as well as Global Crossing's turnaround and $3 billion sale to Level 3. Following the Alcatel-Lucent merger, he was named Chief Operating Officer of the $5 billion Alcatel-Lucent services division, before joining Global Crossing as Chief Financial Officer. Prior to the Alcatel-Lucent merger, he spent over twenty years in various operating, marketing, and finance roles with AT&T and Lucent, including Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller of Lucent from 2001 to 2006. He recently served as Senior Vice President, Business Operations and Organization Planning, at WebMD. "John has an extraordinary track record of accomplishment and leadership in the areas of mergers and acquisitions, capital and strategic management, accounting and financial controls, restructuring, turnarounds, operations management, and investor relations," said Steve Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer. "He also has valuable experience leading strategy and operations at companies that have delivered technology-enabled growth through a period of business disruption. All of this plus his broad global exposure and consistent record of success make him the perfect fit for Wiley."Mr. Smith continued: "We are grateful for the profound impact Ellis Cousens has had on the company during his twelve years as head of finance and operations. He helped us grow to become a $2.3 billion global knowledge and services company, playing an integral part in our $1 billion acquisition of Blackwell Publishing in 2007, our transition to digital content and services, and more recently, the initiation of the largest restructuring in our history. He will turn his attention to leading Wiley's restructuring and reinvestment program until his retirement at the end of fiscal 2014." Mr. Kritzmacher holds a BA in Mathematics and Economics from Dartmouth College and an MBA in Accounting from New York University. He currently sits on the Board of Directors of InterDigital, a wireless technology company, and also served on the board of Duff & Phelps, a financial advisory and investment banking firm, until its recent acquisition by a private equity consortium.

July 24, 2017Tai Chi May Help Prevent Falls in Older and At-Risk Adults
An analysis of published studies indicates that tai chi may help reduce the number of falls in both the older adult population and at-risk adults. The findings, which are published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, offer a simple and holistic way to prevent injuries.Tai chi is an ancient Chinese practice focused on flexibility and whole body coordination that promotes harmonized motion in space. Previous research has shown that tai chi is an effective exercise to improve...


July 24, 2017Weight in Adolescence May Affect Colorectal Cancer Risk
A new study has uncovered a link between being overweight or obese in adolescence and an increased risk of developing colon cancer in adulthood. Obesity was also associated with an elevated risk of developing rectal cancer. Published early online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society, the findings come at a time of growing concern about the impact of adolescent overweight and obesity on chronic disease later in life.Study results on a potential link between...


July 21, 2017Name that Scotch: Colorimetric recognition of aldehydes and ketones
Vodka tastes different from brandy, and connoisseurs can distinguish among different brands of whiskeys. The flavors of spirits result from a complex bouquet of volatile compounds. New colorimetric sensor arrays on disposable test-strips read by hand-held devices allow for their rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive identification by their chemical “fingerprints”. They are based on novel sensor arrays that detect and differentiate among a diverse range of aldehydes and ketones, as...


July 21, 2017Alzheimer’s Drug May Help Treat Traumatic Brain Injury
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability and death globally, but medications have generally failed to benefit patients. A new study found that memantine, a drug that is used to treat dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease, may be a promising therapy.   The study examined the effect of memantine on blood levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a marker of neuronal damage, and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) in patients with moderate TBI. The GCS is the most common...


July 20, 2017Molting Feathers May Help Birds Deal with Environmental Contaminants
Mercury is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that affects the health of birds and other wild animals. Two varieties of songbird—zebra finch and European starling—were found to shed mercury accumulation with their feathers in a recent study.During a molt, both species quickly eliminated mercury from their blood and significantly reduced mercury concentrations in other tissues. This, coupled with a migration out of contaminated sites, may help birds deal with exposure to environmental...


July 20, 2017Cucumbers in Space Provide Insights on Root Growth
Scientists have untangled the competing influences of water and gravity on plant roots—by growing cucumbers during spaceflight.Plant roots grow to find water, according to a process known as hydrotropism. Roots are also influenced by gravity and tend to grow downwards, called gravitropism. To find out whether gravity or water had the greater influence on root growth, investigators grew cucumber plants in the microgravity environment on board the International Space Station. In their...


July 20, 2017Family Factors May Influence a Child’s Temperament
A new study indicates that a child’s temperament may be influenced by maternal postpartum depression, maternal sensitivity, and family functioning. Maternal depression was associated with difficult temperaments in infants when maternal sensitivity was low, but not when maternal sensitivity was high. Family functioning similarly moderated these links.The findings suggest that family factors play a critical role in shaping the trajectory of an infant’s behavioral style as it unfolds over...


July 20, 2017Assessment of bone density and fracture history Can Predict Long-Term Fracture Risk
Factors such as low bone density and previous fractures are commonly used to predict an individual’s risk of experiencing a fracture over the next 10 years. A new analysis has found that a single bone density measurement and an assessment of fracture history in postmenopausal women can predict fracture risk over a much longer period, up to 25 years.The findings come from an analysis of data from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures that assessed bone mineral density and risk factors in 7,959...


July 19, 2017Does Having a Sibling with Autism Affect a Child’s Language and Motor Skills?
A review of published studies suggests that infants who have siblings with autism spectrum disorder may have less advanced linguistic and motor skills than siblings of children with typical development.These differences were detectable when infants were 12 months old and seemed to be sustained until they were 3 years old. Differences in language skills were larger than those in motor skills.The findings are published in Autism Research.Additional InformationLink to Study: http://onlinelibrary....


July 19, 2017Imaging of Scar Tissue Formation: Noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging of lung fibrogenesis with an amino acid targeted probe
Organs respond to injuries with the formation of new fibrous tissue, which can result in scarring. This process called
 fibrogenesis can now be monitored noninvasively on a molecular level, as American scientists report in the journal
 Angewandte Chemie. They have created a new gadolinium-based probe for magnetic resonance imaging that specifically
 reports the proteins involved in fibrogenesis. The imaging method may provide a quantitative assessment of the formation of the
