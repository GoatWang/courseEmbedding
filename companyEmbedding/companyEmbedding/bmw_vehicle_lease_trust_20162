Amazing Customer Service

Outstanding customer service!
After receiving the runaround and otherwise lackluster customer service at other dealerships, I was ready to throw in the towel.
I called BMW of SF and received the best service from Nyomi.
She actually listened to what I had to say and ensured my buying experience exceeded my expectations.
Even the Finance Manager Raquel went above and beyond to find me an outstanding interest rate (much lower than the same bank quoted me), I don't typically write reviews, but wanted to pass on my recommendation for BMW of SF and Nyomi B.!

In late Feb 2007 (Feb 26), I became aware of BMW's March 01 price increases.  As I wanted to do European delivery in May, I decided to email local BMW dealers for a price quote immediately, rather than wait until late March.  My email listed the 335i E90 car specs and desired ED date.   Later that day, the internet manager at BMW SF was the first to reply, with an offer that met my target price.  So on Feb 27, I accepted the deal with BMW SF, and faxed my lease application.  A week or so later, I rec'd a production number and confirmed ED date.   My prior CA (client advisor in BMW-speak) at another Bay Area BMW dealer replied after 4 days, thus locking me into the price increase.  Plus, his offer was way over my target price.  Other dealers wouldn't state a price, and wanted me to come into the dealership.   In early May (about 2-3 weeks prior to the ED date), I finally met my new CA when I went in to sign the purchase order and lease paperwork.  The car was picked up in Munich on May 22.  After a nearly two week vacation in the Italian lake district and the south of France (during the Cannes film festival and Monaco GP), the car was dropped off in Paris on June 1.  Car was redelivered on July 23.

This Indenture, dated as of October
13, 2016, is between the BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2016-2, a
Delaware statutory trust (the “Issuer”), and Citibank,
N.A., a national banking association, as indenture trustee (the
“Indenture Trustee”).



Each party agrees as follows for
the benefit of the other parties and for the equal and ratable
benefit of the holders of the Issuer’s 0.72000% Asset Backed
Notes, Class A-1 (the “Class A-1 Notes”), 1.23% Asset
Backed Notes, Class A-2 (the “Class A-2 Notes”), 1.43%
Asset Backed Notes, Class A-3 (the “Class A-3 Notes”)
and 1.57% Asset Backed Notes, Class A-4 (the “Class A-4
Notes” and, together with the Class A-1 Notes, Class A-2
Notes and Class A-3 Notes, the “Notes”):



GRANTING CLAUSE



The Issuer, to secure the payment
of principal of and interest on, and any other amounts owing in
respect of, the Notes, equally and ratably without prejudice,
priority or distinction except as set forth herein, and to secure
compliance with the provisions of this Indenture, hereby Grants in
trust to the Indenture Trustee on the Closing Date, as trustee for
the benefit of the Noteholders, all of the Issuer’s right,
title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and
to (i) the Trust Estate and (ii) all present and future claims,
demands, causes and choses in action in respect of any or all of
the foregoing and all payments on or under and all proceeds of
every kind and nature whatsoever in respect of any or all of the
foregoing, including all proceeds of the conversion, voluntary or
involuntary, into cash or other liquid property, all cash proceeds,
accounts, accounts receivable, notes, drafts, acceptances, chattel
paper, checks, deposit accounts, insurance proceeds, condemnation
awards, rights to payment of any and every kind and other forms of
obligations and receivables, instruments, securities, financial
assets and other property that at any time constitute all or part
of or are included in the proceeds of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the “Collateral”), in each case as such
terms are defined herein.



The foregoing Grant is made in
trust to secure the payment of principal of and interest on, and
any other amounts owing in respect of, the Notes, equally and
ratably without prejudice, priority or distinction, and to secure
compliance with the provisions of this Indenture, all as provided
in this Indenture.



The Indenture Trustee, as trustee
on behalf of the Noteholders, acknowledges the foregoing Grant,
accepts the trusts under this Indenture in accordance with the
provisions of this Indenture and agrees to perform its duties
required in this Indenture to the best of its ability to the end
that the interests of the Noteholders may be adequately and
effectively protected.



Notwithstanding any statement to
the contrary contained in any Basic Document, neither the Indenture
Trustee nor any of the Noteholders shall have any security interest
in any funds held by the Qualified Intermediary or in any Qualified
Intermediary Account which represent Sales Proceeds with respect to
any of the 2016-2 Vehicles relating to the 2016-2 Leases, and such
funds shall not constitute Collateral; provided ,
however , that Sales Proceeds from the sale of any 2016-2
Vehicle received after the exercise of remedies with respect to an
Indenture Default pursuant to Article V shall not be deposited with
the Qualified Intermediary or into any









 



Qualified Intermediary Account, and
nothing contained herein shall limit any right of the Indenture
Trustee or any Noteholder with respect to Sales Proceeds received
after such exercise of remedies. It is the intention of the parties
hereto that the preceding sentence shall satisfy the requirements
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4), which requires
that the Issuer, the Depositor and their respective Affiliates not
have the right to receive, pledge, borrow or otherwise obtain the
benefits of money or other property held by the Qualified
Intermediary.

other variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture and
may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification and
such



16







 



legends or endorsements placed
thereon as may, consistent herewith, be determined by the officers
executing such Notes, as evidenced by their execution of such
Notes.  Any portion of the text of any Note may be set forth
on the reverse thereof, with an appropriate reference thereto on
the face of such Note.



The terms of the Notes set forth in
Exhibit A hereto are part of the terms of this
Indenture.



 Section
2.02      Execution, Authentication and
Delivery .  The Notes shall be executed by the Owner
Trustee on behalf of the Issuer.  The signature of any
authorized officer of the Owner Trustee on the Notes may be manual
or by facsimile.  Notes bearing the manual or facsimile
signature of individuals who were at any time authorized officers
of the Owner Trustee shall bind the Issuer, notwithstanding that
any such individuals have ceased to hold such offices prior to the
authentication and delivery of such Notes or did not hold such
offices at the date of such Notes.



The Indenture Trustee shall, upon
Issuer Order, authenticate and deliver for original issue the
following aggregate principal amounts of the Notes: (i)
$120,000,000 of Class A-1 Notes, (ii) $440,000,000 of Class
A-2 Notes, (iii) $350,000,000 of Class A-3 Notes and

integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof; provided, however,
that on the Closing Date, one Class A‑1 Note, one Class A-2
Note, one Class A-3 Note and one Class A-4 Note may be issued in a
denomination that includes any remaining portion of the Initial
Class A-1 Note Balance, the Initial Class A-2 Note Balance, the
Initial Class A-3 Note Balance and the Initial Class A-4 Note
Balance (each, a “ Residual Note ”).

benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any
purpose unless there appears on such Note a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form provided for herein
executed by the Indenture Trustee by the manual signature of one of
its authorized signatories, and such certificate upon any Note
shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Note
has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.



 Section
2.03      Temporary Notes .  Pending the
preparation of Definitive Notes, the Owner Trustee may execute, on
behalf of the Issuer, and upon receipt of an Issuer Order, the
Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Notes
that are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or
otherwise produced, substantially of the tenor of the Definitive
Notes in lieu of which they are issued and with such variations not
inconsistent with the terms of this Indenture as the officers
executing such Notes may determine, as evidenced by their execution
of such Notes.



If temporary Notes are issued, the
Issuer shall cause Definitive Notes to be prepared without
unreasonable delay.  After the preparation of Definitive
Notes, the temporary Notes shall



17







 



be exchangeable for Definitive Notes
upon surrender of such temporary Notes at the office or agency of
the Issuer to be maintained as provided in Section 3.02, without
charge to the related Noteholder.  Upon surrender for
cancellation of any one or more temporary Notes, the Owner Trustee
shall execute, on behalf of the Issuer, and the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor, a like
principal amount of Definitive Notes of authorized
denominations.  Until so exchanged, such temporary Notes shall
in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as Definitive Notes.



 Section
2.04      Registration; Registration of Transfer
and Exchange .  The Issuer shall cause to be kept a
register (the “ Note Register ”) in which,
subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the
Issuer shall provide for the registration of Notes and the
registration of transfers of Notes.  The Indenture Trustee is
hereby appointed the “Note Registrar” for the purpose
of registering Notes and transfers of Notes as herein
provided.  Upon any resignation of any Note Registrar, the
Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor or, if it elects not to
make such an appointment, assume the duties of Note
Registrar.



If a Person other than the
Indenture Trustee is appointed by the Issuer as Note Registrar, the
Issuer shall give the Indenture Trustee prompt written notice of
such appointment and the location, and any change in such location,
of the Note Register, and the Indenture Trustee shall have the
right to inspect the Note Register at all reasonable times and to
obtain copies thereof, and the Indenture Trustee shall have the
right to rely upon a certificate executed on behalf of the Note
Registrar by an Executive Officer as to the names and addresses of
the Noteholders and the principal amounts and number of such Notes
until a replacement certificate is provided to it by the Note
Registrar.



Upon surrender for registration of
transfer of any Note at the office or agency of the Issuer to be
maintained as provided in Section 3.02, if the requirements of
Section 8-401 of the UCC are met, the Owner Trustee shall execute,
on behalf of the Issuer, and the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and the related Noteholder shall obtain from the
Indenture Trustee, in the name of the designated transferee, one or
more new Notes in any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate
principal amount.



At the option of the related
Noteholder, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes in any
authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount,
upon surrender of such Notes at such office or agency. 
Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange, if the
requirements of Section 8-401 of the UCC are met, the Owner Trustee
shall execute, on behalf of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and the Noteholder shall obtain from the Indenture
Trustee the Notes that the Noteholder making such exchange is
entitled to receive.



Every Note presented or surrendered
for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by
the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form and
substance satisfactory to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee,
duly executed by the Noteholder thereof or its attorney-in-fact
duly authorized in writing.



18







 



All Notes issued upon any
registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid
obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt and entitled to
the same benefits under this Indenture as the Notes surrendered
upon such registration of transfer or exchange.



No service charge shall be made to
a Noteholder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes,
but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
therewith, other than exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.03 or 9.05
not involving any transfer.



No Note, or any interest therein,
may be transferred to an “employee benefit plan” within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to ERISA, a
“plan” described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, any
entity that is deemed to hold “plan assets” of any of
the foregoing by reason of an employee benefit plan’s or
other plan’s investment in such entity, or any governmental
or church plan subject to applicable law that is substantially
similar to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, unless such transferee represents,
warrants and covenants that its purchase and holding of such note
will not result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code because it will
satisfy the requirements of an applicable prohibited transaction
exemption (or in the case of a governmental or church plan, will
not cause a non-exempt violation of any applicable law that is
substantially similar to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code). 
By its acquisition of a Note in book-entry form or any interest
therein, each transferee will be deemed to have represented,
warranted and covenanted that it satisfies the foregoing
requirements and the Indenture Trustee may relay conclusively on
the same for purposes hereof.



The preceding provisions of this
Section notwithstanding, the Issuer shall not be required to make,
and the Note Registrar need not register, transfers or exchanges of
any Note (i) selected for redemption or (ii) for a period of 15
days preceding the due date for any payment with respect to such
Note.



All transfers or assignments of any
Note or any interest in any Note shall be recorded in the Note
Register.



 Section
2.05      Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen
Notes .  If (i) any mutilated Note is surrendered to the
Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture Trustee receives evidence to
its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note and
(ii) there is delivered to the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer
such security or indemnity as may be required by it to hold the
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee harmless, then, in the absence of
notice to the Issuer, the Note Registrar or a Responsible Officer
of the Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a
“protected purchaser” (as contemplated by Article Eight
of the UCC), and provided that the requirements of Section 8-405 of
the UCC are met, the Owner Trustee shall execute, on behalf of the
Issuer, and upon Issuer Request the Indenture Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a replacement Note;
provided, however, that if any such destroyed, lost or stolen Note
(but not a mutilated Note) shall have become or within seven days
shall become due and payable, or shall have been called for
redemption, instead of issuing a replacement Note, the Issuer may
pay such destroyed, lost or stolen Note when so due or payable or
upon the Redemption Date without the surrender thereof.  If,
after the delivery of such replacement Note or payment of a
destroyed, lost or stolen Note



19







 



pursuant to the proviso to the
preceding sentence, a “protected purchaser” (as
contemplated by Article Eight of the UCC) of the original Note in
lieu of which such replacement Note was issued presents for payment
such original Note, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall be
entitled to recover such replacement Note (or such payment) from
the Person to whom it was delivered or any Person taking such
replacement Note from such Person to whom such replacement Note was
delivered or any assignee of such Person, except a “protected
purchaser” (as contemplated by Article Eight of the UCC), and
shall be entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity
provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or
expense incurred by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee in
connection therewith.



Upon the issuance of any
replacement Note under this Section, the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee may require the payment by the related Noteholder of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses
(including the fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee or the
Note Registrar) connected therewith.



Every replacement Note issued
pursuant to this Section in replacement of any mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of
this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other
Notes duly issued hereunder.



The provisions of this Section are
exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other
rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.



 Section
2.06      Persons Deemed Owners .  Prior
to due presentment for registration of transfer of any Note, the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and their respective agents may treat
the Person in whose name any Note is registered (as of the date of
determination) as the owner of such Note for the purpose of
receiving payments of principal of and interest, if any, on such
Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such
Note be overdue, and neither the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee nor
any of their respective agents shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.



 Section
2.07      Cancellation .  All Notes
surrendered for payment, registration of transfer, exchange or
redemption shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the
Indenture Trustee, be delivered to the Indenture Trustee and shall
be promptly cancelled by the Indenture Trustee.  The Issuer
may at any time deliver to the Indenture Trustee for cancellation
any Notes previously authenticated and delivered hereunder that the
Issuer may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Notes so
delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Indenture
Trustee.  No Notes shall be authenticated in lieu of or in
exchange for any Notes cancelled as provided in this Section,
except as expressly permitted by this Indenture.  All
cancelled Notes may be held or disposed of by the Indenture Trustee
in accordance with its standard retention or disposal policy as in
effect at the time unless the Issuer shall direct by an Issuer
Order that they be destroyed or returned to it; provided, that such
Issuer Order is timely and that such Notes have not been previously
disposed of by the Indenture Trustee.

2.10      Notices to Clearing Agency . 
Whenever a notice or other communication to Noteholders is required
under this Indenture, unless and until Definitive Notes shall have
been issued to Note Owners pursuant to Section 2.11, the Indenture
Trustee shall give all such notices and communications specified
herein to be given to Noteholders to the Clearing Agency, and shall
have no obligation to the Note Owners.



 Section
2.11      Definitive Notes .  If (i) (A)
the Administrator advises the Indenture Trustee in writing that the
Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to properly discharge
its responsibilities as described in the Depository Agreement and
(B) none of the Indenture Trustee,



21







 



the Transferor or the Administrator
is able to locate a qualified successor, (ii) the Administrator at
its option, with the consent of the applicable Clearing Agency
Participants, advises the Indenture Trustee in writing that it
elects to terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing
Agency or (iii) after an Indenture Default, Note Owners
representing in the aggregate not less than 51% of the Outstanding
Amount advise the Indenture Trustee through the Clearing Agency and
its Participants in writing that the continuation of a book-entry
system through the Clearing Agency or its successor is no longer in
the best interest of Note Owners, the Indenture Trustee shall be
required to notify all Note Owners, through the Clearing Agency, of
the occurrence of such event and the availability through the
Clearing Agency of Definitive Notes to Note Owners requesting the
same.  Upon surrender to the Indenture Trustee by the Clearing
Agency of the Note or Notes representing the Book-Entry Notes and
the receipt of instructions for re-registration, the Indenture
Trustee shall issue Definitive Notes to Note Owners, who thereupon
shall become Noteholders for all purposes of this Indenture. 
None of the Owner Trustee, the Note Registrar or the Indenture
Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such
instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected
in relying on, such instructions.



The Indenture Trustee shall not be
liable if the Indenture Trustee or the Administrator is unable to
locate a qualified successor Clearing Agency.  The Definitive
Notes shall be typewritten, printed, lithographed or engraved or
produced by any combination of such methods (with or without steel
engraved borders), all as determined by the officers executing such
Notes, as evidenced by their execution of such Notes.



If Definitive Notes are issued and
the Indenture Trustee is not the Note Registrar, the Owner Trustee
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Indenture Trustee a
list of the names and addresses of the Noteholders (i) as of each
Record Date, within five days thereafter and (ii) as of not more
than ten days prior to the time such list is furnished, within 30
days after receipt by the Owner Trustee of a written request
therefor.



 Section
2.12      Authenticating Agents .  Upon
the request of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee shall, and if the
Indenture Trustee so chooses the Indenture Trustee may, appoint one
or more Authenticating Agents with power to act on its behalf and
subject to its direction in the authentication of Notes in
connection with issuance, transfers and exchanges under
Sections 2.02, 2.04, 2.05 and 9.05, as fully to all intents
and purposes as though each such Authenticating Agent had been
expressly authorized by such Sections to authenticate such
Notes.  For all purposes of this Indenture, the authentication
of Notes by an Authenticating Agent pursuant to this Section shall
be deemed to be the authentication of Notes by the Indenture
Trustee.



Any corporation into which any
Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it
may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
consolidation or conversion to which any Authenticating Agent shall
be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate trust
business of any Authenticating Agent, shall be the successor of
such Authenticating Agent hereunder, without the execution or
filing of any further act on the part of the parties hereto or such
Authenticating Agent or such successor corporation.



22







 



Any Authenticating Agent may at any
time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the
Indenture Trustee and the Issuer.  The Indenture Trustee may
at any time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by
giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent
and the Issuer.  Upon receiving such notice of resignation or
upon such termination, the Indenture Trustee shall promptly appoint
a successor Authenticating Agent and shall give written notice of
such appointment to the Issuer.



The Issuer agrees to pay to each
Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for
its services and reimbursement for its reasonable expenses relating
thereto.  The provisions of Sections 2.07 and 6.04 shall be
applicable to any Authenticating Agent.

to Section 8.04, the Issuer shall cause to be distributed all
amounts on deposit in the Note Distribution Account on each Payment
Date that have been deposited therein for the benefit of the Notes,
as set forth in Section 8.04.  Amounts properly withheld under
the Code by any Person from a payment to any Noteholder of interest

demands upon the Issuer in respect of the Notes and this Indenture
may be served.  The Issuer hereby appoints the Indenture
Trustee as its agent to receive all such surrenders, notices and
demands.  The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to the
Indenture Trustee of the location, and of any change in the
location, of any such office or agency.  If at any time the
Issuer shall fail to maintain any such office or agency or shall
fail to furnish the Indenture Trustee with the address thereof,
such surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
Corporate Trust Office, and the Issuer hereby appoints the
Indenture Trustee as its agent to receive all such surrenders,
notices and demands.



 Section
3.03      Money for Payments to be Held in
Trust .  As provided in Sections 8.04 and 5.04(b), all
payments of amounts due and payable with respect to any Notes that

except as provided in this Section.



On each Payment Date and Redemption
Date, the Issuer shall deposit or cause to be deposited into the
Note Distribution Account an aggregate sum sufficient to pay the
amounts then becoming due under the Notes, and the Paying Agent
shall hold such sum in trust for the



23







 



benefit of the Persons entitled
thereto and (unless the Paying Agent is the Indenture Trustee)
shall promptly notify the Indenture Trustee of any failure by the
Issuer to effect such deposit.



The Issuer shall cause each Paying
Agent other than the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to
the Indenture Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent
shall agree with the Indenture Trustee (and if the Indenture
Trustee acts as Paying Agent, it hereby so agrees to the extent
relevant), subject to the provisions of this Section, that such
Paying Agent shall:



(a)             
hold all sums held by it for the
payment of amounts due with respect to the Notes in trust for the
benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be
paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided
and pay such sums to such Persons as herein provided;



(b)             
give the Indenture Trustee notice of
any default by the Issuer of which it has actual knowledge (or any
other obligor upon the Notes) in the making of any payment required
to be made with respect to the Notes;



(c)             
at any time during the continuance
of any such default, upon the written request of the Indenture
Trustee, forthwith pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums so held in
trust by such Paying Agent;



(d)             
immediately resign as a Paying Agent
and forthwith pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums held by it in
trust for the payment of Notes if at any time it ceases to meet the
standards required to be met by a Paying Agent at the time of its
appointment; and



(e)             
comply with all requirements of the
Code with respect to the withholding from any payments made by it
on any Notes of any applicable withholding taxes imposed thereon
and with respect to any applicable reporting requirements in
connection therewith.



The Issuer may at any time, for the
purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture or for any other purpose, by Issuer Order direct any
Paying Agent to pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums held in trust
by such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Indenture Trustee
upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by
such Paying Agent; and upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the
Indenture Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all
further liability with respect to such money.



Subject to applicable laws with
respect to escheat of funds, any money held by the Indenture
Trustee or any Paying Agent in trust for the payment of any amount
due with respect to any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years
after such amount has become due and payable shall be discharged
from such trust and deposited by the Indenture Trustee into the
2016-2 SUBI Collection Account, and the related Noteholder shall
thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the
Issuer for payment thereof, and all liability of the Indenture
Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money shall
thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Indenture Trustee or
such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such
repayment, may at the expense of the Issuer cause to be published
once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily
published on each Business Day and of general circulation in The
City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and
that, after a date specified therein, which date shall not be less
than 30 days from the date of such



24







 



publication, any unclaimed balance
of such money then remaining shall be paid to the
Administrator.  The Indenture Trustee shall also adopt and
employ, at the expense of the Issuer, any other reasonable means of
notification of such repayment (including mailing notice of such
repayment to Noteholders the Notes of which have been called but
not surrendered for redemption or whose right to or interest in
monies due and payable but not claimed is determinable from the
records of the Indenture Trustee or any Paying Agent at the last
address of record for each such Noteholder).

of any other state or of the United States, in which case the
Issuer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights and
franchises under the laws of such other jurisdiction) and shall

Noteholders to be prior to all other liens in respect of the Trust
Estate, and the Issuer shall take all actions necessary to obtain
and maintain, for the benefit of the Indenture Trustee on behalf of
the Noteholders, a first lien on and a first priority, perfected
security interest in the Trust Estate.  The Issuer shall from
time to time execute and deliver all such supplements and
amendments hereto and all such financing statements, continuation
statements, instruments of further assurance and other instruments,

and shall take such other action necessary or advisable

security interest (and the priority thereof) created by this

(b)             
On or before April 30th of each
calendar year, beginning with April 30, 2017, the Issuer shall

 Section
3.07      Performance of Obligations;
Administration of the 2016-2 SUBI Assets .



(a)             
The Issuer shall not take any action
and shall use its best efforts not to permit any action to be taken
by others, including the Administrator, that would release any
Person from any of such Person’s material covenants or
obligations under any instrument or agreement included in the Trust
Estate or that would result in the amendment, hypothecation,
subordination, termination or discharge of, or impair the validity
or effectiveness of, any such instrument or agreement, except as
expressly provided in the Basic Documents or such other instrument
or agreement.



(b)             
The Issuer may contract with other
Persons, to assist it in performing its duties under this
Indenture, and any performance of such duties by a Person
identified to the Indenture Trustee in an Officer’s
Certificate of the Issuer shall be deemed to be action taken by the
Issuer. Initially, the Issuer has contracted with the
Administrator, and the Administrator has agreed, to assist the
Issuer in performing its duties under this Indenture.



(c)             
The Issuer shall, and, shall cause
the Administrator and the Servicer to, punctually perform and
observe all of its and their respective obligations and agreements
contained in this Indenture, the other Basic Documents and the
instruments and agreements included in the Trust Estate, including
filing or causing to be filed all UCC financing statements and
continuation statements required to be filed by the terms of this
Indenture and the other Basic Documents in accordance with and
within the time periods provided for herein and therein. 
Except as otherwise expressly provided therein, the Issuer, as a
party to the Basic Documents and as Holder of the 2016-2 SUBI
Certificate, shall not, and shall cause each of the Servicer and
the Administrator not to, modify, amend, supplement, waive or
terminate any Basic Document to which it is a party or any
provision thereof without satisfying the Rating Agency Condition
and satisfying each other condition as may be specified in the
particular provision or Basic Document.  Copies of any
statements and certificates required to be provided to the
Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Servicing Agreement or any other

(d)             
If the Issuer or a Responsible
Officer of the Indenture Trustee shall have actual knowledge of the
occurrence and continuation of a Servicer Default, such entity
shall promptly notify the other entity and the Administrator
thereof, and shall specify in such notice the action, if any, the
other entity is taking in respect of such default.  If a
Servicer Default shall arise from the failure of the Servicer to
perform any of its duties or obligations under the Servicing
Agreement with respect to the 2016-2 SUBI Assets, the Issuer shall
take all reasonable steps available to it to remedy such
failure.  Upon the occurrence and continuation of a Servicer
Default with respect to the 2016-2 SUBI, the Indenture Trustee may
(and at the direction of Noteholders holding not less than 66
⅔% of the Outstanding Amount shall) terminate all of the
rights and obligations of the Servicer with respect to the 2016-2
SUBI only, and a successor Servicer shall be appointed pursuant to
the Servicing Agreement.



(e)             
Upon any termination of the
Servicer’s rights and powers or resignation of the Servicer
pursuant to the Servicing Agreement, the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee shall promptly, but in any event within two Business Days
of such termination or resignation, notify the other entity
thereof.  As soon as a successor Servicer is appointed
pursuant to the Servicing Agreement, the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee shall notify the other entity of such appointment,
specifying in such notice the name and address of such successor
Servicer.

operation of law, in each case on any 2016-2 SUBI Asset and arising
solely as a result of an action or omission of the related Lessee)

order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental
body) shall constitute a default under this Indenture (each, an

more;



(b)             
default in the payment of principal
of any Note at the applicable Note Final Scheduled Payment Date or

(c)             
default in the observance or
performance in any material respect of any covenant or agreement of
the Issuer made in this Indenture (other than a covenant or
agreement, a default in the observance or performance of which is
elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with), or any
representation or warranty of the Issuer made in this Indenture or
in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or in
connection herewith proving to have been incorrect in any material
respect as of the time when the same shall have been made, and such
default shall continue or not be cured, or the circumstance or
condition in respect of which such



33







 



misrepresentation or warranty was
incorrect shall not have been eliminated or otherwise cured, for a
period of 30 days after there shall have been given, by registered
or certified mail, to the Issuer by the Indenture Trustee or to the
Issuer and the Indenture Trustee by Noteholders representing at
least 25% of the Outstanding Amount, voting together as a single
class, a written notice specifying such default or incorrect
representation or warranty and requiring it to be remedied and
stating that such notice is a “Notice of Default”
hereunder;



(d)             
the filing of a decree or order for
relief by a court having jurisdiction in the premises in respect of
the Issuer or any substantial part of the Trust Estate in an
involuntary case under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or
appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee,
sequestrator or similar official of the Issuer or for any
substantial part of the Trust Estate, or ordering the winding up or
liquidation of the Issuer’s affairs, and such decree or order
shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive
days; or



(e)             
the commencement by the Issuer of a
voluntary case under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or the
consent by the Issuer to the entry of an order for relief in an
involuntary case under any such law, the consent by the Issuer to
the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator,
assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator or similar official of
the Issuer or for any substantial part of the Trust Estate, the
making by the Issuer of any general assignment for the benefit of
creditors, the failure by the Issuer generally to pay its debts as
such debts become due or the taking of action by the Issuer in
furtherance of any of the foregoing.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
delay in or failure of performance referred to under clause (a) for
a period of 45 days, under clause (b) for a period of 60 days or
under clause (c) for a period of 120 days, will not constitute an
Indenture Default if that failure or delay was caused by a Force
Majeure.



The Issuer shall promptly deliver
to the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Vehicle Trustee,
each Noteholder, and with respect to each Rating Agency shall make
available, written notice in the form of an Officer’s
Certificate of any Indenture Default, its status and what action
the Issuer is taking or proposes to take with respect
thereto.



Subject to the provisions herein
relating to the duties of the Indenture Trustee, if an Indenture
Default occurs and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee shall be
under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under
this Indenture at the request or direction of any Noteholder, if
the Indenture Trustee reasonably believes that it will not be
adequately indemnified against the costs, expenses and liabilities
that might be incurred by it in complying with such request. 
Subject to such provisions for indemnification and certain
limitations contained herein, Noteholders holding not less than a
majority of the Outstanding Amount shall have the right to direct
the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding or any
remedy available to the Indenture Trustee or exercising any trust
power conferred on the Indenture Trustee, and Noteholders holding
not less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount may, in certain
cases, waive any default with respect thereto, except a default in
the payment of principal or interest or a default in respect of a
covenant or provision of the Indenture that cannot be modified
without the waiver or consent of all of the Noteholders of the
Outstanding Notes.



34







 



 Section
5.02      Acceleration of Maturity; Waiver of
Indenture Default .  If an Indenture Default should occur
and be continuing, the Indenture Trustee may (and, at the direction
of the Noteholders holding not less than a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Notes, shall) declare the principal of
the Notes to be immediately due and payable.  Upon such
declaration, the Indenture Trustee shall promptly provide written
notice to the Administrator.  Such declaration may be
rescinded by Noteholders holding a majority of the Outstanding
Amount before a judgment or decree for payment of the amount due
has been obtained by the Indenture Trustee if (a) the Issuer has
deposited with the Indenture Trustee an amount sufficient to pay
(i) all interest on and principal of the Notes as if the Indenture
Default giving rise to such declaration had not occurred and (ii)
all amounts advanced by the Indenture Trustee and its costs and
expenses and (b) all Indenture Defaults (other than the nonpayment
of principal of the Notes that has become due solely by such
acceleration) have been cured or waived.



At any time prior to the
declaration of the acceleration of the maturity of the Notes,
Noteholders holding not less than a majority of the Outstanding
Amount may waive an Indenture Default as set forth in Section
5.12.



If the Notes have been declared due
and payable following an Indenture Default, the Indenture Trustee
may institute proceedings to collect amounts due, exercise remedies
as a secured party (including foreclosure or sale of the Trust
Estate) or elect to maintain the Trust Estate and continue to apply
the proceeds from the Trust Estate as if there had been no
declaration of acceleration.  Any sale of the Trust Estate by
the Indenture Trustee will be subject to the terms and conditions
of Section 5.04.



 Section
5.03      Collection of Indebtedness and Suits
for Enforcement by Indenture Trustee .



(a)             
The Issuer covenants that if there
is a default in the payment of (i) any interest on the Notes when
the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for a
period of five days or (ii) the principal of the Notes at the Note
Final Scheduled Payment Date or the Redemption Date, the Issuer
shall, upon demand of the Indenture Trustee, pay to the Indenture
Trustee, for the benefit of such Noteholders, the entire amount
then due and payable on such Notes for principal and interest, with
interest on the overdue principal, and, to the extent payment at
such rate of interest shall be legally enforceable, upon overdue
installments of interest, at the Overdue Interest Rate and in
addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to
cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Indenture Trustee and its agents, attorneys and
counsel.



(b)             
In case the Issuer shall fail
forthwith to pay amounts described in Section 5.03(a) upon demand,
the Indenture Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express
trust, may institute a Proceeding for the collection of the sums so
due and unpaid, and may prosecute such Proceeding to judgment or
final decree, and may enforce the same against the Issuer or other
obligor upon such Notes and collect in the manner provided by law
out of the property of the Issuer or other obligor upon such Notes,
wherever situated, the monies adjudged or decreed to be
payable.



35







 



(c)             
If an Indenture Default occurs and
is continuing, the Indenture Trustee may, in its discretion,
proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Noteholders, by such appropriate Proceedings as the Indenture
Trustee shall deem most effective to protect and enforce any such
rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or
agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power
granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy or legal or
equitable right vested in the Indenture Trustee by this Indenture
or by law.



(d)             
In case there shall be pending,
relative to the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Notes or any
Person having or claiming an ownership interest in the Trust
Estate, Proceedings under Title 11 of the Code or any other
applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or
reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall
have been appointed for or taken possession of the Issuer or its
property or such other obligor or Person, or in case of any other
comparable judicial Proceedings relative to the Issuer or other
obligor upon the Notes, or to the property of the Issuer or such
other obligor, the Indenture Trustee, irrespective of whether the
principal of any Notes shall then be due and payable as therein
expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Indenture Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant
to the provisions of this Section, shall be entitled and empowered,
by intervention in such Proceedings or otherwise:



(i)

and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and for
reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities incurred, and all
advances and disbursements made, by the Indenture Trustee and each
predecessor Indenture Trustee, except as a result of negligence or
bad faith) and of the Noteholders allowed in such
Proceedings;



(ii)             
unless prohibited by applicable law
and regulations, to vote on behalf of the Noteholders in any
election of a trustee, a standby trustee or Person performing
similar functions in any such Proceedings; to collect and receive
any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such
claims and to distribute all amounts received with respect to the
claims of the Noteholders and the Indenture Trustee on their
behalf; and



(iii)             
to file such proofs of claim and
other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order
to have the claims of the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders
allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer, its
creditors and its property;



and any trustee, receiver,
liquidator, custodian or other similar official in any such
Proceeding is hereby authorized by each Noteholder to make payments
to the Indenture Trustee and, in the event the Indenture Trustee
shall consent to the making of payments directly to such
Noteholders, to pay to the Indenture Trustee such amounts as shall
be sufficient to cover



36







 



reasonable compensation to the
Indenture Trustee, each predecessor Indenture Trustee and their
respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses
and liabilities incurred and all advances and disbursements made by
the Indenture Trustee and each predecessor Indenture Trustee except
as a result of negligence or bad faith, and any other amounts due
the Indenture Trustee under Section 6.07.



(e)             
Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to authorize the Indenture Trustee to authorize or consent
to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder any
plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Notes or the rights of any Noteholder or to vote in
respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such proceeding
except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in
bankruptcy or similar Person.



(f)             
All rights of action and of
asserting claims under this Indenture, or under the Notes, may be
enforced by the Indenture Trustee without the possession of the
Notes or the production thereof in any trial or other Proceedings
relative thereto, and any such action or Proceedings instituted by
the Indenture Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee
of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the
payment of the expenses, advances, disbursements and compensation
of the Indenture Trustee, each predecessor Indenture Trustee and
their respective agents, attorneys and counsel shall be for the
ratable benefit of the Noteholders in respect of which such
judgment has been recovered.



(g)             
In any Proceedings brought by the
Indenture Trustee (and also any Proceedings involving the
interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the
Indenture Trustee shall be a party), the Indenture Trustee shall be
held to represent all the Noteholders, and it shall not be
necessary to make any Noteholder a party to any such
Proceedings.



 Section
5.04      Remedies; Priorities .



(a)             
If an Indenture Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Indenture Trustee may do one or
more of the following (subject to Section 5.05):



(i)             
institute Proceedings in its own
name and as trustee of an express trust for the collection of all
amounts then payable on the Notes or under this Indenture with
respect thereto, whether by declaration or otherwise, enforce any
judgment obtained, and collect from the Issuer and any other
obligor upon such Notes monies adjudged due;



(ii)             
institute Proceedings from time to
time for the complete or partial foreclosure of this Indenture with
respect to the Trust Estate;



(iii)             
exercise any remedies of a secured
party under the UCC and take any other appropriate action to
protect and enforce the rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders; and



(iv)             
subject to Section 5.17, after an
acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 5.02,
sell the Trust Estate or any portion thereof or rights or interest
therein, at one or more public or private sales called and
conducted in any manner permitted by law;



37







 



provided, however, the Indenture
Trustee may not sell or otherwise liquidate the Trust Estate
following an Indenture Default pursuant to clause (iv) above, other
than an Indenture Default described in Section 5.01 (a) or (b),
unless (A) Noteholders holding 100% of the Outstanding Amount
consent thereto, (B) the proceeds of such sale are sufficient to
discharge in full all amounts then due and unpaid upon all
outstanding Notes or (C) the Indenture Trustee determines that the
Trust Estate will not continue to provide sufficient funds for the
payment of principal of and interest on the Notes as they would
have become due if the Notes had not been declared due and payable
and the Indenture Trustee obtains the consent of Noteholders
holding not less than 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Amount;
provided further, that the Indenture Trustee may not sell the Trust
Estate, unless it shall first have obtained an Opinion of Counsel
that such sale will not cause the Vehicle Trust or an interest
therein or portion thereof to be classified as an association (or a
publicly traded partnership) taxable as a corporation for federal
income tax purposes.  In determining such sufficiency or
insufficiency with respect to clauses (B) and (C) of the preceding
sentence, the Indenture Trustee may but need not obtain (at the
expense of the Issuer) and rely upon an opinion of an Independent
investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to
the feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency
of the Trust Estate for such purpose.



(b)             
If the Indenture Trustee collects
any money or property pursuant to this Article Five after an
acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 5.02,
it shall pay out such money or property held as Collateral (and
other amounts including amounts held on deposit in the Reserve
Fund) for the benefit of the Noteholders, net of liquidation costs
associated with the sale of the Trust Estate in the following
order:



(i)             
to the Indenture Trustee, the Note
Registrar, the Certificate Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Owner
Trustee and the Asset Representations Reviewer, pro rata, based on
amounts due to each such party, for payment of any Trustee and
Reviewer Fees and other amounts required to be paid and/or
reimbursed to such party pursuant to Section 6.07 of this
Indenture, Section 8.01 of the Trust Agreement or pursuant to the
terms of the Asset Representations Review Agreement,
respectively;



(ii)             
to the Servicer, for any Payment
Date Advance Reimbursement;



(iii)             
to the Servicer, for amounts due in
respect of accrued and unpaid Servicing Fees;



(iv)             
to the Noteholders, pro rata, based
upon the aggregate amount of interest due to the Noteholders of
each Class, to pay due and unpaid interest, including any overdue
interest and, to the extent permitted under applicable law,
interest on any overdue interest at the applicable Overdue Interest
Rate;



(v)             
to the Noteholders of the Class A-1
Notes, in payment of the principal amount due and unpaid on the
Class A-1 Notes, until paid in full;



(vi)             
to the Noteholders of the Class A-2
Notes, Class A-3 Notes and Class A-4 Notes, pro rata, based on the

      Fitch Rates BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2016-2
    





October 13, 2016 11:19 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Outlooks to the BMW 
      Vehicle Lease Trust 2016-2 (BMWLT 2016-2) notes:
    

      --$120,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$440,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$350,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$90,000,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: The 2016-2 pool is consistent with recent 
      transactions, with a strong WA FICO score of 778 and 10 months of 
      seasoning. The top vehicle model has shifted back to the 3 Series at 
      24.0% of the pool, compared with the 5 Series at 24.7% in 2016-1. The 
      residual value (RV) maturity profile is slightly less diversified 
      compared with 2016-1.
    

      Adequate CE Structure: Initial credit enhancement (CE) decreased to 
      16.15% from 17.05% in 2016-1. CE is composed of a 0.25% reserve fund and 
      overcollateralization (OC) of 15.90% growing to an 18.05% target of the 
      initial securitization value. Initial excess spread is 4.18%. Fitch's 
      credit loss proxy is 0.80% and the 'BB' residual loss proxy is 13.25%. 
      CE is adequate to support Fitch's stressed loss assumptions.
    

      Strong Loss Performance: Credit and residual performance on BMW FS's 
      portfolio has been strong in recent years. This is a result of robust 
      obligor credit quality and wholesale market that has supported BMW RV 
      performance in recent years, but it has exhibited signs of moderating 
      over the past year.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased 
      production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during 
      the life of the transaction.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: BMW FS demonstrates adequate 
      abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer to service this series 
      as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization delinquency and 
      loss performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of BMW FS would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities}
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      would likely result in declines of CE and loss coverage levels available 
      to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing 
      the transaction's initial base case RV and credit loss assumptions and 
      examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The 
      increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent 
      moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5x) stresses, and are intended to provide 
      an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected 
      deterioration of a trust's performance.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG, 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or recalculating 
      certain information with respect to 100 receivables. Fitch considered 
      this information in its analysis and the findings did not have an impact 
      on our analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link at the bottom of the rating action commentary.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated Sept. 29, 2016. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2016-2 -Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated May 31, 2016.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of

	Schrift ändern: (0 Bewertungen)Business Wire·Mehr Nachrichten von Business WireFitch Expects to Rate BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2016-2; Presale Issued    Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Outlooks to   the BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2016-2 (BMWLT 2016-2) notes:     --$120,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';     --$440,000,000 class A-2a/A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;     --$350,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;     --$90,000,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.     KEY RATING DRIVERS     Stable Collateral Quality: The 2016-2 pool is consistent with recent   transactions, with a strong WA FICO score of 778 and 10 months of   seasoning. The top vehicle model has shifted back to the 3 Series at   24.0% of the pool, compared with the 5 Series at 24.7% in 2016-1. The   residual value (RV) maturity profile is slightly less diversified   compared with 2016-1.     Adequate CE Structure: Initial credit enhancement (CE) decreased to   16.15% from 17.05% in 2016-1. CE is composed of a 0.25% reserve fund and   overcollateralization (OC) of 15.90% growing to an 18.05% target of the   initial securitization value (the target OC drops to 17.25% once A-2 has   paid in full). Initial excess spread is expected to be 4.80%. Fitch's   credit loss proxy is 0.80% and the 'BB' residual loss proxy is 13.25%.   CE is adequate to support Fitch's stressed loss assumptions.     Strong Loss Performance: Credit and residual performance on BMW FS's   portfolio has been strong in recent years. This is a result of robust   obligor credit quality and wholesale market that has supported BMW RV   performance in recent years, but it has exhibited signs of moderating   over the past year.     Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been   normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects   that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased   production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during   the life of the transaction.     Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: BMW FS demonstrates adequate   abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer to service this series   as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization delinquency and   loss performance.     Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should   provide that a bankruptcy of BMW FS would not impair the timeliness of   payments on the securities}     RATING SENSITIVITIES     Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or   increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted   receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and   would likely result in declines of CE and loss coverage levels available   to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing   the transaction's initial base case RV and credit loss assumptions and   examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The   increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent   moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5x) stresses, and are intended to provide   an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected   deterioration of a trust's performance.     USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10     Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG,   LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or recalculating   certain information with respect to 100 receivables. Fitch considered   this information in its analysis and the findings did not have an impact   on our analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E   received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained   through the link at the bottom of the rating action commentary.     Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the   presale report dated Sept. 29, 2016. Fitch's analysis of the   Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in   'BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2016-2 -Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to   those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special   report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in   Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated May 31, 2016.

Reproduction or   retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission.   All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in   making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on   factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from   other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable   investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance   with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of   that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources   are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The   manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party   verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated   security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the   jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the   issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public   information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers,   the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit   reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,   engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third   parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party   verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the   particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.   Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an   enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can   ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a   rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer   and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information   they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other   reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the   work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to   financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax   matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other   information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and   predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified   as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts,   ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions   that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or   affirmed.     The information in this report is provided "as is" without any   representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or   warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the   requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion   as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made   by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch   is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports   are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of   individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating   does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,   unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the   offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship.   Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not   solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are   named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is   neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled,   verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in   connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or   withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.   Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a   recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not   comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security   for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of   payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from   issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for   rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000   (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases,   Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer,   or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a   single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to   US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment,   publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute   a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any   registration statement filed under the United States securities laws,   the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or   the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative   efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may   be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to   print subscribers.

Amazing Customer Service

Outstanding customer service!
After receiving the runaround and otherwise lackluster customer service at other dealerships, I was ready to throw in the towel.
I called BMW of SF and received the best service from Nyomi.
She actually listened to what I had to say and ensured my buying experience exceeded my expectations.
Even the Finance Manager Raquel went above and beyond to find me an outstanding interest rate (much lower than the same bank quoted me), I don't typically write reviews, but wanted to pass on my recommendation for BMW of SF and Nyomi B.!

In late Feb 2007 (Feb 26), I became aware of BMW's March 01 price increases.  As I wanted to do European delivery in May, I decided to email local BMW dealers for a price quote immediately, rather than wait until late March.  My email listed the 335i E90 car specs and desired ED date.   Later that day, the internet manager at BMW SF was the first to reply, with an offer that met my target price.  So on Feb 27, I accepted the deal with BMW SF, and faxed my lease application.  A week or so later, I rec'd a production number and confirmed ED date.   My prior CA (client advisor in BMW-speak) at another Bay Area BMW dealer replied after 4 days, thus locking me into the price increase.  Plus, his offer was way over my target price.  Other dealers wouldn't state a price, and wanted me to come into the dealership.   In early May (about 2-3 weeks prior to the ED date), I finally met my new CA when I went in to sign the purchase order and lease paperwork.  The car was picked up in Munich on May 22.  After a nearly two week vacation in the Italian lake district and the south of France (during the Cannes film festival and Monaco GP), the car was dropped off in Paris on June 1.  Car was redelivered on July 23.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
