(/zō-EH-tis/[4]) is the world's largest producer of medicine and vaccinations for pets and livestock.[4][5] The company was a subsidiary of Pfizer, the world's largest drug maker, but with Pfizer's spinoff of its 83% interest in the firm it is now a completely independent company. The company operates in 70 countries worldwide with recent expansions into Southeast Asia and China.[1][6] Contemporaneous with the spinoff in June 2013 S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that Zoetis would replace First Horizon National Corporation in the S&P 500 stock market index.[7]

History[edit]
1950s to 2000s[edit]




Zoetis building in Exton, PA


In the 1950s, Pfizer began research on several drugs including Oxytetracycline.[8] John McKeen, a chemical engineer with Pfizer products, discovered its effective use in livestock. In 1952, the Pfizer Agriculture Division opened a 732-acre research and development facility in Terre Haute, Indiana called Vigo.[8][9] By 1988 the division was renamed Pfizer Animal Health.[8]
The acquisition of GlaxoSmithKline’s Norden Laboratories in 1995 boosted Pfizer's animal health division into small animal care including domestic pets.[8] Secondary research and development centres were opened in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 2003.[8] In the same year, Pfizer acquired Pharmacia Corporation for US$ 60 billion in stock options.[10] Between 2007 and 2011 the company acquired Embrex Inc, Catapult Genetics, Bovigen, Wyeth, Fort Dodge Animal Health, Vetnex Animal Health Ltd, Synbiotics Corporation, Microtek, King Pharmaceuticals, and Alpharma.[8] These acquisitions greatly increased Pfizer's market, range of products, countries it operated in, and resources.
2010s to present[edit]
Plans to break away Pfizer Animal Health into a separate company were officially announced in 2012.[4] The name chosen, Zoetis, roughly translates from the derived Latin zoological word zoetic, meaning 'pertaining to life'.[4]
In 2011, Zoetis Inc.'s revenues exceeded $4.2 billion and $4.34 billion in 2012.[11][4] The animal health industry worldwide is an estimated US$22 billion dollar industry.[4]
On 22 May 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer plans to sell its majority stake in the company.[11] According to the report, shareholders will have the option to swap their Pfizer shares for Zoetis shares.[11] The sell off of Zoetis is consistent with Pfizer's recent decision to shed other non-pharmaceuticals subsidiaries in an effort to save costs, raise capital, and pay off debt. The company has announced that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs & Co., and Morgan Stanley will be the lead underwriters.[11]
In November 2014, activist investor Bill Ackman disclosed that Pershing Square Capital Management had taken an 8.5% stake in the company, amassing approximately 41.8 million shares, causing the share price to hit its highest price since the IPO.[12] On 17 November, the company announced it would acquire a portfolio of pet drugs from Abbott Laboratories for approximately $255 million.[13]
In November 2015 the company announced it would acquire developer of aquaculture treatments and diseases, Pharmaq, for $765 million.[14]
2012: IPO[edit]
Records show that Pfizer officially filed for registration of a Class A stock with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on 10 August 2012.[8][15] Zoetis' IPO on 1 February 2013 sold 86.1 million shares for US$ 2.2 billion.[16] Shares sharply rose 19% by the end of the trading day to $35.01 a share, up from $26.[4] At the time, it was the largest IPO from a U.S. company since Facebook's $16 billion IPO on 18 May 2012.[6] Pfizer retained 414 million Class B shares giving it an 83% controlling stake in the firm.[1] Stock investors were attracted to the steep profit margin in proportion to revenue and consumer confidence in potential future growth of the subsidiary.[4] The offering's lead underwriters were JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.[16] Most of the money raised through the IPO was used to pay off existing Pfizer debt.[4]
Products[edit]
Twenty eight sites in 11 countries make up Zoetis manufacturing network, each facility designed to meet chemical and infectious agent safety regulatory requirements. Many R&D operations are co-located with manufacturing sites, a collaboration that allows to bring new products to market faster. Zoetis builds on six-decade Pfizer history and aims for high tech innovative manufacturing technologies. Zoetis products include:[17]

History[edit]
1950s to 2000s[edit]




Zoetis building in Exton, PA


In the 1950s, Pfizer began research on several drugs including Oxytetracycline.[8] John McKeen, a chemical engineer with Pfizer products, discovered its effective use in livestock. In 1952, the Pfizer Agriculture Division opened a 732-acre research and development facility in Terre Haute, Indiana called Vigo.[8][9] By 1988 the division was renamed Pfizer Animal Health.[8]
The acquisition of GlaxoSmithKline’s Norden Laboratories in 1995 boosted Pfizer's animal health division into small animal care including domestic pets.[8] Secondary research and development centres were opened in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 2003.[8] In the same year, Pfizer acquired Pharmacia Corporation for US$ 60 billion in stock options.[10] Between 2007 and 2011 the company acquired Embrex Inc, Catapult Genetics, Bovigen, Wyeth, Fort Dodge Animal Health, Vetnex Animal Health Ltd, Synbiotics Corporation, Microtek, King Pharmaceuticals, and Alpharma.[8] These acquisitions greatly increased Pfizer's market, range of products, countries it operated in, and resources.
2010s to present[edit]
Plans to break away Pfizer Animal Health into a separate company were officially announced in 2012.[4] The name chosen, Zoetis, roughly translates from the derived Latin zoological word zoetic, meaning 'pertaining to life'.[4]
In 2011, Zoetis Inc.'s revenues exceeded $4.2 billion and $4.34 billion in 2012.[11][4] The animal health industry worldwide is an estimated US$22 billion dollar industry.[4]
On 22 May 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer plans to sell its majority stake in the company.[11] According to the report, shareholders will have the option to swap their Pfizer shares for Zoetis shares.[11] The sell off of Zoetis is consistent with Pfizer's recent decision to shed other non-pharmaceuticals subsidiaries in an effort to save costs, raise capital, and pay off debt. The company has announced that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs & Co., and Morgan Stanley will be the lead underwriters.[11]
In November 2014, activist investor Bill Ackman disclosed that Pershing Square Capital Management had taken an 8.5% stake in the company, amassing approximately 41.8 million shares, causing the share price to hit its highest price since the IPO.[12] On 17 November, the company announced it would acquire a portfolio of pet drugs from Abbott Laboratories for approximately $255 million.[13]
In November 2015 the company announced it would acquire developer of aquaculture treatments and diseases, Pharmaq, for $765 million.[14]
2012: IPO[edit]
Records show that Pfizer officially filed for registration of a Class A stock with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on 10 August 2012.[8][15] Zoetis' IPO on 1 February 2013 sold 86.1 million shares for US$ 2.2 billion.[16] Shares sharply rose 19% by the end of the trading day to $35.01 a share, up from $26.[4] At the time, it was the largest IPO from a U.S. company since Facebook's $16 billion IPO on 18 May 2012.[6] Pfizer retained 414 million Class B shares giving it an 83% controlling stake in the firm.[1] Stock investors were attracted to the steep profit margin in proportion to revenue and consumer confidence in potential future growth of the subsidiary.[4] The offering's lead underwriters were JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.[16] Most of the money raised through the IPO was used to pay off existing Pfizer debt.[4]
Products[edit]
Twenty eight sites in 11 countries make up Zoetis manufacturing network, each facility designed to meet chemical and infectious agent safety regulatory requirements. Many R&D operations are co-located with manufacturing sites, a collaboration that allows to bring new products to market faster. Zoetis builds on six-decade Pfizer history and aims for high tech innovative manufacturing technologies. Zoetis products include:[17]

 June 14, 2017 Zoetis Joins Bac Vactory Collaboration to Develop Vaccines Against Diseases Caused by Bacterial Pathogens 











Zoetis, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of public and private partners spanning animal and human health, announced the start of a program named “Bac Vactory,” to pave the way for development of a new generation of vaccines to help control bacterial infections that pose a significant threat to animals and people. The announcement took place on May 31, 2017 at the annual Immuno Valley conference in Utrecht, The Netherlands.
One Health Approach
During the next five years, the Bac Vactory program will examine bacteria that are closely related and cause diseases in humans and animals, in order to develop innovative, safe and efficacious vaccines.  Combining knowledge from human and veterinary medicine will allow for an integrated approach.  
“Through our participation in the Bac Vactory collaboration, we affirm our commitment to develop new animal vaccines to help our veterinarian and livestock farmer customers prevent diseases caused by ever-evolving bacterial pathogens,” said Dr. Scott Brown, Vice President, External Innovation, Research and Development at Zoetis.  “Collaboration among scientists in veterinary and human health in a true ‘One Health’ approach and across academic institutions and the life sciences industry offers opportunities for Zoetis and its research partners to bring innovative vaccines for animals and people to market  more quickly.”
He added that the project is part of a broader emphasis in research and development at Zoetis in solutions to prevent disease and, in turn, reduce the incidence of infectious disease and the need to treat it with anti-infective medicines. 
Zoetis has the first rights to the results from the collaboration in the area of prevention or treatment of diseases or infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, in particular Streptococci, in the field of animal health. 
World-class Research Partners
The Bac Vactory programme partners include academic institutions Utrecht University, VU Amsterdam, VU Medical Centre, Eindhoven University of Technology, and Radboud University Medical Centre as well as corporate partners Zoetis, Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, Abera Biosciences, GlaxoSmithKline, Pulike Biological Engineering Inc., and Immuno Valley.
Funding for the new Bac Vactory collaboration comes from a Perspective Programme grant of two million euros by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) Domain Applied and Engineering Sciences.  Zoetis and its industry partners will cumulatively contribute direct financing and in-kind support over five years valued at an additional one million euros.

 May 8, 2017 Zoetis Named One of America’s Best Midsize Employers 










For the second consecutive year, Zoetis has been named one of America’s Best Midsize Employers by Forbes Magazine. Zoetis is the only midsize company focused on animal health to make the list.
“Zoetis is honored to once again be named one of America’s Best Employers by Forbes Magazine,” said Roxanne Lagano, Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. “We have created a distinct culture at Zoetis grounded in our Core Beliefs – a culture in which integrity, accountability, collaboration and customer focus are hallmarks of success. This culture has contributed to the growth of our company, and we are very proud and appreciative that our colleagues and others recommend Zoetis as a great place to work.” 
Forbes determined its America’s Best Employers list based on an independent survey among a sample of 30,000 American employees working for large and mid-size companies and institutions. The willingness to recommend one's own employer was used as the most important factor in the assessment. The employees were consulted anonymously through online access panels which allowed them to express their opinions. Visit Forbes.com to see the entire list of America’s Best Employers for 2017.

 April 18, 2017 A Closer Look at How Zoetis Promotes the Veterinary Profession










In the second article in a series on Our Six Social Responsibilities, we look at examples of how Zoetis promotes the veterinary profession.
Veterinary professionals are key customers for Zoetis around the world and play a critically important role in society as stewards of animal and public health. Zoetis is proud of our six-decade partnership with practicing professionals, students, organizations, and collaborations. Together, we help advance veterinary education, research and career development, and help elevate the profession in emerging markets.
Supporting the next generation of veterinary professionals
Zoetis and the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges announced the 315 winners of the 2017 Zoetis Veterinary Student Scholarship Program in March.  The program, which awards annual scholarships to second and third-year U.S. and Caribbean veterinary students to help offset the cost of education, is in its eighth year. Since 2010, nearly $6 million in scholarship funding has been awarded to more than 2,700 exceptional veterinary students.
The scholarships help veterinary students offset the costs of tuition, where they average veterinary student leaves school with more than $152,000 in debt1.
Zoetis is also actively involved in supporting students outside of the U.S. by providing scholarships through the Chinese Veterinary Medical Association and academic mobility funding through the African Small Companion Animal Network (AFSCAN).
Zoetis Commitment to VeterinariansTM
In the U.S., Zoetis continues to expand the Commitment to Veterinarians (C2V) program that supports current and future professionals in the industry.
“Commitment to Veterinarians is the platform where we connect with veterinary professionals as a trusted partner and support them through the unique challenges they face every day,” said Dr. Christine Jenkins, Chief U.S. Veterinary Medical Officer at Zoetis. “We intentionally focus our C2V content on unbranded, non-product related topics to help drive real conversations and advice for those who raise and care for animals.”
Veterinarians and industry professionals can engage with the C2V program online and through social media, where helpful tips, resources, and industry inspiration are shared on a regular basis.
Improving veterinary standards worldwide
Zoetis plays an important role in the long-term growth and success of the veterinary profession in geographies where it is established, and places where it is still emerging. In Africa, Zoetis is the co-founder of the African Small Companion Animal Network (AFSCAN) with the World Small Animal Veterinary Association Foundation (WSAVAF). AFSCAN’s focus is to advance the standards of small animal veterinary care across Africa.
Since the establishment of the organization in 2014, AFSCAN Ambassadors and Zoetis colleagues have been working together to create a sustainable network of companion animal veterinarians in Africa. Past initiatives have included the founding of many regional veterinary associations, creating a distance learning education program, and initiating academic funding and research programs relevant to small animals in the African continent.
In 2017, Zoetis is continuing to support new and existing AFSCAN initiatives under the leadership of Dr. Gabriel Varga, Regional Director, Sub-Saharan Africa at Zoetis.
“Africa is the world’s second largest continent, home to some of the world’s fastest growing countries that are unfortunately plagued by many dangerous diseases,” said Dr. Varga. “We’ve made tremendous progress advancing veterinary standards in the continent with AFSCAN over the past three years and continue to identify more opportunities to train and support small animal veterinarians in the region.”

 April 18, 2017 A Closer Look at How Zoetis Promotes the Veterinary Profession










In the second article in a series on Our Six Social Responsibilities, we look at examples of how Zoetis promotes the veterinary profession.
Veterinary professionals are key customers for Zoetis around the world and play a critically important role in society as stewards of animal and public health. Zoetis is proud of our six-decade partnership with practicing professionals, students, organizations, and collaborations. Together, we help advance veterinary education, research and career development, and help elevate the profession in emerging markets.
Supporting the next generation of veterinary professionals
Zoetis and the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges announced the 315 winners of the 2017 Zoetis Veterinary Student Scholarship Program in March.  The program, which awards annual scholarships to second and third-year U.S. and Caribbean veterinary students to help offset the cost of education, is in its eighth year. Since 2010, nearly $6 million in scholarship funding has been awarded to more than 2,700 exceptional veterinary students.
The scholarships help veterinary students offset the costs of tuition, where they average veterinary student leaves school with more than $152,000 in debt1.
Zoetis is also actively involved in supporting students outside of the U.S. by providing scholarships through the Chinese Veterinary Medical Association and academic mobility funding through the African Small Companion Animal Network (AFSCAN).
Zoetis Commitment to VeterinariansTM
In the U.S., Zoetis continues to expand the Commitment to Veterinarians (C2V) program that supports current and future professionals in the industry.
“Commitment to Veterinarians is the platform where we connect with veterinary professionals as a trusted partner and support them through the unique challenges they face every day,” said Dr. Christine Jenkins, Chief U.S. Veterinary Medical Officer at Zoetis. “We intentionally focus our C2V content on unbranded, non-product related topics to help drive real conversations and advice for those who raise and care for animals.”
Veterinarians and industry professionals can engage with the C2V program online and through social media, where helpful tips, resources, and industry inspiration are shared on a regular basis.
Improving veterinary standards worldwide
Zoetis plays an important role in the long-term growth and success of the veterinary profession in geographies where it is established, and places where it is still emerging. In Africa, Zoetis is the co-founder of the African Small Companion Animal Network (AFSCAN) with the World Small Animal Veterinary Association Foundation (WSAVAF). AFSCAN’s focus is to advance the standards of small animal veterinary care across Africa.
Since the establishment of the organization in 2014, AFSCAN Ambassadors and Zoetis colleagues have been working together to create a sustainable network of companion animal veterinarians in Africa. Past initiatives have included the founding of many regional veterinary associations, creating a distance learning education program, and initiating academic funding and research programs relevant to small animals in the African continent.
In 2017, Zoetis is continuing to support new and existing AFSCAN initiatives under the leadership of Dr. Gabriel Varga, Regional Director, Sub-Saharan Africa at Zoetis.
“Africa is the world’s second largest continent, home to some of the world’s fastest growing countries that are unfortunately plagued by many dangerous diseases,” said Dr. Varga. “We’ve made tremendous progress advancing veterinary standards in the continent with AFSCAN over the past three years and continue to identify more opportunities to train and support small animal veterinarians in the region.”

Animal Health




Animal health affects billions of people worldwide. This growing industry sits at the intersection of two important and well-established areas that affect the lives of people everywhere – livestock production and companion animal care. There is a strong and direct connection between healthy animals and healthy people.











  Companion Animal Health Keeping dogs, cats and horses healthy is a top concern among caregivers everywhere.     








  Farm Animal Health The world will need to double food production to feed a global population estimated to be 9.1 billion. That means producing more food with fewer resources.     








     Growing Industry The animal health industry includes all products and services, other than livestock feed and pet food, that promote livestock productivity and health and companion animal health.  
     What We Stand For At Zoetis, our work is guided by a simple vision – that our products, services and people will be the most valued by animal health customers around the world.

 June 14, 2017 Zoetis Joins Bac Vactory Collaboration to Develop Vaccines Against Diseases Caused by Bacterial Pathogens 











Zoetis, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of public and private partners spanning animal and human health, announced the start of a program named “Bac Vactory,” to pave the way for development of a new generation of vaccines to help control bacterial infections that pose a significant threat to animals and people. The announcement took place on May 31, 2017 at the annual Immuno Valley conference in Utrecht, The Netherlands.
One Health Approach
During the next five years, the Bac Vactory program will examine bacteria that are closely related and cause diseases in humans and animals, in order to develop innovative, safe and efficacious vaccines.  Combining knowledge from human and veterinary medicine will allow for an integrated approach.  
“Through our participation in the Bac Vactory collaboration, we affirm our commitment to develop new animal vaccines to help our veterinarian and livestock farmer customers prevent diseases caused by ever-evolving bacterial pathogens,” said Dr. Scott Brown, Vice President, External Innovation, Research and Development at Zoetis.  “Collaboration among scientists in veterinary and human health in a true ‘One Health’ approach and across academic institutions and the life sciences industry offers opportunities for Zoetis and its research partners to bring innovative vaccines for animals and people to market  more quickly.”
He added that the project is part of a broader emphasis in research and development at Zoetis in solutions to prevent disease and, in turn, reduce the incidence of infectious disease and the need to treat it with anti-infective medicines. 
Zoetis has the first rights to the results from the collaboration in the area of prevention or treatment of diseases or infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, in particular Streptococci, in the field of animal health. 
World-class Research Partners
The Bac Vactory programme partners include academic institutions Utrecht University, VU Amsterdam, VU Medical Centre, Eindhoven University of Technology, and Radboud University Medical Centre as well as corporate partners Zoetis, Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, Abera Biosciences, GlaxoSmithKline, Pulike Biological Engineering Inc., and Immuno Valley.
Funding for the new Bac Vactory collaboration comes from a Perspective Programme grant of two million euros by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) Domain Applied and Engineering Sciences.  Zoetis and its industry partners will cumulatively contribute direct financing and in-kind support over five years valued at an additional one million euros.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

 May 8, 2017 Zoetis Named One of America’s Best Midsize Employers 










For the second consecutive year, Zoetis has been named one of America’s Best Midsize Employers by Forbes Magazine. Zoetis is the only midsize company focused on animal health to make the list.
“Zoetis is honored to once again be named one of America’s Best Employers by Forbes Magazine,” said Roxanne Lagano, Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. “We have created a distinct culture at Zoetis grounded in our Core Beliefs – a culture in which integrity, accountability, collaboration and customer focus are hallmarks of success. This culture has contributed to the growth of our company, and we are very proud and appreciative that our colleagues and others recommend Zoetis as a great place to work.” 
Forbes determined its America’s Best Employers list based on an independent survey among a sample of 30,000 American employees working for large and mid-size companies and institutions. The willingness to recommend one's own employer was used as the most important factor in the assessment. The employees were consulted anonymously through online access panels which allowed them to express their opinions. Visit Forbes.com to see the entire list of America’s Best Employers for 2017.
Our Colleagues Make the Difference
We asked our colleagues why they think Zoetis is a great place to work, here’s what they had to say:

“The passionate people, world-class facilities, and interesting projects make Zoetis a Best Employer. I am fortunate to work in a talent-rich environment designed for collaboration, which is endemic in our culture and essential to our success.”             -Joe, Kalamazoo, MI
“I believe the culture in Zoetis to ‘run it like you own it’ empowers colleagues to take ownership and to constantly strive to improve and contribute, while at the same time being fully supported and rewarded by the company.”                -Helen, Ireland
“Working in Zoetis you have a unique opportunity to learn and to grow in all meanings, from knowledge to practice. It is the BEST place to work and continuously ‘upgrade’ yourself.”               -Kristina, Russia
“As a veterinarian, I feel proud to work in a company that provides the best products and services to enhance the quality of life for animals and pet owners. Zoetis offers opportunities to grow and promotes career development through different initiatives such as talent programs, mentoring and coaching.”               -Simone, Brazil 


Award-Winning Work Environment
Zoetis has been recognized for creating a collaborative culture where every colleague feels a sense of ownership and can achieve a fulfilling work-life balance. The company has been named among the Top Companies for Working Mothers by Working Mother Magazine for the past three years. More information about company awards and recognitions can be found here.
