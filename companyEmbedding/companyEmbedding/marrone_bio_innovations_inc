Davis biotech company Marrone Bio Innovations Inc. on Monday announced it has shipped its first products to Africa.
The company, which makes biologically-based pesticides and fertilizers, shipped its biofungicide Reysana to Morocco for use by growers on tomatoes, grapes and gourds, according to Pam Marrone, CEO of Marrone Bio Innovations (Nasdaq: MBII).

Marrone Bio stock rose 8 cents, or 7.3 percent, to $1.17 on Monday after the announcement was made.
Marrone told the Business Journal that selling in Africa offers a new opportunity to diversify the company's business and expand its revenue base, adding that the company has plans to sell in other countries there.





Marrone Bio Innovations is already licensed to sell its Regalia biofungicide for use on grapes in South Africa, and has submitted registration for some other crops there as well, Marrone said.
Marrone did not have a timeline for when the company will begin shipping products to South Africa.
The company is currently working with distributors on field trials and regulatory submissions in Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya and Burkina Faso.
Marrone Bio Innovations' products are now sold in 12 countries worldwide.
Tomatoes are the largest vegetable crop grown in Morocco and a crop for which Reysana has proved effective against a broad range of diseases, Marrone Bio Innovations said in a news release.
The Moroccan crop protection market is valued at about $130 million to $135 million, and fungicides are 36 percent of pesticides sold, the release said.

Reysana™ Biofungicide to Provide Effective Disease Control With No Residues in Key Agricultural Markets of Morocco

DAVIS, Calif., July  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marrone Bio Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ:MBII) (MBI), a leading provider of bio-based pest management and plant health products for agriculture, turf, ornamental and water treatment markets, has shipped its first product to the African continent.
MBI shipped its biofungicide, REYSANA™, to Morocco for use by growers on tomatoes, grapes and cucurbits. Reysana contains the same ingredients as Regalia® Biofungicide, which is marketed and sold in more than 10 countries worldwide.  
"Our first shipments into the African continent marks a significant milestone for our company," said Pam Marrone, Marrone Bio Innovation's Chief Executive Officer. "Biologically-based Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is becoming a necessity for agricultural exporters in Morocco and other regions around the world. Specifically, biopesticides are increasingly being integrated into this new strategy to ensure ease of access to European and other markets with strict pesticide residue standards. In addition, consumer purchasing preferences demonstrate a growing trend towards food production safety and sustainability. We look forward to our continued expansion into Africa and other areas of the world with a wide range of unmet pest and disease challenges." 
Morocco currently has a free trade agreement with the United States. Agriculture represents about 15% of GDP, and agricultural trade is the largest contributor to GDP growth for Morocco, with exports of $2.4 billion.1 60% of Morocco's ag exports are to the EU and 27% to the United States.1  The Moroccan Government is keen to upgrade its agricultural sector under the "Plan Maroc Vert," with increased investments in green, innovative technologies to support the upgrade of small and medium producers.2  The European Investment Bank recently agreed to lend EUR 42.5 million for irrigation and agriculture in support of the Plan Maroc Vert.3
The drivers behind the rapid adoption of biologicals are globally recognized and include evidence of increased yields and crop quality when biologicals are used either by themselves or integrated into programs. Biologicals are also a key driver behind the reduction or elimination of synthetic pesticide residues on crops for export markets and to delay of pest and plant pathogen resistance to chemicals. Concerns about ensuring the safety for farm workers and pollinators, as well as less environmental pollution overall, are also important factors in the rapid growth in adoption of biopesticides and biostimulants worldwide.
Tomatoes are the largest vegetable crop grown in Morocco and a crop for which Reysana has consistently demonstrated efficacy against a broad range of diseases. The Moroccan crop protection market is valued at approximately $130-135 million, and fungicides are 36% of pesticides sold, with powdery and downy mildews the predominant diseases.4

(NASDAQ:MBII) strives to lead the movement to a more sustainable world through the discovery, development and promotion of biological products for pest management and plant health.

July 24--Davis biotech firm Marrone Bio Innovations Inc. said Monday that it has shipped its first product to the African continent.
MBI said it has shipped its biofungicide, Reysana, to Morocco for use by growers of tomatoes, grapes and cucurbits, a diverse plant of the gourd family.
The Northern California company said Reysana contains the same ingredients as its Regalia biofungicide, which is sold in nearly a dozen countries worldwide. Regalia is used to control a wide variety of bacterial and fungal diseases.
One of Marrone's stated goals is increased marketing and distribution of its products abroad.
In May this year, MBI announced an agreement to market and distribute two of its bioinsecticides in Mexico, a key market for agricultural products consumed by Americans.
Mexico is a major producer and exporter of fruits and vegetables, with exports to the United States alone totaling $19.3 billion from 2013 to 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture'sEconomic Research Service.
"Our first shipments into the African continent marks a significant milestone for our company,"said Pam Marrone, MBI's CEO and founder. "Biologically-based integrated pest management is becoming a necessity for agricultural exporters in Morocco and other regions around the world."
Morocco currently has a free trade agreement with the United States. MBI said agriculture represents about 15 percent of the North African nation's gross domestic product, with annual exports valued at $2.4 billion. MBI said 27 percent of Morocco's ag exports are to the United States.

Marrone Bio Innovations, Inc. Products Show Impressive Results in International Trials Against Key Pests and Diseases




















July 10, 2017 08:30 ET

 | Source: Marrone Bio Innovations






DAVIS, Calif., July  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marrone Bio Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ:MBII), (MBI) a leading provider of bio-based pest management and plant health products for agriculture, turf and ornamental and water treatment markets, has reported excellent product efficacy results in fast growing international markets with intense pest and plant disease problems. The drivers beind the rapid adoption of biologicals are globally recognized and include evidence of increased yields and crop quality when biologicals are integrated into programs. Biologicals are also a key driver behind the reduction or elimination of synthetic pesticide residues on crops for export markets, delay of pest and plant pathogen resistance to chemicals, safety for workers and pollinators, and less environmental pollution. In South Africa, Grandevo® and Venerate® Bioinsecticides have generated positive trial results in citrus - a key agricultural market. MBI products reduced citrus rust mite populations more than 96% and offered fruit a comparable level of protection as commonly used chemical products. Both Grandevo and Venerate provided effective control of citrus fruit damage caused by false codling moth. This pest bores into the citrus fruit, making them unmarketable. South Africa is Africa’s largest exporter of agricultural products and exports more than 1.6 million metric tons of citrus annually, with most fruit being shipped to the EU and Asia where limits on chemical residues are strictly enforced1. South African growers are increasing their use of biologicals to meet the demands for residue-free food from local and international markets, and in response to the EU’s ban on controversial neonicotinoid insecticides. In Latin America, field trials with MBI products have demonstrated efficacy in addressing serious, key crop problems. For example, the addition of Regalia® Biofungicide enhanced existing industry programs for controlling coffee rust. Venerate Bioinsecticide, used in integrated pest management (IPM) programs for managing the dreaded coffee berry borer or “Broca,” successfully reduced the number of organophosphate insecticide applications, including that of the controversial chlorpyrifos, by 50 percent.  The program with Venerate reduced boring damage by almost 70%, which was 40 percent more effective than the chemical-only program.  Broca can cause coffee farmers to lose up to 20 percent of a crop and reduce the crop’s marketable price by 30 to 40 percent2. Coffee rust causes $1 billion in damage to coffee plants across Latin America and the Caribbean.3 Majestene® Bionematicide reduced the most important pest nematodes of bananas (burrowing nematodes) as well as or better than the organophosphate, chlorpyrifos. The burrowing nematode destroys the roots of bananas and plantains so that the plants are starved of water, nutrients, and lack support, causing 30-60% yield loss4. The use of Majestene to control nematodes would be a major step forward in reducing exposure risks to pesticide applicators as well. In Mexico, both Grandevo and Venerate bioinsecticides have demonstrated effective and reliable control of the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), a serious pest that transmits HLB disease. The Asian citrus psyllid has devastated Florida groves and has been recently found in California. Field trial data supporting the use of these two MBI-developed bioinsecticides to control Asian citrus psyllid is now being submitted to support label amendments, adding ACP control to existing Grandevo and Venerate registrations and labels in Mexico. In Asia, Regalia is advancing in banana trials in the Philippines, showing good activity against the most serious disease this crop faces globally, black sigatoka. In previous trials in Costa Rica, Regalia combined with the standard chemical program increased banana girth by 27% compared to the standard chemical program alone.  Convential sprays for this disease are 15-20% of the cost of bananas ($1000/hectare, 25-40 sprays per season).5 In Vietnam, MBI’s distribution partner has completed initial trials with Regalia showing a 20% increase in rice yields, and a concurrent reduction in discolored and unfilled grain caused by rice neck blast disease. Also, in citrus trials in Vietnam, Regalia decreased bacterial canker by more than 70%. In insecticide trials, Grandevo performed under intense pest pressure, reducing pest populations for control of red mites, thrips and mealybugs on strawberry, pumpkin, custard apple, orange and dragon fruit.

Marrone Bio Innovations, Inc. Products Show Impressive Results in International Trials Against Key Pests and Diseases
BY GlobeNewswire— 8:30 AM ET 07/10/2017


DAVIS, Calif., July  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marrone Bio Innovations, Inc. (MBII) , (MBI) a leading provider of bio-based pest management and plant health products for agriculture, turf and ornamental and water treatment markets, has reported excellent product efficacy results in fast growing international markets with intense pest and plant disease problems.
The drivers beind the rapid adoption of biologicals are globally recognized and include evidence of increased yields and crop quality when biologicals are integrated into programs. Biologicals are also a key driver behind the reduction or elimination of synthetic pesticide residues on crops for export markets, delay of pest and plant pathogen resistance to chemicals, safety for workers and pollinators, and less environmental pollution. In South Africa, Grandevo® and Venerate® Bioinsecticides have generated positive trial results in citrus - a key agricultural market. MBI products reduced citrus rust mite populations more than 96% and offered fruit a comparable level of protection as commonly used chemical products. Both Grandevo and Venerate provided effective control of citrus fruit damage caused by false codling moth. This pest bores into the citrus fruit, making them unmarketable. South Africa is Africa’s largest exporter of agricultural products and exports more than 1.6 million metric tons of citrus annually, with most fruit being shipped to the EU and Asia where limits on chemical residues are strictly enforced1. South African growers are increasing their use of biologicals to meet the demands for residue-free food from local and international markets, and in response to the EU’s ban on controversial neonicotinoid insecticides. In Latin America, field trials with MBI products have demonstrated efficacy in addressing serious, key crop problems. For example, the addition of Regalia® Biofungicide enhanced existing industry programs for controlling coffee rust. Venerate Bioinsecticide, used in integrated pest management (IPM) programs for managing the dreaded coffee berry borer or “Broca,” successfully reduced the number of organophosphate insecticide applications, including that of the controversial chlorpyrifos, by 50 percent.  The program with Venerate reduced boring damage by almost 70%, which was 40 percent more effective than the chemical-only program.  Broca can cause coffee farmers to lose up to 20 percent of a crop and reduce the crop’s marketable price by 30 to 40 percent2. Coffee rust causes $1 billion in damage to coffee plants across Latin America and the Caribbean.3 Majestene® Bionematicide reduced the most important pest nematodes of bananas (burrowing nematodes) as well as or better than the organophosphate, chlorpyrifos. The burrowing nematode destroys the roots of bananas and plantains so that the plants are starved of water, nutrients, and lack support, causing 30-60% yield loss4. The use of Majestene to control nematodes would be a major step forward in reducing exposure risks to pesticide applicators as well. In Mexico, both Grandevo and Venerate bioinsecticides have demonstrated effective and reliable control of the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), a serious pest that transmits HLB disease. The Asian citrus psyllid has devastated Florida groves and has been recently found in California. Field trial data supporting the use of these two MBI-developed bioinsecticides to control Asian citrus psyllid is now being submitted to support label amendments, adding ACP control to existing Grandevo and Venerate registrations and labels in Mexico. In Asia, Regalia is advancing in banana trials in the Philippines, showing good activity against the most serious disease this crop faces globally, black sigatoka. In previous trials in Costa Rica, Regalia combined with the standard chemical program increased banana girth by 27% compared to the standard chemical program alone.  Convential sprays for this disease are 15-20% of the cost of bananas ($1000/hectare, 25-40 sprays per season).5 In Vietnam, MBI’s distribution partner has completed initial trials with Regalia showing a 20% increase in rice yields, and a concurrent reduction in discolored and unfilled grain caused by rice neck blast disease. Also, in citrus trials in Vietnam, Regalia decreased bacterial canker by more than 70%. In insecticide trials, Grandevo performed under intense pest pressure, reducing pest populations for control of red mites, thrips and mealybugs on strawberry, pumpkin, custard apple, orange and dragon fruit.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Davis biotech company Marrone Bio Innovations Inc. on Monday announced it has shipped its first products to Africa.
The company, which makes biologically-based pesticides and fertilizers, shipped its biofungicide Reysana to Morocco for use by growers on tomatoes, grapes and gourds, according to Pam Marrone, CEO of Marrone Bio Innovations (Nasdaq: MBII).

Dennis McCoy | Sacramento Business Journal










 


Marrone Bio stock rose 8 cents, or 7.3 percent, to $1.17 on Monday after the announcement was made.
Marrone told the Business Journal that selling in Africa offers a new opportunity to diversify the company's business and expand its revenue base, adding that the company has plans to sell in other countries there.





Marrone Bio Innovations is already licensed to sell its Regalia biofungicide for use on grapes in South Africa, and has submitted registration for some other crops there as well, Marrone said.
Marrone did not have a timeline for when the company will begin shipping products to South Africa.
The company is currently working with distributors on field trials and regulatory submissions in Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya and Burkina Faso.
Marrone Bio Innovations' products are now sold in 12 countries worldwide.
Tomatoes are the largest vegetable crop grown in Morocco and a crop for which Reysana has proved effective against a broad range of diseases, Marrone Bio Innovations said in a news release.
The Moroccan crop protection market is valued at about $130 million to $135 million, and fungicides are 36 percent of pesticides sold, the release said.

Victor Patton covers technology and health care.

Reysana™ Biofungicide to Provide Effective Disease Control With No Residues in Key Agricultural Markets of Morocco

DAVIS, Calif., July  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marrone Bio Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ:MBII) (MBI), a leading provider of bio-based pest management and plant health products for agriculture, turf, ornamental and water treatment markets, has shipped its first product to the African continent.
MBI shipped its biofungicide, REYSANA™, to Morocco for use by growers on tomatoes, grapes and cucurbits. Reysana contains the same ingredients as Regalia® Biofungicide, which is marketed and sold in more than 10 countries worldwide.  
"Our first shipments into the African continent marks a significant milestone for our company," said Pam Marrone, Marrone Bio Innovation's Chief Executive Officer. "Biologically-based Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is becoming a necessity for agricultural exporters in Morocco and other regions around the world. Specifically, biopesticides are increasingly being integrated into this new strategy to ensure ease of access to European and other markets with strict pesticide residue standards. In addition, consumer purchasing preferences demonstrate a growing trend towards food production safety and sustainability. We look forward to our continued expansion into Africa and other areas of the world with a wide range of unmet pest and disease challenges." 
Morocco currently has a free trade agreement with the United States. Agriculture represents about 15% of GDP, and agricultural trade is the largest contributor to GDP growth for Morocco, with exports of $2.4 billion.1 60% of Morocco's ag exports are to the EU and 27% to the United States.1  The Moroccan Government is keen to upgrade its agricultural sector under the "Plan Maroc Vert," with increased investments in green, innovative technologies to support the upgrade of small and medium producers.2  The European Investment Bank recently agreed to lend EUR 42.5 million for irrigation and agriculture in support of the Plan Maroc Vert.3
The drivers behind the rapid adoption of biologicals are globally recognized and include evidence of increased yields and crop quality when biologicals are used either by themselves or integrated into programs. Biologicals are also a key driver behind the reduction or elimination of synthetic pesticide residues on crops for export markets and to delay of pest and plant pathogen resistance to chemicals. Concerns about ensuring the safety for farm workers and pollinators, as well as less environmental pollution overall, are also important factors in the rapid growth in adoption of biopesticides and biostimulants worldwide.
Tomatoes are the largest vegetable crop grown in Morocco and a crop for which Reysana has consistently demonstrated efficacy against a broad range of diseases. The Moroccan crop protection market is valued at approximately $130-135 million, and fungicides are 36% of pesticides sold, with powdery and downy mildews the predominant diseases.4
About Marrone Bio InnovationsSmart. Natural. Solutions.Marrone Bio Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ:MBII) strives to lead the movement to a more sustainable world through the discovery, development and promotion of biological products for pest management and plant health. MBI's effective and environmentally responsible pest management solutions help customers operate more sustainably while uniquely improving plant health and increasing crop yields.
