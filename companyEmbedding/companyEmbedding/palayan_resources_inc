This Prospectus relates to our common stock shares that will be offered on a 
continuous basis by the Selling Security Holders beginning immediately after 
the registration statement effective date, which is included in this 
Prospectus, and may continue for a period in excess of thirty (30) days from 
this effective date. We are completing this registration statement to allow 
the Selling Security Holders to sell their shares. The Selling Security Holders 
will receive all proceeds from this offering and, if all of the shares being 
offered by this Prospectus are sold at $0.002 per share, those proceeds would 
be $30,000. We, the issuer, will not acquire any of the proceeds from the 
common stock sale by the Selling Security Holders in this offering. Our company 
will pay all expenses of this offering estimated at $24,500.


The mineral exploration industry is highly competitive. We are a new and 
pre-exploration stage company and have a weak competitive position in the 
industry. We compete with junior and senior mineral exploration companies, 
independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are 
actively seeking to acquire mineral exploration properties throughout the world 
together with the equipment, labor and materials required to operate on those 
properties. Competition for the acquisition of mineral exploration interests 
is intense with many mineral exploration leases or concessions available in a 
competitive bidding process in which we may lack the technological information 
or expertise available to other bidders.

Many of the mineral exploration companies with which we compete for financing 
and for the acquisition of mineral exploration properties have greater 
financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, 
these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring mineral 
exploration interests of merit or on exploring or developing their mineral 
exploration properties. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire 
mineral exploration properties of greater quality and interest to prospective 
investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and 
development. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the 
financing necessary for us to acquire further mineral exploration interests or 
explore and develop our current or future mineral exploration properties.

We also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies for financing 
from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in such 
companies. The presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies may 
impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our acquisition 
or exploration programs if investors perceive that investments in our 
competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their mineral exploration 
properties or the price of the investment opportunity. In addition, we compete 
with both junior and senior mineral exploration companies for available 
resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists, land 
specialists, engineers, camp staff, helicopters, float planes, mineral 
exploration supplies and drill rigs.

General competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms 
of energy legislation and/or regulation introduced from time to time by the 
governments of the Republic of the Philippines, the United States and other 
countries, as well as factors beyond our control, including international 
political conditions, overall levels of supply and demand for mineral 
exploration.

In the face of competition, we may not be successful in acquiring, exploring 
or developing profitable gold or mineral properties or interests, and we cannot 
give any assurance that suitable gold or mineral properties or interests will 
be available for our acquisition, exploration or development. Despite this, we 
hope to compete successfully in the gold or mineral industry by:

. keeping our costs low; 

. relying on the strength of our management’s contacts; and 

. using our size and experience to our advantage by adapting quickly to 
  changing market conditions or responding swiftly to potential opportunities.


Company Description
We are a start-up, exploration stage company. We have purchased a 100% interest 
in an 8 unit claim block (the “Palayan Gold Claim”) containing approximately 
82.7 hectares that is recorded with the Nueva Ecija provincial office of the 
Department of the Environment and Natural Resources (Mines and


 Geosciences) of 
the Republic of the Philippines. The Palayan Gold Claim was assigned to us on 
June 20, 2013 from Verdasco Enterprises for the sum of $5,000. However, we do 
not currently have the necessary funds to undertake exploration of this 
property and will need to raise capital in order to do so. If we cannot, we 
may have to go out of business. The proposed two phase exploration plan will 
cost approximately $19,326 (Approximately 840,327 Philippine Pesos (PHP). 
There has been no production to date. There are no full-time employees and 
management is able to spend only a small amount of time with respect to these 
affairs. Our company has no other assets.

We have no subsidiaries.
---

We were incorporated on July 26, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada. 
Our principal executive offices are located at 223 De La Cruz Road, Pasay, 
Metro Manila, Philippines. Our telephone number is (63)(914) 269 9345.

Palawan (Pron. /pəˈlɑːwɑːn/), officially the Province of Palawan (Cuyonon: Probinsya i'ang Palawan; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Palawan) is an archipelagic province of the Philippines that is located in the Mimaropa region. It is the largest province in the country in terms of total area of jurisdiction. Its capital is the City of Puerto Princesa, but it is governed independently from the province as a highly urbanized city.
The islands of Palawan stretch between Mindoro in the northeast and Borneo in the southwest. It lies between the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea. The province is named after its largest island, Palawan Island (09°30′N 118°30′E﻿ / ﻿9.500°N 118.500°E﻿ / 9.500; 118.500), measuring 450 kilometres (280 mi) long, and 50 kilometres (31 mi) wide.[9][10]

History[edit]
The early history of Palawan was determined by a team of researchers led by Dr. Robert B. Fox. They found evidence in the Tabon Caves that humans have lived in Palawan for more than 50,000 years. They also found human bone fragments, from an individual known as Tabon Man, in the municipality of Quezon, as well as tools and other artifacts. Although the origin of the cave dwellers is not yet established, anthropologists believe they may have come from Borneo. The Tabon Caves are now known as the Cradle of Philippine Civilization[9]
Ancient times[edit]
The Palawano and Tagbanwa, are believed to be direct descendants of Palawan's earliest settlers. They developed a non-formal form of government, an alphabet, and a system of trading with sea-borne merchants.[11]
Surviving ancient tribal artwork include reliefs of elephants, sharks, and fish found at Tabon Caves. Approximately 5,000 years ago, a culturally distinct period characterised by jar burials is evident. This era lasted till AD 500. Over 1500 jars and a mural depicting a burial procession were found.[citation needed]
A more recent wave of migrants arrived between 220 and 263 AD. This was during a period known as the Three Kingdoms. "Little, dark people" living in Anwei province in South China were driven South by Han People. Some settled in Thailand, others went farther south to Indonesia, Sumatra, Borneo. They were known as Aetas and Negritos from whom Palawan's Batak tribe descended.[12]
In AD 982, ancient Chinese traders regularly visited the islands.[12] A Chinese author referred to these islands as Kla-ma-yan (Calamian), Palau-ye (Palawan), and Paki-nung (Busuanga). Pottery, china and other artifacts recovered from caves and waters of Palawan attest to trade relations that existed between Chinese and Malay merchants.[11]
Classical period[edit]
In the 12th century, Malay immigrants arrived. Most of their settlements were ruled by Malay chieftains. These people grew rice, ginger, coconuts, sweet potatoes, sugarcane and bananas. They also raised pigs, goats and chickens. Most of their economic activities were fishing, farming, and hunting by the use of bamboo traps and blowguns. The local people had a dialect consisting of 18 syllables.[11] They were followed by the Indonesians of the Majapahit Empire in the 13th century, and they brought with them Buddhism and Hinduism.[13]
Surviving Buddhist images and sculptures are primarily in and near Tabon Cave.
Because of Palawan's proximity to Borneo, southern portions of the island were under the control of the Sultanate of Brunei for more than two centuries, and Islam was introduced. During the same period, trade relations flourished, and intermarriages among the natives and the Chinese, Japanese, Arab and Hindu. The inter-mixing of blood resulted to a distinct breed of Palaweños, both in physical stature and features.[11]
Spanish period[edit]




Taytay, the capital of Province of Calamianes in 1818 (Spanish Palawan)


After Ferdinand Magellan's death, remnants of his fleet landed in Palawan where the bounty of the land saved them from starvation. Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler named the place "Land of Promise."[12]
The northern Calamianes Islands were the first to come under Spanish authority, and were later declared a province separate from the Palawan mainland. In the early 17th century, Spanish friars sent out missions in Cuyo, Agutaya, Taytay and Cagayancillo but they met resistance from Moro communities. Before the 18th century, Spain began to build churches enclosed by garrisons for protection against Moro raids in the town of Cuyo, Taytay, Linapacan and Balabac. In 1749, the Sultanate of Brunei ceded southern Palawan to Spain.[11]
In 1818, the entire island of Palawan, or Paragua as it was called, was organized as a single province named Calamianes, with its capital in Taytay.[citation needed] By 1858, the province was divided into two provinces, namely, Castilla, covering the northern section with Taytay as capital and Asturias in the southern mainland with Puerto Princesa as capital. It was later divided into three districts, Calamianes, Paragua and Balabac, with Principe Alfonso town as its capital. and During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Cuyo became the second capital of Palawan from 1873 to 1903.
American rule[edit]
In 1902, after the Philippine-American War, the Americans established civil rule in northern Palawan, calling it the province of Paragua. In 1903, pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 1363, the province was reorganized to include the southern portions and renamed Palawan, and Puerto Princesa declared as its capital.[11]
Many reforms and projects were later introduced in the province. Construction of school buildings, promotion of agriculture, and bringing people closer to the government were among the priority plans during this era.[11]
Japanese invasion[edit]
Palawan Massacre[edit]




U. S. Army personnel toiled to identify the charred remains of Americans captured at Bataan and burned alive on Palawan. 20 March 1945


Main article: Palawan Massacre
During World War II, in order to prevent the rescue of prisoners of war by the advancing allies, on 14 December 1944, units of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army (under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita) herded the remaining 150 prisoners of war at Puerto Princesa into three covered trenches which were then set on fire using barrels of gasoline. Prisoners who tried to escape the flames were shot down.[14] Others attempted to escape by climbing over a cliff that ran along one side of the trenches, but were later hunted down and killed. Only 11 men escaped the slaughter and between 133 and 141 were killed.
The massacre is the basis for the recently published book Last Man Out: Glenn McDole, USMC, Survivor of the Palawan Massacre in World War II by Bob Wilbanks, and the opening scenes of the 2005 Miramax film, The Great Raid. A memorial has been erected on the site and McDole, in his eighties, was able to attend the dedication.[citation needed]
Liberation[edit]
During the first phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, just off the coast of Palawan, two United States Navy submarines, USS Dace (SS-247) and USS Darter (SS-227) attacked a Japanese cruiser task force led by Admiral Takeo Kurita, sinking his flagship (in which he survived) Atago, and her sister ship Maya. Darter later ran aground that afternoon and was scuttled by USS Nautilus (SS-168).
The island was liberated from the Japanese Imperial Forces by a task force consisting of Filipino and American military personnel between February 28 and April 22, 1945.[citation needed]
Geography[edit]
The province is composed of the long and narrow Palawan Island, plus a number of other smaller islands surrounding it, totalling roughly 1,780 islands and islets. The Calamianes Group of Islands to the northeast consists of Busuanga, Coron, Culion, and Linapacan islands. Balabac Island is located off the southern tip, separated from Borneo by the Balabac Strait. In addition, Palawan covers the Cuyo Islands in the Sulu Sea. The disputed Spratly Islands, located a few hundred kilometres to the west, are considered part of Palawan by the Philippines, and is locally called the "Kalayaan Group of Islands".
Palawan's almost 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) of irregular coastline is lined with rocky coves and sugar-white sandy beaches. It also harbors a vast stretch of virgin forests that carpet its chain of mountain ranges. The mountain heights average 3,500 feet (1,100 m) in altitude, with the highest peak rising to 6,843 feet (2,086 m)[10] at Mount Mantalingahan. The vast mountain areas are the source of valuable timber. The terrain is a mix of coastal plain, craggy foothills, valley deltas, and heavy forest interspersed with riverine arteries that serve as irrigation.[9]
The province has a total land area of 14,649.73 square kilometres (5,656.29 sq mi).[15] When Puerto Princesa City is included for geographical purposes, its land area is 17,030.75 square kilometres (6,575.61 square miles).[15] The land area is distributed to its mainland municipalities, comprising 12,239 square kilometres (4,726 square miles), and the island municipalities, which altogether measure 2,657 square kilometres (1,026 square miles). In terms of archipelagic internal waters, Palawan has the biggest marine resources that covers almost half of the Sulu Sea and a big chunk of the South China Sea that is within the municipal waters of Kalayaan Municipality which was official annexed to the Philippine jurisdiction by virtue of Presidential Decree 1596 dated June 11, 1978.
Climate[edit]
The province has two types of climate. The first, which occurs in the northern and southern extremities and the entire western coast, has two distinct seasons – six months dry and six months wet. The other, which prevails in the eastern coast, has a short dry season of one to three months and no pronounced rainy period during the rest of the year. The southern part of the province is virtually free from tropical depressions but northern Palawan experiences torrential rains during the months of July and August. Summer months serve as peak season for Palawan. Sea voyages are most favorable from March to early June when the seas are calm. The average maximum temperature is 31 °C (88 °F) with little variation all year.[9]
Administrative divisions[edit]







Palawan comprises 433 barangays in 23 municipalities and the capital City of Puerto Princesa. As an archipelago, Palawan has 13 mainland municipalities and 10 island towns. There are three congressional districts, namely: the first district comprising five northern mainland municipalities and nine island towns; the second district composed of six southern mainland towns and the island municipality of Balabac; and the third district covering the capital City of Puerto Princesa and the town of Aborlan. Thirteen municipalities are considered as mainland municipalities, namely Aborlan, Narra, Quezon, Sofronio Española, Brooke's Point, Rizal, and Bataraza (located south); San Vicente, Roxas, Dumaran, El Nido, and Taytay (found in the north). The remaining island municipalities are: Busuanga, Coron, Linapacan and Culion (forming the Calamianes group of islands), Cuyo, Agutaya and Magsaysay (the Cuyo group of islands), Araceli, Cagayancillo, Balabac and Kalayaan (Spratly Islands). The capital, Puerto Princesa is a highly urbanized city that governs itself independently from the province, but it usually grouped with the province for statistical and geographic purposes.
A State of Palawan was advocated by President Rodrigo Duterte during a forum in Palawan in 2015. In July 2016, Duterte's spokesperson noted the possibility of 5 states in Luzon, possibly including Palawan in a State of Southern Tagalog which will include CALABARZON and MIMAROPA. There is an active movement in the Calamian Islands, the northernmost island group of Palawan, to become a separate province due to geographic constraint and cultural differences.

Region[edit]
In 2001, the residents of Palawan voted in a plebiscite to reject inclusion into an expanded Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.[17]
On 17 May 2002, Executive Order No. 103 divided Region IV into Region IV-A (Calabarzon) and Region IV-B (Mimaropa), placing the province of Palawan into Mimaropa.[18]
On 23 May 2005, Executive Order No. 429 directed that Palawan be transferred from Region IV-B to Region VI.[5] However, Palaweños criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa City and all municipalities but one preferring to stay with Region IV-B. Consequently, Administrative Order No. 129 was issued on 19 August 2005 that the implementation of EO 429 be held in abeyance pending approval by the President of its implementation Plan.[6] The Philippine Commission on Elections reported the 2010 Philippine general election results for Palawan as a part of the Region IV-B results.[19] As of 30 June 2011[update], the abeyance was still in effect and Palawan remained a part of Mimaropa.[7]
Geology[edit]




A lagoon in El Nido


The geology of Palawan is, in many ways, unlike other parts of the Philippines. The crust of northeast Palawan was derived from the southeast edge of the continental crust of China, part of the Eurasian Plate. It is the exposed portion of a microcontinent that drifted southward with the opening of the South China Sea. This microcontinent also forms the shallow water north of Palawan in the Reed Bank-Dangerous Ground area of the southern South China Sea. Some of the oldest rocks of the Philippines are found in northeast Palawan (Permian-Carboniferous age). Southwest Palawan exposes primarily ophiolitic material (rocks derived from uplifted oceanic crust and mantle). This 34 Myr old oceanic material[20] appears to have been thrust upon the continental crust. The transition from "oceanic" ophiolite in the southwest to "continental"-type rocks in the northeast occurs in the area of central Palawan around Ulugan Bay and the Sabang area. In the southern coasts of Ulugan Bay and Sabang Beach, are several exposures showing that the Palawan ophiolite has been thrust on to the continent-derived clastic rocks ("Sabang thrust").[21]
The Palawan Trough is an area of deeper water adjacent to the north coast of Palawan in the South China Sea.[22] The Palawan trough is thought to be due to downbending of the continental crust due to the weight of the ophiolite thrust sheet.
Further north, around the Malampaya Sound area and up to the El Nido area, one finds deep marine chert and limestone.




Coron Island


Intruding these rocks in central Palawan (Cleopatra's Needle area) and northern Palawan (Mount Capoas or Kapoas area) are young granite bodies (true granite to granodiorite) of Miocene age (13-15 million years old based on zircon and monazite U-Pb dating).[23] In the Taytay area of northern Palawan, a young basaltic cinder cone is another manifestation of young magmatic activity. The granitic magmatism and basaltic magmatism are both expressions of what has been identified as a widespread post-South China Sea spreading magmatism that has affected many areas around the South China Sea.[24]
Tectonically, Palawan with the Calamian Islands, is considered to be a north-east extension of the Sunda Plate, in collision with the Philippine Mobile Belt at Mindoro.

Special pioneers from the Witnesses have been preaching to prisoners at the Iwahig penal colony in Palawan, and were permitted to build a small Kingdom Hall right on the premises.[27]
Islam[edit]
Further information: Islam in the Philippines
While the formerly Muslim majority population in Mindanao was reduced to 40% as a result of the influx of Christian Filipino settlers in the 20th century, as of 2015[update] Muslims were reported by the Routledge Handbook of Southeast Asian Democratization as forming an "overwhelming majority" in Palawan, as well as the Sulu Archipelago.[28] However, other sources had earlier reported a 50-50 split between Muslims and Christians—with Muslims concentrated mostly in the south of Palawan.[29][30]
Other religions[edit]
There are Buddhists - mainly Vietnamese refugees[citation needed] who settled in Palawan, as well as some ethnic Chinese Buddhists. One notable Vietnamese Buddhist Temple in Palawan is Chùa Vạn Pháp.[31]

Palawan has one of the richest fishing grounds in the country. About 45% of Manila's supply of fish comes from here. Having natural gas reserves of approximately 30,000 trillion cubic feet, the province is the only oil-producing province in the country.[32][33] In addition, tourism is also a thriving sector.
Pearl diving used to be a significant economic activity for Palawan until the advent of plastics.[citation needed] The world's largest pearl, the 240 millimetres (9.4 in) diameter Pearl of Lao Tzu, was found off Palawan in 1934.
The economic and agricultural business growth of province is at 20% per annum.[33] Coconut, sugar, rice, lumber, and livestock are produced here.[10]
Flora and fauna[edit]




A Palawan peacock-pheasant


Unlike most of the Philippines, Palawan is biogeographically part of Sundaland, with a fauna and flora related to that found in Borneo.[34]
Among the many endemic species are the Palawan peacock-pheasant, Philippine mouse-deer, Philippine pangolin, Palawan bearded pig, and Palawan birdwing. In the forests and grasslands, the air resonates with the songs of more than 200 kinds of birds. Over 600 species of butterflies flutter around the mountains and fields of Palawan, attracted to some 1500 hosts plants found here. Endangered sea turtles nest on white sand beaches.[35] Dugong numbers have fallen seriously, although Palawan still has a larger population than any other part of the country[36] and organizations such as Community Centred Conservation (C3) are working to end the unsustainable use of marine resources in Palawan and in Philippines.[37]
In 2007, a "shrew-eating pitcher plant", named Nepenthes attenboroughii was discovered in Mount Victoria. There were many species of pitcher pants discovered in this wild mountain paradise, the most recent is named Nepenthes leonardoi.




Palawan palm forest.


Total forest cover is about 56 percent of the total land area of the province while mangrove forest accounts for 3.35 percent based on the 1998 Landsat imagery. Grasslands dwindled from 19 percent in 1992 to 12.40 percent in 1998. This is an indication of improving soil condition as deteriorating soil is normally invaded by grass species. Brushlands increased to 25 percent of the total land area. Sprawled beneath the seas are nearly 11,000 square kilometers of coral reefs, representing more than 35% of the country's coral reefs.[35]
Palawan, the only Philippine island cited, is rated by the Condé Nast Traveler Readers as the most beautiful island in the world and is also rated by the National Geographic Traveler magazine as the best island destination in East and Southeast Asia region in 2007, and the 13th best island in the world having "incredibly beautiful natural seascapes and landscapes. One of the most biodiverse (terrestrial and marine) islands in the Philippines... The island has had a Biosphere Reserve status since the early 1990s, showing local interest for conservation and sustainable development".[38][39]




Taranaban River


The province was also categorized as "doing well" in the 4th Destination Scorecard survey conducted by the National Geographic Center for Sustainable Destinations, and Conde Nast Traveler magazine voted its beaches, coves and islets as the tourist destination with the best beaches in Asia.[40] Renowned underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau has described the province as having one of the most beautiful seascapes in the world.[35] and Caril Ridley, founder of Palawan Environmental and Marine Studies Center (PEMS) says the Islands of northern Palawan are destined to become a future destination for Asia's growing economic and environmental conferencing.
In 2012, the purple crab was discovered here along with four other species.

Puerto-Princesa Subterranean River National Park (1999)

This park features a large limestone karst landscape with an underground river. One of the river's distinguishing features is that it emerges directly into the sea, and its lower portion is subject to tidal influences. The area also represents a significant habitat for biodiversity conservation. The site contains a full 'mountain-to-sea' ecosystem and has some of the most important forests in Asia.

Tubbataha Reef Marine Park (1993)

The Tubbataha Reef Marine Park covers 332 km2, including the North and South Reefs. It is a unique example of an atoll reef with a very high density of marine species; the North Islet serving as a nesting site for birds and marine turtles. The site is an excellent example of a pristine coral reef with a spectacular 100 m perpendicular wall, extensive lagoons and two coral islands.

Palawan (Pron. /pəˈlɑːwɑːn/), officially the Province of Palawan (Cuyonon: Probinsya i'ang Palawan; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Palawan) is an archipelagic province of the Philippines that is located in the Mimaropa region. It is the largest province in the country in terms of total area of jurisdiction. Its capital is the City of Puerto Princesa, but it is governed independently from the province as a highly urbanized city.
The islands of Palawan stretch between Mindoro in the northeast and Borneo in the southwest. It lies between the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea. The province is named after its largest island, Palawan Island (09°30′N 118°30′E﻿ / ﻿9.500°N 118.500°E﻿ / 9.500; 118.500), measuring 450 kilometres (280 mi) long, and 50 kilometres (31 mi) wide.[9][10]

History[edit]
The early history of Palawan was determined by a team of researchers led by Dr. Robert B. Fox. They found evidence in the Tabon Caves that humans have lived in Palawan for more than 50,000 years. They also found human bone fragments, from an individual known as Tabon Man, in the municipality of Quezon, as well as tools and other artifacts. Although the origin of the cave dwellers is not yet established, anthropologists believe they may have come from Borneo. The Tabon Caves are now known as the Cradle of Philippine Civilization[9]
Ancient times[edit]
The Palawano and Tagbanwa, are believed to be direct descendants of Palawan's earliest settlers. They developed a non-formal form of government, an alphabet, and a system of trading with sea-borne merchants.[11]
Surviving ancient tribal artwork include reliefs of elephants, sharks, and fish found at Tabon Caves. Approximately 5,000 years ago, a culturally distinct period characterised by jar burials is evident. This era lasted till AD 500. Over 1500 jars and a mural depicting a burial procession were found.[citation needed]
A more recent wave of migrants arrived between 220 and 263 AD. This was during a period known as the Three Kingdoms. "Little, dark people" living in Anwei province in South China were driven South by Han People. Some settled in Thailand, others went farther south to Indonesia, Sumatra, Borneo. They were known as Aetas and Negritos from whom Palawan's Batak tribe descended.[12]
In AD 982, ancient Chinese traders regularly visited the islands.[12] A Chinese author referred to these islands as Kla-ma-yan (Calamian), Palau-ye (Palawan), and Paki-nung (Busuanga). Pottery, china and other artifacts recovered from caves and waters of Palawan attest to trade relations that existed between Chinese and Malay merchants.[11]
Classical period[edit]
In the 12th century, Malay immigrants arrived. Most of their settlements were ruled by Malay chieftains. These people grew rice, ginger, coconuts, sweet potatoes, sugarcane and bananas. They also raised pigs, goats and chickens. Most of their economic activities were fishing, farming, and hunting by the use of bamboo traps and blowguns. The local people had a dialect consisting of 18 syllables.[11] They were followed by the Indonesians of the Majapahit Empire in the 13th century, and they brought with them Buddhism and Hinduism.[13]
Surviving Buddhist images and sculptures are primarily in and near Tabon Cave.
Because of Palawan's proximity to Borneo, southern portions of the island were under the control of the Sultanate of Brunei for more than two centuries, and Islam was introduced. During the same period, trade relations flourished, and intermarriages among the natives and the Chinese, Japanese, Arab and Hindu. The inter-mixing of blood resulted to a distinct breed of Palaweños, both in physical stature and features.[11]
Spanish period[edit]




Taytay, the capital of Province of Calamianes in 1818 (Spanish Palawan)


After Ferdinand Magellan's death, remnants of his fleet landed in Palawan where the bounty of the land saved them from starvation. Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler named the place "Land of Promise."[12]
The northern Calamianes Islands were the first to come under Spanish authority, and were later declared a province separate from the Palawan mainland. In the early 17th century, Spanish friars sent out missions in Cuyo, Agutaya, Taytay and Cagayancillo but they met resistance from Moro communities. Before the 18th century, Spain began to build churches enclosed by garrisons for protection against Moro raids in the town of Cuyo, Taytay, Linapacan and Balabac. In 1749, the Sultanate of Brunei ceded southern Palawan to Spain.[11]
In 1818, the entire island of Palawan, or Paragua as it was called, was organized as a single province named Calamianes, with its capital in Taytay.[citation needed] By 1858, the province was divided into two provinces, namely, Castilla, covering the northern section with Taytay as capital and Asturias in the southern mainland with Puerto Princesa as capital. It was later divided into three districts, Calamianes, Paragua and Balabac, with Principe Alfonso town as its capital. and During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Cuyo became the second capital of Palawan from 1873 to 1903.
American rule[edit]
In 1902, after the Philippine-American War, the Americans established civil rule in northern Palawan, calling it the province of Paragua. In 1903, pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 1363, the province was reorganized to include the southern portions and renamed Palawan, and Puerto Princesa declared as its capital.[11]
Many reforms and projects were later introduced in the province. Construction of school buildings, promotion of agriculture, and bringing people closer to the government were among the priority plans during this era.[11]
Japanese invasion[edit]
Palawan Massacre[edit]




U. S. Army personnel toiled to identify the charred remains of Americans captured at Bataan and burned alive on Palawan. 20 March 1945


Main article: Palawan Massacre
During World War II, in order to prevent the rescue of prisoners of war by the advancing allies, on 14 December 1944, units of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army (under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita) herded the remaining 150 prisoners of war at Puerto Princesa into three covered trenches which were then set on fire using barrels of gasoline. Prisoners who tried to escape the flames were shot down.[14] Others attempted to escape by climbing over a cliff that ran along one side of the trenches, but were later hunted down and killed. Only 11 men escaped the slaughter and between 133 and 141 were killed.
The massacre is the basis for the recently published book Last Man Out: Glenn McDole, USMC, Survivor of the Palawan Massacre in World War II by Bob Wilbanks, and the opening scenes of the 2005 Miramax film, The Great Raid. A memorial has been erected on the site and McDole, in his eighties, was able to attend the dedication.[citation needed]
Liberation[edit]
During the first phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, just off the coast of Palawan, two United States Navy submarines, USS Dace (SS-247) and USS Darter (SS-227) attacked a Japanese cruiser task force led by Admiral Takeo Kurita, sinking his flagship (in which he survived) Atago, and her sister ship Maya. Darter later ran aground that afternoon and was scuttled by USS Nautilus (SS-168).
The island was liberated from the Japanese Imperial Forces by a task force consisting of Filipino and American military personnel between February 28 and April 22, 1945.[citation needed]
Geography[edit]
The province is composed of the long and narrow Palawan Island, plus a number of other smaller islands surrounding it, totalling roughly 1,780 islands and islets. The Calamianes Group of Islands to the northeast consists of Busuanga, Coron, Culion, and Linapacan islands. Balabac Island is located off the southern tip, separated from Borneo by the Balabac Strait. In addition, Palawan covers the Cuyo Islands in the Sulu Sea. The disputed Spratly Islands, located a few hundred kilometres to the west, are considered part of Palawan by the Philippines, and is locally called the "Kalayaan Group of Islands".
Palawan's almost 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) of irregular coastline is lined with rocky coves and sugar-white sandy beaches. It also harbors a vast stretch of virgin forests that carpet its chain of mountain ranges. The mountain heights average 3,500 feet (1,100 m) in altitude, with the highest peak rising to 6,843 feet (2,086 m)[10] at Mount Mantalingahan. The vast mountain areas are the source of valuable timber. The terrain is a mix of coastal plain, craggy foothills, valley deltas, and heavy forest interspersed with riverine arteries that serve as irrigation.[9]
The province has a total land area of 14,649.73 square kilometres (5,656.29 sq mi).[15] When Puerto Princesa City is included for geographical purposes, its land area is 17,030.75 square kilometres (6,575.61 square miles).[15] The land area is distributed to its mainland municipalities, comprising 12,239 square kilometres (4,726 square miles), and the island municipalities, which altogether measure 2,657 square kilometres (1,026 square miles). In terms of archipelagic internal waters, Palawan has the biggest marine resources that covers almost half of the Sulu Sea and a big chunk of the South China Sea that is within the municipal waters of Kalayaan Municipality which was official annexed to the Philippine jurisdiction by virtue of Presidential Decree 1596 dated June 11, 1978.
Climate[edit]
The province has two types of climate. The first, which occurs in the northern and southern extremities and the entire western coast, has two distinct seasons – six months dry and six months wet. The other, which prevails in the eastern coast, has a short dry season of one to three months and no pronounced rainy period during the rest of the year. The southern part of the province is virtually free from tropical depressions but northern Palawan experiences torrential rains during the months of July and August. Summer months serve as peak season for Palawan. Sea voyages are most favorable from March to early June when the seas are calm. The average maximum temperature is 31 °C (88 °F) with little variation all year.[9]

Palawan comprises 433 barangays in 23 municipalities and the capital City of Puerto Princesa. As an archipelago, Palawan has 13 mainland municipalities and 10 island towns. There are three congressional districts, namely: the first district comprising five northern mainland municipalities and nine island towns; the second district composed of six southern mainland towns and the island municipality of Balabac; and the third district covering the capital City of Puerto Princesa and the town of Aborlan. Thirteen municipalities are considered as mainland municipalities, namely Aborlan, Narra, Quezon, Sofronio Española, Brooke's Point, Rizal, and Bataraza (located south); San Vicente, Roxas, Dumaran, El Nido, and Taytay (found in the north). The remaining island municipalities are: Busuanga, Coron, Linapacan and Culion (forming the Calamianes group of islands), Cuyo, Agutaya and Magsaysay (the Cuyo group of islands), Araceli, Cagayancillo, Balabac and Kalayaan (Spratly Islands). The capital, Puerto Princesa is a highly urbanized city that governs itself independently from the province, but it usually grouped with the province for statistical and geographic purposes.
A State of Palawan was advocated by President Rodrigo Duterte during a forum in Palawan in 2015. In July 2016, Duterte's spokesperson noted the possibility of 5 states in Luzon, possibly including Palawan in a State of Southern Tagalog which will include CALABARZON and MIMAROPA. There is an active movement in the Calamian Islands, the northernmost island group of Palawan, to become a separate province due to geographic constraint and cultural differences.

Region[edit]
In 2001, the residents of Palawan voted in a plebiscite to reject inclusion into an expanded Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.[17]
On 17 May 2002, Executive Order No. 103 divided Region IV into Region IV-A (Calabarzon) and Region IV-B (Mimaropa), placing the province of Palawan into Mimaropa.[18]
On 23 May 2005, Executive Order No. 429 directed that Palawan be transferred from Region IV-B to Region VI.[5] However, Palaweños criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa City and all municipalities but one preferring to stay with Region IV-B. Consequently, Administrative Order No. 129 was issued on 19 August 2005 that the implementation of EO 429 be held in abeyance pending approval by the President of its implementation Plan.[6] The Philippine Commission on Elections reported the 2010 Philippine general election results for Palawan as a part of the Region IV-B results.[19] As of 30 June 2011[update], the abeyance was still in effect and Palawan remained a part of Mimaropa.[7]
Geology[edit]




A lagoon in El Nido


The geology of Palawan is, in many ways, unlike other parts of the Philippines. The crust of northeast Palawan was derived from the southeast edge of the continental crust of China, part of the Eurasian Plate. It is the exposed portion of a microcontinent that drifted southward with the opening of the South China Sea. This microcontinent also forms the shallow water north of Palawan in the Reed Bank-Dangerous Ground area of the southern South China Sea. Some of the oldest rocks of the Philippines are found in northeast Palawan (Permian-Carboniferous age). Southwest Palawan exposes primarily ophiolitic material (rocks derived from uplifted oceanic crust and mantle). This 34 Myr old oceanic material[20] appears to have been thrust upon the continental crust. The transition from "oceanic" ophiolite in the southwest to "continental"-type rocks in the northeast occurs in the area of central Palawan around Ulugan Bay and the Sabang area. In the southern coasts of Ulugan Bay and Sabang Beach, are several exposures showing that the Palawan ophiolite has been thrust on to the continent-derived clastic rocks ("Sabang thrust").[21]
The Palawan Trough is an area of deeper water adjacent to the north coast of Palawan in the South China Sea.[22] The Palawan trough is thought to be due to downbending of the continental crust due to the weight of the ophiolite thrust sheet.
Further north, around the Malampaya Sound area and up to the El Nido area, one finds deep marine chert and limestone.




Coron Island


Intruding these rocks in central Palawan (Cleopatra's Needle area) and northern Palawan (Mount Capoas or Kapoas area) are young granite bodies (true granite to granodiorite) of Miocene age (13-15 million years old based on zircon and monazite U-Pb dating).[23] In the Taytay area of northern Palawan, a young basaltic cinder cone is another manifestation of young magmatic activity. The granitic magmatism and basaltic magmatism are both expressions of what has been identified as a widespread post-South China Sea spreading magmatism that has affected many areas around the South China Sea.[24]
Tectonically, Palawan with the Calamian Islands, is considered to be a north-east extension of the Sunda Plate, in collision with the Philippine Mobile Belt at Mindoro.

The province is a melting pot of 87 different cultural groups and races. Basically, its culture bears a strong influence from China, India and the Middle East.[citation needed] Influx of migrants from other parts of the Philippines, particularly from Muslim Mindanao, accounts for the high population growth rate of 3.98% annually. The native-born Palaweños still predominate the populace. Eighteen percent is composed of cultural minority groups such as the Tagbanwa, Palawano, Batak, and Molbog.
Religion[edit]
Roman Catholicism[edit]
Main article: Apostolic Vicariate of Puerto Princesa
The predominant religion in Palawan is Roman Catholicism. In 2014, the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Puerto Prinsesa had a 68% adherence while the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Taytay (Northern Palawan) had an 88% adherence.[citation needed]One of the religious orders that had a significant mission in the islands is the Order of Augustinian Recollects.

Immaculate Conception Cathedral in Puerto Princesa, Palawan


Protestantism and other groups[edit]
Several Baptist and other Protestant denominations have a strong presence on Palawan as do the Church of the Foursquare Gospel in the Philippines, and the Seventh-day Adventists. Charismatic groups such as Jesus is Lord (JIL), Jesus Touch Fellowship (JTF) and the Life Church (formerly known at the Life Renewal Center).
The Members Church of God International popularly called Ang Dating Daan establishes three church districts namely Coron, Northern Palawan and Southern Palawan which signifies strong membership in the province.
Other Christian denominations including the indigenous Iglesia ni Cristo has many local congregations in the province.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the United Church of Christ in the Philippines or (UCCP), the Jesus Miracle Crusade, the Pentecostal Missionary Church of Christ or PMCC as well as the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (Philippine Independent Church or Aglipayan Church) which is standing as one diocese (The Diocese of Palawan). Jehovah's Witnesses have an active membership of 181,236 in the Philippines as of 2012. Special pioneers from the Witnesses have been preaching to prisoners at the Iwahig penal colony in Palawan, and were permitted to build a small Kingdom Hall right on the premises.[27]
Islam[edit]
Further information: Islam in the Philippines
While the formerly Muslim majority population in Mindanao was reduced to 40% as a result of the influx of Christian Filipino settlers in the 20th century, as of 2015[update] Muslims were reported by the Routledge Handbook of Southeast Asian Democratization as forming an "overwhelming majority" in Palawan, as well as the Sulu Archipelago.[28] However, other sources had earlier reported a 50-50 split between Muslims and Christians—with Muslims concentrated mostly in the south of Palawan.[29][30]
Other religions[edit]
There are Buddhists - mainly Vietnamese refugees[citation needed] who settled in Palawan, as well as some ethnic Chinese Buddhists. One notable Vietnamese Buddhist Temple in Palawan is Chùa Vạn Pháp.[31]
Most of the ethnic minorities such as Batak and Tagbanwa are animists, but many have become Christians (usually Protestant) or have joined other sects.

Economy[edit]
Palawan's economy is basically agricultural. The three major crops are palay, corn and coconut. Mineral resources include nickel, copper, manganese, and chromite. Logging is also a major industry. Palawan has one of the richest fishing grounds in the country. About 45% of Manila's supply of fish comes from here. Having natural gas reserves of approximately 30,000 trillion cubic feet, the province is the only oil-producing province in the country.[32][33] In addition, tourism is also a thriving sector.
Pearl diving used to be a significant economic activity for Palawan until the advent of plastics.[citation needed] The world's largest pearl, the 240 millimetres (9.4 in) diameter Pearl of Lao Tzu, was found off Palawan in 1934.
The economic and agricultural business growth of province is at 20% per annum.[33] Coconut, sugar, rice, lumber, and livestock are produced here.[10]
Flora and fauna[edit]




A Palawan peacock-pheasant


Unlike most of the Philippines, Palawan is biogeographically part of Sundaland, with a fauna and flora related to that found in Borneo.[34]
Among the many endemic species are the Palawan peacock-pheasant, Philippine mouse-deer, Philippine pangolin, Palawan bearded pig, and Palawan birdwing. In the forests and grasslands, the air resonates with the songs of more than 200 kinds of birds. Over 600 species of butterflies flutter around the mountains and fields of Palawan, attracted to some 1500 hosts plants found here. Endangered sea turtles nest on white sand beaches.[35] Dugong numbers have fallen seriously, although Palawan still has a larger population than any other part of the country[36] and organizations such as Community Centred Conservation (C3) are working to end the unsustainable use of marine resources in Palawan and in Philippines.[37]
In 2007, a "shrew-eating pitcher plant", named Nepenthes attenboroughii was discovered in Mount Victoria. There were many species of pitcher pants discovered in this wild mountain paradise, the most recent is named Nepenthes leonardoi.




Palawan palm forest.


Total forest cover is about 56 percent of the total land area of the province while mangrove forest accounts for 3.35 percent based on the 1998 Landsat imagery. Grasslands dwindled from 19 percent in 1992 to 12.40 percent in 1998. This is an indication of improving soil condition as deteriorating soil is normally invaded by grass species. Brushlands increased to 25 percent of the total land area. Sprawled beneath the seas are nearly 11,000 square kilometers of coral reefs, representing more than 35% of the country's coral reefs.[35]
Palawan, the only Philippine island cited, is rated by the Condé Nast Traveler Readers as the most beautiful island in the world and is also rated by the National Geographic Traveler magazine as the best island destination in East and Southeast Asia region in 2007, and the 13th best island in the world having "incredibly beautiful natural seascapes and landscapes. One of the most biodiverse (terrestrial and marine) islands in the Philippines... The island has had a Biosphere Reserve status since the early 1990s, showing local interest for conservation and sustainable development".[38][39]




Taranaban River


The province was also categorized as "doing well" in the 4th Destination Scorecard survey conducted by the National Geographic Center for Sustainable Destinations, and Conde Nast Traveler magazine voted its beaches, coves and islets as the tourist destination with the best beaches in Asia.[40] Renowned underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau has described the province as having one of the most beautiful seascapes in the world.[35] and Caril Ridley, founder of Palawan Environmental and Marine Studies Center (PEMS) says the Islands of northern Palawan are destined to become a future destination for Asia's growing economic and environmental conferencing.
In 2012, the purple crab was discovered here along with four other species.

Attractions[edit]
Calauit Game Preserve and Wildlife Sanctuary[edit]
See also: Calauit Safari Park
A game reserve and wildlife sanctuary of exotic African animals and endangered endemic animals of Palawan. The reserve was established on August 31, 1976 by virtue of the Presidential Decree No.1578, this was initiated in response to the appeal of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to help save African wildlife when former President Ferdinand Marcos attended the 3rd World Conference in Kenya. By virtue of the Republic Act 7611 (SEP), administrative jurisdiction of DENR was given to the local government of Palawan, effective December 31, 1993. Management of the area is the responsibility of the Office of the Palawan Council of Sustainable Development (PCSD). It is located in Calauit Island in Busuanga.
Coron Reefs, Coron Bay, Busuanga[edit]




Coron, Palawan


Seven lakes surrounded by craggy limestone cliffs attract hundreds of nature lovers to Coron Reefs in Northern Palawan, near the town of Coron. Busuanga Island, whose main town is Coron, is the jump-off point for numerous dive operators. The principal dive sites are 12 World War II Japanese shipwrecks sunk on September 24, 1944 by US Navy action. They range in depth from the surface to 40 meters. This large variety offers exciting wreck exploration for enthusiasts, from novice divers and snorkelers and recreational divers to experienced TEC divers. The aquatic views from the sunken Japanese warships off Coron Island are listed in Forbes Traveler Magazine's top 10 best scuba sites in the world.[40]

The January 2008 issue of international magazine Travel + Leisure, published by the American Express Co. (which partnered with Conservation International) listed El Nido's sister hotel resorts El Nido Lagen Island and El Nido Miniloc Island in Miniloc and Lagen Islands as "conservation-minded places on a mission to protect the local environment". Travel + Leisure's 20 Favorite Green Hotels scored El Nido Resort's protection of Palawan's giant clam gardens and the re-introduction of endangered Philippine cockatoos: "8. El Nido Resorts, Philippines: Guest cottages on stilts are set above the crystalline ocean. The resorts are active in both reef and island conservation."[41]
Malampaya Sound Land and Seascape Protected Area[edit]
Main article: Malampaya Sound
Located in the Municipality of Taytay, this important ecological and economic zone is a watershed and fishing ground, and the habitat of Bottle-nosed and Irrawaddy dolphins.[42]
UNESCO World Heritage Sites[edit]

Puerto-Princesa Subterranean River National Park (1999)

This park features a large limestone karst landscape with an underground river. One of the river's distinguishing features is that it emerges directly into the sea, and its lower portion is subject to tidal influences. The area also represents a significant habitat for biodiversity conservation. The site contains a full 'mountain-to-sea' ecosystem and has some of the most important forests in Asia.

Tubbataha Reef Marine Park (1993)

The Tubbataha Reef Marine Park covers 332 km2, including the North and South Reefs. It is a unique example of an atoll reef with a very high density of marine species; the North Islet serving as a nesting site for birds and marine turtles. The site is an excellent example of a pristine coral reef with a spectacular 100 m perpendicular wall, extensive lagoons and two coral islands.
Ursula Island[edit]
This game refuge and bird sanctuary is situated near the Municipality of Bataraza in southern Palawan. The islet is a migratory and wintering ground for shorebirds and seabirds.[42]
Rasa Island Wildlife Sanctuary[edit]
Main article: Rasa Island
This 1,983-hectare (4,900-acre) protected area located in the municipality of Narra is a nesting ground of the endemic Philippine cockatoo or katala. It also harbors other rare bird species and marine turtles.

Palawan (Pron. /pəˈlɑːwɑːn/), officially the Province of Palawan (Cuyonon: Probinsya i'ang Palawan; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Palawan) is an archipelagic province of the Philippines that is located in the Mimaropa region. It is the largest province in the country in terms of total area of jurisdiction. Its capital is the City of Puerto Princesa, but it is governed independently from the province as a highly urbanized city.
The islands of Palawan stretch between Mindoro in the northeast and Borneo in the southwest. It lies between the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea. The province is named after its largest island, Palawan Island (09°30′N 118°30′E﻿ / ﻿9.500°N 118.500°E﻿ / 9.500; 118.500), measuring 450 kilometres (280 mi) long, and 50 kilometres (31 mi) wide.[9][10]

History[edit]
The early history of Palawan was determined by a team of researchers led by Dr. Robert B. Fox. They found evidence in the Tabon Caves that humans have lived in Palawan for more than 50,000 years. They also found human bone fragments, from an individual known as Tabon Man, in the municipality of Quezon, as well as tools and other artifacts. Although the origin of the cave dwellers is not yet established, anthropologists believe they may have come from Borneo. The Tabon Caves are now known as the Cradle of Philippine Civilization[9]
Ancient times[edit]
The Palawano and Tagbanwa, are believed to be direct descendants of Palawan's earliest settlers. They developed a non-formal form of government, an alphabet, and a system of trading with sea-borne merchants.[11]
Surviving ancient tribal artwork include reliefs of elephants, sharks, and fish found at Tabon Caves. Approximately 5,000 years ago, a culturally distinct period characterised by jar burials is evident. This era lasted till AD 500. Over 1500 jars and a mural depicting a burial procession were found.[citation needed]
A more recent wave of migrants arrived between 220 and 263 AD. This was during a period known as the Three Kingdoms. "Little, dark people" living in Anwei province in South China were driven South by Han People. Some settled in Thailand, others went farther south to Indonesia, Sumatra, Borneo. They were known as Aetas and Negritos from whom Palawan's Batak tribe descended.[12]
In AD 982, ancient Chinese traders regularly visited the islands.[12] A Chinese author referred to these islands as Kla-ma-yan (Calamian), Palau-ye (Palawan), and Paki-nung (Busuanga). Pottery, china and other artifacts recovered from caves and waters of Palawan attest to trade relations that existed between Chinese and Malay merchants.[11]
Classical period[edit]
In the 12th century, Malay immigrants arrived. Most of their settlements were ruled by Malay chieftains. These people grew rice, ginger, coconuts, sweet potatoes, sugarcane and bananas. They also raised pigs, goats and chickens. Most of their economic activities were fishing, farming, and hunting by the use of bamboo traps and blowguns. The local people had a dialect consisting of 18 syllables.[11] They were followed by the Indonesians of the Majapahit Empire in the 13th century, and they brought with them Buddhism and Hinduism.[13]
Surviving Buddhist images and sculptures are primarily in and near Tabon Cave.
Because of Palawan's proximity to Borneo, southern portions of the island were under the control of the Sultanate of Brunei for more than two centuries, and Islam was introduced. During the same period, trade relations flourished, and intermarriages among the natives and the Chinese, Japanese, Arab and Hindu. The inter-mixing of blood resulted to a distinct breed of Palaweños, both in physical stature and features.[11]
Spanish period[edit]




Taytay, the capital of Province of Calamianes in 1818 (Spanish Palawan)


After Ferdinand Magellan's death, remnants of his fleet landed in Palawan where the bounty of the land saved them from starvation. Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler named the place "Land of Promise."[12]
The northern Calamianes Islands were the first to come under Spanish authority, and were later declared a province separate from the Palawan mainland. In the early 17th century, Spanish friars sent out missions in Cuyo, Agutaya, Taytay and Cagayancillo but they met resistance from Moro communities. Before the 18th century, Spain began to build churches enclosed by garrisons for protection against Moro raids in the town of Cuyo, Taytay, Linapacan and Balabac. In 1749, the Sultanate of Brunei ceded southern Palawan to Spain.[11]
In 1818, the entire island of Palawan, or Paragua as it was called, was organized as a single province named Calamianes, with its capital in Taytay.[citation needed] By 1858, the province was divided into two provinces, namely, Castilla, covering the northern section with Taytay as capital and Asturias in the southern mainland with Puerto Princesa as capital. It was later divided into three districts, Calamianes, Paragua and Balabac, with Principe Alfonso town as its capital. and During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Cuyo became the second capital of Palawan from 1873 to 1903.
American rule[edit]
In 1902, after the Philippine-American War, the Americans established civil rule in northern Palawan, calling it the province of Paragua. In 1903, pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 1363, the province was reorganized to include the southern portions and renamed Palawan, and Puerto Princesa declared as its capital.[11]
Many reforms and projects were later introduced in the province. Construction of school buildings, promotion of agriculture, and bringing people closer to the government were among the priority plans during this era.[11]
Japanese invasion[edit]
Palawan Massacre[edit]




U. S. Army personnel toiled to identify the charred remains of Americans captured at Bataan and burned alive on Palawan. 20 March 1945


Main article: Palawan Massacre
During World War II, in order to prevent the rescue of prisoners of war by the advancing allies, on 14 December 1944, units of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army (under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita) herded the remaining 150 prisoners of war at Puerto Princesa into three covered trenches which were then set on fire using barrels of gasoline. Prisoners who tried to escape the flames were shot down.[14] Others attempted to escape by climbing over a cliff that ran along one side of the trenches, but were later hunted down and killed. Only 11 men escaped the slaughter and between 133 and 141 were killed.
The massacre is the basis for the recently published book Last Man Out: Glenn McDole, USMC, Survivor of the Palawan Massacre in World War II by Bob Wilbanks, and the opening scenes of the 2005 Miramax film, The Great Raid. A memorial has been erected on the site and McDole, in his eighties, was able to attend the dedication.[citation needed]
Liberation[edit]
During the first phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, just off the coast of Palawan, two United States Navy submarines, USS Dace (SS-247) and USS Darter (SS-227) attacked a Japanese cruiser task force led by Admiral Takeo Kurita, sinking his flagship (in which he survived) Atago, and her sister ship Maya. Darter later ran aground that afternoon and was scuttled by USS Nautilus (SS-168).
The island was liberated from the Japanese Imperial Forces by a task force consisting of Filipino and American military personnel between February 28 and April 22, 1945.[citation needed]
Geography[edit]
The province is composed of the long and narrow Palawan Island, plus a number of other smaller islands surrounding it, totalling roughly 1,780 islands and islets. The Calamianes Group of Islands to the northeast consists of Busuanga, Coron, Culion, and Linapacan islands. Balabac Island is located off the southern tip, separated from Borneo by the Balabac Strait. In addition, Palawan covers the Cuyo Islands in the Sulu Sea. The disputed Spratly Islands, located a few hundred kilometres to the west, are considered part of Palawan by the Philippines, and is locally called the "Kalayaan Group of Islands".
Palawan's almost 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) of irregular coastline is lined with rocky coves and sugar-white sandy beaches. It also harbors a vast stretch of virgin forests that carpet its chain of mountain ranges. The mountain heights average 3,500 feet (1,100 m) in altitude, with the highest peak rising to 6,843 feet (2,086 m)[10] at Mount Mantalingahan. The vast mountain areas are the source of valuable timber. The terrain is a mix of coastal plain, craggy foothills, valley deltas, and heavy forest interspersed with riverine arteries that serve as irrigation.[9]
The province has a total land area of 14,649.73 square kilometres (5,656.29 sq mi).[15] When Puerto Princesa City is included for geographical purposes, its land area is 17,030.75 square kilometres (6,575.61 square miles).[15] The land area is distributed to its mainland municipalities, comprising 12,239 square kilometres (4,726 square miles), and the island municipalities, which altogether measure 2,657 square kilometres (1,026 square miles). In terms of archipelagic internal waters, Palawan has the biggest marine resources that covers almost half of the Sulu Sea and a big chunk of the South China Sea that is within the municipal waters of Kalayaan Municipality which was official annexed to the Philippine jurisdiction by virtue of Presidential Decree 1596 dated June 11, 1978.
Climate[edit]
The province has two types of climate. The first, which occurs in the northern and southern extremities and the entire western coast, has two distinct seasons – six months dry and six months wet. The other, which prevails in the eastern coast, has a short dry season of one to three months and no pronounced rainy period during the rest of the year. The southern part of the province is virtually free from tropical depressions but northern Palawan experiences torrential rains during the months of July and August. Summer months serve as peak season for Palawan. Sea voyages are most favorable from March to early June when the seas are calm. The average maximum temperature is 31 °C (88 °F) with little variation all year.[9]
Administrative divisions[edit]







Palawan comprises 433 barangays in 23 municipalities and the capital City of Puerto Princesa. As an archipelago, Palawan has 13 mainland municipalities and 10 island towns. There are three congressional districts, namely: the first district comprising five northern mainland municipalities and nine island towns; the second district composed of six southern mainland towns and the island municipality of Balabac; and the third district covering the capital City of Puerto Princesa and the town of Aborlan. Thirteen municipalities are considered as mainland municipalities, namely Aborlan, Narra, Quezon, Sofronio Española, Brooke's Point, Rizal, and Bataraza (located south); San Vicente, Roxas, Dumaran, El Nido, and Taytay (found in the north). The remaining island municipalities are: Busuanga, Coron, Linapacan and Culion (forming the Calamianes group of islands), Cuyo, Agutaya and Magsaysay (the Cuyo group of islands), Araceli, Cagayancillo, Balabac and Kalayaan (Spratly Islands). The capital, Puerto Princesa is a highly urbanized city that governs itself independently from the province, but it usually grouped with the province for statistical and geographic purposes.
A State of Palawan was advocated by President Rodrigo Duterte during a forum in Palawan in 2015. In July 2016, Duterte's spokesperson noted the possibility of 5 states in Luzon, possibly including Palawan in a State of Southern Tagalog which will include CALABARZON and MIMAROPA. There is an active movement in the Calamian Islands, the northernmost island group of Palawan, to become a separate province due to geographic constraint and cultural differences.

Region[edit]
In 2001, the residents of Palawan voted in a plebiscite to reject inclusion into an expanded Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.[17]
On 17 May 2002, Executive Order No. 103 divided Region IV into Region IV-A (Calabarzon) and Region IV-B (Mimaropa), placing the province of Palawan into Mimaropa.[18]
On 23 May 2005, Executive Order No. 429 directed that Palawan be transferred from Region IV-B to Region VI.[5] However, Palaweños criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa City and all municipalities but one preferring to stay with Region IV-B. Consequently, Administrative Order No. 129 was issued on 19 August 2005 that the implementation of EO 429 be held in abeyance pending approval by the President of its implementation Plan.[6] The Philippine Commission on Elections reported the 2010 Philippine general election results for Palawan as a part of the Region IV-B results.[19] As of 30 June 2011[update], the abeyance was still in effect and Palawan remained a part of Mimaropa.[7]
Geology[edit]




A lagoon in El Nido


The geology of Palawan is, in many ways, unlike other parts of the Philippines. The crust of northeast Palawan was derived from the southeast edge of the continental crust of China, part of the Eurasian Plate. It is the exposed portion of a microcontinent that drifted southward with the opening of the South China Sea. This microcontinent also forms the shallow water north of Palawan in the Reed Bank-Dangerous Ground area of the southern South China Sea. Some of the oldest rocks of the Philippines are found in northeast Palawan (Permian-Carboniferous age). Southwest Palawan exposes primarily ophiolitic material (rocks derived from uplifted oceanic crust and mantle). This 34 Myr old oceanic material[20] appears to have been thrust upon the continental crust. The transition from "oceanic" ophiolite in the southwest to "continental"-type rocks in the northeast occurs in the area of central Palawan around Ulugan Bay and the Sabang area. In the southern coasts of Ulugan Bay and Sabang Beach, are several exposures showing that the Palawan ophiolite has been thrust on to the continent-derived clastic rocks ("Sabang thrust").[21]
The Palawan Trough is an area of deeper water adjacent to the north coast of Palawan in the South China Sea.[22] The Palawan trough is thought to be due to downbending of the continental crust due to the weight of the ophiolite thrust sheet.
Further north, around the Malampaya Sound area and up to the El Nido area, one finds deep marine chert and limestone.

Intruding these rocks in central Palawan (Cleopatra's Needle area) and northern Palawan (Mount Capoas or Kapoas area) are young granite bodies (true granite to granodiorite) of Miocene age (13-15 million years old based on zircon and monazite U-Pb dating).[23] In the Taytay area of northern Palawan, a young basaltic cinder cone is another manifestation of young magmatic activity. The granitic magmatism and basaltic magmatism are both expressions of what has been identified as a widespread post-South China Sea spreading magmatism that has affected many areas around the South China Sea.[24]
Tectonically, Palawan with the Calamian Islands, is considered to be a north-east extension of the Sunda Plate, in collision with the Philippine Mobile Belt at Mindoro.

Special pioneers from the Witnesses have been preaching to prisoners at the Iwahig penal colony in Palawan, and were permitted to build a small Kingdom Hall right on the premises.[27]
Islam[edit]
Further information: Islam in the Philippines
While the formerly Muslim majority population in Mindanao was reduced to 40% as a result of the influx of Christian Filipino settlers in the 20th century, as of 2015[update] Muslims were reported by the Routledge Handbook of Southeast Asian Democratization as forming an "overwhelming majority" in Palawan, as well as the Sulu Archipelago.[28] However, other sources had earlier reported a 50-50 split between Muslims and Christians—with Muslims concentrated mostly in the south of Palawan.[29][30]
Other religions[edit]
There are Buddhists - mainly Vietnamese refugees[citation needed] who settled in Palawan, as well as some ethnic Chinese Buddhists. One notable Vietnamese Buddhist Temple in Palawan is Chùa Vạn Pháp.[31]

Palawan has one of the richest fishing grounds in the country. About 45% of Manila's supply of fish comes from here. Having natural gas reserves of approximately 30,000 trillion cubic feet, the province is the only oil-producing province in the country.[32][33] In addition, tourism is also a thriving sector.
Pearl diving used to be a significant economic activity for Palawan until the advent of plastics.[citation needed] The world's largest pearl, the 240 millimetres (9.4 in) diameter Pearl of Lao Tzu, was found off Palawan in 1934.
The economic and agricultural business growth of province is at 20% per annum.[33] Coconut, sugar, rice, lumber, and livestock are produced here.[10]
Flora and fauna[edit]




A Palawan peacock-pheasant


Unlike most of the Philippines, Palawan is biogeographically part of Sundaland, with a fauna and flora related to that found in Borneo.[34]
Among the many endemic species are the Palawan peacock-pheasant, Philippine mouse-deer, Philippine pangolin, Palawan bearded pig, and Palawan birdwing. In the forests and grasslands, the air resonates with the songs of more than 200 kinds of birds. Over 600 species of butterflies flutter around the mountains and fields of Palawan, attracted to some 1500 hosts plants found here. Endangered sea turtles nest on white sand beaches.[35] Dugong numbers have fallen seriously, although Palawan still has a larger population than any other part of the country[36] and organizations such as Community Centred Conservation (C3) are working to end the unsustainable use of marine resources in Palawan and in Philippines.[37]
In 2007, a "shrew-eating pitcher plant", named Nepenthes attenboroughii was discovered in Mount Victoria. There were many species of pitcher pants discovered in this wild mountain paradise, the most recent is named Nepenthes leonardoi.




Palawan palm forest.


Total forest cover is about 56 percent of the total land area of the province while mangrove forest accounts for 3.35 percent based on the 1998 Landsat imagery. Grasslands dwindled from 19 percent in 1992 to 12.40 percent in 1998. This is an indication of improving soil condition as deteriorating soil is normally invaded by grass species. Brushlands increased to 25 percent of the total land area. Sprawled beneath the seas are nearly 11,000 square kilometers of coral reefs, representing more than 35% of the country's coral reefs.[35]
Palawan, the only Philippine island cited, is rated by the Condé Nast Traveler Readers as the most beautiful island in the world and is also rated by the National Geographic Traveler magazine as the best island destination in East and Southeast Asia region in 2007, and the 13th best island in the world having "incredibly beautiful natural seascapes and landscapes. One of the most biodiverse (terrestrial and marine) islands in the Philippines... The island has had a Biosphere Reserve status since the early 1990s, showing local interest for conservation and sustainable development".[38][39]




Taranaban River


The province was also categorized as "doing well" in the 4th Destination Scorecard survey conducted by the National Geographic Center for Sustainable Destinations, and Conde Nast Traveler magazine voted its beaches, coves and islets as the tourist destination with the best beaches in Asia.[40] Renowned underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau has described the province as having one of the most beautiful seascapes in the world.[35] and Caril Ridley, founder of Palawan Environmental and Marine Studies Center (PEMS) says the Islands of northern Palawan are destined to become a future destination for Asia's growing economic and environmental conferencing.
In 2012, the purple crab was discovered here along with four other species.

The reserve was established on August 31, 1976 by virtue of the Presidential Decree No.1578, this was initiated in response to the appeal of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to help save African wildlife when former President Ferdinand Marcos attended the 3rd World Conference in Kenya. By virtue of the Republic Act 7611 (SEP), administrative jurisdiction of DENR was given to the local government of Palawan, effective December 31, 1993. Management of the area is the responsibility of the Office of the Palawan Council of Sustainable Development (PCSD). It is located in Calauit Island in Busuanga.
Coron Reefs, Coron Bay, Busuanga[edit]




Coron, Palawan


Seven lakes surrounded by craggy limestone cliffs attract hundreds of nature lovers to Coron Reefs in Northern Palawan, near the town of Coron.

The principal dive sites are 12 World War II Japanese shipwrecks sunk on September 24, 1944 by US Navy action. They range in depth from the surface to 40 meters. This large variety offers exciting wreck exploration for enthusiasts, from novice divers and snorkelers and recreational divers to experienced TEC divers. The aquatic views from the sunken Japanese warships off Coron Island are listed in Forbes Traveler Magazine's top 10 best scuba sites in the world.[40]

UNESCO World Heritage Sites[edit]

Puerto-Princesa Subterranean River National Park (1999)

This park features a large limestone karst landscape with an underground river. One of the river's distinguishing features is that it emerges directly into the sea, and its lower portion is subject to tidal influences. The area also represents a significant habitat for biodiversity conservation. The site contains a full 'mountain-to-sea' ecosystem and has some of the most important forests in Asia.

Tubbataha Reef Marine Park (1993)

The Tubbataha Reef Marine Park covers 332 km2, including the North and South Reefs. It is a unique example of an atoll reef with a very high density of marine species; the North Islet serving as a nesting site for birds and marine turtles. The site is an excellent example of a pristine coral reef with a spectacular 100 m perpendicular wall, extensive lagoons and two coral islands.
Ursula Island[edit]
This game refuge and bird sanctuary is situated near the Municipality of Bataraza in southern Palawan. The islet is a migratory and wintering ground for shorebirds and seabirds.[42]

Palawan (Pron. /pəˈlɑːwɑːn/), officially the Province of Palawan (Cuyonon: Probinsya i'ang Palawan; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Palawan) is an archipelagic province of the Philippines that is located in the Mimaropa region. It is the largest province in the country in terms of total area of jurisdiction. Its capital is the City of Puerto Princesa, but it is governed independently from the province as a highly urbanized city.
The islands of Palawan stretch between Mindoro in the northeast and Borneo in the southwest. It lies between the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea. The province is named after its largest island, Palawan Island (09°30′N 118°30′E﻿ / ﻿9.500°N 118.500°E﻿ / 9.500; 118.500), measuring 450 kilometres (280 mi) long, and 50 kilometres (31 mi) wide.[9][10]

History[edit]
The early history of Palawan was determined by a team of researchers led by Dr. Robert B. Fox. They found evidence in the Tabon Caves that humans have lived in Palawan for more than 50,000 years. They also found human bone fragments, from an individual known as Tabon Man, in the municipality of Quezon, as well as tools and other artifacts. Although the origin of the cave dwellers is not yet established, anthropologists believe they may have come from Borneo. The Tabon Caves are now known as the Cradle of Philippine Civilization[9]
Ancient times[edit]
The Palawano and Tagbanwa, are believed to be direct descendants of Palawan's earliest settlers. They developed a non-formal form of government, an alphabet, and a system of trading with sea-borne merchants.[11]
Surviving ancient tribal artwork include reliefs of elephants, sharks, and fish found at Tabon Caves. Approximately 5,000 years ago, a culturally distinct period characterised by jar burials is evident. This era lasted till AD 500. Over 1500 jars and a mural depicting a burial procession were found.[citation needed]
A more recent wave of migrants arrived between 220 and 263 AD. This was during a period known as the Three Kingdoms. "Little, dark people" living in Anwei province in South China were driven South by Han People. Some settled in Thailand, others went farther south to Indonesia, Sumatra, Borneo. They were known as Aetas and Negritos from whom Palawan's Batak tribe descended.[12]
In AD 982, ancient Chinese traders regularly visited the islands.[12] A Chinese author referred to these islands as Kla-ma-yan (Calamian), Palau-ye (Palawan), and Paki-nung (Busuanga). Pottery, china and other artifacts recovered from caves and waters of Palawan attest to trade relations that existed between Chinese and Malay merchants.[11]
Classical period[edit]
In the 12th century, Malay immigrants arrived. Most of their settlements were ruled by Malay chieftains. These people grew rice, ginger, coconuts, sweet potatoes, sugarcane and bananas. They also raised pigs, goats and chickens. Most of their economic activities were fishing, farming, and hunting by the use of bamboo traps and blowguns. The local people had a dialect consisting of 18 syllables.[11] They were followed by the Indonesians of the Majapahit Empire in the 13th century, and they brought with them Buddhism and Hinduism.[13]
Surviving Buddhist images and sculptures are primarily in and near Tabon Cave.
Because of Palawan's proximity to Borneo, southern portions of the island were under the control of the Sultanate of Brunei for more than two centuries, and Islam was introduced. During the same period, trade relations flourished, and intermarriages among the natives and the Chinese, Japanese, Arab and Hindu. The inter-mixing of blood resulted to a distinct breed of Palaweños, both in physical stature and features.[11]
Spanish period[edit]




Taytay, the capital of Province of Calamianes in 1818 (Spanish Palawan)


After Ferdinand Magellan's death, remnants of his fleet landed in Palawan where the bounty of the land saved them from starvation. Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler named the place "Land of Promise."[12]
The northern Calamianes Islands were the first to come under Spanish authority, and were later declared a province separate from the Palawan mainland. In the early 17th century, Spanish friars sent out missions in Cuyo, Agutaya, Taytay and Cagayancillo but they met resistance from Moro communities. Before the 18th century, Spain began to build churches enclosed by garrisons for protection against Moro raids in the town of Cuyo, Taytay, Linapacan and Balabac. In 1749, the Sultanate of Brunei ceded southern Palawan to Spain.[11]
In 1818, the entire island of Palawan, or Paragua as it was called, was organized as a single province named Calamianes, with its capital in Taytay.[citation needed] By 1858, the province was divided into two provinces, namely, Castilla, covering the northern section with Taytay as capital and Asturias in the southern mainland with Puerto Princesa as capital. It was later divided into three districts, Calamianes, Paragua and Balabac, with Principe Alfonso town as its capital. and During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Cuyo became the second capital of Palawan from 1873 to 1903.
American rule[edit]
In 1902, after the Philippine-American War, the Americans established civil rule in northern Palawan, calling it the province of Paragua. In 1903, pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 1363, the province was reorganized to include the southern portions and renamed Palawan, and Puerto Princesa declared as its capital.[11]
Many reforms and projects were later introduced in the province. Construction of school buildings, promotion of agriculture, and bringing people closer to the government were among the priority plans during this era.[11]
Japanese invasion[edit]
Palawan Massacre[edit]




U. S. Army personnel toiled to identify the charred remains of Americans captured at Bataan and burned alive on Palawan. 20 March 1945


Main article: Palawan Massacre
During World War II, in order to prevent the rescue of prisoners of war by the advancing allies, on 14 December 1944, units of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army (under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita) herded the remaining 150 prisoners of war at Puerto Princesa into three covered trenches which were then set on fire using barrels of gasoline. Prisoners who tried to escape the flames were shot down.[14] Others attempted to escape by climbing over a cliff that ran along one side of the trenches, but were later hunted down and killed. Only 11 men escaped the slaughter and between 133 and 141 were killed.
The massacre is the basis for the recently published book Last Man Out: Glenn McDole, USMC, Survivor of the Palawan Massacre in World War II by Bob Wilbanks, and the opening scenes of the 2005 Miramax film, The Great Raid. A memorial has been erected on the site and McDole, in his eighties, was able to attend the dedication.[citation needed]
Liberation[edit]
During the first phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, just off the coast of Palawan, two United States Navy submarines, USS Dace (SS-247) and USS Darter (SS-227) attacked a Japanese cruiser task force led by Admiral Takeo Kurita, sinking his flagship (in which he survived) Atago, and her sister ship Maya. Darter later ran aground that afternoon and was scuttled by USS Nautilus (SS-168).
The island was liberated from the Japanese Imperial Forces by a task force consisting of Filipino and American military personnel between February 28 and April 22, 1945.[citation needed]
Geography[edit]
The province is composed of the long and narrow Palawan Island, plus a number of other smaller islands surrounding it, totalling roughly 1,780 islands and islets. The Calamianes Group of Islands to the northeast consists of Busuanga, Coron, Culion, and Linapacan islands. Balabac Island is located off the southern tip, separated from Borneo by the Balabac Strait. In addition, Palawan covers the Cuyo Islands in the Sulu Sea. The disputed Spratly Islands, located a few hundred kilometres to the west, are considered part of Palawan by the Philippines, and is locally called the "Kalayaan Group of Islands".
Palawan's almost 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) of irregular coastline is lined with rocky coves and sugar-white sandy beaches. It also harbors a vast stretch of virgin forests that carpet its chain of mountain ranges. The mountain heights average 3,500 feet (1,100 m) in altitude, with the highest peak rising to 6,843 feet (2,086 m)[10] at Mount Mantalingahan. The vast mountain areas are the source of valuable timber. The terrain is a mix of coastal plain, craggy foothills, valley deltas, and heavy forest interspersed with riverine arteries that serve as irrigation.[9]
The province has a total land area of 14,649.73 square kilometres (5,656.29 sq mi).[15] When Puerto Princesa City is included for geographical purposes, its land area is 17,030.75 square kilometres (6,575.61 square miles).[15] The land area is distributed to its mainland municipalities, comprising 12,239 square kilometres (4,726 square miles), and the island municipalities, which altogether measure 2,657 square kilometres (1,026 square miles). In terms of archipelagic internal waters, Palawan has the biggest marine resources that covers almost half of the Sulu Sea and a big chunk of the South China Sea that is within the municipal waters of Kalayaan Municipality which was official annexed to the Philippine jurisdiction by virtue of Presidential Decree 1596 dated June 11, 1978.
Climate[edit]
The province has two types of climate. The first, which occurs in the northern and southern extremities and the entire western coast, has two distinct seasons – six months dry and six months wet. The other, which prevails in the eastern coast, has a short dry season of one to three months and no pronounced rainy period during the rest of the year. The southern part of the province is virtually free from tropical depressions but northern Palawan experiences torrential rains during the months of July and August. Summer months serve as peak season for Palawan. Sea voyages are most favorable from March to early June when the seas are calm. The average maximum temperature is 31 °C (88 °F) with little variation all year.[9]
Administrative divisions[edit]







Palawan comprises 433 barangays in 23 municipalities and the capital City of Puerto Princesa. As an archipelago, Palawan has 13 mainland municipalities and 10 island towns. There are three congressional districts, namely: the first district comprising five northern mainland municipalities and nine island towns; the second district composed of six southern mainland towns and the island municipality of Balabac; and the third district covering the capital City of Puerto Princesa and the town of Aborlan. Thirteen municipalities are considered as mainland municipalities, namely Aborlan, Narra, Quezon, Sofronio Española, Brooke's Point, Rizal, and Bataraza (located south); San Vicente, Roxas, Dumaran, El Nido, and Taytay (found in the north). The remaining island municipalities are: Busuanga, Coron, Linapacan and Culion (forming the Calamianes group of islands), Cuyo, Agutaya and Magsaysay (the Cuyo group of islands), Araceli, Cagayancillo, Balabac and Kalayaan (Spratly Islands). The capital, Puerto Princesa is a highly urbanized city that governs itself independently from the province, but it usually grouped with the province for statistical and geographic purposes.
A State of Palawan was advocated by President Rodrigo Duterte during a forum in Palawan in 2015. In July 2016, Duterte's spokesperson noted the possibility of 5 states in Luzon, possibly including Palawan in a State of Southern Tagalog which will include CALABARZON and MIMAROPA. There is an active movement in the Calamian Islands, the northernmost island group of Palawan, to become a separate province due to geographic constraint and cultural differences.

Region[edit]
In 2001, the residents of Palawan voted in a plebiscite to reject inclusion into an expanded Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.[17]
On 17 May 2002, Executive Order No. 103 divided Region IV into Region IV-A (Calabarzon) and Region IV-B (Mimaropa), placing the province of Palawan into Mimaropa.[18]
On 23 May 2005, Executive Order No. 429 directed that Palawan be transferred from Region IV-B to Region VI.[5] However, Palaweños criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa City and all municipalities but one preferring to stay with Region IV-B. Consequently, Administrative Order No. 129 was issued on 19 August 2005 that the implementation of EO 429 be held in abeyance pending approval by the President of its implementation Plan.[6] The Philippine Commission on Elections reported the 2010 Philippine general election results for Palawan as a part of the Region IV-B results.[19] As of 30 June 2011[update], the abeyance was still in effect and Palawan remained a part of Mimaropa.[7]
Geology[edit]




A lagoon in El Nido


The geology of Palawan is, in many ways, unlike other parts of the Philippines. The crust of northeast Palawan was derived from the southeast edge of the continental crust of China, part of the Eurasian Plate. It is the exposed portion of a microcontinent that drifted southward with the opening of the South China Sea. This microcontinent also forms the shallow water north of Palawan in the Reed Bank-Dangerous Ground area of the southern South China Sea. Some of the oldest rocks of the Philippines are found in northeast Palawan (Permian-Carboniferous age). Southwest Palawan exposes primarily ophiolitic material (rocks derived from uplifted oceanic crust and mantle). This 34 Myr old oceanic material[20] appears to have been thrust upon the continental crust. The transition from "oceanic" ophiolite in the southwest to "continental"-type rocks in the northeast occurs in the area of central Palawan around Ulugan Bay and the Sabang area. In the southern coasts of Ulugan Bay and Sabang Beach, are several exposures showing that the Palawan ophiolite has been thrust on to the continent-derived clastic rocks ("Sabang thrust").[21]
The Palawan Trough is an area of deeper water adjacent to the north coast of Palawan in the South China Sea.[22] The Palawan trough is thought to be due to downbending of the continental crust due to the weight of the ophiolite thrust sheet.
Further north, around the Malampaya Sound area and up to the El Nido area, one finds deep marine chert and limestone.




Coron Island


Intruding these rocks in central Palawan (Cleopatra's Needle area) and northern Palawan (Mount Capoas or Kapoas area) are young granite bodies (true granite to granodiorite) of Miocene age (13-15 million years old based on zircon and monazite U-Pb dating).[23] In the Taytay area of northern Palawan, a young basaltic cinder cone is another manifestation of young magmatic activity. The granitic magmatism and basaltic magmatism are both expressions of what has been identified as a widespread post-South China Sea spreading magmatism that has affected many areas around the South China Sea.[24]
Tectonically, Palawan with the Calamian Islands, is considered to be a north-east extension of the Sunda Plate, in collision with the Philippine Mobile Belt at Mindoro.

Special pioneers from the Witnesses have been preaching to prisoners at the Iwahig penal colony in Palawan, and were permitted to build a small Kingdom Hall right on the premises.[27]
Islam[edit]
Further information: Islam in the Philippines
While the formerly Muslim majority population in Mindanao was reduced to 40% as a result of the influx of Christian Filipino settlers in the 20th century, as of 2015[update] Muslims were reported by the Routledge Handbook of Southeast Asian Democratization as forming an "overwhelming majority" in Palawan, as well as the Sulu Archipelago.[28] However, other sources had earlier reported a 50-50 split between Muslims and Christians—with Muslims concentrated mostly in the south of Palawan.[29][30]
Other religions[edit]
There are Buddhists - mainly Vietnamese refugees[citation needed] who settled in Palawan, as well as some ethnic Chinese Buddhists. One notable Vietnamese Buddhist Temple in Palawan is Chùa Vạn Pháp.[31]

Palawan has one of the richest fishing grounds in the country. About 45% of Manila's supply of fish comes from here. Having natural gas reserves of approximately 30,000 trillion cubic feet, the province is the only oil-producing province in the country.[32][33] In addition, tourism is also a thriving sector.
Pearl diving used to be a significant economic activity for Palawan until the advent of plastics.[citation needed] The world's largest pearl, the 240 millimetres (9.4 in) diameter Pearl of Lao Tzu, was found off Palawan in 1934.
The economic and agricultural business growth of province is at 20% per annum.[33] Coconut, sugar, rice, lumber, and livestock are produced here.[10]
Flora and fauna[edit]




A Palawan peacock-pheasant


Unlike most of the Philippines, Palawan is biogeographically part of Sundaland, with a fauna and flora related to that found in Borneo.[34]
Among the many endemic species are the Palawan peacock-pheasant, Philippine mouse-deer, Philippine pangolin, Palawan bearded pig, and Palawan birdwing. In the forests and grasslands, the air resonates with the songs of more than 200 kinds of birds. Over 600 species of butterflies flutter around the mountains and fields of Palawan, attracted to some 1500 hosts plants found here. Endangered sea turtles nest on white sand beaches.[35] Dugong numbers have fallen seriously, although Palawan still has a larger population than any other part of the country[36] and organizations such as Community Centred Conservation (C3) are working to end the unsustainable use of marine resources in Palawan and in Philippines.[37]
In 2007, a "shrew-eating pitcher plant", named Nepenthes attenboroughii was discovered in Mount Victoria. There were many species of pitcher pants discovered in this wild mountain paradise, the most recent is named Nepenthes leonardoi.




Palawan palm forest.


Total forest cover is about 56 percent of the total land area of the province while mangrove forest accounts for 3.35 percent based on the 1998 Landsat imagery. Grasslands dwindled from 19 percent in 1992 to 12.40 percent in 1998. This is an indication of improving soil condition as deteriorating soil is normally invaded by grass species. Brushlands increased to 25 percent of the total land area. Sprawled beneath the seas are nearly 11,000 square kilometers of coral reefs, representing more than 35% of the country's coral reefs.[35]
Palawan, the only Philippine island cited, is rated by the Condé Nast Traveler Readers as the most beautiful island in the world and is also rated by the National Geographic Traveler magazine as the best island destination in East and Southeast Asia region in 2007, and the 13th best island in the world having "incredibly beautiful natural seascapes and landscapes. One of the most biodiverse (terrestrial and marine) islands in the Philippines... The island has had a Biosphere Reserve status since the early 1990s, showing local interest for conservation and sustainable development".[38][39]




Taranaban River


The province was also categorized as "doing well" in the 4th Destination Scorecard survey conducted by the National Geographic Center for Sustainable Destinations, and Conde Nast Traveler magazine voted its beaches, coves and islets as the tourist destination with the best beaches in Asia.[40] Renowned underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau has described the province as having one of the most beautiful seascapes in the world.[35] and Caril Ridley, founder of Palawan Environmental and Marine Studies Center (PEMS) says the Islands of northern Palawan are destined to become a future destination for Asia's growing economic and environmental conferencing.
In 2012, the purple crab was discovered here along with four other species.

Puerto-Princesa Subterranean River National Park (1999)

This park features a large limestone karst landscape with an underground river. One of the river's distinguishing features is that it emerges directly into the sea, and its lower portion is subject to tidal influences. The area also represents a significant habitat for biodiversity conservation. The site contains a full 'mountain-to-sea' ecosystem and has some of the most important forests in Asia.

Tubbataha Reef Marine Park (1993)

The Tubbataha Reef Marine Park covers 332 km2, including the North and South Reefs. It is a unique example of an atoll reef with a very high density of marine species; the North Islet serving as a nesting site for birds and marine turtles. The site is an excellent example of a pristine coral reef with a spectacular 100 m perpendicular wall, extensive lagoons and two coral islands.

Palawan (Pron. /pəˈlɑːwɑːn/), officially the Province of Palawan (Cuyonon: Probinsya i'ang Palawan; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Palawan) is an archipelagic province of the Philippines that is located in the Mimaropa region. It is the largest province in the country in terms of total area of jurisdiction. Its capital is the City of Puerto Princesa, but it is governed independently from the province as a highly urbanized city.
The islands of Palawan stretch between Mindoro in the northeast and Borneo in the southwest. It lies between the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea. The province is named after its largest island, Palawan Island (09°30′N 118°30′E﻿ / ﻿9.500°N 118.500°E﻿ / 9.500; 118.500), measuring 450 kilometres (280 mi) long, and 50 kilometres (31 mi) wide.[9][10]

History[edit]
The early history of Palawan was determined by a team of researchers led by Dr. Robert B. Fox. They found evidence in the Tabon Caves that humans have lived in Palawan for more than 50,000 years. They also found human bone fragments, from an individual known as Tabon Man, in the municipality of Quezon, as well as tools and other artifacts. Although the origin of the cave dwellers is not yet established, anthropologists believe they may have come from Borneo. The Tabon Caves are now known as the Cradle of Philippine Civilization[9]
Ancient times[edit]
The Palawano and Tagbanwa, are believed to be direct descendants of Palawan's earliest settlers. They developed a non-formal form of government, an alphabet, and a system of trading with sea-borne merchants.[11]
Surviving ancient tribal artwork include reliefs of elephants, sharks, and fish found at Tabon Caves. Approximately 5,000 years ago, a culturally distinct period characterised by jar burials is evident. This era lasted till AD 500. Over 1500 jars and a mural depicting a burial procession were found.[citation needed]
A more recent wave of migrants arrived between 220 and 263 AD. This was during a period known as the Three Kingdoms. "Little, dark people" living in Anwei province in South China were driven South by Han People. Some settled in Thailand, others went farther south to Indonesia, Sumatra, Borneo. They were known as Aetas and Negritos from whom Palawan's Batak tribe descended.[12]
In AD 982, ancient Chinese traders regularly visited the islands.[12] A Chinese author referred to these islands as Kla-ma-yan (Calamian), Palau-ye (Palawan), and Paki-nung (Busuanga). Pottery, china and other artifacts recovered from caves and waters of Palawan attest to trade relations that existed between Chinese and Malay merchants.[11]
Classical period[edit]
In the 12th century, Malay immigrants arrived. Most of their settlements were ruled by Malay chieftains. These people grew rice, ginger, coconuts, sweet potatoes, sugarcane and bananas. They also raised pigs, goats and chickens. Most of their economic activities were fishing, farming, and hunting by the use of bamboo traps and blowguns. The local people had a dialect consisting of 18 syllables.[11] They were followed by the Indonesians of the Majapahit Empire in the 13th century, and they brought with them Buddhism and Hinduism.[13]
Surviving Buddhist images and sculptures are primarily in and near Tabon Cave.
Because of Palawan's proximity to Borneo, southern portions of the island were under the control of the Sultanate of Brunei for more than two centuries, and Islam was introduced. During the same period, trade relations flourished, and intermarriages among the natives and the Chinese, Japanese, Arab and Hindu. The inter-mixing of blood resulted to a distinct breed of Palaweños, both in physical stature and features.[11]
Spanish period[edit]




Taytay, the capital of Province of Calamianes in 1818 (Spanish Palawan)


After Ferdinand Magellan's death, remnants of his fleet landed in Palawan where the bounty of the land saved them from starvation. Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler named the place "Land of Promise."[12]
The northern Calamianes Islands were the first to come under Spanish authority, and were later declared a province separate from the Palawan mainland. In the early 17th century, Spanish friars sent out missions in Cuyo, Agutaya, Taytay and Cagayancillo but they met resistance from Moro communities. Before the 18th century, Spain began to build churches enclosed by garrisons for protection against Moro raids in the town of Cuyo, Taytay, Linapacan and Balabac. In 1749, the Sultanate of Brunei ceded southern Palawan to Spain.[11]
In 1818, the entire island of Palawan, or Paragua as it was called, was organized as a single province named Calamianes, with its capital in Taytay.[citation needed] By 1858, the province was divided into two provinces, namely, Castilla, covering the northern section with Taytay as capital and Asturias in the southern mainland with Puerto Princesa as capital. It was later divided into three districts, Calamianes, Paragua and Balabac, with Principe Alfonso town as its capital. and During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Cuyo became the second capital of Palawan from 1873 to 1903.
American rule[edit]
In 1902, after the Philippine-American War, the Americans established civil rule in northern Palawan, calling it the province of Paragua. In 1903, pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 1363, the province was reorganized to include the southern portions and renamed Palawan, and Puerto Princesa declared as its capital.[11]
Many reforms and projects were later introduced in the province. Construction of school buildings, promotion of agriculture, and bringing people closer to the government were among the priority plans during this era.[11]
Japanese invasion[edit]
Palawan Massacre[edit]




U. S. Army personnel toiled to identify the charred remains of Americans captured at Bataan and burned alive on Palawan. 20 March 1945


Main article: Palawan Massacre
During World War II, in order to prevent the rescue of prisoners of war by the advancing allies, on 14 December 1944, units of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army (under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita) herded the remaining 150 prisoners of war at Puerto Princesa into three covered trenches which were then set on fire using barrels of gasoline. Prisoners who tried to escape the flames were shot down.[14] Others attempted to escape by climbing over a cliff that ran along one side of the trenches, but were later hunted down and killed. Only 11 men escaped the slaughter and between 133 and 141 were killed.
The massacre is the basis for the recently published book Last Man Out: Glenn McDole, USMC, Survivor of the Palawan Massacre in World War II by Bob Wilbanks, and the opening scenes of the 2005 Miramax film, The Great Raid. A memorial has been erected on the site and McDole, in his eighties, was able to attend the dedication.[citation needed]
Liberation[edit]
During the first phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, just off the coast of Palawan, two United States Navy submarines, USS Dace (SS-247) and USS Darter (SS-227) attacked a Japanese cruiser task force led by Admiral Takeo Kurita, sinking his flagship (in which he survived) Atago, and her sister ship Maya. Darter later ran aground that afternoon and was scuttled by USS Nautilus (SS-168).
The island was liberated from the Japanese Imperial Forces by a task force consisting of Filipino and American military personnel between February 28 and April 22, 1945.[citation needed]
Geography[edit]
The province is composed of the long and narrow Palawan Island, plus a number of other smaller islands surrounding it, totalling roughly 1,780 islands and islets. The Calamianes Group of Islands to the northeast consists of Busuanga, Coron, Culion, and Linapacan islands. Balabac Island is located off the southern tip, separated from Borneo by the Balabac Strait. In addition, Palawan covers the Cuyo Islands in the Sulu Sea. The disputed Spratly Islands, located a few hundred kilometres to the west, are considered part of Palawan by the Philippines, and is locally called the "Kalayaan Group of Islands".
Palawan's almost 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) of irregular coastline is lined with rocky coves and sugar-white sandy beaches. It also harbors a vast stretch of virgin forests that carpet its chain of mountain ranges. The mountain heights average 3,500 feet (1,100 m) in altitude, with the highest peak rising to 6,843 feet (2,086 m)[10] at Mount Mantalingahan. The vast mountain areas are the source of valuable timber. The terrain is a mix of coastal plain, craggy foothills, valley deltas, and heavy forest interspersed with riverine arteries that serve as irrigation.[9]
The province has a total land area of 14,649.73 square kilometres (5,656.29 sq mi).[15] When Puerto Princesa City is included for geographical purposes, its land area is 17,030.75 square kilometres (6,575.61 square miles).[15] The land area is distributed to its mainland municipalities, comprising 12,239 square kilometres (4,726 square miles), and the island municipalities, which altogether measure 2,657 square kilometres (1,026 square miles). In terms of archipelagic internal waters, Palawan has the biggest marine resources that covers almost half of the Sulu Sea and a big chunk of the South China Sea that is within the municipal waters of Kalayaan Municipality which was official annexed to the Philippine jurisdiction by virtue of Presidential Decree 1596 dated June 11, 1978.
Climate[edit]
The province has two types of climate. The first, which occurs in the northern and southern extremities and the entire western coast, has two distinct seasons – six months dry and six months wet. The other, which prevails in the eastern coast, has a short dry season of one to three months and no pronounced rainy period during the rest of the year. The southern part of the province is virtually free from tropical depressions but northern Palawan experiences torrential rains during the months of July and August. Summer months serve as peak season for Palawan. Sea voyages are most favorable from March to early June when the seas are calm. The average maximum temperature is 31 °C (88 °F) with little variation all year.[9]
Administrative divisions[edit]







Palawan comprises 433 barangays in 23 municipalities and the capital City of Puerto Princesa. As an archipelago, Palawan has 13 mainland municipalities and 10 island towns. There are three congressional districts, namely: the first district comprising five northern mainland municipalities and nine island towns; the second district composed of six southern mainland towns and the island municipality of Balabac; and the third district covering the capital City of Puerto Princesa and the town of Aborlan. Thirteen municipalities are considered as mainland municipalities, namely Aborlan, Narra, Quezon, Sofronio Española, Brooke's Point, Rizal, and Bataraza (located south); San Vicente, Roxas, Dumaran, El Nido, and Taytay (found in the north). The remaining island municipalities are: Busuanga, Coron, Linapacan and Culion (forming the Calamianes group of islands), Cuyo, Agutaya and Magsaysay (the Cuyo group of islands), Araceli, Cagayancillo, Balabac and Kalayaan (Spratly Islands). The capital, Puerto Princesa is a highly urbanized city that governs itself independently from the province, but it usually grouped with the province for statistical and geographic purposes.
A State of Palawan was advocated by President Rodrigo Duterte during a forum in Palawan in 2015. In July 2016, Duterte's spokesperson noted the possibility of 5 states in Luzon, possibly including Palawan in a State of Southern Tagalog which will include CALABARZON and MIMAROPA. There is an active movement in the Calamian Islands, the northernmost island group of Palawan, to become a separate province due to geographic constraint and cultural differences.

Region[edit]
In 2001, the residents of Palawan voted in a plebiscite to reject inclusion into an expanded Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.[17]
On 17 May 2002, Executive Order No. 103 divided Region IV into Region IV-A (Calabarzon) and Region IV-B (Mimaropa), placing the province of Palawan into Mimaropa.[18]
On 23 May 2005, Executive Order No. 429 directed that Palawan be transferred from Region IV-B to Region VI.[5] However, Palaweños criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa City and all municipalities but one preferring to stay with Region IV-B. Consequently, Administrative Order No. 129 was issued on 19 August 2005 that the implementation of EO 429 be held in abeyance pending approval by the President of its implementation Plan.[6] The Philippine Commission on Elections reported the 2010 Philippine general election results for Palawan as a part of the Region IV-B results.[19] As of 30 June 2011[update], the abeyance was still in effect and Palawan remained a part of Mimaropa.[7]
Geology[edit]




A lagoon in El Nido


The geology of Palawan is, in many ways, unlike other parts of the Philippines. The crust of northeast Palawan was derived from the southeast edge of the continental crust of China, part of the Eurasian Plate. It is the exposed portion of a microcontinent that drifted southward with the opening of the South China Sea. This microcontinent also forms the shallow water north of Palawan in the Reed Bank-Dangerous Ground area of the southern South China Sea. Some of the oldest rocks of the Philippines are found in northeast Palawan (Permian-Carboniferous age). Southwest Palawan exposes primarily ophiolitic material (rocks derived from uplifted oceanic crust and mantle). This 34 Myr old oceanic material[20] appears to have been thrust upon the continental crust. The transition from "oceanic" ophiolite in the southwest to "continental"-type rocks in the northeast occurs in the area of central Palawan around Ulugan Bay and the Sabang area. In the southern coasts of Ulugan Bay and Sabang Beach, are several exposures showing that the Palawan ophiolite has been thrust on to the continent-derived clastic rocks ("Sabang thrust").[21]
The Palawan Trough is an area of deeper water adjacent to the north coast of Palawan in the South China Sea.[22] The Palawan trough is thought to be due to downbending of the continental crust due to the weight of the ophiolite thrust sheet.
Further north, around the Malampaya Sound area and up to the El Nido area, one finds deep marine chert and limestone.




Coron Island


Intruding these rocks in central Palawan (Cleopatra's Needle area) and northern Palawan (Mount Capoas or Kapoas area) are young granite bodies (true granite to granodiorite) of Miocene age (13-15 million years old based on zircon and monazite U-Pb dating).[23] In the Taytay area of northern Palawan, a young basaltic cinder cone is another manifestation of young magmatic activity. The granitic magmatism and basaltic magmatism are both expressions of what has been identified as a widespread post-South China Sea spreading magmatism that has affected many areas around the South China Sea.[24]
Tectonically, Palawan with the Calamian Islands, is considered to be a north-east extension of the Sunda Plate, in collision with the Philippine Mobile Belt at Mindoro.

Further information: Tribes of Palawan
The population of Palawan in the 2015 census was 849,469 people,[8] with a density of 58 inhabitants per square kilometre or 150 inhabitants per square mile. When Puerto Princesa City is included for geographical purposes, the population is 1,104,585 people, with a density of 65/km2 (168/sq mi).
The province is a melting pot of 87 different cultural groups and races. Basically, its culture bears a strong influence from China, India and the Middle East.[citation needed] Influx of migrants from other parts of the Philippines, particularly from Muslim Mindanao, accounts for the high population growth rate of 3.98% annually. The native-born Palaweños still predominate the populace. Eighteen percent is composed of cultural minority groups such as the Tagbanwa, Palawano, Batak, and Molbog.
Religion[edit]
Roman Catholicism[edit]
Main article: Apostolic Vicariate of Puerto Princesa
The predominant religion in Palawan is Roman Catholicism. In 2014, the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Puerto Prinsesa had a 68% adherence while the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Taytay (Northern Palawan) had an 88% adherence.[citation needed]One of the religious orders that had a significant mission in the islands is the Order of Augustinian Recollects.
The island of Palawan is divided into two Apostolic Vicariates: the Apostolic Vicariate of Puerto Princesa in Southern Palawan and the Apostolic Vicariate of Taytay in Northern Palawan.




Immaculate Conception Cathedral in Puerto Princesa, Palawan


Protestantism and other groups[edit]
Several Baptist and other Protestant denominations have a strong presence on Palawan as do the Church of the Foursquare Gospel in the Philippines, and the Seventh-day Adventists. Charismatic groups such as Jesus is Lord (JIL), Jesus Touch Fellowship (JTF) and the Life Church (formerly known at the Life Renewal Center).
The Members Church of God International popularly called Ang Dating Daan establishes three church districts namely Coron, Northern Palawan and Southern Palawan which signifies strong membership in the province.
Other Christian denominations including the indigenous Iglesia ni Cristo has many local congregations in the province.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the United Church of Christ in the Philippines or (UCCP), the Jesus Miracle Crusade, the Pentecostal Missionary Church of Christ or PMCC as well as the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (Philippine Independent Church or Aglipayan Church) which is standing as one diocese (The Diocese of Palawan). Jehovah's Witnesses have an active membership of 181,236 in the Philippines as of 2012. Special pioneers from the Witnesses have been preaching to prisoners at the Iwahig penal colony in Palawan, and were permitted to build a small Kingdom Hall right on the premises.[27]
Islam[edit]
Further information: Islam in the Philippines
While the formerly Muslim majority population in Mindanao was reduced to 40% as a result of the influx of Christian Filipino settlers in the 20th century, as of 2015[update] Muslims were reported by the Routledge Handbook of Southeast Asian Democratization as forming an "overwhelming majority" in Palawan, as well as the Sulu Archipelago.[28] However, other sources had earlier reported a 50-50 split between Muslims and Christians—with Muslims concentrated mostly in the south of Palawan.[29][30]
Other religions[edit]
There are Buddhists - mainly Vietnamese refugees[citation needed] who settled in Palawan, as well as some ethnic Chinese Buddhists. One notable Vietnamese Buddhist Temple in Palawan is Chùa Vạn Pháp.[31]
Most of the ethnic minorities such as Batak and Tagbanwa are animists, but many have become Christians (usually Protestant) or have joined other sects.

Economy[edit]
Palawan's economy is basically agricultural. The three major crops are palay, corn and coconut. Mineral resources include nickel, copper, manganese, and chromite. Logging is also a major industry. Palawan has one of the richest fishing grounds in the country. About 45% of Manila's supply of fish comes from here. Having natural gas reserves of approximately 30,000 trillion cubic feet, the province is the only oil-producing province in the country.[32][33] In addition, tourism is also a thriving sector.
Pearl diving used to be a significant economic activity for Palawan until the advent of plastics.[citation needed] The world's largest pearl, the 240 millimetres (9.4 in) diameter Pearl of Lao Tzu, was found off Palawan in 1934.
The economic and agricultural business growth of province is at 20% per annum.[33] Coconut, sugar, rice, lumber, and livestock are produced here.[10]
Flora and fauna[edit]




A Palawan peacock-pheasant


Unlike most of the Philippines, Palawan is biogeographically part of Sundaland, with a fauna and flora related to that found in Borneo.[34]
Among the many endemic species are the Palawan peacock-pheasant, Philippine mouse-deer, Philippine pangolin, Palawan bearded pig, and Palawan birdwing. In the forests and grasslands, the air resonates with the songs of more than 200 kinds of birds. Over 600 species of butterflies flutter around the mountains and fields of Palawan, attracted to some 1500 hosts plants found here. Endangered sea turtles nest on white sand beaches.[35] Dugong numbers have fallen seriously, although Palawan still has a larger population than any other part of the country[36] and organizations such as Community Centred Conservation (C3) are working to end the unsustainable use of marine resources in Palawan and in Philippines.[37]
In 2007, a "shrew-eating pitcher plant", named Nepenthes attenboroughii was discovered in Mount Victoria. There were many species of pitcher pants discovered in this wild mountain paradise, the most recent is named Nepenthes leonardoi.




Palawan palm forest.


Total forest cover is about 56 percent of the total land area of the province while mangrove forest accounts for 3.35 percent based on the 1998 Landsat imagery. Grasslands dwindled from 19 percent in 1992 to 12.40 percent in 1998. This is an indication of improving soil condition as deteriorating soil is normally invaded by grass species. Brushlands increased to 25 percent of the total land area. Sprawled beneath the seas are nearly 11,000 square kilometers of coral reefs, representing more than 35% of the country's coral reefs.[35]
Palawan, the only Philippine island cited, is rated by the Condé Nast Traveler Readers as the most beautiful island in the world and is also rated by the National Geographic Traveler magazine as the best island destination in East and Southeast Asia region in 2007, and the 13th best island in the world having "incredibly beautiful natural seascapes and landscapes. One of the most biodiverse (terrestrial and marine) islands in the Philippines...

A game reserve and wildlife sanctuary of exotic African animals and endangered endemic animals of Palawan. The reserve was established on August 31, 1976 by virtue of the Presidential Decree No.1578, this was initiated in response to the appeal of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to help save African wildlife when former President Ferdinand Marcos attended the 3rd World Conference in Kenya. By virtue of the Republic Act 7611 (SEP), administrative jurisdiction of DENR was given to the local government of Palawan, effective December 31, 1993. Management of the area is the responsibility of the Office of the Palawan Council of Sustainable Development (PCSD). It is located in Calauit Island in Busuanga.
Coron Reefs, Coron Bay, Busuanga[edit]




Coron, Palawan


Seven lakes surrounded by craggy limestone cliffs attract hundreds of nature lovers to Coron Reefs in Northern Palawan, near the town of Coron. Busuanga Island, whose main town is Coron, is the jump-off point for numerous dive operators. The principal dive sites are 12 World War II Japanese shipwrecks sunk on September 24, 1944 by US Navy action. They range in depth from the surface to 40 meters. This large variety offers exciting wreck exploration for enthusiasts, from novice divers and snorkelers and recreational divers to experienced TEC divers. The aquatic views from the sunken Japanese warships off Coron Island are listed in Forbes Traveler Magazine's top 10 best scuba sites in the world.[40]

(which partnered with Conservation International) listed El Nido's sister hotel resorts El Nido Lagen Island and El Nido Miniloc Island in Miniloc and Lagen Islands as "conservation-minded places on a mission to protect the local environment". Travel + Leisure's 20 Favorite Green Hotels scored El Nido Resort's protection of Palawan's giant clam gardens and the re-introduction of endangered Philippine cockatoos: "8.

Located in the Municipality of Taytay, this important ecological and economic zone is a watershed and fishing ground, and the habitat of Bottle-nosed and Irrawaddy dolphins.[42]
UNESCO World Heritage Sites[edit]

Puerto-Princesa Subterranean River National Park (1999)

This park features a large limestone karst landscape with an underground river. One of the river's distinguishing features is that it emerges directly into the sea, and its lower portion is subject to tidal influences. The area also represents a significant habitat for biodiversity conservation. The site contains a full 'mountain-to-sea' ecosystem and has some of the most important forests in Asia.

Tubbataha Reef Marine Park (1993)

The Tubbataha Reef Marine Park covers 332 km2, including the North and South Reefs. It is a unique example of an atoll reef with a very high density of marine species; the North Islet serving as a nesting site for birds and marine turtles. The site is an excellent example of a pristine coral reef with a spectacular 100 m perpendicular wall, extensive lagoons and two coral islands.
Ursula Island[edit]
This game refuge and bird sanctuary is situated near the Municipality of Bataraza in southern Palawan. The islet is a migratory and wintering ground for shorebirds and seabirds.[42]
Rasa Island Wildlife Sanctuary[edit]
Main article: Rasa Island
This 1,983-hectare (4,900-acre) protected area located in the municipality of Narra is a nesting ground of the endemic Philippine cockatoo or katala. It also harbors other rare bird species and marine turtles.

Palawan (Pron. /pəˈlɑːwɑːn/), officially the Province of Palawan (Cuyonon: Probinsya i'ang Palawan; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Palawan) is an archipelagic province of the Philippines that is located in the Mimaropa region. It is the largest province in the country in terms of total area of jurisdiction. Its capital is the City of Puerto Princesa, but it is governed independently from the province as a highly urbanized city.
The islands of Palawan stretch between Mindoro in the northeast and Borneo in the southwest. It lies between the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea. The province is named after its largest island, Palawan Island (09°30′N 118°30′E﻿ / ﻿9.500°N 118.500°E﻿ / 9.500; 118.500), measuring 450 kilometres (280 mi) long, and 50 kilometres (31 mi) wide.[9][10]

History[edit]
The early history of Palawan was determined by a team of researchers led by Dr. Robert B. Fox. They found evidence in the Tabon Caves that humans have lived in Palawan for more than 50,000 years. They also found human bone fragments, from an individual known as Tabon Man, in the municipality of Quezon, as well as tools and other artifacts. Although the origin of the cave dwellers is not yet established, anthropologists believe they may have come from Borneo. The Tabon Caves are now known as the Cradle of Philippine Civilization[9]
Ancient times[edit]
The Palawano and Tagbanwa, are believed to be direct descendants of Palawan's earliest settlers. They developed a non-formal form of government, an alphabet, and a system of trading with sea-borne merchants.[11]
Surviving ancient tribal artwork include reliefs of elephants, sharks, and fish found at Tabon Caves. Approximately 5,000 years ago, a culturally distinct period characterised by jar burials is evident. This era lasted till AD 500. Over 1500 jars and a mural depicting a burial procession were found.[citation needed]
A more recent wave of migrants arrived between 220 and 263 AD. This was during a period known as the Three Kingdoms. "Little, dark people" living in Anwei province in South China were driven South by Han People. Some settled in Thailand, others went farther south to Indonesia, Sumatra, Borneo. They were known as Aetas and Negritos from whom Palawan's Batak tribe descended.[12]
In AD 982, ancient Chinese traders regularly visited the islands.[12] A Chinese author referred to these islands as Kla-ma-yan (Calamian), Palau-ye (Palawan), and Paki-nung (Busuanga). Pottery, china and other artifacts recovered from caves and waters of Palawan attest to trade relations that existed between Chinese and Malay merchants.[11]
Classical period[edit]
In the 12th century, Malay immigrants arrived. Most of their settlements were ruled by Malay chieftains. These people grew rice, ginger, coconuts, sweet potatoes, sugarcane and bananas. They also raised pigs, goats and chickens. Most of their economic activities were fishing, farming, and hunting by the use of bamboo traps and blowguns. The local people had a dialect consisting of 18 syllables.[11] They were followed by the Indonesians of the Majapahit Empire in the 13th century, and they brought with them Buddhism and Hinduism.[13]
Surviving Buddhist images and sculptures are primarily in and near Tabon Cave.
Because of Palawan's proximity to Borneo, southern portions of the island were under the control of the Sultanate of Brunei for more than two centuries, and Islam was introduced. During the same period, trade relations flourished, and intermarriages among the natives and the Chinese, Japanese, Arab and Hindu. The inter-mixing of blood resulted to a distinct breed of Palaweños, both in physical stature and features.[11]
Spanish period[edit]




Taytay, the capital of Province of Calamianes in 1818 (Spanish Palawan)


After Ferdinand Magellan's death, remnants of his fleet landed in Palawan where the bounty of the land saved them from starvation. Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler named the place "Land of Promise."[12]
The northern Calamianes Islands were the first to come under Spanish authority, and were later declared a province separate from the Palawan mainland. In the early 17th century, Spanish friars sent out missions in Cuyo, Agutaya, Taytay and Cagayancillo but they met resistance from Moro communities. Before the 18th century, Spain began to build churches enclosed by garrisons for protection against Moro raids in the town of Cuyo, Taytay, Linapacan and Balabac. In 1749, the Sultanate of Brunei ceded southern Palawan to Spain.[11]
In 1818, the entire island of Palawan, or Paragua as it was called, was organized as a single province named Calamianes, with its capital in Taytay.[citation needed] By 1858, the province was divided into two provinces, namely, Castilla, covering the northern section with Taytay as capital and Asturias in the southern mainland with Puerto Princesa as capital. It was later divided into three districts, Calamianes, Paragua and Balabac, with Principe Alfonso town as its capital. and During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Cuyo became the second capital of Palawan from 1873 to 1903.
American rule[edit]
In 1902, after the Philippine-American War, the Americans established civil rule in northern Palawan, calling it the province of Paragua. In 1903, pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 1363, the province was reorganized to include the southern portions and renamed Palawan, and Puerto Princesa declared as its capital.[11]
Many reforms and projects were later introduced in the province. Construction of school buildings, promotion of agriculture, and bringing people closer to the government were among the priority plans during this era.[11]
Japanese invasion[edit]
Palawan Massacre[edit]




U. S. Army personnel toiled to identify the charred remains of Americans captured at Bataan and burned alive on Palawan. 20 March 1945


Main article: Palawan Massacre
During World War II, in order to prevent the rescue of prisoners of war by the advancing allies, on 14 December 1944, units of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army (under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita) herded the remaining 150 prisoners of war at Puerto Princesa into three covered trenches which were then set on fire using barrels of gasoline. Prisoners who tried to escape the flames were shot down.[14] Others attempted to escape by climbing over a cliff that ran along one side of the trenches, but were later hunted down and killed. Only 11 men escaped the slaughter and between 133 and 141 were killed.
The massacre is the basis for the recently published book Last Man Out: Glenn McDole, USMC, Survivor of the Palawan Massacre in World War II by Bob Wilbanks, and the opening scenes of the 2005 Miramax film, The Great Raid. A memorial has been erected on the site and McDole, in his eighties, was able to attend the dedication.[citation needed]
Liberation[edit]
During the first phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, just off the coast of Palawan, two United States Navy submarines, USS Dace (SS-247) and USS Darter (SS-227) attacked a Japanese cruiser task force led by Admiral Takeo Kurita, sinking his flagship (in which he survived) Atago, and her sister ship Maya. Darter later ran aground that afternoon and was scuttled by USS Nautilus (SS-168).
The island was liberated from the Japanese Imperial Forces by a task force consisting of Filipino and American military personnel between February 28 and April 22, 1945.[citation needed]
Geography[edit]
The province is composed of the long and narrow Palawan Island, plus a number of other smaller islands surrounding it, totalling roughly 1,780 islands and islets. The Calamianes Group of Islands to the northeast consists of Busuanga, Coron, Culion, and Linapacan islands. Balabac Island is located off the southern tip, separated from Borneo by the Balabac Strait. In addition, Palawan covers the Cuyo Islands in the Sulu Sea. The disputed Spratly Islands, located a few hundred kilometres to the west, are considered part of Palawan by the Philippines, and is locally called the "Kalayaan Group of Islands".
Palawan's almost 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) of irregular coastline is lined with rocky coves and sugar-white sandy beaches. It also harbors a vast stretch of virgin forests that carpet its chain of mountain ranges. The mountain heights average 3,500 feet (1,100 m) in altitude, with the highest peak rising to 6,843 feet (2,086 m)[10] at Mount Mantalingahan. The vast mountain areas are the source of valuable timber. The terrain is a mix of coastal plain, craggy foothills, valley deltas, and heavy forest interspersed with riverine arteries that serve as irrigation.[9]
The province has a total land area of 14,649.73 square kilometres (5,656.29 sq mi).[15] When Puerto Princesa City is included for geographical purposes, its land area is 17,030.75 square kilometres (6,575.61 square miles).[15] The land area is distributed to its mainland municipalities, comprising 12,239 square kilometres (4,726 square miles), and the island municipalities, which altogether measure 2,657 square kilometres (1,026 square miles). In terms of archipelagic internal waters, Palawan has the biggest marine resources that covers almost half of the Sulu Sea and a big chunk of the South China Sea that is within the municipal waters of Kalayaan Municipality which was official annexed to the Philippine jurisdiction by virtue of Presidential Decree 1596 dated June 11, 1978.
Climate[edit]
The province has two types of climate. The first, which occurs in the northern and southern extremities and the entire western coast, has two distinct seasons – six months dry and six months wet. The other, which prevails in the eastern coast, has a short dry season of one to three months and no pronounced rainy period during the rest of the year. The southern part of the province is virtually free from tropical depressions but northern Palawan experiences torrential rains during the months of July and August. Summer months serve as peak season for Palawan. Sea voyages are most favorable from March to early June when the seas are calm. The average maximum temperature is 31 °C (88 °F) with little variation all year.[9]
Administrative divisions[edit]







Palawan comprises 433 barangays in 23 municipalities and the capital City of Puerto Princesa. As an archipelago, Palawan has 13 mainland municipalities and 10 island towns. There are three congressional districts, namely: the first district comprising five northern mainland municipalities and nine island towns; the second district composed of six southern mainland towns and the island municipality of Balabac; and the third district covering the capital City of Puerto Princesa and the town of Aborlan. Thirteen municipalities are considered as mainland municipalities, namely Aborlan, Narra, Quezon, Sofronio Española, Brooke's Point, Rizal, and Bataraza (located south); San Vicente, Roxas, Dumaran, El Nido, and Taytay (found in the north). The remaining island municipalities are: Busuanga, Coron, Linapacan and Culion (forming the Calamianes group of islands), Cuyo, Agutaya and Magsaysay (the Cuyo group of islands), Araceli, Cagayancillo, Balabac and Kalayaan (Spratly Islands). The capital, Puerto Princesa is a highly urbanized city that governs itself independently from the province, but it usually grouped with the province for statistical and geographic purposes.
A State of Palawan was advocated by President Rodrigo Duterte during a forum in Palawan in 2015. In July 2016, Duterte's spokesperson noted the possibility of 5 states in Luzon, possibly including Palawan in a State of Southern Tagalog which will include CALABARZON and MIMAROPA. There is an active movement in the Calamian Islands, the northernmost island group of Palawan, to become a separate province due to geographic constraint and cultural differences.

Region[edit]
In 2001, the residents of Palawan voted in a plebiscite to reject inclusion into an expanded Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.[17]
On 17 May 2002, Executive Order No. 103 divided Region IV into Region IV-A (Calabarzon) and Region IV-B (Mimaropa), placing the province of Palawan into Mimaropa.[18]
On 23 May 2005, Executive Order No. 429 directed that Palawan be transferred from Region IV-B to Region VI.[5] However, Palaweños criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa City and all municipalities but one preferring to stay with Region IV-B. Consequently, Administrative Order No. 129 was issued on 19 August 2005 that the implementation of EO 429 be held in abeyance pending approval by the President of its implementation Plan.[6] The Philippine Commission on Elections reported the 2010 Philippine general election results for Palawan as a part of the Region IV-B results.[19] As of 30 June 2011[update], the abeyance was still in effect and Palawan remained a part of Mimaropa.[7]

The geology of Palawan is, in many ways, unlike other parts of the Philippines. The crust of northeast Palawan was derived from the southeast edge of the continental crust of China, part of the Eurasian Plate. It is the exposed portion of a microcontinent that drifted southward with the opening of the South China Sea. This microcontinent also forms the shallow water north of Palawan in the Reed Bank-Dangerous Ground area of the southern South China Sea. Some of the oldest rocks of the Philippines are found in northeast Palawan (Permian-Carboniferous age). Southwest Palawan exposes primarily ophiolitic material (rocks derived from uplifted oceanic crust and mantle). This 34 Myr old oceanic material[20] appears to have been thrust upon the continental crust. The transition from "oceanic" ophiolite in the southwest to "continental"-type rocks in the northeast occurs in the area of central Palawan around Ulugan Bay and the Sabang area. In the southern coasts of Ulugan Bay and Sabang Beach, are several exposures showing that the Palawan ophiolite has been thrust on to the continent-derived clastic rocks ("Sabang thrust").[21]
The Palawan Trough is an area of deeper water adjacent to the north coast of Palawan in the South China Sea.[22] The Palawan trough is thought to be due to downbending of the continental crust due to the weight of the ophiolite thrust sheet.
Further north, around the Malampaya Sound area and up to the El Nido area, one finds deep marine chert and limestone.




Coron Island


Intruding these rocks in central Palawan (Cleopatra's Needle area) and northern Palawan (Mount Capoas or Kapoas area) are young granite bodies (true granite to granodiorite) of Miocene age (13-15 million years old based on zircon and monazite U-Pb dating).[23] In the Taytay area of northern Palawan, a young basaltic cinder cone is another manifestation of young magmatic activity. The granitic magmatism and basaltic magmatism are both expressions of what has been identified as a widespread post-South China Sea spreading magmatism that has affected many areas around the South China Sea.[24]
Tectonically, Palawan with the Calamian Islands, is considered to be a north-east extension of the Sunda Plate, in collision with the Philippine Mobile Belt at Mindoro.

The province is a melting pot of 87 different cultural groups and races. Basically, its culture bears a strong influence from China, India and the Middle East.[citation needed] Influx of migrants from other parts of the Philippines, particularly from Muslim Mindanao, accounts for the high population growth rate of 3.98% annually. The native-born Palaweños still predominate the populace. Eighteen percent is composed of cultural minority groups such as the Tagbanwa, Palawano, Batak, and Molbog.
Religion[edit]
Roman Catholicism[edit]
Main article: Apostolic Vicariate of Puerto Princesa
The predominant religion in Palawan is Roman Catholicism. In 2014, the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Puerto Prinsesa had a 68% adherence while the Roman Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Taytay (Northern Palawan) had an 88% adherence.[citation needed]One of the religious orders that had a significant mission in the islands is the Order of Augustinian Recollects.

Protestantism and other groups[edit]
Several Baptist and other Protestant denominations have a strong presence on Palawan as do the Church of the Foursquare Gospel in the Philippines, and the Seventh-day Adventists. Charismatic groups such as Jesus is Lord (JIL), Jesus Touch Fellowship (JTF) and the Life Church (formerly known at the Life Renewal Center).
The Members Church of God International popularly called Ang Dating Daan establishes three church districts namely Coron, Northern Palawan and Southern Palawan which signifies strong membership in the province.

Jehovah's Witnesses have an active membership of 181,236 in the Philippines as of 2012. Special pioneers from the Witnesses have been preaching to prisoners at the Iwahig penal colony in Palawan, and were permitted to build a small Kingdom Hall right on the premises.[27]
Islam[edit]
Further information: Islam in the Philippines
While the formerly Muslim majority population in Mindanao was reduced to 40% as a result of the influx of Christian Filipino settlers in the 20th century, as of 2015[update] Muslims were reported by the Routledge Handbook of Southeast Asian Democratization as forming an "overwhelming majority" in Palawan, as well as the Sulu Archipelago.[28] However, other sources had earlier reported a 50-50 split between Muslims and Christians—with Muslims concentrated mostly in the south of Palawan.[29][30]
Other religions[edit]
There are Buddhists - mainly Vietnamese refugees[citation needed] who settled in Palawan, as well as some ethnic Chinese Buddhists. One notable Vietnamese Buddhist Temple in Palawan is Chùa Vạn Pháp.[31]
Most of the ethnic minorities such as Batak and Tagbanwa are animists, but many have become Christians (usually Protestant) or have joined other sects.

Economy[edit]
Palawan's economy is basically agricultural. The three major crops are palay, corn and coconut. Mineral resources include nickel, copper, manganese, and chromite. Logging is also a major industry. Palawan has one of the richest fishing grounds in the country. About 45% of Manila's supply of fish comes from here. Having natural gas reserves of approximately 30,000 trillion cubic feet, the province is the only oil-producing province in the country.[32][33] In addition, tourism is also a thriving sector.
Pearl diving used to be a significant economic activity for Palawan until the advent of plastics.[citation needed] The world's largest pearl, the 240 millimetres (9.4 in) diameter Pearl of Lao Tzu, was found off Palawan in 1934.
The economic and agricultural business growth of province is at 20% per annum.[33] Coconut, sugar, rice, lumber, and livestock are produced here.[10]
Flora and fauna[edit]




A Palawan peacock-pheasant


Unlike most of the Philippines, Palawan is biogeographically part of Sundaland, with a fauna and flora related to that found in Borneo.[34]
Among the many endemic species are the Palawan peacock-pheasant, Philippine mouse-deer, Philippine pangolin, Palawan bearded pig, and Palawan birdwing. In the forests and grasslands, the air resonates with the songs of more than 200 kinds of birds. Over 600 species of butterflies flutter around the mountains and fields of Palawan, attracted to some 1500 hosts plants found here. Endangered sea turtles nest on white sand beaches.[35] Dugong numbers have fallen seriously, although Palawan still has a larger population than any other part of the country[36] and organizations such as Community Centred Conservation (C3) are working to end the unsustainable use of marine resources in Palawan and in Philippines.[37]
In 2007, a "shrew-eating pitcher plant", named Nepenthes attenboroughii was discovered in Mount Victoria. There were many species of pitcher pants discovered in this wild mountain paradise, the most recent is named Nepenthes leonardoi.




Palawan palm forest.


Total forest cover is about 56 percent of the total land area of the province while mangrove forest accounts for 3.35 percent based on the 1998 Landsat imagery. Grasslands dwindled from 19 percent in 1992 to 12.40 percent in 1998. This is an indication of improving soil condition as deteriorating soil is normally invaded by grass species. Brushlands increased to 25 percent of the total land area. Sprawled beneath the seas are nearly 11,000 square kilometers of coral reefs, representing more than 35% of the country's coral reefs.[35]
Palawan, the only Philippine island cited, is rated by the Condé Nast Traveler Readers as the most beautiful island in the world and is also rated by the National Geographic Traveler magazine as the best island destination in East and Southeast Asia region in 2007, and the 13th best island in the world having "incredibly beautiful natural seascapes and landscapes. One of the most biodiverse (terrestrial and marine) islands in the Philippines... The island has had a Biosphere Reserve status since the early 1990s, showing local interest for conservation and sustainable development".[38][39]




Taranaban River


The province was also categorized as "doing well" in the 4th Destination Scorecard survey conducted by the National Geographic Center for Sustainable Destinations, and Conde Nast Traveler magazine voted its beaches, coves and islets as the tourist destination with the best beaches in Asia.[40] Renowned underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau has described the province as having one of the most beautiful seascapes in the world.[35] and Caril Ridley, founder of Palawan Environmental and Marine Studies Center (PEMS) says the Islands of northern Palawan are destined to become a future destination for Asia's growing economic and environmental conferencing.
In 2012, the purple crab was discovered here along with four other species.

Attractions[edit]
Calauit Game Preserve and Wildlife Sanctuary[edit]
See also: Calauit Safari Park
A game reserve and wildlife sanctuary of exotic African animals and endangered endemic animals of Palawan. The reserve was established on August 31, 1976 by virtue of the Presidential Decree No.1578, this was initiated in response to the appeal of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to help save African wildlife when former President Ferdinand Marcos attended the 3rd World Conference in Kenya. By virtue of the Republic Act 7611 (SEP), administrative jurisdiction of DENR was given to the local government of Palawan, effective December 31, 1993. Management of the area is the responsibility of the Office of the Palawan Council of Sustainable Development (PCSD). It is located in Calauit Island in Busuanga.
Coron Reefs, Coron Bay, Busuanga[edit]




Coron, Palawan


Seven lakes surrounded by craggy limestone cliffs attract hundreds of nature lovers to Coron Reefs in Northern Palawan, near the town of Coron. Busuanga Island, whose main town is Coron, is the jump-off point for numerous dive operators. The principal dive sites are 12 World War II Japanese shipwrecks sunk on September 24, 1944 by US Navy action. They range in depth from the surface to 40 meters. This large variety offers exciting wreck exploration for enthusiasts, from novice divers and snorkelers and recreational divers to experienced TEC divers. The aquatic views from the sunken Japanese warships off Coron Island are listed in Forbes Traveler Magazine's top 10 best scuba sites in the world.[40]

UNESCO World Heritage Sites[edit]

Puerto-Princesa Subterranean River National Park (1999)

This park features a large limestone karst landscape with an underground river. One of the river's distinguishing features is that it emerges directly into the sea, and its lower portion is subject to tidal influences. The area also represents a significant habitat for biodiversity conservation. The site contains a full 'mountain-to-sea' ecosystem and has some of the most important forests in Asia.

Tubbataha Reef Marine Park (1993)

The Tubbataha Reef Marine Park covers 332 km2, including the North and South Reefs. It is a unique example of an atoll reef with a very high density of marine species; the North Islet serving as a nesting site for birds and marine turtles. The site is an excellent example of a pristine coral reef with a spectacular 100 m perpendicular wall, extensive lagoons and two coral islands.
Ursula Island[edit]
This game refuge and bird sanctuary is situated near the Municipality of Bataraza in southern Palawan. The islet is a migratory and wintering ground for shorebirds and seabirds.[42]

Palawan (Pron. /pəˈlɑːwɑːn/), officially the Province of Palawan (Cuyonon: Probinsya i'ang Palawan; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Palawan) is an archipelagic province of the Philippines that is located in the Mimaropa region. It is the largest province in the country in terms of total area of jurisdiction. Its capital is the City of Puerto Princesa, but it is governed independently from the province as a highly urbanized city.
The islands of Palawan stretch between Mindoro in the northeast and Borneo in the southwest. It lies between the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea. The province is named after its largest island, Palawan Island (09°30′N 118°30′E﻿ / ﻿9.500°N 118.500°E﻿ / 9.500; 118.500), measuring 450 kilometres (280 mi) long, and 50 kilometres (31 mi) wide.[9][10]

History[edit]
The early history of Palawan was determined by a team of researchers led by Dr. Robert B. Fox. They found evidence in the Tabon Caves that humans have lived in Palawan for more than 50,000 years. They also found human bone fragments, from an individual known as Tabon Man, in the municipality of Quezon, as well as tools and other artifacts. Although the origin of the cave dwellers is not yet established, anthropologists believe they may have come from Borneo. The Tabon Caves are now known as the Cradle of Philippine Civilization[9]
Ancient times[edit]
The Palawano and Tagbanwa, are believed to be direct descendants of Palawan's earliest settlers. They developed a non-formal form of government, an alphabet, and a system of trading with sea-borne merchants.[11]
Surviving ancient tribal artwork include reliefs of elephants, sharks, and fish found at Tabon Caves. Approximately 5,000 years ago, a culturally distinct period characterised by jar burials is evident. This era lasted till AD 500. Over 1500 jars and a mural depicting a burial procession were found.[citation needed]
A more recent wave of migrants arrived between 220 and 263 AD. This was during a period known as the Three Kingdoms. "Little, dark people" living in Anwei province in South China were driven South by Han People. Some settled in Thailand, others went farther south to Indonesia, Sumatra, Borneo. They were known as Aetas and Negritos from whom Palawan's Batak tribe descended.[12]
In AD 982, ancient Chinese traders regularly visited the islands.[12] A Chinese author referred to these islands as Kla-ma-yan (Calamian), Palau-ye (Palawan), and Paki-nung (Busuanga). Pottery, china and other artifacts recovered from caves and waters of Palawan attest to trade relations that existed between Chinese and Malay merchants.[11]
Classical period[edit]
In the 12th century, Malay immigrants arrived. Most of their settlements were ruled by Malay chieftains. These people grew rice, ginger, coconuts, sweet potatoes, sugarcane and bananas. They also raised pigs, goats and chickens. Most of their economic activities were fishing, farming, and hunting by the use of bamboo traps and blowguns. The local people had a dialect consisting of 18 syllables.[11] They were followed by the Indonesians of the Majapahit Empire in the 13th century, and they brought with them Buddhism and Hinduism.[13]
Surviving Buddhist images and sculptures are primarily in and near Tabon Cave.
Because of Palawan's proximity to Borneo, southern portions of the island were under the control of the Sultanate of Brunei for more than two centuries, and Islam was introduced. During the same period, trade relations flourished, and intermarriages among the natives and the Chinese, Japanese, Arab and Hindu. The inter-mixing of blood resulted to a distinct breed of Palaweños, both in physical stature and features.[11]
Spanish period[edit]




Taytay, the capital of Province of Calamianes in 1818 (Spanish Palawan)


After Ferdinand Magellan's death, remnants of his fleet landed in Palawan where the bounty of the land saved them from starvation. Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler named the place "Land of Promise."[12]
The northern Calamianes Islands were the first to come under Spanish authority, and were later declared a province separate from the Palawan mainland. In the early 17th century, Spanish friars sent out missions in Cuyo, Agutaya, Taytay and Cagayancillo but they met resistance from Moro communities. Before the 18th century, Spain began to build churches enclosed by garrisons for protection against Moro raids in the town of Cuyo, Taytay, Linapacan and Balabac. In 1749, the Sultanate of Brunei ceded southern Palawan to Spain.[11]
In 1818, the entire island of Palawan, or Paragua as it was called, was organized as a single province named Calamianes, with its capital in Taytay.[citation needed] By 1858, the province was divided into two provinces, namely, Castilla, covering the northern section with Taytay as capital and Asturias in the southern mainland with Puerto Princesa as capital. It was later divided into three districts, Calamianes, Paragua and Balabac, with Principe Alfonso town as its capital. and During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, Cuyo became the second capital of Palawan from 1873 to 1903.
American rule[edit]
In 1902, after the Philippine-American War, the Americans established civil rule in northern Palawan, calling it the province of Paragua. In 1903, pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No. 1363, the province was reorganized to include the southern portions and renamed Palawan, and Puerto Princesa declared as its capital.[11]
Many reforms and projects were later introduced in the province. Construction of school buildings, promotion of agriculture, and bringing people closer to the government were among the priority plans during this era.[11]
Japanese invasion[edit]
Palawan Massacre[edit]




U. S. Army personnel toiled to identify the charred remains of Americans captured at Bataan and burned alive on Palawan. 20 March 1945


Main article: Palawan Massacre
During World War II, in order to prevent the rescue of prisoners of war by the advancing allies, on 14 December 1944, units of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army (under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita) herded the remaining 150 prisoners of war at Puerto Princesa into three covered trenches which were then set on fire using barrels of gasoline. Prisoners who tried to escape the flames were shot down.[14] Others attempted to escape by climbing over a cliff that ran along one side of the trenches, but were later hunted down and killed. Only 11 men escaped the slaughter and between 133 and 141 were killed.
The massacre is the basis for the recently published book Last Man Out: Glenn McDole, USMC, Survivor of the Palawan Massacre in World War II by Bob Wilbanks, and the opening scenes of the 2005 Miramax film, The Great Raid. A memorial has been erected on the site and McDole, in his eighties, was able to attend the dedication.[citation needed]
Liberation[edit]
During the first phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, just off the coast of Palawan, two United States Navy submarines, USS Dace (SS-247) and USS Darter (SS-227) attacked a Japanese cruiser task force led by Admiral Takeo Kurita, sinking his flagship (in which he survived) Atago, and her sister ship Maya. Darter later ran aground that afternoon and was scuttled by USS Nautilus (SS-168).
The island was liberated from the Japanese Imperial Forces by a task force consisting of Filipino and American military personnel between February 28 and April 22, 1945.[citation needed]
Geography[edit]
The province is composed of the long and narrow Palawan Island, plus a number of other smaller islands surrounding it, totalling roughly 1,780 islands and islets. The Calamianes Group of Islands to the northeast consists of Busuanga, Coron, Culion, and Linapacan islands. Balabac Island is located off the southern tip, separated from Borneo by the Balabac Strait. In addition, Palawan covers the Cuyo Islands in the Sulu Sea. The disputed Spratly Islands, located a few hundred kilometres to the west, are considered part of Palawan by the Philippines, and is locally called the "Kalayaan Group of Islands".
Palawan's almost 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) of irregular coastline is lined with rocky coves and sugar-white sandy beaches. It also harbors a vast stretch of virgin forests that carpet its chain of mountain ranges. The mountain heights average 3,500 feet (1,100 m) in altitude, with the highest peak rising to 6,843 feet (2,086 m)[10] at Mount Mantalingahan. The vast mountain areas are the source of valuable timber. The terrain is a mix of coastal plain, craggy foothills, valley deltas, and heavy forest interspersed with riverine arteries that serve as irrigation.[9]
The province has a total land area of 14,649.73 square kilometres (5,656.29 sq mi).[15] When Puerto Princesa City is included for geographical purposes, its land area is 17,030.75 square kilometres (6,575.61 square miles).[15] The land area is distributed to its mainland municipalities, comprising 12,239 square kilometres (4,726 square miles), and the island municipalities, which altogether measure 2,657 square kilometres (1,026 square miles). In terms of archipelagic internal waters, Palawan has the biggest marine resources that covers almost half of the Sulu Sea and a big chunk of the South China Sea that is within the municipal waters of Kalayaan Municipality which was official annexed to the Philippine jurisdiction by virtue of Presidential Decree 1596 dated June 11, 1978.
Climate[edit]
The province has two types of climate. The first, which occurs in the northern and southern extremities and the entire western coast, has two distinct seasons – six months dry and six months wet. The other, which prevails in the eastern coast, has a short dry season of one to three months and no pronounced rainy period during the rest of the year. The southern part of the province is virtually free from tropical depressions but northern Palawan experiences torrential rains during the months of July and August. Summer months serve as peak season for Palawan. Sea voyages are most favorable from March to early June when the seas are calm. The average maximum temperature is 31 °C (88 °F) with little variation all year.[9]
Administrative divisions[edit]







Palawan comprises 433 barangays in 23 municipalities and the capital City of Puerto Princesa. As an archipelago, Palawan has 13 mainland municipalities and 10 island towns. There are three congressional districts, namely: the first district comprising five northern mainland municipalities and nine island towns; the second district composed of six southern mainland towns and the island municipality of Balabac; and the third district covering the capital City of Puerto Princesa and the town of Aborlan. Thirteen municipalities are considered as mainland municipalities, namely Aborlan, Narra, Quezon, Sofronio Española, Brooke's Point, Rizal, and Bataraza (located south); San Vicente, Roxas, Dumaran, El Nido, and Taytay (found in the north). The remaining island municipalities are: Busuanga, Coron, Linapacan and Culion (forming the Calamianes group of islands), Cuyo, Agutaya and Magsaysay (the Cuyo group of islands), Araceli, Cagayancillo, Balabac and Kalayaan (Spratly Islands). The capital, Puerto Princesa is a highly urbanized city that governs itself independently from the province, but it usually grouped with the province for statistical and geographic purposes.
A State of Palawan was advocated by President Rodrigo Duterte during a forum in Palawan in 2015. In July 2016, Duterte's spokesperson noted the possibility of 5 states in Luzon, possibly including Palawan in a State of Southern Tagalog which will include CALABARZON and MIMAROPA. There is an active movement in the Calamian Islands, the northernmost island group of Palawan, to become a separate province due to geographic constraint and cultural differences.

Region[edit]
In 2001, the residents of Palawan voted in a plebiscite to reject inclusion into an expanded Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.[17]
On 17 May 2002, Executive Order No. 103 divided Region IV into Region IV-A (Calabarzon) and Region IV-B (Mimaropa), placing the province of Palawan into Mimaropa.[18]
On 23 May 2005, Executive Order No. 429 directed that Palawan be transferred from Region IV-B to Region VI.[5] However, Palaweños criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in Puerto Princesa City and all municipalities but one preferring to stay with Region IV-B. Consequently, Administrative Order No. 129 was issued on 19 August 2005 that the implementation of EO 429 be held in abeyance pending approval by the President of its implementation Plan.[6] The Philippine Commission on Elections reported the 2010 Philippine general election results for Palawan as a part of the Region IV-B results.[19] As of 30 June 2011[update], the abeyance was still in effect and Palawan remained a part of Mimaropa.[7]
Geology[edit]




A lagoon in El Nido


The geology of Palawan is, in many ways, unlike other parts of the Philippines. The crust of northeast Palawan was derived from the southeast edge of the continental crust of China, part of the Eurasian Plate. It is the exposed portion of a microcontinent that drifted southward with the opening of the South China Sea. This microcontinent also forms the shallow water north of Palawan in the Reed Bank-Dangerous Ground area of the southern South China Sea. Some of the oldest rocks of the Philippines are found in northeast Palawan (Permian-Carboniferous age). Southwest Palawan exposes primarily ophiolitic material (rocks derived from uplifted oceanic crust and mantle). This 34 Myr old oceanic material[20] appears to have been thrust upon the continental crust. The transition from "oceanic" ophiolite in the southwest to "continental"-type rocks in the northeast occurs in the area of central Palawan around Ulugan Bay and the Sabang area. In the southern coasts of Ulugan Bay and Sabang Beach, are several exposures showing that the Palawan ophiolite has been thrust on to the continent-derived clastic rocks ("Sabang thrust").[21]
The Palawan Trough is an area of deeper water adjacent to the north coast of Palawan in the South China Sea.[22] The Palawan trough is thought to be due to downbending of the continental crust due to the weight of the ophiolite thrust sheet.
Further north, around the Malampaya Sound area and up to the El Nido area, one finds deep marine chert and limestone.




Coron Island


Intruding these rocks in central Palawan (Cleopatra's Needle area) and northern Palawan (Mount Capoas or Kapoas area) are young granite bodies (true granite to granodiorite) of Miocene age (13-15 million years old based on zircon and monazite U-Pb dating).[23] In the Taytay area of northern Palawan, a young basaltic cinder cone is another manifestation of young magmatic activity. The granitic magmatism and basaltic magmatism are both expressions of what has been identified as a widespread post-South China Sea spreading magmatism that has affected many areas around the South China Sea.[24]
Tectonically, Palawan with the Calamian Islands, is considered to be a north-east extension of the Sunda Plate, in collision with the Philippine Mobile Belt at Mindoro.

Islam[edit]
Further information: Islam in the Philippines
While the formerly Muslim majority population in Mindanao was reduced to 40% as a result of the influx of Christian Filipino settlers in the 20th century, as of 2015[update] Muslims were reported by the Routledge Handbook of Southeast Asian Democratization as forming an "overwhelming majority" in Palawan, as well as the Sulu Archipelago.[28] However, other sources had earlier reported a 50-50 split between Muslims and Christians—with Muslims concentrated mostly in the south of Palawan.[29][30]
Other religions[edit]
There are Buddhists - mainly Vietnamese refugees[citation needed] who settled in Palawan, as well as some ethnic Chinese Buddhists. One notable Vietnamese Buddhist Temple in Palawan is Chùa Vạn Pháp.[31]

Palawan has one of the richest fishing grounds in the country. About 45% of Manila's supply of fish comes from here. Having natural gas reserves of approximately 30,000 trillion cubic feet, the province is the only oil-producing province in the country.[32][33] In addition, tourism is also a thriving sector.
Pearl diving used to be a significant economic activity for Palawan until the advent of plastics.[citation needed] The world's largest pearl, the 240 millimetres (9.4 in) diameter Pearl of Lao Tzu, was found off Palawan in 1934.
The economic and agricultural business growth of province is at 20% per annum.[33] Coconut, sugar, rice, lumber, and livestock are produced here.[10]
Flora and fauna[edit]




A Palawan peacock-pheasant


Unlike most of the Philippines, Palawan is biogeographically part of Sundaland, with a fauna and flora related to that found in Borneo.[34]
Among the many endemic species are the Palawan peacock-pheasant, Philippine mouse-deer, Philippine pangolin, Palawan bearded pig, and Palawan birdwing. In the forests and grasslands, the air resonates with the songs of more than 200 kinds of birds. Over 600 species of butterflies flutter around the mountains and fields of Palawan, attracted to some 1500 hosts plants found here. Endangered sea turtles nest on white sand beaches.[35] Dugong numbers have fallen seriously, although Palawan still has a larger population than any other part of the country[36] and organizations such as Community Centred Conservation (C3) are working to end the unsustainable use of marine resources in Palawan and in Philippines.[37]
In 2007, a "shrew-eating pitcher plant", named Nepenthes attenboroughii was discovered in Mount Victoria. There were many species of pitcher pants discovered in this wild mountain paradise, the most recent is named Nepenthes leonardoi.




Palawan palm forest.


Total forest cover is about 56 percent of the total land area of the province while mangrove forest accounts for 3.35 percent based on the 1998 Landsat imagery. Grasslands dwindled from 19 percent in 1992 to 12.40 percent in 1998. This is an indication of improving soil condition as deteriorating soil is normally invaded by grass species. Brushlands increased to 25 percent of the total land area. Sprawled beneath the seas are nearly 11,000 square kilometers of coral reefs, representing more than 35% of the country's coral reefs.[35]
Palawan, the only Philippine island cited, is rated by the Condé Nast Traveler Readers as the most beautiful island in the world and is also rated by the National Geographic Traveler magazine as the best island destination in East and Southeast Asia region in 2007, and the 13th best island in the world having "incredibly beautiful natural seascapes and landscapes. One of the most biodiverse (terrestrial and marine) islands in the Philippines... The island has had a Biosphere Reserve status since the early 1990s, showing local interest for conservation and sustainable development".[38][39]




Taranaban River


The province was also categorized as "doing well" in the 4th Destination Scorecard survey conducted by the National Geographic Center for Sustainable Destinations, and Conde Nast Traveler magazine voted its beaches, coves and islets as the tourist destination with the best beaches in Asia.[40] Renowned underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau has described the province as having one of the most beautiful seascapes in the world.[35] and Caril Ridley, founder of Palawan Environmental and Marine Studies Center (PEMS) says the Islands of northern Palawan are destined to become a future destination for Asia's growing economic and environmental conferencing.
In 2012, the purple crab was discovered here along with four other species.

Technical Report of the Palayan Gold Mine 
3




1.   Summary 
At the behest of the President of Palayan Resources Inc., this
report has been produced in order to discuss the exploration potential of the
recently acquired Palayan Gold Mine. As this report presents, to date only a
rough estimation of the sites mineral properties is known and further
exploration is recommended. The report is to be filed with appropriate
regulatory bodies upon its review.
The Palayan Gold Mine includes 82.7 hectares in a single,
8-unit claim block located near Nueve Ecija, Philippines at 15º 53' 33 North,
121º 08' 33 East. Palayan Resources Inc. has acquired the sole rights to the
entire Claim, and this has been appropriately recorded with the Nueva Ecija
provincial office of the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources
(Mines and Geosciences) of the Republic of the Philippines. 
The information provided in this report reflects evidence found
from a variety of sources such as geological reports, both current and historic,
provided from documents prepared for the annual reports for the Nueva Ecija
provincial office of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (Mines
and Geosciences). In addition to this, geological maps and assessment reports
have helped to illustrate the mineral potential for the property. Lastly, the
Palayan Gold Mine was visited in June 24-28, 2013 to further examine, at least
at a preliminary level, any further exploration potential for the site and to
provide recommendations for this report.
Given the evidence presented in this report, a recommended
two-phased exploration program has been provided at the conclusion. It is
strongly encouraged to be implemented in order to move forward with the project.
A total budget of PHP 840, 326.95 has been provided as well, which will be spent
on aerial photos, geological mapping, geochemical soil sampling, and geophysical
surveying.

2. Introduction 
The Palayan Gold Mine, purchased in its entirety by Palayan
Resources Inc. in 2013, is located near Nueva Ecija, Philippines. There are
other mines in the area which have achieved significant production levels, most
notably the Laur Gold Claim. The Laur Gold Claim, 53kms northeast of the Palayan
Gold Mine, has recently been conditionally reactivated and has produced in
excess of 21.4 millions ounces of gold. Other mines in the area also proved
productive, having produced 35million ounces of between 1927 and 1998.
This report aims to aptly describe the Palayan Gold Mine,
including its general setting and productivity potential based on information
gathered from existing literature provided by previous operators and exploration
work. Much of the relevant information has been provided by Palayan Resources
Inc. Moving forward, at the conclusion of this report is an outline for the
recommended exploration. 
Please note that for the purpose of consistency and clarity,
metric units of measure will be used in this report, and the currency references
are in Philippine pesos. 
3. Property Description and Location
3.1     Location 
Palayan Gold Mine is located
approximately 16 km northeast of Cabanatuan City and 45 km north of Gapan City,
and near Nueve Ecija, Philippines. As previously mentioned, the Property is also
relatively close to the Laur Gold Claim, which is 12 km to the northeast.
3.2     Property Description 
Included in the Palayan project is 1
unpatented mineral claim, located in the capital city of Nueva Ecija,
Philippines, at UTM co-ordinates Latitude 15º 53' 33 North and Longitude 121º
08' 33 West. Verdasco Enterprises LLC assigned the mineral claim to Palayan Resources Inc., the
transaction of which has been recorded with the Nueva Ecija Provincial Office of
the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (Mines and Geosciences) of
the Republic of the Philippines.

To the authors knowledge, there are no
known encumbrances on the property, nor are there any environmental concerns or
developments in line for any part of the Property.
4. Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure
and Physiography 
The Palayan Gold Claim is located approximately 10km southwest
of Palayan City, the capital of Nueva Ecija province in the Philippines. It is
also about 12kms northwest of the more urban city of Cabanatuan, and Manila is a
five-hour drive away. The Property covers areas of placer and small to mid-
scale gold mining.
Nueva Ecija is the largest province in the eastern rim of
Central Luzon bounded by the provinces of Pangasinan and Nueva Viscaya in the
north, the province of Tarlac in the west, the provinces of Pampanga and Bulacan
in the south and the province of Aurora in the west. Completely landlocked, the
province starts at its low points in the southwestern marshes of the Candaba
Swamps, near the Pampanga border and levels off north and eastward, increasing
in elevation to rolling hills closer to the mountains. It is bordered on three
sides by mountain ranges - Sierra Madre in the east, Caraballo in the north, and
Cordillera in the west which provide protection from the monsoon storms during
the months of July to October. Four large rivers - the Pampanga River which cuts
through the province, Rio Chico along the Tarlac Boundaries, Diaman in the north
and Penaranda River in the south nourish Nueva Ecijas fertile farm lands. The
water resources of the region have been harnessed for use to irrigate farm
lands, to generate power for domestic and commercial use, for aquaculture
production and for recreational uses.

Nueva Ecija is the center of agricultural research and production in the Philippines. It is known as the “Rice Bowl of the Philippines” with rice, corn and onion as its main agricultural products. The area also grows mango, banana,
eggplant and garlic. Other economic activities include cattle, poultry and fish productions, investments in trading, manufacturing and agriculture related enterprises and products for export. Non-metallic minerals resources such as gravel, sand,
white clay, black clay, red clay, bentonite, quartz, marble and feldspar have been discovered in the mountain and forest areas. Copper and manganese have been found in the municipalities of General Tinio, Carranglan and Patabangan.  The upper
reaches of Carranglan and Palayan are currently being explored for gold deposits.

The province is also building a reputation in ecotourism, agri-tourism and cultural tourism.  Destination such as the Minalungao National Park, Rizal Hot Spring, Burburayok Springs and Pajanutic Falls, Barrio Puncan in the town of Carranglan, the
Central Luzon State University and year round festivals help to promote those goals. Palayan City is classified as Type II climate zone characterized by distinct dry and wet seasons. Rainy season typically starts from May to early December with peak
rainfall in the months of July and August.  The average amount of rain is 1,597 mm annually and peaks to around 3,304 mm in the month of August. Average temperature ranges 22°C to 36°C.  It is anticipated that exploration work and production
can be carried out throughout the year, although production may be slower during heavy monsoon rains.

The Pantabangan Dam stands as a feat of Filipino engineering phenomenon providing ample power source, irrigation and potable water to all the towns in the province of Nueva Ecija. The Pantabangan Hydro-Power Plant supplies 112 MW in addition to the
150 MW  generated by the Casecnan Multi-Purpose Irrigation and Power Project for province’s energy consumption needs.  The Pampanga River which runs across the province of Nueva Ecija also provides irrigation to the rich farm lands, generates
hydroelectric power and minimizes flood damage to the area.

Transportation infrastructure in the area is modern and
developed in that there is a network of all-weather roads, highways, and
bridges, that make the highly Property accessible. Currently, road networks
total about 5,384 km in length and there are 104 concrete bridges as well as 2
temporary bridges that connect Palayan City to the rest of the province. The
Maharlika Highway runs through the heart of province which makes Nueva Ecija
accessible from any of the surrounding provinces as well as the capital city of
the country, Manila. The highway also links to a system of roadways that connect
the various municipalities and barangays to each other and to the rest of the
province. 
Nueva Ecija is home to six major bus depots that provide
transport services to most major cities in Luzon; as far as the northern tip of
the country, Apparri. Smaller public utility companies operate along the
countryside.
There is sufficient commercial, rural and government banking
institutions that operate within the province to service personal and commercial
banking needs and provide financing facilities for business and agriculture.

Major telephone companies provide telecommunication facilities
and telegram services. 
Tagalog is the main dialect spoken by 70% of Nueva Ecijas
population; 22% speak Ilocano and 3% speak Pampangeno. A minority speaks
Pangasinan, Bicol and Ilonggo. 
5. History 
There has been sufficient evidence of profitable mineralization
throughout the areas adjacent to the Palayan Gold Mine site. Eight prospects
have already achieved significant production, the most notable of which is the
Laur Gold Claim which produces 216,000 ounces of Gold annually.
Gold is reported to have also been discovered in the upper
reaches of Carranglan, a municipality in the province of Nueva Ecija
approximately 77 km north of Palayan, where several mining explorations are
currently being conducted.

6. Geological Setting and Mineralization

6.1    Regional Geology 
Central Luzon is the longest area of
lowlands and produces one third of the countrys total rice production where 41%
of its total land area is devoted agriculture.
The lands of Nueva Ecija begin in the
southwestern marshes near the Pampanga border. It levels off and then gradually
increases in elevation to rolling hills as it approaches the mountains of Sierra
Madre in the east, and the Caraballo and Cordillera ranges in the north. It is
dominated by alluvial plain covering more than one-half of the province. The
areas of high elevation are in the northern and eastern boundaries of the Sierra
Madre, Cordillera and the Caraballo Mountains. The Sierra Madre constitutes one
continuous topographic unit that forms an almost north-south trending block
bordering the eastern boundary of the province of Aurora. The alluvial plain is
gently undulating towards the east and rises abruptly to the Sierra Madre
Cordillera. 
The main geomorphological feature of
the Central plain is between the Gulf of Lingayen and Manila and this is where
Nueva Ecija is found. The lithology of the central plains are mostly composed of
alluvium deposits formed by the Agno River. The most dominant lithology in the
area are the Late Oligocene to Pleistocene and quaternary alluvium deposited by
the Agno River. 
Geologically, the plain of the province
consists of recent alluvial deposits of various materials. The depths of these
deposits vary in many places depending on the elevation of the area. The absence
of gravel, cobble-stones, and pebble in the substratum shows that these deposits
were made by slow-moving streams. The mountains in the northern part consist of
Tertiary undifferentiated rocks, while those on the eastern sides consist of
Tertiary and later effusive rocks of rhyolites, dacites, and basalts. The foothills on the
western flank of Sierra Madre Range consist of narrow strips of volcanic tuff
material, sandstone, shales and limestones.

The rock formation in the province is
represented by time units ranging in age from PreCretaceous to Quaternary

6.2   Property Geology and Mineralization 
As previously mentioned, eight
prospects in the area surrounding the Palayan Gold Mine have already achieved
significant production. This is because they, as well the Property in question,
sit atop a bedrock of native gold occurrences and numerous relatively small
alluvial gold deposits. Mineralization was discovered in the area in the early
1920s and since then has been the site of multiple small to mid-scale placer
operations. Alluvial gold deposits appear to be widespread in the region and
these types of deposits have been the main target of small-scale individual
miners. Native gold is readily panned from the surrounding areas, generally in
areas of minor excavations and mine workings and also from creeks. Grains of
native gold up to 4mm in size have been observed in rock samples from the
project.
The following are the main
stratigraphic units in the region. 


 
 
Caraballo Formation 

 
 
Pantabangan Formation 

 
 
Guadalupe Formation

Caraballo Formation 
The Caraballo Formation is located in
the northeastern part of San Jose City, Nueva Ecija. It is the most extensively
exposed rocks in the Northern Sierra Madre, previously designated as Caraballo
Group, and subdivided into Formations I, II and III. This formation is composed
of a proximal and distal volcano-sedimentary facies and is dated in the Late
Cretaceous to Late Eocene which is widely distributed in the Caraballo
Mountains. 



Technical Report of the Palayan Gold Mine 
10




The distal facies of the Caraballo
Formation are well-exposed along the eastern side of the Northern Sierra Madre
range, in Divilacan Bay, west and south of Dinapique, south and east of San
Ildefonso Peninsula and north of Dingalan. These facies consists of well bedded
red and green mudstones, siltstones, sandstones, and pyroclastic rocks, with
occasional fragmental flows and conglomerates. On the western side of the
northern Sierra Madre, from San Jose to Digdig, Nueva Ecija, red and green
siltstones and mudstones are overlain by gray to black tuffs and conglomerates
which coarsen upwards and become intercalated with pillow basalts. 
Pantabangan Formation

The Pantabangan Formation is facing the
highlands located east of San Jose City, Nueva Ecija. This formation is a series
of sandstone, mudstone and polymictic conglomerates forming the gently rolling
hills in the area of Pantabangan Basin. A uniqueness separates this formation
from the underlying Palali and Santa Fe formations. 
An increase in the amount of
conglomerates towards the south and east suggests its origin from this
direction. The formation is believed to be partly equivalent to the
PlioPleistocene Ilagan Formation of the Cagayan Valley Basin. A dating of 1.3 Ma
(Pleistocene) for a biotite extracted from an andesite intruding the Pantabangan
Formation was found. Furthermore, correlation of this formation to the Tartaro
Formation on the western flank of the Southern Sierra Madre dates as
Plio-Pleistocene from benthonic foraminifera. It is estimated to attain a
thickness of 1000m. 
Guadalupe Formation 
The Guadalupe Formation is found
beneath the highland eastern parts of Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija. It has been
called the Guadalupe Tuffs or the Guadalupe Formation with a lower Alat
Conglomerate member and an upper Diliman Tuff member. The formation overlies
Miocene rocks and on the basis of the presence of Stegodon fossils and other
vertebrates remains, leaf imprints and artifacts, it is assigned a Pleistocene
age. 



Technical Report of the Palayan Gold Mine 
11




The Alat Conglomerate was first mapped
and named by Alvir after marine littoral conglomerate exposed along Sapang Alat
about 3 km north of the Novaliches reservoir near Novaliches town where it
overlies Miocene lavas. The Alat consists of massive conglomerate, deeply
weathered silty mudstone and tuffaceous sandstone. The most common rock type,
the poorly sorted conglomerate, consists of well rounded pebbles and small
boulders of the underlying igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks cemented
by a coarse-grained, calcareous sandy matrix. The interbedded sandstone is
massive to poorly-bedded, tuffaceous fine  to medium grained, loosely-cemented,
friable and exhibits cross bedding. The mudstone is medium to thin bedded, soft,
sticky, silty and tuffaceous. The maximum estimated thickness of this member is
200 m.
The whole series is flat-lying, medium
to thin bedded and consists of fine grained vitric tuffs and welded pyroclastic
breccias with minor fine to medium grained tuffaceous sandstone. Dark mafic
minerals and bits of pumiceous and scoriaceous materials are dispersed in the
glassy tuff matrix. The thickness of the Diliman Tuff is 1,300-2,000 m. 
Tectonic Setting 
The major structural element recognized
in the area of Nueva Ecija is the Dingalan Cabaldon Rift which is part of the
Philippine Fault. The fault appears to be the major factor that influences the
formation of Gabaldon Valley. It trends N 40ºW and branches out into numerous
secondary faults of minor magnitude that the northeastern part, cutting the
Cretaceous-Paleogene rock series. These secondary faults appear to have sliced
the rocks into a series of parallel fault blocks. The orientation of these
faults, together with the schistocity and fold axes appears to be closely
related to the major northwest structure. 



Technical Report of the Palayan Gold Mine 
12




The Philippine Fault Zone is a major
left-lateral strike-slip fault zone that has a mapped length of 1,200 km from
the eastern part of Mindanao to Northern Luzon. Slip on the Philippine Fault
Zone accommodates a significant portion of oblique convergence between the
Philippine Sea and Eurasian Plates. The Philippine Fault Zone trends northwest
from Dingalan Bay just east of Gabaldon to the southern end of the Central
Cordillera. Northwest of Gabaldon, the Philippine Fault splays into the Digdig
Fault and the San Jose Fault The convergence rate of the Philippine Plate
relative to Eurasia falls in the range of 8.0 cm/yr. The movement is
accommodated on three main parallel zones: 


 
 

The westward verging subduction zones running through the
      Taiwan Mindoro- Panay trenches 

 
 
 

 
 

The Philippine Plate at the eastern side, subducting
      westward along the Philippine Trench; and 

 
 
 

 
 

In between the two, the Philippine Fault, an active
      left-lateral strike-slip which runs from Southern Mindanao to Northern
      Luzon. 
The subduction at the Philippine Trench
and the Philippine Fault are young features, initiated in late Early Pliocene,
probably in response to increasing blockage by collisions along Eurasias
boundary. Most of the oblique convergence would have since been partitioned
between the two structures. 
In Luzon, the South China Sea plate is
subducted eastward along the Manila Trench while at the eastern side; the
Philippine Trench is indented by the Benham Rise. A strike slip fault zone along
the East Luzon Trough, borders the latter. The area of Northern Luzon is wedged
and compressed by the two opposing subduction zones.
There are few strong earthquakes that
have historically affected Luzon. Prior to the 1990s, earthquakes in the Luzon
area have severely affected Nueva Ecija. Recorded data shows that this section
of the fault moved in the year 1645 and in the year 1839.

7.     Deposit Types 
Generally speaking, there is a concentration of small-scale
mine operations in Nueva Ecija. The presence of quaternary volcanoes have made
exploration profitable for small-scale operations. It is estimated that the
province has combined gold reserves of 18,301,000 million metric tons. A total
of 5,072,000 million metric tons is estimated as Indicated Ore Reserves. Of
which, 4,410,000 million metric tons are deposited in and around Palayan City
and are distributed in barangays Dona Josefa, Palae and Kabalugan. Indicated
gold reserve in this region has a reported grade between 0.16 and 0.21 gram
Au/MT and metal content is between 0.06 and 0.1 MT. Inferred Gold Ore Reserve in
Nueva Ecija for small-scale mining areas stands at 13,229,000 million metric
tons. This reserve has an average grade of 0.03 gram Au/MT. Metal content varies
between 0.02 and 0.33MT.
8.     Exploration 
From the research undertaken in order to write this report,
there is no record of any extensive exploration work or drilling has been
conducted on the Property.
9.     Drilling 
The research shows that a number of properties to the northeast
of the Palayan Gold Mine were drilled in the late 1990s by junior exploration
companies but again, to the author's knowledge, no sites on the Property in
question have been drilled.
10.   Sample Preparation, Analyses and
Security 
Any and all current exploration has been done so in accordance
with modernly accepted procedures, methods, and practices. Preliminary samples
have also been prepared in ways that adhere to current procedures. 



Technical Report of the Palayan Gold Mine 
14




Presently, no comment on the quality of any samples taken can
be presented. Appropriate measures of quality control were in place, though no
comment can be made on the lack of any additional measure of such controls.
There have been confirmed reports that communist rebels have
been sighted near the borders of Nueva Vizcaya, Nueva Ecija and Aurora
provinces, near Kasibu town where a number of mining exploration activities are
ongoing. The New Peoples Army, the armed wing of the Communist Party of the
Philippines had made threats to mining companies who they view as exploiting the
countrys natural resources. The Philippine Army has given assurances that they
will protect mining companies from communist guerillas. Notwithstanding, a small
force will be maintained to secure the property. 
11.   Adjacent Properties 
At this time the author would like to stress that the adjacent
properties discussed in this report have been cited as examples and evidence
that the Palayan Gold Mine has sufficient exploration potential as it may share
similar mineralization. By no means do these examples serve as significant
factors to this report. 
12.   Interpretations and Conclusions 
As it stands Palayan Resources Inc. is eager to proceed further
with this project by beginning with more exhaustive preliminary exploration work
on the Palayan Gold Mine.
It has already been discussed that access to the Palayan
project site is straightforward via the well maintained highways and roadways.
Personnel, supplies and equipment can be transported by plane to Manila and by
trucks to the camp at the center of the property. It should be reasonable to
expect uninterrupted exploration work and production year round, though both may
have to slow down during monsoon season. 
To date, the Property has shown mineral properties similar to
those found in surrounding areas where there are past or presently successful
mines. Therefore an intensive exploration program is strongly recommended in
order to more clearly illustrate the production potential of the Palayan Gold Mine.
At present time however, the exact mineralization of the Palayan Gold Mine has
not been sufficiently explored as previous work has been inconsistent and
limited. 



Technical Report of the Palayan Gold Mine 
15




Should the results of the two-phased exploration program come
back encouraging, additional exploration and investment will be required to
properly evaluate the Property.
13.     Recommendations

13.1   Phase I and Phase II Recommendations

Below is a outline, including proposed
budgetary expenses, of the intensive exploration program recommended to be
undertaken on the Palayan Gold Mine site. 
The first phase consists of: 


Aerial Photography to locate structures and understand the topography 

Detailed geological mapping of the region in addition to the Palayan Gold
  Mine in order to more broadly understand its geological setting 

Geophysical survey using magnetic and electromagnetic instrumentation of
  both the region and main area for exploration 

Geochemical soil sample of the Property to determine areas of most
  significant mineral wealth and more exactly determine the mineralization of
  the site. 
Implemented as a whole, the proposed
exploration program is quite intensive and examines all aspects of the property.
Results from such a program should help determine the exact mineralization of
the property in addition to whether a subsequent work, such as a diamond drill
program, is justifiable.
