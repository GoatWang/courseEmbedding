★★★★★"Great 
            customer service, quick response and turn around. Thanks Jennifer!!"Cathy Washington - Dallas, TX




★★★★★...Your 
            patience and understandin...
            "Thank you so much for all your help in obtaining the flood insurance 
            I needed so that I could purchase my first home. It is really too 
            bad other insurance agents aren't like you, in your patience and understanding 
            in helping me obtain all my insurance with one agent. I could not 
            have completed the purchase of my home without your help! I may have 
            located you by searching online and I did not expect much when I sent 
            the first email. But, I was extremely surprised to be in contact with 
            an agent that really cared and went the extra mile to help me. Again, 
            thank you so much for all your help."
Pamela Tanner - Unadilla, NY




★★★★★I 
            was a little scared to switch...
            I recently changed all of my insurance due to the horrid flood insurance 
            policies, Jennifer was so helpful in finding me flood insurance at 
            a reasonable rate and included my home insurance also. Since she did 
            so well with that we changed our car insurance also. When she found 
            me a company I had never heard of, I was a little scared to switch. 
            But did anyways and then 3 weeks later my son totaled his car. But 
            with working with this new company and Jennifer everything worked 
            out well. I am so thankful for all her help with my insurance needs. 
            Plus I have never had insurance people call to see how things are 
            going which I think is great customer service on her part. I thank 
            her for all her help and hard work."
Vicki Sanchez - Huntington Beach, CA




★★★★★...Affordable 
            Flood Insurance policy... 
            "I just wanted to say that you did a great job in setting me up with 
            an affordable flood insurance policy for my home. Your honesty, expertise 
            and professionalism was very refreshing after weeks of being put through 
            the ringer by other insurance providers. You saved me close to $2000.00 
            per year for twice the coverage offered by others and if I would have 
            found you sooner I would have saved another $750.00 dollars on a flood 
            elevation survey that I did not need! I will definitely recommend 
            your firm to friends and family that find themselves in the same predicament 
            as I. Thank you so much for a pleasant experience and your superior 
            performance."
Robert Gallagher - Rochester, NY




★★★★★"...Beginning 
            of a long relationship between us...My wife June and I would like 
            to express our sincere appreciation to Jennifer for an excellent job 
            that she did for us. She found solutions to our needs, not only saving 
            us money but also found us better policies. Jennifer is very courteous, 
            knowledgeable, professional and reliable. Her customer service is 
            second to none. She is always calm under pressure. We tried to do 
            eight policies all at once with one fairly complex policy. She tried 
            many options to come up with the best solution for each property. 
            We believe she got us a very good package. We trust that this is just 
            the beginning of a long relationship between us and your company."
Glang Dao - Milpitas, CA

            what I expected, not only did they give me great rates but as a consumer 
            I feel better educated about my insurance. I know what the coverage's 
            mean because they took the time to explain it to me. I also like the 
            extra features of being with RIS, like the newsletter and Referral 
            Program. This year I am going to win the GRAND PRIZE!"
Kim & Dave Evange - West Palm Beach, FL

            reach them on the phone and everyone was very polite and my calls

            feel comfortable knowing we are in good hands. Veronica has been wonderful 
            to us in taking the time to deal with our concerns and questions. 
            We truly feel as if she understands our needs and she has taken the 
            time needed to help us understand what is best for us. Thank you to

Tips for Picking the Proper Flood Insurance

          Two inches of water can cause nearly $8,000 damage to the average home, 
          according to research conducted by the Federal Emergency Management 
          Agency (FEMA).
          Not only is water-related damage one of the most common causes of an 
          insurance claim, thanks to recent flood-zone revisions by FEMA, millions 
          of homeowners are racing to find affordable flood insurance for the 
          first time. 
          Unfortunately, selecting the best flood insurance isn't always the easiest 
          of tasks.
          Following is a checklist to use when speaking with an agent about purchasing 
          the right flood insurance protection for your property. 
        
Many underwriters are restricted from writing a new flood policy once 
          a major event is announced, so shop for flood insurance ahead of time. 
          
          Find out when the flood policy is scheduled to go into effect, and ask 
          about purchasing a temporary policy during the interim. 
          Remember, flood insurance doesn't always cost a lot. 
          Homes in low to moderate risk areas may qualify for preferred risk policies.
Policy Specifics 
          Understand what type of flooding is included and what is excluded, as 
          well as which portion of the policy will cover the damage.
          For example, high winds from a hurricane may result in water damage 
          to exposed areas of the home, earthquakes can cause pipes to burst and 
          even putting out a fire may result in extensive water damage. 
          Ask your agent what portions of the policy provide needed protection 
          in different scenarios, and evaluate the deductibles, limitations and 
          restrictions for each.
 Review Your Risk
          Updated flood maps have resulted in big changes. 
Visit www.floodsmart.gov 
          and enter your zip code to get an up-to-date listing of flood risks 
          for your area
 Flooding is the United States' #1 natural hazard. 
          We want consumers to know that while homeowner's insurance won't cover 
          them against flooding, they can protect their home and property by purchasing 
          a flood insurance policy separately through us--the flood insurance 
          specialists.
          Many people are under the misconception that they are ineligible for 
          flood insurance because of where they live, or their mortgage status. 
          But the truth is, as long as your hometown is an NFIP community, most 
          homeowners, business owners and renters can get flood insurance. We 
          urge consumers to remember the flood insurance basics:

          You CAN get flood insurance nationwide.

You CAN get flood insurance nationwide.
You CAN get flood insurance if you live in a floodplain or high-flood-risk 
            area.
You CAN get flood insurance if you live outside a floodplain, or 
            a low-to-moderate flood-risk area - and at lower cost.
You CAN get flood insurance if your property has been flooded before.
You CAN get flood insurance from insurance agents in your area.
You CAN get flood insurance even if your mortgage broker doesn't 
            require it.

---------------------------------
 NFIP- National Flood Insurance Program aka FEMA flood insurance 
          Program Changes as of January 1, 2013

          NFIP previously announced average premium increases of 5% overall and 
          3% for Preferred Risk Policies as their annual premium change to the 
          flood program. Those premium changes were covered in FEMA 
          W-12027, summarized in Summer 
          FloodLines and will be implemented as of October 1, 2012. Therefore, 
          the premium increases below represent successive increases due to the 
          passage of the Biggert Waters Flood Reform Act. 
 NFIP Extends PRP Extension Eligibility Beyond the Initial 
          2 Year Period

          While FEMA completes a study and analysis to develop an implementation 
          strategy for the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, 
          policies written as Preferred Risk Policies under the 2 Year PRP Eligibility 
          Extension may continue to be renewed as PRPs beyond the previously designated 
          2-year period. 
 Under the initial 2-Year PRP Eligibility Extension, buildings newly 
          mapped into a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) on or after October 1, 
          2008, became eligible for the PRP for 2 years beginning on January 1, 
          2011. Buildings newly mapped into an SFHA on or after January 1, 2011, 
          were also eligible for the PRP during the 2-year period following the 
          map revision date. At the end of the 2-year period, the policies were 
          required to be rewritten as standard-rated policies. For more information 
          please review FEMA 
          Bulletin W-10085 Aug. 23, 2010. 
Beginning with the first renewal effective on or after January 1, 2013, 
          policies issued under the PRP Eligibility Extension that meet the PRP 
          loss history requirements will not be transitioned into standard X-zone 
          rating, but will continue to be issued as PRPs at each renewal until 
          further notice. Under the extension, new business PRPs may also continue 
          to be issued for properties newly mapped into the SFHA as a result of 
          a map revision that became effective on or after October 1, 2008.
 NFIP Announces Jan. 1, 2013 Premium Increases for Preferred Risk Policies 
          (PRP) 

          Premiums will increase an average of 13% for PRPs written or renewed 
          on or after January 1, 2013. (The 3% increase as of October 1, 2012 
          and the average 10% increase as of Jan. 1, 2013 combined.) The combined 
          premium for a particular policy may change more or less than the average 
          13% total PRP premium change. The PRP premium tables that become effective 
          January 1, 2013, are included in the full FEMA bulletin linked below. 
          

          For more information and to view Jan. 1, 2013 PRP rate tables, please 
          refer to the entire FEMA 
          Bulletin W-12054 related to the January 1, 2013 changes. 
NFIP Provides Premium Increase Rates for Non-Primary Residence Properties

          Through the passage of HR 5740 authorizing the NFIP through July 31, 
          2012, the NFIP was directed for properties not the primary residence 
          of an individual to discontinue premium subsidies and to increase the 
          premium rates by 25% each year until the average risk premium rate equals 
          the average risk premium rates for actuarially-based properties beginning 
          on July 1, 2012.br> 

          The FEMA 
          Bulletin 12043 includes the premium rate tables to accomplish this 
          25% increase as of Jan. 1, 2013 and further information for your use. 
          

          Fidelity renewal billings for policies renewing Jan. 1, 2013 or later, 
          not indicated in our files as primary residence, and rated with subsidies 
          will contain the required 25% increase as well as a statement to inform 
          policyholders of the premium increase effective on that renewal billing. 
          The statement will read similar to the following: 

          On May 31, 2012, HR 5740 was signed into law amending the National Flood 
          Insurance Program. One provision of the new law states that residential 
          properties that are not the policy holder's primary residence are no 
          longer eligible to receive subsidized rates. Furthermore, the law requires 
          that rates for these risks must increase by 25% each year until it reaches 
          the appropriate actuarial rate level as determined by FEMA. 

          Flood insurance covers direct physical loss caused by "flood." In simple 
          terms, a flood is an excess of water on land that is normally dry. Here's 
          the official definition used by the National Flood Insurance Program. 
          

          A flood is (1) "A general and temporary condition of partial or complete 
          inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land area or of two 
          or more properties (at least one of which is your property) from a. 
          overflow of inland or tidal waters; b. unusual and rapid accumulation 
          or runoff of surface waters from any source; or c. mudflow*. (2) Collapse 
          or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water

 Nation 
        Flood Insurance Program


        Background on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) 

        The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating 
        communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. 
        This insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster 
        assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings 
        and their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based 
        on an agreement between local communities and the Federal Government that 
        states if a community will adopt and enforce a floodplain management ordinance 
        to reduce future flood risks to new construction in Special Flood Hazard 
        Areas, the Federal Government will make flood insurance available within 
        the community as a financial protection against flood losses.

        For decades, the national response to flood disasters was generally limited 
        to constructing flood-control works such as dams, levees, seawalls, and 
        the like, and providing disaster relief to flood victims. This approach 
        did not reduce losses, nor did it discourage unwise development. In some 
        instances, it may have actually encouraged additional questionable development. 
        To compound the problem, the public generally could not buy flood coverage 
        from insurance companies, and building techniques to reduce flood damage 
        were often overlooked. In the face of mounting flood losses and escalating 
        costs of disaster relief to the general taxpayers, the U.S. Congress created 
        the NFIP. The intent was to reduce future flood damage through community 
        floodplain management ordinances, and provide protection for property 
        owners against potential losses through an insurance mechanism that requires 
        a premium to be paid for the protection.

        The U.S. Congress established the NFIP on August 1, 1968, with the passage 
        of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. The NFIP was broadened and 
        modified with the passage of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 
        and other legislative measures. It was further modified by the National 
        Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 and the Flood Insurance Reform Act 
        of 2004. The NFIP is administered by the Federal Emergency Management 
        Agency (FEMA), a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
        (DHS).


What Is The Write Your Own (WYO) Program?


      The Write Your Own (WYO) Program began in 1983 and is a cooperative undertaking 
      of the insurance industry and FEMA. The WYO Program allows participating 
      property and casualty insurance companies to write and service the Standard 
      Flood Insurance Policy in their own names. The WYO Program operates as part 
      of the NFIP, and is subject to its rules and regulations. 

      The goals of the WYO Program are: 
      
Increase the NFIP policy base and the geographic distribution of policies;
Improve service to NFIP policyholders through the infusion of insurance 
          industry knowledge;
Provide the insurance industry with direct operating experience with 
          flood insurance

      Who needs flood insurance? Everyone. And everyone in a 
      participating community of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) can 
      buy flood insurance. Nationwide, almost 20,000 communities have joined the 
      Program. 
Top Ten Facts... every consumer needs to know about the National 
      Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
      1. Everyone lives in a flood zone. 
      You don't need to live near water to be flooded. Floods are caused by storms, 
      melting snow, hurricanes, and water backup due to inadequate or overloaded 
      drainage systems, dam or levee failure, etc. 
2. Flood damage is not covered by homeowners policies.

      You can protect your home, business, and belongings with flood insurance 
      from the National Flood Insurance Program. You can insure your home with 
      flood insurance for up to $250,000 for the building and $100,000 for its 
      contents. 
3. You can buy flood insurance no matter what your flood risk is.

      It doesn't matter whether your flood risk is high or low. You can buy flood 
      insurance as long as your community participates in the National Flood Insurance 
      Program. And, it's a good idea to buy even in low-risk areas: between 20 
      and 25 percent of all flood insurance claims come from low-risk areas. 
4. The low-cost Preferred Risk Policy is ideal for homes and businesses 
      in low- to moderate-risk areas. 
      Homeowners can insure buildings and contents for as little as $112 per year. 
      Business owners can insure building and contents for as little as $500 per 
      year. Residential renters can insure contents for as little as $39 per year. 
      
5. Flood insurance is affordable. 
      The average flood insurance policy costs a little more than $400 a year 
      for about $100,000 of coverage. In comparison, a $50,000 disaster home loan 
      can cost you about $240 a month at 4 percent interest over 20 years.
6. Flood insurance is easy to get. 
      You can buy NFIP flood insurance from private insurance companies and agents; 
      call yours today! You may be able to purchase flood insurance with a credit 
      card. 
7. Contents coverage is separate, so renters can insure their belongings 
      too. 
      Up to $100,000 contents coverage is available for homeowners and renters. 
      
      Whether you rent or own your home or business, make sure to ask your insurance 
      agent about contents coverage. It is not automatically included with the 
      building coverage (except under the Preferred Risk Policy). 
8. Up to a total of $1 million of flood insurance coverage is available 
      for non-residential buildings and contents. 
      Up to $500,000 of coverage is available for non-residential buildings. Up 
      to $500,000 of coverage is available for the contents of non-residential 
      buildings. 
9. There is usually a 30-day waiting period before the coverage 
      goes into effect. 
      Plan ahead so you're not caught without flood insurance when a flood threatens 
      your home or business. 
10. Federal disaster assistance is not the answer. 
      Federal disaster assistance is only available if the President declares 
      a disaster. 
      Flood insurance pays even if a disaster is not declared. It's just good 
      sense to protect your home and business.

      In some instances, people have been told that they cannot buy flood insurance 
      because of where they live. To clear up this and other misconceptions about 
      National Flood Insurance, the NFIP has compiled the following list of common 
      myths about the Program, and the real facts behind them, to give the full 
      story about this valuable protection.


MYTH: You can't buy flood insurance if you are 
      located in a high-flood-risk area.
FACT: You can buy National Flood Insurance no matter where 
      you live if your community participates in the NFIP, except in Coastal Barrier 
      Resources System (CBRS) areas. The Program was created in 1968 to make federally 
      backed flood insurance available to property owners who live in eligible 
      communities. Flood insurance was then virtually unavailable from the private 
      insurance industry. The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 
      requires federally regulated lending institutions to make sure that mortgage 
      loans secured by buildings in high-flood-risk areas are protected by flood 
      insurance. Lenders should notify borrowers, prior to closing, that their 
      property is located in a high-flood-risk area and that National Flood Insurance 
      is required.


MYTH: You can't buy flood insurance immediately before 
      or during a flood.

FACT: You can purchase National Flood Insurance at any 
      time. There is usually a 30-day waiting period after premium payment before 
      the policy is effective, with the following exceptions:

      1. If the initial purchase of flood insurance is in connection with the 
      making, increasing, extending, or renewing of a loan, there is no waiting 
      period. Coverage becomes effective at the time of the loan, provided application 
      and payment of premium is made at or prior to loan closing.

      2. If the initial purchase of flood insurance is made during the 13-month 
      period following the effective date of a revised flood map for a community, 
      there is a 1-day waiting period. This applies only where the Flood Insurance 
      Rate Map (FIRM) is revised to show the building to be in a Special Flood 
      Hazard Area (SFHA) when it had not been in an SFHA. The policy does not 
      cover a "loss in progress," defined by the NFIP as a loss occurring as of 
      12:01 a.m. on the first day of the policy term. In addition, you cannot 
      increase the amount of insurance coverage you have during a loss in progress.


MYTH: Homeowners insurance policies cover flooding.
FACT: Unfortunately, many home and business owners do not 
      find out until it is too late that their homeowners and business multiperil 
      policies do not cover flooding. The NFIP offers a separate policy that protects 
      the single most important financial asset, which for most people is their 
      home or business. Homeowners can include contents coverage in their NFIP 
      policy. Residential and commercial renters can purchase contents coverage. 
      Business owners can purchase flood insurance coverage for their buildings 
      and contents/inventory and, by doing so, protect their livelihood.


MYTH: Flood insurance is only available for homeowners.
FACT: Most people who live in NFIP participating communities, 
      including renters and condo unit owners, are eligible to purchase federally 
      backed flood insurance. A maximum of $250,000 of building coverage is available 
      for single-family residential buildings; $250,000 per unit for residential 
      condominiums. The limit for contents coverage on all residential buildings 
      is $100,000, which is also available to renters. Commercial structures can 
      be insured to a limit of $500,000 for the building and $500,000 for the 
      contents. The maximum insurance limit may not exceed the insurable value 
      of the property.


MYTH: You can't buy flood insurance if your property has 
      been flooded.
FACT: You are still eligible to purchase flood insurance 
      after your home, apartment, or business has been flooded, provided that 
      your community is participating in the NFIP.


MYTH: Only residents of high-flood-risk areas need to insure 
      their property.
FACT: All areas are susceptible to flooding, although to 
      varying degrees. If you live in a low-to-moderate flood risk area, it is 
      advisable to have flood insurance. Between 20 and 25 percent of the NFIP's 
      claims come from outside high-flood-risk areas. Residential and commercial 
      property owners located in low-to-moderate risk areas should ask their agents 
      if they are eligible for the Preferred Risk Policy, which provides very 
      inexpensive flood insurance protection.


MYTH: National Flood Insurance can only be purchased through 
      the NFIP directly.
FACT: NFIP flood insurance is sold through private insurance 
      companies and agents, and is backed by the federal government.


MYTH: The NFIP does not offer any type of basement coverage.
FACT: Yes it does. The NFIP defines a basement as any area 
      of a building with a floor that is below ground level on all sides. While 
      flood insurance does not cover basement improvements (such as finished walls, 
      floors, or ceilings), or personal belongings kept in a basement (such as 
      furniture and other contents), it does cover structural elements and essential 
      equipment. 

      The following items are covered under building coverage, as long as they 
      are connected to a power source, if required, and installed in their functioning 
      location:

 Sump pumps
 Well water tanks and pumps, cisterns, and the water in them
 Oil tanks and the oil in them, natural gas tanks and the gas in them
 Pumps and/or tanks used in conjunction with solar energy
 Furnaces, water heaters, air conditioners, and heat pumps
 Electrical junction and circuit breaker boxes and required utility 
          connections
 Foundation elements
 Stairways, staircases, elevators, and dumbwaiters
 Unpainted drywall walls and ceilings, including fiberglass insulation
 Cleanup
        The following items are covered under contents coverage: 
         Clothes washers and dryers
 Food freezers and the food in them

      The NFIP recommends both building and contents coverage for the broadest 
      protection.


MYTH: The NFIP encourages coastal development.
FACT: One of the NFIP's primary objectives is to guide 
      development away from high-flood-risk areas. NFIP regulations minimize the 
      impact of structures that are built in SFHAs by requiring them not to cause 
      obstructions to the natural flow of floodwaters. Also, as a condition of 
      community participation in the NFIP, those structures built within SFHAs 
      must adhere to strict floodplain management regulations enforced by the 
      community. In addition, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) of 1982 
      relies on the NFIP to discourage building in fragile coastal areas by prohibiting 
      the sale of flood insurance in designated CBRA areas. While the NFIP does 
      not prohibit property owners from building in these areas, any Federal financial 
      assistance, including federally backed flood insurance, is prohibited. However, 
      the CBRA does not prohibit privately financed development or insurance.


MYTH: Federal disaster assistance will pay for flood damage.
FACT: Before a community is eligible for disaster assistance, 
      it must be declared a federal disaster area. Federal disaster assistance 
      declarations are issued in less than 50 percent of flooding events. The 
      premium for an NFIP policy, averaging a little over $400 a year, can be 
      less expensive than the monthly payments on a federal disaster loan. Furthermore, 
      if you are uninsured and receive federal disaster assistance after a flood, 
      you must purchase flood insurance to remain eligible for future disaster 
      relief.

FLOOD ZONES EXPLAINED:
      Zone--A geographical area shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map or a Flood 
      Insurance Rate Map that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the 
      area. 
      Flood hazard areas identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map are identified 
      as a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). SFHA are defined as the area that 
      will be inundated by the flood event having a 1-percent chance of being 
      equaled or exceeded in any given year. The 1-percent annual chance flood 
      is also referred to as the base flood or 100-year flood. SFHAs are labeled 
      as Zone A, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zones A1-A30, Zone AE, Zone A99, Zone AR, Zone 
      AR/AE, Zone AR/AO, Zone AR/A1-A30, Zone AR/A, Zone V, Zone VE, and Zones 
      V1-V30. Moderate flood hazard areas, labeled Zone B or Zone X (shaded) are 
      also shown on the FIRM, and are the areas between the limits of the base 
      flood and the 0.2-percent-annual-chance (or 500-year) flood. The areas of 
      minimal flood hazard, which are the areas outside the SFHA and higher than 
      the elevation of the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood, are labeled Zone C 
      or Zone X (unshaded).

Zone A
      Zone A is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the 100-year 
      floodplains that are determined in the Flood Insurance Study by approximate 
      methods. Because detailed hydraulic analyses are not performed for such 
      areas, no Base Flood Elevations or depths are shown within this zone. Mandatory 
      flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

Zone AE and A1-A30
      Zones AE and A1-A30 are the flood insurance rate zones that correspond to 
      the 100-year floodplains that are determined in the Flood Insurance Study 
      by detailed methods. In most instances, Base Flood Elevations derived from 
      the detailed hydraulic analyses are shown at selected intervals within this 
      zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.


Zone AH
      Zone AH is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the areas of 
      100-year shallow flooding with a constant water-surface elevation (usually 
      areas of ponding) where average depths are between 1 and 3 feet. The BFEs 
      derived from the detailed hydraulic analyses are shown at selected intervals 
      within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.


Zone AO
      Zone AO is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the areas of 
      100-year shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where 
      average depths are between 1 and 3 feet. The depth should be averaged along 
      the cross section and then along the direction of flow to determine the 
      extent of the zone. Average flood depths derived from the detailed hydraulic 
      analyses are shown within this zone. In addition, alluvial fan flood hazards 
      are shown as Zone AO on the FIRM. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements 
      apply.


Zone AR
      Zone AR is the flood insurance rate zone used to depict areas protected 
      from flood hazards by flood control structures, such as a levee, that are 
      being restored. FEMA will consider using the Zone AR designation for a community 
      if the flood protection system has been deemed restorable by a Federal agency 
      in consultation with a local project sponsor; a minimum level of flood protection 
      is still provided to the community by the system; and restoration of the 
      flood protection system is scheduled to begin within a designated time period 
      and in accordance with a progress plan negotiated between the community 
      and FEMA. Mandatory purchase requirements for flood insurance will apply 
      in Zone AR, but the rate will not exceed the rate for unnumbered A zones 
      if the structure is built in compliance with Zone AR floodplain management 
      regulations.

      For floodplain management in Zone AR areas, elevation is not required for 
      improvements to existing structures. However, for new construction, the 
      structure must be elevated (or floodproofed for non-residential structures) 
      such that the lowest floor, including basement, is a maximum of 3 feet above 
      the highest adjacent existing grade if the depth of the base flood elevation 
      (BFE) does not exceed 5 feet at the proposed development site. For infill 
      sites, rehabilitation of existing structures, or redevelopment of previously 
      developed areas, there is a 3 foot elevation requirement regardless of the 
      depth of the BFE at the project site.
      The Zone AR designation will be removed and the restored flood control system 
      shown as providing protection from the 1% annual chance flood on the NFIP 
      map upon completion of the restoration project and submittal of all the 
      necessary data to FEMA.


Zone A99
      Zone A99 is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to areas of the 
      100-year floodplains that will be protected by a Federal flood protection 
      system where construction has reached specified statutory milestones. No 
      BFEs or depths are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase 
      requirements apply.


Zone D
      The Zone D designation on NFIP maps is used for areas where there are possible 
      but undetermined flood hazards. In areas designated as Zone D, no analysis 
      of flood hazards has been conducted. Mandatory flood insurance purchase 
      requirements do not apply, but coverage is available. The flood insurance 
      rates for properties in Zone D are commensurate with the uncertainty of 
      the flood risk.


Zone V
      Zone V is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the 100-year 
      coastal floodplains that have additional hazards associated with storm waves. 
      Because approximate hydraulic analyses are performed for such areas, no 
      BFEs are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements 
      apply.


Zone VE
      Zone VE is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the 100-year 
      coastal floodplains that have additional hazards associated with storm waves. 
      BFEs derived from the detailed hydraulic analyses are shown at selected 
      intervals within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements 
      apply.


Zones B, C, and X
      Zones B, C, and X are the flood insurance rate zones that correspond to 
      areas outside the 100-year floodplains, areas of 100-year sheet flow flooding 
      where average depths are less than 1 foot, areas of 100-year stream flooding 
      where the contributing drainage area is less than 1 square mile, or areas 
      protected from the 100-year flood by levees. No BFEs or depths are shown 
      within this zone.

★★★★★"Great 
            customer service, quick response and turn around. Thanks Jennifer!!"Cathy Washington - Dallas, TX




★★★★★...Your 
            patience and understandin...
            "Thank you so much for all your help in obtaining the flood insurance 
            I needed so that I could purchase my first home. It is really too 
            bad other insurance agents aren't like you, in your patience and understanding 
            in helping me obtain all my insurance with one agent. I could not 
            have completed the purchase of my home without your help! I may have 
            located you by searching online and I did not expect much when I sent 
            the first email. But, I was extremely surprised to be in contact with 
            an agent that really cared and went the extra mile to help me. Again, 
            thank you so much for all your help."
Pamela Tanner - Unadilla, NY




★★★★★I 
            was a little scared to switch...
            I recently changed all of my insurance due to the horrid flood insurance 
            policies, Jennifer was so helpful in finding me flood insurance at 
            a reasonable rate and included my home insurance also. Since she did 
            so well with that we changed our car insurance also. When she found 
            me a company I had never heard of, I was a little scared to switch. 
            But did anyways and then 3 weeks later my son totaled his car. But 
            with working with this new company and Jennifer everything worked 
            out well. I am so thankful for all her help with my insurance needs. 
            Plus I have never had insurance people call to see how things are 
            going which I think is great customer service on her part. I thank 
            her for all her help and hard work."
Vicki Sanchez - Huntington Beach, CA




★★★★★...Affordable 
            Flood Insurance policy... 
            "I just wanted to say that you did a great job in setting me up with 
            an affordable flood insurance policy for my home. Your honesty, expertise 
            and professionalism was very refreshing after weeks of being put through 
            the ringer by other insurance providers. You saved me close to $2000.00 
            per year for twice the coverage offered by others and if I would have 
            found you sooner I would have saved another $750.00 dollars on a flood 
            elevation survey that I did not need! I will definitely recommend 
            your firm to friends and family that find themselves in the same predicament 
            as I. Thank you so much for a pleasant experience and your superior 
            performance."
Robert Gallagher - Rochester, NY




★★★★★"...Beginning 
            of a long relationship between us...My wife June and I would like 
            to express our sincere appreciation to Jennifer for an excellent job 
            that she did for us. She found solutions to our needs, not only saving 
            us money but also found us better policies. Jennifer is very courteous, 
            knowledgeable, professional and reliable. Her customer service is 
            second to none. She is always calm under pressure. We tried to do 
            eight policies all at once with one fairly complex policy. She tried 
            many options to come up with the best solution for each property. 
            We believe she got us a very good package. We trust that this is just 
            the beginning of a long relationship between us and your company."

★★★★★"Great 
            customer service, quick response and turn around. Thanks Jennifer!!"Cathy Washington - Dallas, TX




★★★★★...Your 
            patience and understandin...
            "Thank you so much for all your help in obtaining the flood insurance 
            I needed so that I could purchase my first home. It is really too 
            bad other insurance agents aren't like you, in your patience and understanding 
            in helping me obtain all my insurance with one agent. I could not 
            have completed the purchase of my home without your help! I may have 
            located you by searching online and I did not expect much when I sent 
            the first email. But, I was extremely surprised to be in contact with 
            an agent that really cared and went the extra mile to help me. Again, 
            thank you so much for all your help."
Pamela Tanner - Unadilla, NY




★★★★★I 
            was a little scared to switch...
            I recently changed all of my insurance due to the horrid flood insurance 
            policies, Jennifer was so helpful in finding me flood insurance at 
            a reasonable rate and included my home insurance also. Since she did 
            so well with that we changed our car insurance also. When she found 
            me a company I had never heard of, I was a little scared to switch. 
            But did anyways and then 3 weeks later my son totaled his car. But 
            with working with this new company and Jennifer everything worked 
            out well. I am so thankful for all her help with my insurance needs. 
            Plus I have never had insurance people call to see how things are 
            going which I think is great customer service on her part. I thank 
            her for all her help and hard work."
Vicki Sanchez - Huntington Beach, CA




★★★★★...Affordable 
            Flood Insurance policy... 
            "I just wanted to say that you did a great job in setting me up with 
            an affordable flood insurance policy for my home. Your honesty, expertise 
            and professionalism was very refreshing after weeks of being put through 
            the ringer by other insurance providers. You saved me close to $2000.00 
            per year for twice the coverage offered by others and if I would have 
            found you sooner I would have saved another $750.00 dollars on a flood 
            elevation survey that I did not need! I will definitely recommend 
            your firm to friends and family that find themselves in the same predicament 
            as I. Thank you so much for a pleasant experience and your superior 
            performance."

 Who 
        Needs Flood Insurance?


        When your home is flooded, it can lead to financial ruin if you don't 
        have the proper insurance. And note this: A basic homeowners policy won't 
        cover your flood damage! You need flood insurance - a special policy backed 
        by the federal government, with cooperation from local communities and 
        private insurance companies. 

        About 200 insurance companies, possibly including the company that already 
        handles your homeowners or auto insurance, write and service flood insurance 
        policies for the government, which finances the program through premiums. 
        Although flood insurance is relatively inexpensive, most Americans neglect 
        to purchase protection. Only about one-quarter of the homes in areas most 
        vulnerable are insured against flood loss, according to the Federal Insurance 
        Administration (FIA). In those areas, flooding is 26 times more likely 
        to occur than a fire during the course of a typical 30-year mortgage. 
        

        More than 19,000 communities have agreed to stricter zoning and building 
        measures to control floods, according to the Federal Emergency Management 
        Agency (FEMA). Residents in these communities are entitled to purchase 
        flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), a 
        program FEMA oversees. 

Purchasing your policy

      The average flood insurance premium in 2000 was $353 a year. The average 
      amount of flood insurance purchased in 2000 was $124,089. Policies are available 
      in three forms: "Dwelling" (most homes); "General Property" (apartments 
      and businesses); and "Residential Condominium Building Association Policy" 
      (condominiums). All have limits on coverage. You might be eligible for discounts 
      if you live in a low- to moderate-risk zone. 
A Flood Of Data

      Wondering what type of policy you should buy and how much coverage you need? 
      Do you simply need a good definition of a flood? The Federal Emergency Management 
      Agency, which oversees the National Flood Insurance Program, answers these 
      questions and more on its Web site. 
      In general, the policy does not take effect until 30 days after you purchase 
      flood insurance. So, if the weather forecast announces a flood alert for 
      your area and you run to purchase coverage, it's already too late. You will 
      not be insured if you buy a policy a few days before a flood. 
      Insurers and FEMA officials say the national flood program works best for 
      everyone when more people participate. This lowers rates, increases the 
      pool of funds from which to draw in the event of a flood, and lessens the 
      chance that claim payments will have to taken from taxpayer funds. 
Picking A Company

      Since the federal government sets the rates, private insurance companies 
      that sell flood insurance compete on service, not on price. These "Write 
      Your Own" companies make their profit from service fees allotted by the 
      NFIP. When comparing insurers, one question to ask is how quickly are claims 
      resolved? A company in poor financial health may not be able to pay its 
      claims as promptly as a prosperous company. You can check the financial 
      strength of companies at www.ambest.com 
Living on the shoreline? It'll cost you

      If your home sits between the mainland and often-stormy, ocean waters, you 
      might not be eligible for federally subsidized insurance. The government 
      limits its liability by excluding property owners in such areas as the North 
      Carolina Outer Banks, sections of the Florida panhandle, and selected areas 
      in Delaware and South Carolina. The reason stems from the Coastal Barrier 
      Resources Act, which is designed to protect wildlife living in valuable 
      ecological areas. The government discourages development by withholding 
      subsidized insurance. 
      Also, a study released by the FEMA on June 27, 2000, reported that close 
      to 87,000 homes and buildings have been built on land likely to wash away 
      during the next 60 years. 
      Some insurance companies are willing to expose themselves to higher risks 
      and take on policies in some of the developed barrier areas. Instead of 
      $340 in premiums offered through the government program, a few private companies 
      will charge about $3,000 a year for flood coverage of slightly less than 
      $200,000 

Flood insurance: Are you in the zone?

      The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has placed more than 19,000 
      communities in the United States into a category of flood zones. Each community 
      is able to participate in the agency's National Flood Insurance Program 
      (NFIP), with premium rates determined by the risks of flooding. To indicate 
      the risks in different parts of the country, FEMA has assigned a character 
      from the alphabet to each zone. 
      The major zone categories are V and A, which have the highest risk of flooding. 
      Older maps list B and C as minimal-risk zones, but those characters have 
      been phased out and relabeled as X zones on new flood maps. 
      There are several ways to find out which zone applies to you. You can go 
      to your town hall or city hall, where employees responsible for issuing 
      building permits in your area have access to flood zone maps. If you are 
      buying a home, your Realtor and your insurance agent should be able to help 
      you. Also, you can order a flood map from the FEMA's Map Service Center 
      for a nominal charge by calling (800) 358-9616 or by visiting the FEMA Web 
      site. 
V zones

      These are the most hazardous of the Special Flood Hazard Areas, or SFHAs. 
      V zones generally include the first row of beachfront properties. The hazards 
      in these areas are increased because of wave velocity - hence the V designation. 
      These property owners pay more than $1,000 annually and flood insurance 
      is mandatory. 
A zones

      A zones - the next most volatile of the SFHAs - are subject to rising waters 
      and are usually near a lake, river, stream or other body of water. Flood 
      insurance is mandatory in all A zones, where premiums can be about $895 
      annually because of the high potential of flooding. 
      A-zone maps also include AE, AH, AO, AR, and A99 designations, all having 
      the same rates. The different A zones are named depending on the way in 
      which they might be flooded. 
X zones

      These are minimal-risk areas where flood insurance is not mandatory. Homeowners 
      in X zones (which are labeled B and C zones on older maps) pay as little 
      as $395 annually. In certain cases, property owners may qualify for the 
      $100-a-year preferred risk policy. 
D zones

      These are areas that have not been studied, but where flooding is possible. 
      Flood insurance is available in participating communities. 
Flood Insurance Glossary


Actual cash value

      The value of property as figured by determining the cost to replace the 
      damaged or destroyed property (see replacement value) and adjusting the 
      replacement value by subtracting an amount that reflects depreciation. Simply 
      put, replacement cost minus depreciation. Homeowners are entitled to a replacement 
      cost value if they live in their homes at least 80 percent of the time and 
      have flood coverage for at least 80 percent of their home's market value. 
      
Federal Flood Insurance

      Coverage made available to residents of a community on a subsidized and 
      nonsubsidized premium rate basis after the community qualifies for protection 
      under the National Flood Insurance Act. 
FEMA

      The Federal Emergency Management Agency is responsible for coordinating 
      federal disaster response. It oversees the National Flood Insurance Program 
      (NFIP), which was established in 1968 and is run by the Federal Insurance 
      Administration. 
FIRM

      Flood Insurance Rate Map. Shows base flood elevations, insurance risk zones, 
      and floodplain boundaries. When a community decides to participate in the 
      NFIP, the program makes a FIRM that will help to determine flood insurance 
      rates for buildings in the community. A Pre-FIRM building is one that existed 
      before the community began participating in NFIP. A Post-FIRM building is 
      one that was constructed after flood zones and related regulations were 
      established. Pre-Firm buildings are more vulnerable to flood damage because 
      they were not built to flood-control specifications. 
Flood

      Outside of fire, flooding is the most widespread natural disaster. Floods 
      are caused by storms, melting snow, hurricanes, and water backup due to 
      inadequate or overloaded drainage systems, dam or levee failure, etc. According 
      to the NFIP, two adjacent properties have to be under water to call the 
      situation a flood. In a rural area, at least 2 acres must be submerged. 
      
Flood Insurance

      A standard homeowners policy will not cover damages caused by flooding. 
      You must have flood insurance from an insurer that writes for the National 
      Flood Insurance Program. If your community participates in NFIP's floodplain 
      management program, you should be eligible to buy the coverage no matter 
      if your flood risk is low, medium or high. The only people who may have 
      trouble finding flood coverage are residents of "coastal barrier resource 
      system" areas and communities that do not participate in NFIP's programs. 
      Flood insurance is also available to renters, condominium owners, and co-op 
      owners. 
Flood perils

      These include the following: the overflow of inland or tidal waters; unusual 
      and rapid accumulation of runoff or surface waters from any source; mud 
      slides caused by flooding; the washing away, collapse or subsiding of land 
      along the shoreline due to erosion or undermining of waves or currents of 
      water exceeding the cyclical levels; and sewer backup caused by flooding. 
      
National Flood Insurance Program

      Coverage against flooding for personal and business property under the National 
      Flood Insurance Act of 1968, which encourages participation of private insurers 
      in the program through and industry flood insurance pool of private insurers 
      that provide initial flood insurance in cooperation with the U.S. Department 
      of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
Preferred risk policy

      Low-rate flood insurance policy (available for just over $100 a year) for 
      people living in flood zones of minimal and moderate risk (zones B, C, and 
      X). 
Replacement value

      The amount it costs to replace or rebuild a damaged property. Replacement 
      cost coverage is available only for the building portion of a condominium 
      policy. Owners of single-family homes may be able to buy replacement cost 
      coverage on the building portions of their flood policies. Commercial and 
      apartment buildings will be covered only for actual cash value. Keep in 
      mind that a policy will pay only the replacement value up to the coverage 
      limit. For example, if rebuilding your home will cost $250,000, but you 
      only purchased $200,000 in coverage, your policy will pay only $200,000. 
      
Special Flood Hazard Area

      The most hazardous flood zones are V (usually first-row, beach-front properties) 
      and A (usually, but not always, properties near water). 
Standard Flood Insurance Policy

      This is the name for the flood insurance policy that property owners buy 
      from the NFIP (overseen by FEMA). It refers to the contract between FEMA 
      as the insurer and the insureds named in the policy. 
Write Your Own program/companies

      Program under which policyholders get their insurance directly from private 
      insurance companies rather than going to the NFIP. Write Your Own companies 
      write and service about 90 percent of flood insurance policies for NFIP. 
      You pay the same amount whether you buy it from the government or a company.  
      
Special Flood Hazard Areas - High Risk

      Special Flood Hazard Areas represent the area subject to inundation by 1-percent-annual 
      chance flood. Structures located within the SFHA have a 26-percent chance 
      of flooding during the life of a standard 30-year mortgage. Federal floodplain 
      management regulations and mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements 
      apply in these zones. 



ZONE


DESCRIPTION



A
Areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance 
          flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, 
          no Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) or flood depths are shown.


AE, A1-A30
Areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance 
          flood event determined by detailed methods. BFEs are shown within these 
          zones. (Zone AE is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)


AH
Areas subject to inundation by 1-percent-annual-chance 
          shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are 
          1-3 feet. BFEs derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in 
          this zone.


AO
Areas subject to inundation by 1-percent-annual-chance 
          shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average 
          depths are 1-3 feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic 
          analyses are shown within this zone.


AR
Areas that result from the decertification of a 
          previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to 
          be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection.


A99
Areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance 
          flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion 
          of an under-construction Federal flood protection system. These are 
          areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on 
          the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, 
          to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may 
          be used only when the flood protection system has reached specified 
          statutory progress toward completion. No BFEs or flood depths are shown.


Coastal High Hazard Areas - High Risk

      Coastal High Hazard Areas (CHHA) represent the area subject to inundation 
      by 1-percent-annual chance flood, extending from offshore to the inland 
      limit of a primary front al dune along an open coast and any other area 
      subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. Structures 
      located within the CHHA have a 26-percent chance of flooding during the 
      life of a standard 30-year mortgage. Federal floodplain management regulations 
      and mandatory purchase requirements apply in these zones. 



ZONE


DESCRIPTION



V
Areas along coasts subject to inundation by the 
          1-percent-annual-chance flood event with additional hazards associated 
          with storm-induced waves. Because detailed coastal analyses have not 
          been performed, no BFEs or flood depths are shown.


VE, V1-V30
Areas along coasts subject to inundation by the 
          1-percent-annual-chance flood event with additional hazards due to storm-induced 
          velocity wave action. BFEs derived from detailed hydraulic coastal analyses 
          are shown within these zones. (Zone VE is used on new and revised maps 
          in place of Zones V1-V30.)


Coastal High Hazard Areas - High Risk

      Coastal High Hazard Areas (CHHA) represent the area subject to inundation 
      by 1-percent-annual chance flood, extending from offshore to the inland 
      limit of a primary front al dune along an open coast and any other area 
      subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. Structures 
      located within the CHHA have a 26-percent chance of flooding during the 
      life of a standard 30-year mortgage. Federal floodplain management regulations 
      and mandatory purchase requirements apply in these zones. 



ZONE


DESCRIPTION



V
Areas along coasts subject to inundation by the 
          1-percent-annual-chance flood event with additional hazards associated 
          with storm-induced waves. Because detailed coastal analyses have not 
          been performed, no BFEs or flood depths are shown.


VE, V1-V30
Areas along coasts subject to inundation by the 
          1-percent-annual-chance flood event with additional hazards due to storm-induced 
          velocity wave action. BFEs derived from detailed hydraulic coastal analyses 
          are shown within these zones. (Zone VE is used on new and revised maps 
          in place of Zones V1-V30.)


Moderate and Minimal Risk Areas

      Areas of moderate or minimal hazard are studied based upon the principal 
      source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be 
      flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage 
      systems. Local stormwater drainage systems are not normally considered in 
      a community's flood insurance study. The failure of a local drainage system 
      can create areas of high flood risk within these zones. Flood insurance 
      is available in participating communities, but is not required by regulation 
      in these zones. Nearly 25-percent of all flood claims filed are for structures 
      located within these zones. 



ZONE


DESCRIPTION



B, X (shaded)
Moderate risk areas within the 0.2-percent-annual-chance 
          floodplain, areas of 1-percent-annual-chance flooding where average 
          depths are less than 1 foot, areas of 1-percent-annual-chance flooding 
          where the contributing drainage area is less than 1 square mile, and 
          areas protected from the 1-percent-annual-chance flood by a levee. No 
          BFEs or base flood depths are shown within these zones. (Zone X (shaded) 
          is used on new and revised maps in place of Zone B.)


C, X (unshaded)
Minimal risk areas outside the 1-percent and .2-percent-annual-chance 
          floodplains. No BFEs or base flood depths are shown within these zones. 
          (Zone X (unshaded) is used on new and revised maps in place of Zone 
          C.)


Undetermined Risk Areas

      Areas of moderate or minimal hazard are studied based upon the principal 
      source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be 
      flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage 
      systems. Local stormwater drainage systems are not normally considered in 
      a community's flood insurance study. The failure of a local drainage system 
      can create areas of high flood risk within these zones. Flood insurance 
      is available in participating communities, but is not required by regulation 
      in these zones. Nearly 25-percent of all flood claims filed are for structures 
      located within these zones. 



ZONE


DESCRIPTION



D (unshaded)
Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, 
          but flooding is possible. No mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements 
          apply, but coverage is available in participating communities.

★★★★★"Great 
            customer service, quick response and turn around. Thanks Jennifer!!"Cathy Washington - Dallas, TX




★★★★★...Your 
            patience and understandin...
            "Thank you so much for all your help in obtaining the flood insurance 
            I needed so that I could purchase my first home. It is really too 
            bad other insurance agents aren't like you, in your patience and understanding 
            in helping me obtain all my insurance with one agent. I could not 
            have completed the purchase of my home without your help! I may have 
            located you by searching online and I did not expect much when I sent 
            the first email. But, I was extremely surprised to be in contact with 
            an agent that really cared and went the extra mile to help me. Again, 
            thank you so much for all your help."
Pamela Tanner - Unadilla, NY




★★★★★I 
            was a little scared to switch...
            I recently changed all of my insurance due to the horrid flood insurance 
            policies, Jennifer was so helpful in finding me flood insurance at 
            a reasonable rate and included my home insurance also. Since she did 
            so well with that we changed our car insurance also. When she found 
            me a company I had never heard of, I was a little scared to switch. 
            But did anyways and then 3 weeks later my son totaled his car. But 
            with working with this new company and Jennifer everything worked 
            out well. I am so thankful for all her help with my insurance needs. 
            Plus I have never had insurance people call to see how things are 
            going which I think is great customer service on her part. I thank 
            her for all her help and hard work."
Vicki Sanchez - Huntington Beach, CA




★★★★★...Affordable 
            Flood Insurance policy... 
            "I just wanted to say that you did a great job in setting me up with 
            an affordable flood insurance policy for my home. Your honesty, expertise 
            and professionalism was very refreshing after weeks of being put through 
            the ringer by other insurance providers. You saved me close to $2000.00 
            per year for twice the coverage offered by others and if I would have 
            found you sooner I would have saved another $750.00 dollars on a flood 
            elevation survey that I did not need! I will definitely recommend 
            your firm to friends and family that find themselves in the same predicament 
            as I. Thank you so much for a pleasant experience and your superior 
            performance."
Robert Gallagher - Rochester, NY




★★★★★"...Beginning 
            of a long relationship between us...My wife June and I would like 
            to express our sincere appreciation to Jennifer for an excellent job 
            that she did for us. She found solutions to our needs, not only saving 
            us money but also found us better policies. Jennifer is very courteous, 
            knowledgeable, professional and reliable. Her customer service is 
            second to none. She is always calm under pressure. We tried to do 
            eight policies all at once with one fairly complex policy. She tried 
            many options to come up with the best solution for each property. 
            We believe she got us a very good package. We trust that this is just 
            the beginning of a long relationship between us and your company."

Frequently Asked Questions






Why are FloodSimple’s policies so much less expense compared to FEMA?

                        Alternative flood insurance providers are selective about 
                        which properties they choose to insure which minimizes their 
                        losses. Unlike FEMA, which is required to insure any property 
                        determined to be in flood zone. 


                    






Does FloodSimple require an elevationcertificate? 

                    No. We use computer scoring and underwriters
                    who evaluate properties on an individual 
                    basis.
                    
                    
                





Will my bank accept an alternativeto a FEMA flood insurance policy?

                    Yes, thousands of banks, mortgage companies and 
                    credit unions accept alternative flood policies as 
                    an alternative to a FEMA flood policy.
                    
                    
                   
                





Can a FloodSimple policy be purchasedonline?

                    Yes, purchasing an alternative flood policy from
                    FloodSimple is quick and easy. Simply provide a
                    small amount of information about the property and
                    an underwriter will evaluate it within 24 hours.
                    If the property is approved you can purchase a policy
                    by mailing a check or paying online with a credit card
                    or electronic check. 
                    
                    

                





What is the difference between the homeowners insurance and floodinsurance?

                    The difference between what is covered under the
                    homeowner's insurance and what is covered under this 
                    policy really depends on the source of flooding. If the 
                    flooding is an accumulation of surface water from 
                    outside your property a flood policy is meant to cover
                    this. If it is natural water entering from an opening
                    in the roof, walls, or windows or if the water is 
                    processed tap water that leaks from your water pipes
                    or appliances (water heater, washer), it should be
                    covered under most homeowners’ policies.

                    
                  
                





Can my lender require the purchase offlood insurance?

                    Lenders are mandated under the Flood Disaster 
                    Protection Act of 1973 and the National Flood Insurance 
                    Reform Act of 1994 to require the purchase of flood 
                    insurance by property owners who acquire loans from 
                    federally regulated, supervised, or insured financial 
                    institutions for the acquisition or improvement of land, 
                    facilities, or structures located within or to be located
                    within an special flood hazard zone.

Inet3 launches Flood Re products


                       
                        Specialist property MGA inet3 has launched a Flood Re solution for non-standard homes, alongside a new learning hub for brokers. Speaking to Insurance Business UK, chairman of inet3 Catherine Bell said the solution has been in the works for a very long time.

As well as being chairman of inet3, Bell is also on the board of the Managing General Agents Association and chairman of the MGAA membership benefits committee. She said these positions, and her work with BiBA, made her very aware of the demand among brokers for a Flood Re product for non-standard homes.

“I was very keen to help consumers via brokers, and because of the Government’s new signposting for consumers to brokers, which is something BiBA have been very active in,” Bell said. “It made perfect sense that as an MGA, supporting those brokers, that we needed to get our act together, be nimble and quick, and research how we could really make a difference and take part in that.”

One of the reasons inet3 has been able to quickly launch its own solution is the company’s internal software systems. By building software in house, Bell said the company did not have to get in the queue and wait for a software developer to do the work for them.

The new scheme is also accompanied by extensive updates to inet3’s learning hub to educate brokers about the new solution.

“The Learning Hub is the icing on the cake of our service delivery of added value to our broker partners, because it gives them access to a concise and clear message on the product for their whole organisation to understand how that can be offered to their clients,” said Bell.

Bell praised the work of Flood Re CEO Brendan McCafferty in handling a very difficult project.
“It’s been difficult by everyone’s own admission,” she said. “It was a little bit like holding a tiger by the tail at one point, because they were trying to put together an offer that would work financially.”

Bell said she hopes inet3’s new product will help many property owners who have found it virtually impossible to get insurance, to find cover.

The first to get access to the solution are Bluefin Network broker partners. Director of Bluefin Network Duncan Pagan said brokers who are reaching out to the right customers will benefit most from these changes.

“inet3 has worked very hard to be ready for Flood Re and I’m delighted that our partner brokers have access to their solutions and training materials,” said Pagan. “We are also very positive about their pipeline of future developments.”

 Case Studies: Reliable Basement Waterproofing Products Will Keep a Flooding Basement Dry in Crown City, OH


				Wednesday, November 9th, 2016						
				by Holly Richards								


































 





After a night of heavy rains, water entered through the walk-out access and flooded this basement.



Here is another view of the flooded basement. Even though some items are elevated, the flooding water can still damage the basement.



TrenchDrain was installed in the floor along the wall where water flooded the basement. This drainage system is connected to the perimeter WaterGuard system so any seeping water will be directed to the SuperSump and safely pumped out of the basement.



A FloodRing was placed around the water heater and connected to the WaterGuard system to help prevent any flooding and damage if the water heater should leak or fail.




Challenge

After living in his house for three years, a homeowner in Crown City, OH, wanted to refinance his home. Before doing so, his bank required various repairs be completed. This included waterproofing the basement.
The basement had some dampness and moisture issues, so the homeowner wanted to make sure the house would be a healthy and dry living environment. He contacted Ohio Basement Authority after learning more about our company through online resources like Home Advisor.
The night before his scheduled appointment with Inspector Brendan Kent, several waves of strong thunderstorms with heavy rain hit the area. All of this rain had nowhere to go but inside the homeowner’s basement, causing a flood.
Brendan visited the next day to assess the basement, and he presented the homeowner with several options that would permanently keep his basement dry. 
Solution

Per Brendan’s suggestions, one of our expert crews installed the best waterproofing products in the industry.
The perimeter of the floor was excavated for the installation of the WaterGuard interior drainage system. If any water seeps into the basement, it will be intercepted by the WaterGuard. Sections of TrenchDrain also were installed along the wall with an access door where the flooding water may have entered the basement. This system was also connected to the WaterGuard system.
Water intercepted by the WaterGuard or TrenchDrain systems will then be directed to the SuperSump sump pump, then safely and effectively pumped out of the basement and away from the home’s foundation.
An IceGuard was attached to the exterior sump pump discharge line, and a LawnScape was added to camouflage the end of this discharge line that was buried underground. A FloodRing also was placed around the water heater and connected to the WaterGuard system to prevent flooding if the water heater would leak or fail.
The homeowner was pleased to have these many reliable waterproofing solutions installed so the basement, as well as the rest of the home, will be a healthier living environment for many years to come.

Certified Inspector: Brendan Kent

★★★★★"Great 
            customer service, quick response and turn around. Thanks Jennifer!!"Cathy Washington - Dallas, TX




★★★★★...Your 
            patience and understandin...
            "Thank you so much for all your help in obtaining the flood insurance 
            I needed so that I could purchase my first home. It is really too 
            bad other insurance agents aren't like you, in your patience and understanding 
            in helping me obtain all my insurance with one agent. I could not 
            have completed the purchase of my home without your help! I may have 
            located you by searching online and I did not expect much when I sent 
            the first email. But, I was extremely surprised to be in contact with 
            an agent that really cared and went the extra mile to help me. Again, 
            thank you so much for all your help."
Pamela Tanner - Unadilla, NY




★★★★★I 
            was a little scared to switch...
            I recently changed all of my insurance due to the horrid flood insurance 
            policies, Jennifer was so helpful in finding me flood insurance at 
            a reasonable rate and included my home insurance also. Since she did 
            so well with that we changed our car insurance also. When she found 
            me a company I had never heard of, I was a little scared to switch. 
            But did anyways and then 3 weeks later my son totaled his car. But 
            with working with this new company and Jennifer everything worked 
            out well. I am so thankful for all her help with my insurance needs. 
            Plus I have never had insurance people call to see how things are 
            going which I think is great customer service on her part. I thank 
            her for all her help and hard work."
Vicki Sanchez - Huntington Beach, CA




★★★★★...Affordable 
            Flood Insurance policy... 
            "I just wanted to say that you did a great job in setting me up with 
            an affordable flood insurance policy for my home. Your honesty, expertise 
            and professionalism was very refreshing after weeks of being put through 
            the ringer by other insurance providers. You saved me close to $2000.00 
            per year for twice the coverage offered by others and if I would have 
            found you sooner I would have saved another $750.00 dollars on a flood 
            elevation survey that I did not need! I will definitely recommend 
            your firm to friends and family that find themselves in the same predicament 
            as I. Thank you so much for a pleasant experience and your superior 
            performance."
Robert Gallagher - Rochester, NY




★★★★★"...Beginning 
            of a long relationship between us...My wife June and I would like 
            to express our sincere appreciation to Jennifer for an excellent job 
            that she did for us. She found solutions to our needs, not only saving 
            us money but also found us better policies. Jennifer is very courteous, 
            knowledgeable, professional and reliable. Her customer service is 
            second to none. She is always calm under pressure. We tried to do 
            eight policies all at once with one fairly complex policy. She tried 
            many options to come up with the best solution for each property. 
            We believe she got us a very good package. We trust that this is just 
            the beginning of a long relationship between us and your company."
Glang Dao - Milpitas, CA

            what I expected, not only did they give me great rates but as a consumer 
            I feel better educated about my insurance. I know what the coverage's 
            mean because they took the time to explain it to me. I also like the 
            extra features of being with RIS, like the newsletter and Referral 
            Program. This year I am going to win the GRAND PRIZE!"
Kim & Dave Evange - West Palm Beach, FL

            reach them on the phone and everyone was very polite and my calls

            feel comfortable knowing we are in good hands. Veronica has been wonderful 
            to us in taking the time to deal with our concerns and questions. 
            We truly feel as if she understands our needs and she has taken the 
            time needed to help us understand what is best for us. Thank you to

Tips for Picking the Proper Flood Insurance

          Two inches of water can cause nearly $8,000 damage to the average home, 
          according to research conducted by the Federal Emergency Management 
          Agency (FEMA).
          Not only is water-related damage one of the most common causes of an 
          insurance claim, thanks to recent flood-zone revisions by FEMA, millions 
          of homeowners are racing to find affordable flood insurance for the 
          first time. 
          Unfortunately, selecting the best flood insurance isn't always the easiest 
          of tasks.
          Following is a checklist to use when speaking with an agent about purchasing 
          the right flood insurance protection for your property. 
        
Many underwriters are restricted from writing a new flood policy once 
          a major event is announced, so shop for flood insurance ahead of time. 
          
          Find out when the flood policy is scheduled to go into effect, and ask 
          about purchasing a temporary policy during the interim. 
          Remember, flood insurance doesn't always cost a lot. 
          Homes in low to moderate risk areas may qualify for preferred risk policies.
Policy Specifics 
          Understand what type of flooding is included and what is excluded, as 
          well as which portion of the policy will cover the damage.
          For example, high winds from a hurricane may result in water damage 
          to exposed areas of the home, earthquakes can cause pipes to burst and 
          even putting out a fire may result in extensive water damage. 
          Ask your agent what portions of the policy provide needed protection 
          in different scenarios, and evaluate the deductibles, limitations and 
          restrictions for each.
 Review Your Risk
          Updated flood maps have resulted in big changes. 
Visit www.floodsmart.gov 
          and enter your zip code to get an up-to-date listing of flood risks 
          for your area
 Flooding is the United States' #1 natural hazard. 
          We want consumers to know that while homeowner's insurance won't cover 
          them against flooding, they can protect their home and property by purchasing 
          a flood insurance policy separately through us--the flood insurance 
          specialists.
          Many people are under the misconception that they are ineligible for 
          flood insurance because of where they live, or their mortgage status. 
          But the truth is, as long as your hometown is an NFIP community, most 
          homeowners, business owners and renters can get flood insurance. We 
          urge consumers to remember the flood insurance basics:

          You CAN get flood insurance nationwide.

You CAN get flood insurance nationwide.
You CAN get flood insurance if you live in a floodplain or high-flood-risk 
            area.
You CAN get flood insurance if you live outside a floodplain, or 
            a low-to-moderate flood-risk area - and at lower cost.
You CAN get flood insurance if your property has been flooded before.
You CAN get flood insurance from insurance agents in your area.
You CAN get flood insurance even if your mortgage broker doesn't 
            require it.

---------------------------------
 NFIP- National Flood Insurance Program aka FEMA flood insurance 
          Program Changes as of January 1, 2013

          NFIP previously announced average premium increases of 5% overall and 
          3% for Preferred Risk Policies as their annual premium change to the 
          flood program. Those premium changes were covered in FEMA 
          W-12027, summarized in Summer 
          FloodLines and will be implemented as of October 1, 2012. Therefore, 
          the premium increases below represent successive increases due to the 
          passage of the Biggert Waters Flood Reform Act. 
 NFIP Extends PRP Extension Eligibility Beyond the Initial 
          2 Year Period

          While FEMA completes a study and analysis to develop an implementation 
          strategy for the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, 
          policies written as Preferred Risk Policies under the 2 Year PRP Eligibility 
          Extension may continue to be renewed as PRPs beyond the previously designated 
          2-year period. 
 Under the initial 2-Year PRP Eligibility Extension, buildings newly 
          mapped into a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) on or after October 1, 
          2008, became eligible for the PRP for 2 years beginning on January 1, 
          2011. Buildings newly mapped into an SFHA on or after January 1, 2011, 
          were also eligible for the PRP during the 2-year period following the 
          map revision date. At the end of the 2-year period, the policies were 
          required to be rewritten as standard-rated policies. For more information 
          please review FEMA 
          Bulletin W-10085 Aug. 23, 2010. 
Beginning with the first renewal effective on or after January 1, 2013, 
          policies issued under the PRP Eligibility Extension that meet the PRP 
          loss history requirements will not be transitioned into standard X-zone 
          rating, but will continue to be issued as PRPs at each renewal until 
          further notice. Under the extension, new business PRPs may also continue 
          to be issued for properties newly mapped into the SFHA as a result of 
          a map revision that became effective on or after October 1, 2008.
 NFIP Announces Jan. 1, 2013 Premium Increases for Preferred Risk Policies 
          (PRP) 

          Premiums will increase an average of 13% for PRPs written or renewed 
          on or after January 1, 2013. (The 3% increase as of October 1, 2012 
          and the average 10% increase as of Jan. 1, 2013 combined.) The combined 
          premium for a particular policy may change more or less than the average 
          13% total PRP premium change. The PRP premium tables that become effective 
          January 1, 2013, are included in the full FEMA bulletin linked below. 
          

          For more information and to view Jan. 1, 2013 PRP rate tables, please 
          refer to the entire FEMA 
          Bulletin W-12054 related to the January 1, 2013 changes. 
NFIP Provides Premium Increase Rates for Non-Primary Residence Properties

          Through the passage of HR 5740 authorizing the NFIP through July 31, 
          2012, the NFIP was directed for properties not the primary residence 
          of an individual to discontinue premium subsidies and to increase the 
          premium rates by 25% each year until the average risk premium rate equals 
          the average risk premium rates for actuarially-based properties beginning 
          on July 1, 2012.br> 

          The FEMA 
          Bulletin 12043 includes the premium rate tables to accomplish this 
          25% increase as of Jan. 1, 2013 and further information for your use. 
          

          Fidelity renewal billings for policies renewing Jan. 1, 2013 or later, 
          not indicated in our files as primary residence, and rated with subsidies 
          will contain the required 25% increase as well as a statement to inform 
          policyholders of the premium increase effective on that renewal billing. 
          The statement will read similar to the following: 

          On May 31, 2012, HR 5740 was signed into law amending the National Flood 
          Insurance Program. One provision of the new law states that residential 
          properties that are not the policy holder's primary residence are no 
          longer eligible to receive subsidized rates. Furthermore, the law requires 
          that rates for these risks must increase by 25% each year until it reaches 
          the appropriate actuarial rate level as determined by FEMA. 

          Flood insurance covers direct physical loss caused by "flood." In simple 
          terms, a flood is an excess of water on land that is normally dry. Here's 
          the official definition used by the National Flood Insurance Program. 
          

          A flood is (1) "A general and temporary condition of partial or complete 
          inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land area or of two 
          or more properties (at least one of which is your property) from a. 
          overflow of inland or tidal waters; b. unusual and rapid accumulation 
          or runoff of surface waters from any source; or c. mudflow*. (2) Collapse 
          or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water 
          as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of 
          water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels that result in a flood as 
          defined in A.1.a. Above." 

          * Mudflow is defined (in part) as "A river of liquid and flowing mud 
          on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried 
          by a current of water."

        Flood Insurance Program


        Background on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) 

        The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating 
        communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. 
        This insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster 
        assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings 
        and their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based 
        on an agreement between local communities and the Federal Government that 
        states if a community will adopt and enforce a floodplain management ordinance 
        to reduce future flood risks to new construction in Special Flood Hazard 
        Areas, the Federal Government will make flood insurance available within 
        the community as a financial protection against flood losses.

        For decades, the national response to flood disasters was generally limited 
        to constructing flood-control works such as dams, levees, seawalls, and 
        the like, and providing disaster relief to flood victims. This approach 
        did not reduce losses, nor did it discourage unwise development. In some 
        instances, it may have actually encouraged additional questionable development. 
        To compound the problem, the public generally could not buy flood coverage 
        from insurance companies, and building techniques to reduce flood damage 
        were often overlooked. In the face of mounting flood losses and escalating 
        costs of disaster relief to the general taxpayers, the U.S. Congress created 
        the NFIP. The intent was to reduce future flood damage through community 
        floodplain management ordinances, and provide protection for property 
        owners against potential losses through an insurance mechanism that requires 
        a premium to be paid for the protection.

        The U.S. Congress established the NFIP on August 1, 1968, with the passage 
        of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. The NFIP was broadened and 
        modified with the passage of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 
        and other legislative measures. It was further modified by the National 
        Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 and the Flood Insurance Reform Act 
        of 2004. The NFIP is administered by the Federal Emergency Management 
        Agency (FEMA), a component of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
        (DHS).


What Is The Write Your Own (WYO) Program?


      The Write Your Own (WYO) Program began in 1983 and is a cooperative undertaking 
      of the insurance industry and FEMA. The WYO Program allows participating 
      property and casualty insurance companies to write and service the Standard 
      Flood Insurance Policy in their own names. The WYO Program operates as part 
      of the NFIP, and is subject to its rules and regulations. 

      The goals of the WYO Program are: 
      
Increase the NFIP policy base and the geographic distribution of policies;
Improve service to NFIP policyholders through the infusion of insurance 
          industry knowledge;
Provide the insurance industry with direct operating experience with 
          flood insurance

      Who needs flood insurance? Everyone. And everyone in a 
      participating community of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) can 
      buy flood insurance. Nationwide, almost 20,000 communities have joined the 
      Program. 
Top Ten Facts... every consumer needs to know about the National 
      Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
      1. Everyone lives in a flood zone. 
      You don't need to live near water to be flooded. Floods are caused by storms, 
      melting snow, hurricanes, and water backup due to inadequate or overloaded 
      drainage systems, dam or levee failure, etc. 
2. Flood damage is not covered by homeowners policies.

      You can protect your home, business, and belongings with flood insurance 
      from the National Flood Insurance Program. You can insure your home with 
      flood insurance for up to $250,000 for the building and $100,000 for its 
      contents. 
3. You can buy flood insurance no matter what your flood risk is.

      It doesn't matter whether your flood risk is high or low. You can buy flood 
      insurance as long as your community participates in the National Flood Insurance 
      Program. And, it's a good idea to buy even in low-risk areas: between 20 
      and 25 percent of all flood insurance claims come from low-risk areas. 
4. The low-cost Preferred Risk Policy is ideal for homes and businesses 
      in low- to moderate-risk areas. 
      Homeowners can insure buildings and contents for as little as $112 per year. 
      Business owners can insure building and contents for as little as $500 per 
      year. Residential renters can insure contents for as little as $39 per year. 
      
5. Flood insurance is affordable. 
      The average flood insurance policy costs a little more than $400 a year 
      for about $100,000 of coverage. In comparison, a $50,000 disaster home loan 
      can cost you about $240 a month at 4 percent interest over 20 years.
6. Flood insurance is easy to get. 
      You can buy NFIP flood insurance from private insurance companies and agents; 
      call yours today! You may be able to purchase flood insurance with a credit 
      card. 
7. Contents coverage is separate, so renters can insure their belongings 
      too. 
      Up to $100,000 contents coverage is available for homeowners and renters. 
      
      Whether you rent or own your home or business, make sure to ask your insurance 
      agent about contents coverage. It is not automatically included with the 
      building coverage (except under the Preferred Risk Policy). 
8. Up to a total of $1 million of flood insurance coverage is available 
      for non-residential buildings and contents. 
      Up to $500,000 of coverage is available for non-residential buildings. Up 
      to $500,000 of coverage is available for the contents of non-residential 
      buildings. 
9. There is usually a 30-day waiting period before the coverage 
      goes into effect. 
      Plan ahead so you're not caught without flood insurance when a flood threatens 
      your home or business. 
10. Federal disaster assistance is not the answer. 
      Federal disaster assistance is only available if the President declares 
      a disaster. 
      Flood insurance pays even if a disaster is not declared. It's just good 
      sense to protect your home and business.

      In some instances, people have been told that they cannot buy flood insurance 
      because of where they live. To clear up this and other misconceptions about 
      National Flood Insurance, the NFIP has compiled the following list of common 
      myths about the Program, and the real facts behind them, to give the full 
      story about this valuable protection.


MYTH: You can't buy flood insurance if you are 
      located in a high-flood-risk area.
FACT: You can buy National Flood Insurance no matter where 
      you live if your community participates in the NFIP, except in Coastal Barrier 
      Resources System (CBRS) areas. The Program was created in 1968 to make federally 
      backed flood insurance available to property owners who live in eligible 
      communities. Flood insurance was then virtually unavailable from the private 
      insurance industry. The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 
      requires federally regulated lending institutions to make sure that mortgage 
      loans secured by buildings in high-flood-risk areas are protected by flood 
      insurance. Lenders should notify borrowers, prior to closing, that their 
      property is located in a high-flood-risk area and that National Flood Insurance 
      is required.


MYTH: You can't buy flood insurance immediately before 
      or during a flood.

FACT: You can purchase National Flood Insurance at any 
      time. There is usually a 30-day waiting period after premium payment before 
      the policy is effective, with the following exceptions:

      1. If the initial purchase of flood insurance is in connection with the 
      making, increasing, extending, or renewing of a loan, there is no waiting 
      period. Coverage becomes effective at the time of the loan, provided application 
      and payment of premium is made at or prior to loan closing.

      2. If the initial purchase of flood insurance is made during the 13-month 
      period following the effective date of a revised flood map for a community, 
      there is a 1-day waiting period. This applies only where the Flood Insurance 
      Rate Map (FIRM) is revised to show the building to be in a Special Flood 
      Hazard Area (SFHA) when it had not been in an SFHA. The policy does not 
      cover a "loss in progress," defined by the NFIP as a loss occurring as of 
      12:01 a.m. on the first day of the policy term. In addition, you cannot 
      increase the amount of insurance coverage you have during a loss in progress.


MYTH: Homeowners insurance policies cover flooding.
FACT: Unfortunately, many home and business owners do not 
      find out until it is too late that their homeowners and business multiperil 
      policies do not cover flooding. The NFIP offers a separate policy that protects 
      the single most important financial asset, which for most people is their 
      home or business. Homeowners can include contents coverage in their NFIP 
      policy. Residential and commercial renters can purchase contents coverage. 
      Business owners can purchase flood insurance coverage for their buildings 
      and contents/inventory and, by doing so, protect their livelihood.


MYTH: Flood insurance is only available for homeowners.
FACT: Most people who live in NFIP participating communities, 
      including renters and condo unit owners, are eligible to purchase federally 
      backed flood insurance. A maximum of $250,000 of building coverage is available 
      for single-family residential buildings; $250,000 per unit for residential 
      condominiums. The limit for contents coverage on all residential buildings 
      is $100,000, which is also available to renters. Commercial structures can 
      be insured to a limit of $500,000 for the building and $500,000 for the 
      contents. The maximum insurance limit may not exceed the insurable value 
      of the property.


MYTH: You can't buy flood insurance if your property has 
      been flooded.
FACT: You are still eligible to purchase flood insurance 
      after your home, apartment, or business has been flooded, provided that 
      your community is participating in the NFIP.


MYTH: Only residents of high-flood-risk areas need to insure 
      their property.
FACT: All areas are susceptible to flooding, although to 
      varying degrees. If you live in a low-to-moderate flood risk area, it is 
      advisable to have flood insurance. Between 20 and 25 percent of the NFIP's 
      claims come from outside high-flood-risk areas. Residential and commercial 
      property owners located in low-to-moderate risk areas should ask their agents 
      if they are eligible for the Preferred Risk Policy, which provides very 
      inexpensive flood insurance protection.


MYTH: National Flood Insurance can only be purchased through 
      the NFIP directly.
FACT: NFIP flood insurance is sold through private insurance 
      companies and agents, and is backed by the federal government.


MYTH: The NFIP does not offer any type of basement coverage.
FACT: Yes it does. The NFIP defines a basement as any area 
      of a building with a floor that is below ground level on all sides. While 
      flood insurance does not cover basement improvements (such as finished walls, 
      floors, or ceilings), or personal belongings kept in a basement (such as 
      furniture and other contents), it does cover structural elements and essential 
      equipment. 

      The following items are covered under building coverage, as long as they 
      are connected to a power source, if required, and installed in their functioning 
      location:

 Sump pumps
 Well water tanks and pumps, cisterns, and the water in them
 Oil tanks and the oil in them, natural gas tanks and the gas in them
 Pumps and/or tanks used in conjunction with solar energy
 Furnaces, water heaters, air conditioners, and heat pumps
 Electrical junction and circuit breaker boxes and required utility 
          connections
 Foundation elements
 Stairways, staircases, elevators, and dumbwaiters
 Unpainted drywall walls and ceilings, including fiberglass insulation
 Cleanup
        The following items are covered under contents coverage: 
         Clothes washers and dryers
 Food freezers and the food in them

      The NFIP recommends both building and contents coverage for the broadest 
      protection.


MYTH: The NFIP encourages coastal development.
FACT: One of the NFIP's primary objectives is to guide 
      development away from high-flood-risk areas. NFIP regulations minimize the 
      impact of structures that are built in SFHAs by requiring them not to cause 
      obstructions to the natural flow of floodwaters. Also, as a condition of 
      community participation in the NFIP, those structures built within SFHAs 
      must adhere to strict floodplain management regulations enforced by the 
      community. In addition, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) of 1982 
      relies on the NFIP to discourage building in fragile coastal areas by prohibiting 
      the sale of flood insurance in designated CBRA areas. While the NFIP does 
      not prohibit property owners from building in these areas, any Federal financial 
      assistance, including federally backed flood insurance, is prohibited. However, 
      the CBRA does not prohibit privately financed development or insurance.


MYTH: Federal disaster assistance will pay for flood damage.
FACT: Before a community is eligible for disaster assistance, 
      it must be declared a federal disaster area. Federal disaster assistance 
      declarations are issued in less than 50 percent of flooding events. The 
      premium for an NFIP policy, averaging a little over $400 a year, can be 
      less expensive than the monthly payments on a federal disaster loan. Furthermore, 
      if you are uninsured and receive federal disaster assistance after a flood, 
      you must purchase flood insurance to remain eligible for future disaster 
      relief.

FLOOD ZONES EXPLAINED:
      Zone--A geographical area shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map or a Flood 
      Insurance Rate Map that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the 
      area. 
      Flood hazard areas identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map are identified 
      as a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). SFHA are defined as the area that 
      will be inundated by the flood event having a 1-percent chance of being 
      equaled or exceeded in any given year. The 1-percent annual chance flood 
      is also referred to as the base flood or 100-year flood. SFHAs are labeled 
      as Zone A, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zones A1-A30, Zone AE, Zone A99, Zone AR, Zone 
      AR/AE, Zone AR/AO, Zone AR/A1-A30, Zone AR/A, Zone V, Zone VE, and Zones 
      V1-V30. Moderate flood hazard areas, labeled Zone B or Zone X (shaded) are 
      also shown on the FIRM, and are the areas between the limits of the base 
      flood and the 0.2-percent-annual-chance (or 500-year) flood. The areas of 
      minimal flood hazard, which are the areas outside the SFHA and higher than 
      the elevation of the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood, are labeled Zone C 
      or Zone X (unshaded).

Zone A
      Zone A is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the 100-year 
      floodplains that are determined in the Flood Insurance Study by approximate 
      methods. Because detailed hydraulic analyses are not performed for such 
      areas, no Base Flood Elevations or depths are shown within this zone. Mandatory 
      flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

Zone AE and A1-A30
      Zones AE and A1-A30 are the flood insurance rate zones that correspond to 
      the 100-year floodplains that are determined in the Flood Insurance Study 
      by detailed methods. In most instances, Base Flood Elevations derived from 
      the detailed hydraulic analyses are shown at selected intervals within this 
      zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.


Zone AH
      Zone AH is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the areas of 
      100-year shallow flooding with a constant water-surface elevation (usually 
      areas of ponding) where average depths are between 1 and 3 feet. The BFEs 
      derived from the detailed hydraulic analyses are shown at selected intervals 
      within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.


Zone AO
      Zone AO is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the areas of 
      100-year shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where 
      average depths are between 1 and 3 feet. The depth should be averaged along 
      the cross section and then along the direction of flow to determine the 
      extent of the zone. Average flood depths derived from the detailed hydraulic 
      analyses are shown within this zone. In addition, alluvial fan flood hazards 
      are shown as Zone AO on the FIRM. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements 
      apply.


Zone AR
      Zone AR is the flood insurance rate zone used to depict areas protected 
      from flood hazards by flood control structures, such as a levee, that are 
      being restored. FEMA will consider using the Zone AR designation for a community 
      if the flood protection system has been deemed restorable by a Federal agency 
      in consultation with a local project sponsor; a minimum level of flood protection 
      is still provided to the community by the system; and restoration of the 
      flood protection system is scheduled to begin within a designated time period 
      and in accordance with a progress plan negotiated between the community 
      and FEMA. Mandatory purchase requirements for flood insurance will apply 
      in Zone AR, but the rate will not exceed the rate for unnumbered A zones 
      if the structure is built in compliance with Zone AR floodplain management 
      regulations.

      For floodplain management in Zone AR areas, elevation is not required for 
      improvements to existing structures. However, for new construction, the 
      structure must be elevated (or floodproofed for non-residential structures) 
      such that the lowest floor, including basement, is a maximum of 3 feet above 
      the highest adjacent existing grade if the depth of the base flood elevation 
      (BFE) does not exceed 5 feet at the proposed development site. For infill 
      sites, rehabilitation of existing structures, or redevelopment of previously 
      developed areas, there is a 3 foot elevation requirement regardless of the 
      depth of the BFE at the project site.
      The Zone AR designation will be removed and the restored flood control system 
      shown as providing protection from the 1% annual chance flood on the NFIP 
      map upon completion of the restoration project and submittal of all the 
      necessary data to FEMA.


Zone A99
      Zone A99 is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to areas of the 
      100-year floodplains that will be protected by a Federal flood protection 
      system where construction has reached specified statutory milestones. No 
      BFEs or depths are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase 
      requirements apply.


Zone D
      The Zone D designation on NFIP maps is used for areas where there are possible 
      but undetermined flood hazards. In areas designated as Zone D, no analysis 
      of flood hazards has been conducted. Mandatory flood insurance purchase 
      requirements do not apply, but coverage is available. The flood insurance 
      rates for properties in Zone D are commensurate with the uncertainty of 
      the flood risk.


Zone V
      Zone V is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the 100-year 
      coastal floodplains that have additional hazards associated with storm waves. 
      Because approximate hydraulic analyses are performed for such areas, no 
      BFEs are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements 
      apply.


Zone VE
      Zone VE is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the 100-year 
      coastal floodplains that have additional hazards associated with storm waves. 
      BFEs derived from the detailed hydraulic analyses are shown at selected 
      intervals within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements 
      apply.


Zones B, C, and X
      Zones B, C, and X are the flood insurance rate zones that correspond to 
      areas outside the 100-year floodplains, areas of 100-year sheet flow flooding 
      where average depths are less than 1 foot, areas of 100-year stream flooding 
      where the contributing drainage area is less than 1 square mile, or areas 
      protected from the 100-year flood by levees. No BFEs or depths are shown 
      within this zone.

★★★★★"Great 
            customer service, quick response and turn around. Thanks Jennifer!!"Cathy Washington - Dallas, TX




★★★★★...Your 
            patience and understandin...
            "Thank you so much for all your help in obtaining the flood insurance 
            I needed so that I could purchase my first home. It is really too 
            bad other insurance agents aren't like you, in your patience and understanding 
            in helping me obtain all my insurance with one agent. I could not 
            have completed the purchase of my home without your help! I may have 
            located you by searching online and I did not expect much when I sent 
            the first email. But, I was extremely surprised to be in contact with 
            an agent that really cared and went the extra mile to help me. Again, 
            thank you so much for all your help."
Pamela Tanner - Unadilla, NY




★★★★★I 
            was a little scared to switch...
            I recently changed all of my insurance due to the horrid flood insurance 
            policies, Jennifer was so helpful in finding me flood insurance at 
            a reasonable rate and included my home insurance also. Since she did 
            so well with that we changed our car insurance also. When she found 
            me a company I had never heard of, I was a little scared to switch. 
            But did anyways and then 3 weeks later my son totaled his car. But 
            with working with this new company and Jennifer everything worked 
            out well. I am so thankful for all her help with my insurance needs. 
            Plus I have never had insurance people call to see how things are 
            going which I think is great customer service on her part. I thank 
            her for all her help and hard work."
Vicki Sanchez - Huntington Beach, CA




★★★★★...Affordable 
            Flood Insurance policy... 
            "I just wanted to say that you did a great job in setting me up with 
            an affordable flood insurance policy for my home. Your honesty, expertise 
            and professionalism was very refreshing after weeks of being put through 
            the ringer by other insurance providers. You saved me close to $2000.00 
            per year for twice the coverage offered by others and if I would have 
            found you sooner I would have saved another $750.00 dollars on a flood 
            elevation survey that I did not need! I will definitely recommend 
            your firm to friends and family that find themselves in the same predicament 
            as I. Thank you so much for a pleasant experience and your superior 
            performance."
Robert Gallagher - Rochester, NY




★★★★★"...Beginning 
            of a long relationship between us...My wife June and I would like 
            to express our sincere appreciation to Jennifer for an excellent job 
            that she did for us. She found solutions to our needs, not only saving 
            us money but also found us better policies. Jennifer is very courteous, 
            knowledgeable, professional and reliable. Her customer service is 
            second to none. She is always calm under pressure. We tried to do 
            eight policies all at once with one fairly complex policy. She tried 
            many options to come up with the best solution for each property. 
            We believe she got us a very good package. We trust that this is just 
            the beginning of a long relationship between us and your company."
Glang Dao - Milpitas, CA




★★★★★I 
            also like the extra features..."Orlando's entire staff went above 
            what I expected, not only did they give me great rates but as a consumer 
            I feel better educated about my insurance. I know what the coverage's 
            mean because they took the time to explain it to me. I also like the 
            extra features of being with RIS, like the newsletter and Referral 
            Program. This year I am going to win the GRAND PRIZE!"
Kim & Dave Evange - West Palm Beach, FL




★★★★★...I 
            highly recommend them"What a great experience! It was easy to

★★★★★"Great 
            customer service, quick response and turn around. Thanks Jennifer!!"Cathy Washington - Dallas, TX




★★★★★...Your 
            patience and understandin...
            "Thank you so much for all your help in obtaining the flood insurance 
            I needed so that I could purchase my first home. It is really too 
            bad other insurance agents aren't like you, in your patience and understanding 
            in helping me obtain all my insurance with one agent. I could not 
            have completed the purchase of my home without your help! I may have 
            located you by searching online and I did not expect much when I sent 
            the first email. But, I was extremely surprised to be in contact with 
            an agent that really cared and went the extra mile to help me. Again, 
            thank you so much for all your help."
Pamela Tanner - Unadilla, NY




★★★★★I 
            was a little scared to switch...
            I recently changed all of my insurance due to the horrid flood insurance 
            policies, Jennifer was so helpful in finding me flood insurance at 
            a reasonable rate and included my home insurance also. Since she did 
            so well with that we changed our car insurance also. When she found 
            me a company I had never heard of, I was a little scared to switch. 
            But did anyways and then 3 weeks later my son totaled his car. But 
            with working with this new company and Jennifer everything worked 
            out well. I am so thankful for all her help with my insurance needs. 
            Plus I have never had insurance people call to see how things are 
            going which I think is great customer service on her part. I thank 
            her for all her help and hard work."
Vicki Sanchez - Huntington Beach, CA




★★★★★...Affordable 
            Flood Insurance policy... 
            "I just wanted to say that you did a great job in setting me up with 
            an affordable flood insurance policy for my home. Your honesty, expertise 
            and professionalism was very refreshing after weeks of being put through 
            the ringer by other insurance providers. You saved me close to $2000.00 
            per year for twice the coverage offered by others and if I would have 
            found you sooner I would have saved another $750.00 dollars on a flood 
            elevation survey that I did not need! I will definitely recommend 
            your firm to friends and family that find themselves in the same predicament 
            as I. Thank you so much for a pleasant experience and your superior 
            performance."
Robert Gallagher - Rochester, NY




★★★★★"...Beginning 
            of a long relationship between us...My wife June and I would like 
            to express our sincere appreciation to Jennifer for an excellent job 
            that she did for us. She found solutions to our needs, not only saving 
            us money but also found us better policies. Jennifer is very courteous, 
            knowledgeable, professional and reliable. Her customer service is 
            second to none. She is always calm under pressure. We tried to do 
            eight policies all at once with one fairly complex policy. She tried 
            many options to come up with the best solution for each property. 
            We believe she got us a very good package. We trust that this is just 
            the beginning of a long relationship between us and your company."

 Who 
        Needs Flood Insurance?


        When your home is flooded, it can lead to financial ruin if you don't 
        have the proper insurance. And note this: A basic homeowners policy won't 
        cover your flood damage! You need flood insurance - a special policy backed 
        by the federal government, with cooperation from local communities and 
        private insurance companies. 

        About 200 insurance companies, possibly including the company that already 
        handles your homeowners or auto insurance, write and service flood insurance 
        policies for the government, which finances the program through premiums. 
        Although flood insurance is relatively inexpensive, most Americans neglect 
        to purchase protection. Only about one-quarter of the homes in areas most 
        vulnerable are insured against flood loss, according to the Federal Insurance 
        Administration (FIA). In those areas, flooding is 26 times more likely 
        to occur than a fire during the course of a typical 30-year mortgage. 
        

        More than 19,000 communities have agreed to stricter zoning and building 
        measures to control floods, according to the Federal Emergency Management 
        Agency (FEMA). Residents in these communities are entitled to purchase 
        flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), a 
        program FEMA oversees. 

Purchasing your policy

      The average flood insurance premium in 2000 was $353 a year. The average 
      amount of flood insurance purchased in 2000 was $124,089. Policies are available 
      in three forms: "Dwelling" (most homes); "General Property" (apartments 
      and businesses); and "Residential Condominium Building Association Policy" 
      (condominiums). All have limits on coverage. You might be eligible for discounts 
      if you live in a low- to moderate-risk zone. 
A Flood Of Data

      Wondering what type of policy you should buy and how much coverage you need? 
      Do you simply need a good definition of a flood? The Federal Emergency Management 
      Agency, which oversees the National Flood Insurance Program, answers these 
      questions and more on its Web site. 
      In general, the policy does not take effect until 30 days after you purchase 
      flood insurance. So, if the weather forecast announces a flood alert for 
      your area and you run to purchase coverage, it's already too late. You will 
      not be insured if you buy a policy a few days before a flood. 
      Insurers and FEMA officials say the national flood program works best for 
      everyone when more people participate. This lowers rates, increases the 
      pool of funds from which to draw in the event of a flood, and lessens the 
      chance that claim payments will have to taken from taxpayer funds. 
Picking A Company

      Since the federal government sets the rates, private insurance companies 
      that sell flood insurance compete on service, not on price. These "Write 
      Your Own" companies make their profit from service fees allotted by the 
      NFIP. When comparing insurers, one question to ask is how quickly are claims 
      resolved? A company in poor financial health may not be able to pay its 
      claims as promptly as a prosperous company. You can check the financial 
      strength of companies at www.ambest.com 
Living on the shoreline? It'll cost you

      If your home sits between the mainland and often-stormy, ocean waters, you 
      might not be eligible for federally subsidized insurance. The government 
      limits its liability by excluding property owners in such areas as the North 
      Carolina Outer Banks, sections of the Florida panhandle, and selected areas 
      in Delaware and South Carolina. The reason stems from the Coastal Barrier 
      Resources Act, which is designed to protect wildlife living in valuable 
      ecological areas. The government discourages development by withholding 
      subsidized insurance. 
      Also, a study released by the FEMA on June 27, 2000, reported that close 
      to 87,000 homes and buildings have been built on land likely to wash away 
      during the next 60 years. 
      Some insurance companies are willing to expose themselves to higher risks 
      and take on policies in some of the developed barrier areas. Instead of 
      $340 in premiums offered through the government program, a few private companies 
      will charge about $3,000 a year for flood coverage of slightly less than 
      $200,000 

Flood insurance: Are you in the zone?

      The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has placed more than 19,000 
      communities in the United States into a category of flood zones. Each community 
      is able to participate in the agency's National Flood Insurance Program 
      (NFIP), with premium rates determined by the risks of flooding. To indicate 
      the risks in different parts of the country, FEMA has assigned a character 
      from the alphabet to each zone. 
      The major zone categories are V and A, which have the highest risk of flooding. 
      Older maps list B and C as minimal-risk zones, but those characters have 
      been phased out and relabeled as X zones on new flood maps. 
      There are several ways to find out which zone applies to you. You can go 
      to your town hall or city hall, where employees responsible for issuing 
      building permits in your area have access to flood zone maps. If you are 
      buying a home, your Realtor and your insurance agent should be able to help 
      you. Also, you can order a flood map from the FEMA's Map Service Center 
      for a nominal charge by calling (800) 358-9616 or by visiting the FEMA Web 
      site. 
V zones

      These are the most hazardous of the Special Flood Hazard Areas, or SFHAs. 
      V zones generally include the first row of beachfront properties. The hazards 
      in these areas are increased because of wave velocity - hence the V designation. 
      These property owners pay more than $1,000 annually and flood insurance 
      is mandatory. 
A zones

      A zones - the next most volatile of the SFHAs - are subject to rising waters 
      and are usually near a lake, river, stream or other body of water. Flood 
      insurance is mandatory in all A zones, where premiums can be about $895 
      annually because of the high potential of flooding. 
      A-zone maps also include AE, AH, AO, AR, and A99 designations, all having 
      the same rates. The different A zones are named depending on the way in 
      which they might be flooded. 
X zones

      These are minimal-risk areas where flood insurance is not mandatory. Homeowners 
      in X zones (which are labeled B and C zones on older maps) pay as little 
      as $395 annually. In certain cases, property owners may qualify for the 
      $100-a-year preferred risk policy. 
D zones

      These are areas that have not been studied, but where flooding is possible. 
      Flood insurance is available in participating communities. 
Flood Insurance Glossary


Actual cash value

      The value of property as figured by determining the cost to replace the 
      damaged or destroyed property (see replacement value) and adjusting the 
      replacement value by subtracting an amount that reflects depreciation. Simply 
      put, replacement cost minus depreciation. Homeowners are entitled to a replacement 
      cost value if they live in their homes at least 80 percent of the time and 
      have flood coverage for at least 80 percent of their home's market value. 
      
Federal Flood Insurance

      Coverage made available to residents of a community on a subsidized and 
      nonsubsidized premium rate basis after the community qualifies for protection 
      under the National Flood Insurance Act. 
FEMA

      The Federal Emergency Management Agency is responsible for coordinating 
      federal disaster response. It oversees the National Flood Insurance Program 
      (NFIP), which was established in 1968 and is run by the Federal Insurance 
      Administration. 
FIRM

      Flood Insurance Rate Map. Shows base flood elevations, insurance risk zones, 
      and floodplain boundaries. When a community decides to participate in the 
      NFIP, the program makes a FIRM that will help to determine flood insurance 
      rates for buildings in the community. A Pre-FIRM building is one that existed 
      before the community began participating in NFIP. A Post-FIRM building is 
      one that was constructed after flood zones and related regulations were 
      established. Pre-Firm buildings are more vulnerable to flood damage because 
      they were not built to flood-control specifications. 
Flood

      Outside of fire, flooding is the most widespread natural disaster. Floods 
      are caused by storms, melting snow, hurricanes, and water backup due to 
      inadequate or overloaded drainage systems, dam or levee failure, etc. According 
      to the NFIP, two adjacent properties have to be under water to call the 
      situation a flood. In a rural area, at least 2 acres must be submerged. 
      
Flood Insurance

      A standard homeowners policy will not cover damages caused by flooding. 
      You must have flood insurance from an insurer that writes for the National 
      Flood Insurance Program. If your community participates in NFIP's floodplain 
      management program, you should be eligible to buy the coverage no matter 
      if your flood risk is low, medium or high. The only people who may have 
      trouble finding flood coverage are residents of "coastal barrier resource 
      system" areas and communities that do not participate in NFIP's programs. 
      Flood insurance is also available to renters, condominium owners, and co-op 
      owners. 
Flood perils

      These include the following: the overflow of inland or tidal waters; unusual 
      and rapid accumulation of runoff or surface waters from any source; mud 
      slides caused by flooding; the washing away, collapse or subsiding of land 
      along the shoreline due to erosion or undermining of waves or currents of 
      water exceeding the cyclical levels; and sewer backup caused by flooding. 
      
National Flood Insurance Program

      Coverage against flooding for personal and business property under the National 
      Flood Insurance Act of 1968, which encourages participation of private insurers 
      in the program through and industry flood insurance pool of private insurers 
      that provide initial flood insurance in cooperation with the U.S. Department 
      of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
Preferred risk policy

      Low-rate flood insurance policy (available for just over $100 a year) for 
      people living in flood zones of minimal and moderate risk (zones B, C, and 
      X). 
Replacement value

      The amount it costs to replace or rebuild a damaged property. Replacement 
      cost coverage is available only for the building portion of a condominium 
      policy. Owners of single-family homes may be able to buy replacement cost 
      coverage on the building portions of their flood policies. Commercial and 
      apartment buildings will be covered only for actual cash value. Keep in 
      mind that a policy will pay only the replacement value up to the coverage 
      limit. For example, if rebuilding your home will cost $250,000, but you 
      only purchased $200,000 in coverage, your policy will pay only $200,000. 
      
Special Flood Hazard Area

      The most hazardous flood zones are V (usually first-row, beach-front properties) 
      and A (usually, but not always, properties near water). 
Standard Flood Insurance Policy

      This is the name for the flood insurance policy that property owners buy 
      from the NFIP (overseen by FEMA). It refers to the contract between FEMA 
      as the insurer and the insureds named in the policy. 
Write Your Own program/companies

      Program under which policyholders get their insurance directly from private 
      insurance companies rather than going to the NFIP. Write Your Own companies 
      write and service about 90 percent of flood insurance policies for NFIP. 
      You pay the same amount whether you buy it from the government or a company.  
      
Special Flood Hazard Areas - High Risk

      Special Flood Hazard Areas represent the area subject to inundation by 1-percent-annual 
      chance flood. Structures located within the SFHA have a 26-percent chance 
      of flooding during the life of a standard 30-year mortgage. Federal floodplain 
      management regulations and mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements 
      apply in these zones. 



ZONE


DESCRIPTION



A
Areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance 
          flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, 
          no Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) or flood depths are shown.


AE, A1-A30
Areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance 
          flood event determined by detailed methods. BFEs are shown within these 
          zones. (Zone AE is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)


AH
Areas subject to inundation by 1-percent-annual-chance 
          shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are 
          1-3 feet. BFEs derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in 
          this zone.


AO
Areas subject to inundation by 1-percent-annual-chance 
          shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average 
          depths are 1-3 feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic 
          analyses are shown within this zone.


AR
Areas that result from the decertification of a 
          previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to 
          be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection.


A99
Areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance 
          flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion 
          of an under-construction Federal flood protection system. These are 
          areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on 
          the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, 
          to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may 
          be used only when the flood protection system has reached specified 
          statutory progress toward completion. No BFEs or flood depths are shown.


Coastal High Hazard Areas - High Risk

      Coastal High Hazard Areas (CHHA) represent the area subject to inundation 
      by 1-percent-annual chance flood, extending from offshore to the inland 
      limit of a primary front al dune along an open coast and any other area 
      subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. Structures 
      located within the CHHA have a 26-percent chance of flooding during the 
      life of a standard 30-year mortgage. Federal floodplain management regulations 
      and mandatory purchase requirements apply in these zones. 



ZONE


DESCRIPTION



V
Areas along coasts subject to inundation by the 
          1-percent-annual-chance flood event with additional hazards associated 
          with storm-induced waves. Because detailed coastal analyses have not 
          been performed, no BFEs or flood depths are shown.


VE, V1-V30
Areas along coasts subject to inundation by the 
          1-percent-annual-chance flood event with additional hazards due to storm-induced 
          velocity wave action. BFEs derived from detailed hydraulic coastal analyses 
          are shown within these zones. (Zone VE is used on new and revised maps 
          in place of Zones V1-V30.)


Coastal High Hazard Areas - High Risk

      Coastal High Hazard Areas (CHHA) represent the area subject to inundation 
      by 1-percent-annual chance flood, extending from offshore to the inland 
      limit of a primary front al dune along an open coast and any other area 
      subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. Structures 
      located within the CHHA have a 26-percent chance of flooding during the 
      life of a standard 30-year mortgage. Federal floodplain management regulations 
      and mandatory purchase requirements apply in these zones. 



ZONE


DESCRIPTION



V
Areas along coasts subject to inundation by the 
          1-percent-annual-chance flood event with additional hazards associated 
          with storm-induced waves. Because detailed coastal analyses have not 
          been performed, no BFEs or flood depths are shown.


VE, V1-V30
Areas along coasts subject to inundation by the 
          1-percent-annual-chance flood event with additional hazards due to storm-induced 
          velocity wave action. BFEs derived from detailed hydraulic coastal analyses 
          are shown within these zones. (Zone VE is used on new and revised maps 
          in place of Zones V1-V30.)


Moderate and Minimal Risk Areas

      Areas of moderate or minimal hazard are studied based upon the principal 
      source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be 
      flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage 
      systems. Local stormwater drainage systems are not normally considered in 
      a community's flood insurance study. The failure of a local drainage system 
      can create areas of high flood risk within these zones. Flood insurance 
      is available in participating communities, but is not required by regulation 
      in these zones. Nearly 25-percent of all flood claims filed are for structures 
      located within these zones. 



ZONE


DESCRIPTION



B, X (shaded)
Moderate risk areas within the 0.2-percent-annual-chance 
          floodplain, areas of 1-percent-annual-chance flooding where average 
          depths are less than 1 foot, areas of 1-percent-annual-chance flooding 
          where the contributing drainage area is less than 1 square mile, and 
          areas protected from the 1-percent-annual-chance flood by a levee. No 
          BFEs or base flood depths are shown within these zones. (Zone X (shaded) 
          is used on new and revised maps in place of Zone B.)


C, X (unshaded)
Minimal risk areas outside the 1-percent and .2-percent-annual-chance 
          floodplains. No BFEs or base flood depths are shown within these zones. 
          (Zone X (unshaded) is used on new and revised maps in place of Zone 
          C.)


Undetermined Risk Areas

      Areas of moderate or minimal hazard are studied based upon the principal 
      source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be 
      flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage 
      systems. Local stormwater drainage systems are not normally considered in 
      a community's flood insurance study. The failure of a local drainage system 
      can create areas of high flood risk within these zones. Flood insurance 
      is available in participating communities, but is not required by regulation 
      in these zones. Nearly 25-percent of all flood claims filed are for structures 
      located within these zones. 



ZONE


DESCRIPTION



D (unshaded)
Unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, 
          but flooding is possible. No mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements 
          apply, but coverage is available in participating communities.

★★★★★"Great 
            customer service, quick response and turn around. Thanks Jennifer!!"Cathy Washington - Dallas, TX




★★★★★...Your 
            patience and understandin...
            "Thank you so much for all your help in obtaining the flood insurance 
            I needed so that I could purchase my first home. It is really too 
            bad other insurance agents aren't like you, in your patience and understanding 
            in helping me obtain all my insurance with one agent. I could not 
            have completed the purchase of my home without your help! I may have 
            located you by searching online and I did not expect much when I sent 
            the first email. But, I was extremely surprised to be in contact with 
            an agent that really cared and went the extra mile to help me. Again, 
            thank you so much for all your help."
Pamela Tanner - Unadilla, NY




★★★★★I 
            was a little scared to switch...
            I recently changed all of my insurance due to the horrid flood insurance 
            policies, Jennifer was so helpful in finding me flood insurance at 
            a reasonable rate and included my home insurance also. Since she did 
            so well with that we changed our car insurance also. When she found 
            me a company I had never heard of, I was a little scared to switch. 
            But did anyways and then 3 weeks later my son totaled his car. But 
            with working with this new company and Jennifer everything worked 
            out well. I am so thankful for all her help with my insurance needs. 
            Plus I have never had insurance people call to see how things are 
            going which I think is great customer service on her part. I thank 
            her for all her help and hard work."
Vicki Sanchez - Huntington Beach, CA




★★★★★...Affordable 
            Flood Insurance policy... 
            "I just wanted to say that you did a great job in setting me up with 
            an affordable flood insurance policy for my home. Your honesty, expertise 
            and professionalism was very refreshing after weeks of being put through 
            the ringer by other insurance providers. You saved me close to $2000.00 
            per year for twice the coverage offered by others and if I would have 
            found you sooner I would have saved another $750.00 dollars on a flood 
            elevation survey that I did not need! I will definitely recommend 
            your firm to friends and family that find themselves in the same predicament 
            as I. Thank you so much for a pleasant experience and your superior 
            performance."
Robert Gallagher - Rochester, NY




★★★★★"...Beginning 
            of a long relationship between us...My wife June and I would like 
            to express our sincere appreciation to Jennifer for an excellent job 
            that she did for us. She found solutions to our needs, not only saving 
            us money but also found us better policies. Jennifer is very courteous, 
            knowledgeable, professional and reliable. Her customer service is 
            second to none. She is always calm under pressure. We tried to do 
            eight policies all at once with one fairly complex policy. She tried 
            many options to come up with the best solution for each property. 
            We believe she got us a very good package. We trust that this is just 
            the beginning of a long relationship between us and your company."

            I feel better educated about my insurance. I know what the coverage's 
            mean because they took the time to explain it to me. I also like the

Frequently Asked Questions






Why are FloodSimple’s policies so much less expense compared to FEMA?

                        Alternative flood insurance providers are selective about 
                        which properties they choose to insure which minimizes their 
                        losses. Unlike FEMA, which is required to insure any property 
                        determined to be in flood zone. 


                    






Does FloodSimple require an elevationcertificate? 

                    No. We use computer scoring and underwriters
                    who evaluate properties on an individual 
                    basis.
                    
                    
                





Will my bank accept an alternativeto a FEMA flood insurance policy?

                    Yes, thousands of banks, mortgage companies and 
                    credit unions accept alternative flood policies as 
                    an alternative to a FEMA flood policy.
                    
                    
                   
                





Can a FloodSimple policy be purchasedonline?

                    Yes, purchasing an alternative flood policy from
                    FloodSimple is quick and easy. Simply provide a
                    small amount of information about the property and
                    an underwriter will evaluate it within 24 hours.
                    If the property is approved you can purchase a policy
                    by mailing a check or paying online with a credit card
                    or electronic check. 
                    
                    

                





What is the difference between the homeowners insurance and floodinsurance?

                    The difference between what is covered under the
                    homeowner's insurance and what is covered under this 
                    policy really depends on the source of flooding. If the 
                    flooding is an accumulation of surface water from 
                    outside your property a flood policy is meant to cover
                    this. If it is natural water entering from an opening
                    in the roof, walls, or windows or if the water is 
                    processed tap water that leaks from your water pipes
                    or appliances (water heater, washer), it should be
                    covered under most homeowners’ policies.

                    
                  
                





Can my lender require the purchase offlood insurance?

                    Lenders are mandated under the Flood Disaster 
                    Protection Act of 1973 and the National Flood Insurance 
                    Reform Act of 1994 to require the purchase of flood 
                    insurance by property owners who acquire loans from 
                    federally regulated, supervised, or insured financial 
                    institutions for the acquisition or improvement of land, 
                    facilities, or structures located within or to be located
                    within an special flood hazard zone.
