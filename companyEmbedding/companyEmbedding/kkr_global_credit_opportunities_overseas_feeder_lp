NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Artivest, a cutting-edge technology platform that connects leading private equity and hedge funds with a wider audience of suitable investors, announced today a $15 million round of funding led by prominent global investment firm KKR, with existing investors RRE Ventures, Peter Thiel, Nyca Partners, Anthemis Group and FinTech Collective participating as well. Artivest will use the funding to accelerate the growth of its technology, infrastructure and sales teams and the execution of its product roadmap.

	"Artivest combines leading technology with operational tools for feeder funds that will further open the door for financial advisors and high net worth investors looking to commit capital to a wide variety of top private equity funds. Most private equity firms are very interested in accessing this capital but do not have the technical or operational capability to do so today. We look forward to partnering with Artivest as they expand their business," said Ed Brandman, KKR's Chief Information Officer, who will join Artivest's Board of Directors.

	Founded in 2012 and headquartered in New York City, Artivest provides access at lower investment minimums to a select assortment of privately offered alternative investment funds. To date, Artivest has offered premier private equity and venture capital funds and will soon be offering hedge funds.

	"The process of investing in private placements—previously inefficient for all involved--has not changed in any meaningful way for decades. A number of trends have come together, including alternative funds' increasing focus on individual investors and investors' growing appetite for all types of alternatives. At this crucial moment, we are bringing private investing a much-needed digital upgrade," said Artivest CEO and Founder, James Waldinger. "It's a great honor and a meaningful endorsement to be backed by KKR, one of our first partners."

High net worth investors — a crucial and complicated customer base

	Qualified investors, including those served by the rapidly growing independent advisor community, are fueling a new wave of demand for alternative strategies and are, in fact, the fastest growing segment of assets allocated to alternative funds. With equity markets periodically testing new highs and publicly available fixed income investments providing unsatisfactory yields, clients and their advisors are actively seeking alternative solutions for compounding wealth over long time periods. Top private equity and hedge funds, which have historically raised capital exclusively from institutions and those capable of writing institutional-sized checks, are compelled by this investor base but challenged by the implications of sourcing, onboarding and serving a much more fragmented clientele.

	Artivest provides a multi-pronged solution to connect these two constituencies at scale. Key Artivest features for qualified investors include more accessible investment minimums, online access to intuitive displays of fund metrics and electronic completion of all legal documentation. Funds utilize Artivest technology to manage investor relations and client operations at scale. Both user types benefit from best-in-class-security and encryption protection.

About Artivest

	Artivest offers a digital platform for private investment managers and investors. We connect a wider audience of suitable investors with investment opportunities in top-quality private equity and hedge funds that are typically available only at institutional minimum investment sizes. Our technological, financial, and operational expertise powers a seamless experience for individual investors and a scalable point of access for financial advisors and fund managers. Ultimately, our mission is to bring private investment management into the digital age. Artivest is a FINRA member registered Broker Dealer. For more information, please visit www.Artivest.co.

About James Waldinger, Founder and CEO

	James drew on his background in investing and online marketing to found Artivest. He identified a compelling opportunity to deliver to a wider audience intuitive access to the best that money managers had to offer, and let the best money managers focus on what they do best. Previously, he served on the investment team at the global macro hedge fund, Clarium Capital Management, where he also ran an emerging markets-focused investment portfolio. He has worked with a variety of internet startups, in investment, advisory and operational roles, including as an analyst on Peter Thiel's initial investment in Facebook. James earned his BA in History from Yale, and he holds both a JD and MBA from Stanford.

The KKR Global Institute (KGI) is an integral part of the KKR investment process — working in partnership with KKR deal teams, portfolio companies, and limited partners to help enable smarter investing through a better understanding of the world.
To accomplish its mission, KGI integrates expertise and analysis about emerging developments and long-term trends in geopolitics, macroeconomics, demographics, energy and natural resource markets, technology, and trade policy, as well as environmental, social, and government (ESG) considerations. Whether working with a KKR deal team as we explore entering a new market, supporting a KKR portfolio company as it expands its international footprint, or assessing which countries stand the best chance of becoming the next “breakout nations,” KGI provides critical inputs as the firm thinks through where to invest and how to help businesses grow.
In order to identify and cultivate over-the-horizon opportunities while mitigating against risks, KGI draws from both a deep bench of in-house experience and knowledge, as well as a differentiated network of global contacts. Under General (Ret.) David Petraeus as Chairman and Vance Serchuk as Executive Director, KGI integrates the macroeconomic analyses of KKR’s Global Macro and Asset Allocation Team led by Henry McVey and the Public Policy & Public Affairs, stakeholder engagement, and environmental, social, and governance work of KKR’s Global Public Affairs Team led by Ken Mehlman.
In addition to supporting the KKR investment process, KGI serves as a platform for thought leadership, publishing analyses on a range of market-relevant developments and subjects, including Henry McVey’s Global Insights and other publications.

KKR Income Opportunities Fund seeks to dynamically allocate across credit instruments to capitalize on changes in relative value among corporate credit investments and manage against macroeconomic risks. The Fund is designed to offer investors:

Investment experience of KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, the Fund’s investment adviser, which is a subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., a leading global investment firm with a 40-year history of leadership, innovation and investment excellence
Potential for attractive levels of current income through monthly distributions
A targeted portfolio investing primarily in bank loans and high yield securities
KKR Credit's consistent approach and robust credit investment process that seeks to adapt credit strategies to market conditions

KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC serves as KKR Income Opportunities Fund’s investment adviser (the “Adviser”). Launched in 2004, the Adviser is a subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (together with the Adviser and its other affiliates, “KKR”). The Adviser’s investment teams, which are organized by industry, invest across the capital structure with the goal of achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns and protecting capital. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s investment objectives of seeking a high level of current income with a secondary objective of capital appreciation will be achieved or that the Fund’s investment program will be successful.
An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle. The Fund’s investment policy of investing primarily in bank loans and high yield securities, including special situations opportunities, involves certain risks. Investors could lose some or all of their investment.
The securities in which the Fund will invest may be rated below investment grade. Such securities are regarded as having predominately speculative characteristics with respect to an issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal and are commonly referred to as “high yield” securities or “junk” bonds.
For a summary of the risks associated with an investment in the Fund, please see the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus. The Fund intends to use leverage. Leverage involves the use of various financial instruments or borrowings in an attempt to increase the return of an investment. The use of leverage involves risk, including the potential for higher volatility and greater declines of the Fund’s net asset value, and fluctuations of dividends and other distributions paid by the Fund. For additional risk information, see the “Leverage” section of the prospectus.
