IMPORTANT INFORMATION


    Alternative Investments also labeled hedge funds or investment partnerships are speculative, not suitable for all clients,
    and intended for experienced and sophisticated investors who are willing to bear the high risks of the investment, which include:
    

	Loss of all or a substantial portion of the investment due to leveraging, short-selling
        or other speculative investment practices;
        	Lack of liquidity in that there may be no secondary market and none expected to develop;
        	Volatility of returns;
        	Restrictions on transferring Investment Partnership interests;
        	Potential lack of diversification and resulting higher risk due to concentration of
        trading authority with a single advisor;
        	Absence of information regarding valuations and pricing;
        	Complex tax structures and delays in tax reporting; and
        	Less regulation and higher fees than mutual funds.
    

    The foregoing does not purport to be a complete enumeration or explanation of the general risks
    involved in investing in Investment Partnerships. An Investment Partnership's offering materials
    or a manager's disclosure document typically describes the risks and conflicts of interest
    relating to an investment in such Investment Partnership and to its operations. Each prospective
    investor is urged to read those documents carefully to determine whether an investment in such
    Investment Partnership is suitable for such investor in light of, among other things, such
    investor's financial situation, his or its need for liquidity and other investments.
    
    Past performance does not guarantee future results.  An investment in the products mentioned
    herein may result in a loss to the investors.
    
    None of the material on this section of the website constitutes an offering.  It is meant only
    to provide a broad overview for discussion purposes.  All information provided here is subject
    to change.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION


      Our disclosure and analysis in this press release contain some 
      forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current 
      expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these 
      statements because they do not relate strictly to historical or current 
      facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," 
      "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," and other words and terms of 
      similar meaning. They also appear in any discussion of future operating 
      or financial performance. In particular, these include statements 
      relating to future actions, future performance of our products, 
      expenses, the outcome of any legal proceedings, and financial results. 
      Although we believe that we are basing our expectations and beliefs on 
      reasonable assumptions within the bounds of what we currently know about 
      our business and operations, there can be no assurance that our actual 
      results will not differ materially from what we expect or believe. Some 
      of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our 
      expectations or beliefs include, without limitation: the adverse effect 
      from a decline in the securities markets; a decline in the performance 
      of our products; a general downturn in the economy; changes in 
      government policy or regulation; changes in our ability to attract or 
      retain key employees; and unforeseen costs and other effects related to 
      legal proceedings or investigations of governmental and self-regulatory 
      organizations. We also direct your attention to any more specific 
      discussions of risk contained in our Form 10-K and other public filings. 
      We are providing these statements as permitted by the Private Litigation 
      Reform Act of 1995. We do not undertake to update publicly any 
      forward-looking statements if we subsequently learn that we are unlikely 
      to achieve our expectations or if we receive any additional information 
      relating to the subject matters of our forward-looking statements.

                Closed-end funds carry a certain level of risk for investors.
		 		
				Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through a stock exchange. The Closed-end fund's investment
                return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the
                original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value
                (NAV) of the fund's portfolio.  The market price for a closed-end fund is based on supply and demand which
                fluctuates daily based on many factors, such as economic conditions and global events, investor sentiment, and
                security-specific factors. The possibility of a market decline should be considered market risk.
 				
				There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective and you can lose money by investing in a
                closed-end fund. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

	Investing in small capitalization securities involves special challenges because these securities may trade

	in micro capitalization securities may involve greater risks than investments in small, medium and large
	capitalization securities because the securities are subject to more abrupt or erratic movements in price.
	Investments in foreign securities involves risks not ordinarily associated with investments in domestic
	issues, including currency fluctuation, economic and political risks. Investing in gold is considered

About GAMCO

As of August 2005, the firm formerly known
as Gabelli Asset Management Inc. became GAMCO Investors, Inc. 
Company executives said the new name "is a more inclusive parent
company name, and more appropriately represents the various
investment strategies and asset management brands contributing to
the continued growth of our company."  Operating under a new
moniker, GAMCO's strategy remained unchanged: perform intensive
research to find and then invest in undervalued companies that are
likely to reach their intrinsic value over time.

As of June 2009, GAMCO had $21.4 billion in assets under management
in partnerships, mutual funds, closed end funds and private
advisory accounts.  The company operates principally through
three subsidiaries: GAMCO Asset Management Inc., which manages
private advisory accounts; Gabelli Funds, which handles mutual
funds and closed-end funds; and Gabelli Securities, Inc., through
which the company serves as a general partner or investment manager
in a number of limited partnerships with varying investment
objectives.

In addition to the value-oriented investment strategy, GAMCO has
developed a diversified product mix to serve the financial
objectives of a broad range of investors.  The company's
investment services are primarily offered through its subsidiary,
GAMCO Asset Management Inc., which manages separate accounts for
high-net-worth individuals, institutions and qualified pension
plans, as well as through the company's role as advisor to a family
of mutual funds.

One defining feature of the company is its high-profile founder and
CEO, Mario Gabelli.  A Chartered Financial Analyst and
Columbia University MBA grad, Gabelli is a self-taught stock picker
who, in an interview with Investors Business Daily, recounted that
he learned the stock market as a 16-year-old caddie at a White
Plains, N.Y., golf course.  Gabelli spent several years
working as an analyst in the industry before founding his eponymous
firm in 1977, during a time when money managers and research firms
were struggling due to changes in the industry.  Gabelli
credits his company's success to meticulous research techniques,
based on applying Graham & Dodd's principles to the analysis of
domestic, cash-generating, franchise companies in a wide range of
industries.
The terms of GAMCO's $105 million IPO in 1999 allowed Gabelli to
retain control of 80 percent of the firm's equity and 97.6 percent
of the firm's voting power.  Additionally, he reportedly
receives 10 percent of the firm's pre-tax profits, plus portfolio
management fees.  In 2002, he took home $37 million in cash
when the firm's net income was $53.3 million. Today, Gabelli owns
about 72 percent of the company. 

Despite his wealth, Mario Gabelli cannot seem to find his way out
of trouble.  In March 2006, the U.S. government said it would
join a civil fraud lawsuit against Gabelli, which claims that Lynch
Interactive Corporation, for which Mario Gabelli served as
Chairman, created sham companies to bid for cell phone licenses at
a series of Federal Communications Commission auctions between 1995
and 2000.  Initially, Gabelli vowed to fight the charges, but
by June of 2006, he agreed to settle.   Specific terms of
the deal were not disclosed, but the business press speculated that
Gabelli's settlement payments to the government could top $100
million.  Although GAMCO Investors was not named in the cell
phone suit, it's unlikely to go unscathed by its leaders actions.
"All of GAMCO is predicated on Mario Gabelli's personality, persona
and reputation,'' Rachel Barnard, an analyst with Morningstar, told
Bloomberg.  "These settlements help in the sense that it gets
him out of the news, but in terms of reputation, the damage cannot
be undone."
The cell phone settlement came just a few weeks after Gabelli
settled an unrelated lawsuit brought against him by two of his
earliest investors.  Frederick Mancheski and David Perlmutter
sued in 2003 to dissolve Gabelli Group Capital Partners, Inc. (a
privately held company) because it didn't allow them to sell their
restricted shares.  Under the settlement, Mancheski received
two million GAMCO shares, making him the largest individual
stockholder.

In October 2003, GAMCO received what many of its peers in the
mutual fund industry had been steadily receiving since 2003: a
subpoena from the government.  The New York Attorney General's
office requested information from the firm relating to improper
fund-share trading. Shortly thereafter, GAMCO acknowledged that it
allowed one client to engage in short-term trading of one of its
mutual funds even after other investors had been banned for similar
practices (a practice widely known as market timing, or the rapid
trading of mutual fund shares to take advantage of gaps between the
fund's share price and the current value of its holdings). 
The SEC also subpoenaed the firm for information in October
2004.
