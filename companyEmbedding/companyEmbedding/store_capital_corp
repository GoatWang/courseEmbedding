About Us






Our leadership team brings over 200 years of experience to address your business needs.



Company Profile

Already one of the largest and fastest-growing net-lease REITs in the United States, S|T|O|R|E Capital was co-founded in 2011 by five executives who worked together in various capacities at other organizations. Christopher Volk, Catherine Long, Mary Fedewa, Michael Bennett and Michael Zieg pooled their collective investment, accounting, legal and real estate experience to form Scottsdale, Ariz.-based S|T|O|R|E Capital with a commitment to deliver value-creating real estate lease solutions and build long-lasting relationships with each customer.
Having supplied more than $14 billion in real estate mortgage and lease solutions to customers across the U.S., our senior leadership team has been investing in single tenant real estate for over three decades. Mort Fleischer, our non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, was the first to introduce capital, by way of sale-leaseback transactions, to the rapidly growing chain restaurant industry in the 1980s. With his experience, combined with invaluable guidance, support and wisdom over the years, our executive team considers Mort an honorary founder of STORE. Mort also completed the largest U.S. real estate limited partnership rollup taken public on the New York Stock Exchange with Chris and Cathy in 1994. Subsequently, they formed and took public Spirit Finance Corporation, where they created the country’s first investment-grade real estate debt program designed to finance net lease investments, and guided the company in completing the largest reported U.S. sale-leaseback transaction of its time.
Today, our team continues to partner with real estate intensive business owners to free up capital and create wealth through innovative lease financing solutions.

About Us






Our leadership team brings over 200 years of experience to address your business needs.



Company Profile

Already one of the largest and fastest-growing net-lease REITs in the United States, S|T|O|R|E Capital was co-founded in 2011 by five executives who worked together in various capacities at other organizations. Christopher Volk, Catherine Long, Mary Fedewa, Michael Bennett and Michael Zieg pooled their collective investment, accounting, legal and real estate experience to form Scottsdale, Ariz.-based S|T|O|R|E Capital with a commitment to deliver value-creating real estate lease solutions and build long-lasting relationships with each customer.
Having supplied more than $14 billion in real estate mortgage and lease solutions to customers across the U.S., our senior leadership team has been investing in single tenant real estate for over three decades. Mort Fleischer, our non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, was the first to introduce capital, by way of sale-leaseback transactions, to the rapidly growing chain restaurant industry in the 1980s. With his experience, combined with invaluable guidance, support and wisdom over the years, our executive team considers Mort an honorary founder of STORE. Mort also completed the largest U.S. real estate limited partnership rollup taken public on the New York Stock Exchange with Chris and Cathy in 1994. Subsequently, they formed and took public Spirit Finance Corporation, where they created the country’s first investment-grade real estate debt program designed to finance net lease investments, and guided the company in completing the largest reported U.S. sale-leaseback transaction of its time.
Today, our team continues to partner with real estate intensive business owners to free up capital and create wealth through innovative lease financing solutions.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion.
