(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation  Unless otherwise indicated, references to "our," "we" and "us" in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MPT Operating Partnership, L.P.  Overview  We were incorporated in Maryland on August 27, 2003, primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net-leased healthcare facilities. We also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants. We conduct our business operations in one segment. With the acquisition of properties in Germany and the United Kingdom in 2013 and 2014, we have healthcare investments in the United States and Europe. We have operated as a REIT since April 6, 2004, and accordingly, elected REIT status upon the filing of our calendar year 2004 United States Federal income tax return. Our existing tenants are, and our prospective tenants will generally be, healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations. We offer financing for these operators' real estate through 100% lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long-term basis ranging from 10 to 15 years with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers. We also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases. Our existing portfolio minimum escalators range from 0.5% to 4%, while a limited number of our properties do not have an escalator. Most of our leases and loans also include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases. In addition to rent or mortgage interest, our leases and loans typically require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility. Some leases also may require our tenants to pay percentage rents, which are based on the level of the tenant's revenues from their operations. Finally, we may acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants (which we refer to as RIDEA investments) that gives us a right to share in the tenant's income or loss.  We selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, which they use for acquisitions and working capital. We consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons: (1) it provides opportunities to make income-earning investments that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise, and (2) by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators, we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of, and financing sources for, healthcare facilities.  At December 31, 2014, our portfolio consisted of 132 properties leased or loaned to 27 operators, of which nine are under development and eight are in the form of mortgage loans.  2014 Highlights  In 2014, we invested or committed to invest approximately $1.4 billion in healthcare real estate assets - the highest in our history. These significant investments greatly strengthened our portfolio through geographic, tenant and property type diversification. We expanded total assets by 29%, increased revenues by 29%, completed additional acquisitions in Europe, and reduced our concentration with affiliates of Prime.  A summary of our 2014 highlights is as follows:   Acquired real estate assets, entered into development agreements, entered into leases and made new loan investments, totaling more than $1.4 billion as noted below:   Completed Step 1 of the acquisition, with Waterland Private Equity, of MEDIAN Kliniken Group. Upon the completion of Step 2 (sale-leaseback step) in early 2015, we will have added 38 rehabilitation and two acute care hospitals valued at approximately ?705 million (or approximately $881 million);  Table of Contents   Acquired an acute care hospital in Fairmont, West Virginia for an aggregate purchase price of $15 million from Alecto Healthcare Services ("Alecto"), made a $5 million working capital loan to the tenant and a commitment to fund up to $5 million in capital improvements;   Acquired an acute care hospital in Sherman, Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $32.5 million from Alecto and funded $7.5 million working capital loan to the tenant;   Entered the United Kingdom healthcare market by acquiring an acute care hospital in Peasedown St. John, United Kingdom from Circle Health Ltd., through its subsidiary Circle Hospital (Bath) Ltd. valued at approximately £28.3 million (approximately $48.0 million) incurring approximately £1.1 million (approximately $1.9 million) of transfer and other taxes that have been expensed as acquisition costs;   Acquired a general acute care hospital and an adjacent parcel of land for an aggregate purchase price of $115 million from a joint venture of LHP Hospital Group, Inc. and Hackensack University Medical Center Mountainside;   Executed an additional $150 million agreement with Adeptus Health for the development of acute care hospitals and free-standing emergency departments (began construction on five of these facilities in 2014);   Completed construction and began recording rental income on the following facilities:   Northern Utah Rehabilitation Hospital - $19 million inpatient rehabilitation facility located in South Ogden, Utah;   Oakleaf Surgical Hospital - $30.5 million acute care facility located in Altoona, Wisconsin;   First Choice ER (a subsidiary of Adeptus Health) - Completed 17 acute care facilities totaling approximately $80.3 million.  With these new investments, many of our diversification metrics have improved including:   Individual property diversification - On an individual property basis, we had no investment of any single property greater than 3.1% of our total assets as of December 31, 2014, down from 3.9% as of December 31, 2013;   Geographic diversification - Investments located in California represented 14.6% of our total assets at December 31, 2014, down from 18.7% in the prior year. Investments located in Texas represented 20.2% of our total assets at December 31, 2014, down from 22.7% in the prior year. In addition, we further expanded our portfolio into Europe with the additional RHM acquisitions, Circle Bath and Median transaction (as fully described in Note 3 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).   Sold the real estate of La Palma Community Hospital to Prime Healthcare recognizing a gain on sale of $2.9 million;   Sold the real estate of our Bucks facility pursuant to a purchase option, resulting in a $3.1 million impairment charge;   Restructured our investment in Monroe Hospital by entering into a lease with an affiliate of Prime which had acquired the operations of the facility;  Table of Contents   Received investment grade rating on our unsecured debt of BBB- and a corporate credit rating upgrade from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services to BB+.  2013 Highlights  In 2013, we leveraged our expertise in healthcare real estate, finance and operations to continue executing our strategy to grow and diversify our portfolio of hospital-only investments. We completed our first international acquisition.  A summary of the 2013 highlights is as follows:   Acquired real estate assets, entered into development agreements, entered into leases and made new loan investments, totaling more than $700 million as noted below:   Completed the ?184 million acquisition of 11 German facilities in a sale/leaseback transaction with a new tenant to us, valued at approximately $250 million (including transfer taxes of $12 million). This acquisition expanded both our geographic and tenant diversity;   Completed the $281.3 million acquisition of the real estate of three general acute care hospitals from affiliates of IASIS Healthcare LLC ("IASIS") via a sale/leaseback transaction;   Acquired the real estate of Esplanade Rehab Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas (now operating as Corpus Christi Rehabilitation Hospital) for $15.8 million, which is leased to Ernest under the 2012 master lease;   Acquired the real estate of two acute care hospitals in Kansas from affiliates of Prime for a combined purchase price of $75 million. These properties are leased to Prime pursuant to the master lease agreements;   Commenced construction of several facilities pursuant to a master funding and development agreement with First Choice Emergency Room, LLC ("First Choice") to develop up to 25 free standing emergency rooms (the remaining of these facilities were completed in 2014);   Financed the development of inpatient rehabilitation facilities in South Ogden, Utah and Post Falls, Idaho for a total of $33.5 million, which is leased to Ernest under the 2012 master lease (Post Falls was completed in 2013 and the Ogden facility opened in the 2014 first quarter); and   Provided a $20 million mortgage financing to Alecto for the 204-bed Olympia Medical Center.   Sold the real estate of an inpatient rehabilitation facility, Warm Springs Rehabilitation Hospital of San Antonio, for $14 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $5.6 million;   Sold two long-term acute care hospitals in Texas and Arizona, CHG Cornerstone Hospital of Houston, L.P. and Cornerstone Hospital of Southeast Arizona, for total cash proceeds of $18.5 million, resulting in a $2.1 million gain on the sale.   Issued $150 million of unsecured notes (as a tack on to the 2012 unsecured senior notes), completed a ?200 million euro-denominated (approximately $275 million) long-term fixed rate debt transaction at an annual coupon of 5.75%, and raised $313 million in equity to fund our acquisition activity above.  Table of Contents  2012 Highlights  In 2012, we achieved a number of important milestones, including increasing our assets beyond the $2 billion mark and driving revenues above $200 million. A summary of the 2012 highlights is as follows:   Acquired real estate assets, entered into development agreements, entered into leases, made new loan investments, made RIDEA investments and committed to new development projects totaling more than $800 million as noted below:   Made loans to and acquired assets from Ernest for a combined purchase price and investment of $396.5 million, consisting of $200 million to purchase real estate assets, a first mortgage loan of $100 million, and $96.5 million in RIDEA investments made up of an acquisition loan for $93.2 million and an equity contribution of $3.3 million. With this acquisition, we took ownership of 16 new facilities;   Funded a $100 million mortgage loan secured by the real property of Centinela Hospital Medical Center. Centinela is a 369 bed acute care facility that is operated by Prime;   Acquired the real estate of the 380 bed St. Mary's Regional Medical Center, an acute care hospital in Reno, Nevada for $80 million and the real estate of the 140-bed Roxborough Memorial Hospital in Pennsylvania for $30 million. The acquired facilities are leased to Prime;   Acquired the real estate of a 40-bed long-term acute care hospital in Hammond, Louisiana for $10.5 million and leased the facility to the operator under a 15-year lease. As part of this transaction, we made a secured working capital loan of $2.5 million as well as a revolving loan of up to $2.0 million. In addition, we have made a $2.0 million RIDEA investment for a 25% equity ownership in the operator of this facility;   Entered into an agreement to develop and lease an acute care facility in Altoona, Wisconsin for $33.5 million, with National Surgical Hospitals. The facility was completed in the third quarter of 2014;   Agreed to fund the construction of an inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Spartanburg, South Carolina for Ernest. This facility opened in the third quarter of 2013;   Entered into an agreement with Ernest to develop and lease a 40-bed rehabilitation hospital in Lafayette, Indiana, which opened in the 2013 first quarter;   Amended the current lease on our Victoria, Texas facility with Post Acute Medical to extend the current lease term to 2028, and we agreed to develop and lease a 26-bed facility next to the existing facility. The new facility was completed in the fourth quarter of 2013.   Committed to fund $100 million to First Choice ER, LLC in development financing for up to 25 freestanding emergency room facilities.   Signed our lead tenant for the Twelve Oaks property representing approximately 55% of the building. Operations commenced for this tenant in January 2013;   Sold the real estate of two long-term acute care facilities, Thornton and New Bedford, to Vibra for total cash proceeds of $42 million. The sale of Thornton was completed on September 28, 2012, resulting in a gain of $8.4 million. The sale of New Bedford was completed on October 22, 2012, resulting in a gain of approximately $7 million; and   Established a $100 million term loan facility, issued $220 million of unsecured notes, and $220 million in equity and increased our revolving credit facility by $70 million for the purpose of funding our acquisition activity above.  Critical Accounting Policies  In order to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we must make estimates about certain types of transactions and account balances. We believe that  Table of Contents  our estimates of the amount and timing of our revenues, credit losses, fair values (either as part of a purchase price allocation, impairment analysis or in valuing certain of our Ernest investments), periodic depreciation of our real estate assets, and stock compensation expense, along with our assessment as to whether an entity that we do business with should be consolidated with our results, have significant effects on our financial statements. Each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments. We rely on our experience, collect historical and current market data, and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the critical accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. Our accounting estimates include the following:  Revenue Recognition: We receive income from operating leases based on the fixed, minimum required rents (base rents) per the lease agreements. Rent revenue from base rents is recorded on the straight-line method over the terms of the related lease agreements for new leases and the remaining terms of existing leases for those acquired as part of a property acquisition. The straight-line method records the periodic average amount of base rent earned over the term of a lease, taking into account contractual rent adjustments over the lease term. The straight-line method typically has the effect of recording more rent revenue from a lease than a tenant is required to pay early in the term of the lease. During the later parts of a lease term, this effect reverses with less rent revenue recorded than a tenant is required to pay. Rent revenue, as recorded on the straight-line method, in the consolidated statements of income is presented as two amounts: billed rent revenue and straight-line revenue. Billed rent revenue is the amount of base rent actually billed to the customer each period as required by the lease. Straight-line rent revenue is the difference between rent revenue earned based on the straight-line method and the amount recorded as billed rent revenue. We record the difference between base rent revenues earned and amounts due per the respective lease agreements, as applicable, as an increase or decrease to straight-line rent receivable.  Certain leases may provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the tenant's revenues in excess of specified base amount/threshold (percentage rents). Percentage rents are recognized in the period in which revenue thresholds are met. Rental payments received prior to their recognition as income are classified as deferred revenue. We also receive additional rent (contingent rent) under some leases based on increases in the consumer price index or where the consumer price index exceeds the annual minimum percentage increase in the lease. Contingent rents are recorded as billed rent revenue in the period earned.  We use direct finance lease accounting ("DFL") to record rent on certain leases deemed to be financing leases, per accounting rules, rather than operating leases. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectability of the lease payments is reasonably assured. Investments in DFLs are presented net of unamortized and unearned income.  In instances where we have a profits or equity interest in our tenant's operations, we record income equal to our percentage interest of the tenant's profits, as defined in the lease or tenant's operating agreements, once annual thresholds, if any, are met.  We begin recording base rent income from our development projects when the lessee takes physical possession of the facility, which may be different from the stated start date of the lease. Also, during construction of our development projects, we are generally entitled to accrue rent based on the cost paid during the construction period (construction period rent). We accrue construction period rent as a receivable with a corresponding offset to deferred revenue during the construction period. When the lessee takes physical possession of the facility, we begin recognizing the deferred construction period revenue on the straight-line method over the remaining term of the lease.  We receive interest income from our tenants/borrowers on mortgage loans, working capital loans, and other long-term loans. Interest income from these loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal outstanding and terms of the loans.  Table of Contents  Commitment fees received from development and leasing services for lessees are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the initial term of a lease to produce a constant effective yield on the lease (interest method). Commitment and origination fees from lending services are also recorded as deferred revenue initially and recognized as income over the life of the loan using the interest method.  Investments in Real Estate: We maintain our investments in real estate at cost, and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. While our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility, to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance, we expense those costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the weighted-average useful life of approximately 38 years for buildings and improvements.  When circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments, we review the recoverability of the facility's carrying value. The review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, from the facility's use and eventual disposition. Our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends, and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility on an undiscounted basis, such as was the case with our Monroe and Bucks facilities in 2014, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility. We do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at December 31, 2014; however, given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken.  Acquired Real Estate Purchase Price Allocation: For existing properties acquired for leasing purposes, we account for such acquisitions based on business combination accounting rules. We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate, we may utilize a number of sources, including available real estate broker data, independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, internal data from previous acquisitions or developments, and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.  We record above-market and below-market in-place lease values, if any, for the facilities we own which are based on the present value of the difference between  We measure the aggregate value of other lease intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between (i) the property valued with new or in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and (ii) the property valued as if vacant when acquired. Management's estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, which we expect to be about six months depending on specific local market conditions. Management  Table of Contents  also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal costs, and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction.  Other intangible assets acquired may include customer relationship intangible values, which are based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenant's lease and our overall relationship with that tenant. Characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality, and expectations of lease renewals, including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement, among other factors. At December 31, 2014, we have assigned no value to customer relationship intangibles.  We amortize the value of lease intangibles to expense over the term of the respective leases, which have a weighted average useful life of 17.9 years at December 31, 2014. If a lease is terminated, the unamortized portion of the lease intangible is charged to expense.  Losses from Rent Receivables: For all leases, we continuously monitor the performance of our existing tenants including, but not limited to: admission levels and surgery/procedure volumes by type; current operating margins; ratio of our tenant's operating margins both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs; trends in revenue and patient mix; and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations on tenant's profitability and liquidity.  Losses from Operating Lease Receivables: We utilize the information above along with the tenant's payment and default history in evaluating (on a property-by-property basis) whether or not a provision for losses on outstanding rent receivables is needed. A provision for losses on rent receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) is ultimately recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full. The provision is an amount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from existing collateral, if any.  Losses on DFL Receivables: Allowances are established for DFLs based upon an estimate of probable losses for the individual DFLs deemed to be impaired. DFLs are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the lease. Like operating lease receivables, the need for an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's overall financial condition; economic resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the DFL's effective interest rate, fair value of collateral, and other relevant factors, as appropriate. DFLs are placed on non-accrual status when we determine that the collectability of contractual amounts is not . . .  Mar 02, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Unless otherwise indicated, references to "our," "we" and "us" in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MPT Operating Partnership, L.P.  Overview  We were incorporated in Maryland on August 27, 2003, primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net-leased healthcare facilities. We also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants. We conduct our business operations in one segment. We have healthcare investments in the United States and Europe. We have operated as a REIT since April 6, 2004, and accordingly, elected REIT status upon the filing of our calendar year 2004 United States federal income tax return. Our existing tenants are, and our prospective tenants will generally be, healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations. We offer financing for these operators' real estate through 100% lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long-term basis ranging from 10 to 15 years with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers. We also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases. Our existing portfolio's minimum escalators range from 0.5% to 5%, while a limited number of our properties do not have an escalator. Most of our leases and loans also include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases. In addition to rent or mortgage interest, our leases and loans typically require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility. Some leases also may require our tenants to pay percentage rents, which are based on the tenant's revenues from their operations. Finally, we may acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a right to share in the tenant's income or loss.  We selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, which they use for acquisitions and working capital. We consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons: (1) it provides opportunities to make income-earning investments that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise, and (2) by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators, we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of, and financing sources for, healthcare facilities.  At December 31, 2015, our portfolio consisted of 202 properties leased or loaned to 28 operators, of which nine are under development and 14 are in the form of mortgage loans.  2015 Highlights  In 2015, we invested or committed to invest approximately $1.8 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments greatly strengthened our portfolio through geographic, tenant and property type diversification. We expanded total assets by 51%, increased revenues by 41%, and lowered our general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue to less than 10%.  A summary of our 2015 highlights is as follows:   Acquired real estate assets, entered into development agreements, entered into leases and made new loan investments, totaling more than $1.7 billion as noted below:   Acquired Capella's hospital portfolio including seven acute care hospitals throughout the U.S. and obtained a stake in their operations for a combined total of approximately $900 million. Also, acquired an eighth Capella facility (Kershaw) for $35 million later in the year.   Completed the sale-leaseback transaction of 31 MEDIAN facilities in Germany for an aggregate purchase price of ?646 million;  Table of Contents   Executed a $19 million agreement to develop an inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Toledo, Ohio, acquired an inpatient rehabilitation facility and a long-term acute care hospital in Lubbock, Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $31.5 million, and acquired an inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Weslaco, Texas for $10.7 million all leased to Ernest;   Completed $30 million mortgage financing to Prime for a general acute care hospital in Port Huron, Michigan and subsequently purchased the real estate for $20 million, which reduced the mortgage loan accordingly;   Provided $100 million mortgage financing to Prime for three general acute care hospitals and one free-standing emergency department in New Jersey and acquired two general acute care hospitals in the Kansas City area for $110 million;   Acquired a 266-bed outpatient rehabilitation clinic located in Hannover, Germany from RHM for ?18.7 million;   Executed an additional $250 million agreement with Adeptus Health for the development of acute care hospitals and free-standing emergency departments (completed four of these facilities in 2015); and   Completed construction and began recording rental income on 17 acute care facilities in Texas, Arizona, and Colorado with First Choice ER (a subsidiary of Adeptus Health) totaling approximately $102.6 million and an acute care facility and a medical office building in Birmingham, Alabama with UAB Medical West totaling $8.6 million.  With these new investments, many of our diversification metrics have improved including:   Individual property diversification - On an individual property basis, we had no investment of any single property greater than 2% of our total assets as of December 31, 2015, down from 3.1% as of December 31, 2014; and   Geographic diversification - Investments located in California represented 9.8% of our total assets at December 31, 2015, down from 14.7% in the prior year. Investments located in Texas represented 16.4% of our total assets at December 31, 2015, down from 20.9% in the prior year. In addition, we further expanded our portfolio into Europe with the additional investments in Spain and Italy (as fully described in Note 3 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).   Sold the real estate of a long-term acute care facility in Luling, Texas, and real estate of six wellness centers in the United States for a net gain; and   Increased our senior Credit Facility to $1.95 billion comprised of a $1.3 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and a $250 million senior unsecured term loan facility along with a $400 million accordion feature, issued ?500 million of unsecured notes, and raised $817 million in equity to fund the acquisition activity mentioned above.  2014 Highlights  In 2014, we invested or committed to invest approximately $1.4 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments greatly strengthened our portfolio through geographic, tenant and property type diversification.  Table of Contents  A summary of our 2014 highlights is as follows:   Acquired real estate assets, entered into development agreements, entered into leases and made new loan investments, totaling more than $1.4 billion as noted below:   Completed Step 1 of the two step acquisition of 32 MEDIAN facilities for ?688 million by loaning ?425 million to Waterland and MEDIAN;   Completed the acquisition of three RHM Klinik rehabilitation facilities located in Germany for a transaction valued at approximately ?64 million incurring approximately ?3 million of transfer and other taxes that have been expensed as acquisition costs;   Acquired an acute care hospital in Fairmont, West Virginia for an aggregate purchase price of $15 million from Alecto Healthcare Services ("Alecto"), made a $5 million working capital loan to the tenant and a commitment to fund up to $5 million in capital improvements;   Acquired an acute care hospital in Sherman, Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $32.5 million from Alecto and funded a $7.5 million working capital loan to the tenant;   Entered the United Kingdom healthcare market by acquiring an acute care hospital in Peasedown St. John, United Kingdom from Circle Health Ltd., through its subsidiary Circle Hospital (Bath) Ltd. valued at approximately �28.3 million incurring approximately �1.1 million of transfer and other taxes that have been expensed as acquisition costs;   Acquired a general acute care hospital and an adjacent parcel of land for an aggregate purchase price of $115 million from a joint venture of LHP Hospital Group, Inc. and Hackensack University Medical Center Mountainside;   Executed an additional $150 million agreement with Adeptus Health for the development of acute care hospitals and free-standing emergency departments; and   Completed construction and began recording rental income on the following facilities:   Northern Utah Rehabilitation Hospital - $19 million inpatient rehabilitation facility located in South Ogden, Utah;   Oakleaf Surgical Hospital - $30.5 million acute care facility located in Altoona, Wisconsin; and   First Choice ER - Completed 17 acute care facilities totaling approximately $80.3 million.   Sold the real estate of La Palma Community Hospital to Prime recognizing a gain on sale of $2.9 million;   Sold the real estate of our Bucks facility pursuant to a purchase option, resulting in a $3.1 million impairment charge;   Restructured our investment in Monroe Hospital by entering into a lease with an affiliate of Prime which had acquired the operations of the facility;   Completed a new $1.15 billion senior unsecured credit facility comprised of a $1.025 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and a $125 million senior unsecured term loan facility, issued $300 million of unsecured notes, and raised $138 million in equity to fund the acquisition activity mentioned above; and   Received investment grade rating on our unsecured debt of BBB- and a corporate credit rating upgrade from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services to BB+.  2013 Highlights  In 2013, we leveraged our expertise in healthcare real estate, finance and operations to continue executing our strategy to grow and diversify our portfolio of hospital-only investments. We completed our first international acquisition.  Table of Contents  A summary of the 2013 highlights is as follows:   Acquired real estate assets, entered into development agreements, entered into leases and made new loan investments, totaling more than $700 million as noted below:   Completed the ?184 million acquisition of 11 German facilities in a sale/leaseback transaction with RHM. This acquisition expanded both our geographic and tenant diversity;   Completed the $281.3 million acquisition of the real estate of three general acute care hospitals from affiliates of IASIS Healthcare LLC ("IASIS") via a sale/leaseback transaction;   Acquired the real estate of Esplanade Rehab Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas (now operating as Corpus Christi Rehabilitation Hospital) for $15.8 million, which is leased to Ernest under the 2012 master lease;   Acquired the real estate of two acute care hospitals in Kansas from affiliates of Prime for a combined purchase price of $75 million. These properties are leased to Prime pursuant to the master lease agreements;   Commenced construction of several facilities pursuant to a $100 million master funding and development agreement with First Choice ER to develop up to 25 free standing emergency rooms;   Financed the development of inpatient rehabilitation facilities in South Ogden, Utah and Post Falls, Idaho for a total of $33.5 million, which is leased to Ernest under the 2012 master lease; and   Provided a $20 million mortgage financing to Alecto for the 204-bed Olympia Medical Center.   Sold the real estate of an inpatient rehabilitation facility, Warm Springs Rehabilitation Hospital of San Antonio, for $14 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $5.6 million;   Sold two long-term acute care hospitals in Texas and Arizona, CHG Cornerstone Hospital of Houston, L.P. and Cornerstone Hospital of Southeast Arizona, for total cash proceeds of $18.5 million, resulting in a $2.1 million gain on the sale; and   Issued $150 million of unsecured notes (as a tack on to the 2012 unsecured senior notes), completed a ?200 million euro-denominated long-term fixed rate debt transaction at an annual coupon of 5.75%, and raised $313 million in equity to fund our acquisition activity above.  Critical Accounting Policies  In order to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we must make estimates about certain types of transactions and account balances. We believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of our revenues, credit losses, fair values (either as part of a purchase price allocation, impairment analysis or in valuing certain of our equity investments), periodic depreciation of our real estate assets, and stock compensation expense, along with our assessment as to whether an entity that we do business with should be consolidated with our results, have significant effects on our financial statements. Each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments. We rely on our experience, collect historical and current market data, and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the critical accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. Our accounting estimates include the following:  Revenue Recognition: We receive income from operating leases based on the fixed, minimum required rents (base rents) per the lease agreements. Rent revenue from base rents is recorded on the straight-line method over the terms of the related lease agreements for new leases and the remaining terms of existing leases for those acquired as part of a property acquisition. The straight-line method records the periodic average amount of base  Table of Contents  rent earned over the term of a lease, taking into account contractual rent adjustments over the lease term. The straight-line method typically has the effect of recording more rent revenue from a lease than a tenant is required to pay early in the term of the lease. During the later parts of a lease term, this effect reverses with less rent revenue recorded than a tenant is required to pay. Rent revenue, as recorded on the straight-line method, in the consolidated statements of income is presented as two amounts: rent billed revenue and straight-line revenue. Rent billed revenue is the amount of base rent actually billed to the customer each period as required by the lease. Straight-line rent revenue is the difference between rent revenue earned based on the straight-line method and the amount recorded as rent billed revenue. We record the difference between base rent revenues earned and amounts due per the respective lease agreements, as applicable, as an increase or decrease to straight-line rent receivable.  Certain leases may provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the tenant's revenues in excess of specified base amount/threshold (percentage rents). Percentage rents are recognized in the period in which revenue thresholds are met. Rental payments received prior to their recognition as income are classified as deferred revenue. We also receive additional rent (contingent rent) under some leases based on increases in the consumer price index or where the consumer price index exceeds the annual minimum percentage increase in the lease. Contingent rents are recorded as rent billed revenue in the period earned.  We use direct finance lease ("DFL") accounting to record rent on certain leases deemed to be financing leases, per accounting rules, rather than operating leases. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectability of the lease payments is reasonably assured. Investments in DFLs are presented net of unamortized and unearned income.  In instances where we have a profits or equity interest in our tenant's operations, we record income equal to our percentage interest of the tenant's profits, as defined in the lease or tenant's operating agreements, once annual thresholds, if any, are met.  We begin recording base rent income from our development projects when the lessee takes physical possession of the facility, which may be different from the stated start date of the lease. Also, during construction of our development projects, we are generally entitled to accrue rent based on the cost paid during the construction period (construction period rent). We accrue construction period rent as a receivable with a corresponding offset to deferred revenue during the construction period. When the lessee takes physical possession of the facility, we begin recognizing the deferred construction period revenue on the straight-line method over the remaining term of the lease.  We receive interest income from our tenants/borrowers on mortgage loans, working capital loans, and other long-term loans. Interest income from these loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal outstanding and terms of the loans.  Commitment fees received from development and leasing services for lessees are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the initial term of a lease to produce a constant effective yield on the lease (interest method). Commitment and origination fees from lending services are also recorded as deferred revenue initially and recognized as income over the life of the loan using the interest method.  Investments in Real Estate: We maintain our investments in real estate at cost, and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. While our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility, to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance, we expense those costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the weighted-average useful life of approximately 39 years for buildings and improvements.  Table of Contents  When circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments, we review the recoverability of the facility's carrying value. The review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, from the facility's use and eventual disposition. Our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends, and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility on an undiscounted basis, such as was the case with our Monroe and Bucks facilities in 2014, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility. We do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at December 31, 2015; however, given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken.  Acquired Real Estate Purchase Price Allocation: For existing properties acquired for leasing purposes, we account for such acquisitions based on business combination accounting rules. We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate, we may utilize a number of sources, including available real estate broker data, independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, internal data from previous acquisitions or developments, and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.  We record above-market and below-market in-place lease values, if any, for the facilities we own which are based on the present value of the difference between  We measure the aggregate value of other lease intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between (i) the property valued with new or in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and (ii) the property valued as if vacant when acquired. Management's estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, which we expect to be about six months (based on experience) depending on specific local market conditions. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal costs, and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction.  Other intangible assets acquired may include customer relationship intangible values, which are based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenant's lease and our overall relationship with that tenant. Characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality, and expectations of lease renewals, including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement, among other factors. At December 31, 2015, we have assigned no value to customer relationship intangibles.  Table of Contents  We amortize the value of lease intangibles to expense over the term of the respective leases, which have a weighted average useful life of 25.6 years at December 31, 2015. If a lease is terminated, the unamortized portion of the lease intangible is charged to expense - as was the case with our Twelve Oaks facility in 2015.  Losses from Rent Receivables: For all leases, we continuously monitor the performance of our existing tenants including, but not limited to: admission levels and surgery/procedure volumes by type; current operating margins; ratio of our tenant's operating margins both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs; trends in revenue and patient mix; and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations on tenant's profitability and liquidity.  Losses from Operating Lease Receivables: We utilize the information above along with the tenant's payment and default history in evaluating (on a property-by-property basis) whether or not a provision for losses on outstanding rent receivables is needed. A provision for losses on rent receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) is ultimately recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full. The provision is an amount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from existing collateral, if any.  In regards to our Florence and Twelve Oaks facilities, we analyzed whether or not a provision of loss was needed at December 31, 2015 based on the outstanding receivables due to us. However, after reviewing the tenant's business, all available credit enhancements (such as letters of credit) and subsequent cash receipts, we believe no such provision was needed at this time. However, no assurances can be given that future provisions of losses will not be taken.  Losses on DFL Receivables: Allowances are established for DFLs based upon an estimate of probable losses for the individual DFLs deemed to be impaired. DFLs are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the lease. Like operating lease receivables, the need for an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's overall financial condition; economic resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the DFL's effective interest rate, fair value of collateral, and other relevant factors, as appropriate. DFLs are placed on non-accrual status when we determine that the collectability of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. While on non-accrual status, we generally account for the DFLs on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash.  Loans: Loans consist of mortgage loans, working capital loans and other long-term loans. Mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property. Working capital and other long-term loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees. We record loans at cost. We evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal on a loan-by-loan basis (using the same process as we do for assessing the collectability of rents as discussed above) to determine whether they are . . .
