CST Brands & CrossAmerica Announce Dropdown Transactions and 
      Acquisition of One Stop Stores





Dropdown to CrossAmerica of 29 “New to Industry” stores and 12.5 
        percent interest in CST’s U.S. wholesale fuel supply business


CrossAmerica agrees to acquire One Stop network of stores in 
        West Virginia


Transactions to close in the third quarter of 2015







June 15, 2015 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN ANTONIO & ALLENTOWN, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CST Brands, Inc. (NYSE:CST) (“CST Brands”) and CrossAmerica Partners LP 
      (NYSE:CAPL) (“CrossAmerica” or “The Partnership”) announced today two 
      dropdown transactions totaling approximately $261.5 million between CST 
      Brands and CrossAmerica. The transactions are expected to close in the 
      third quarter of 2015.
    


      In addition, CrossAmerica has entered into a definitive agreement to 
      acquire the One Stop convenience store network, based in Charleston, 
      West Virginia, that is also expected to close in the third quarter of 
      2015.
    

      “This is the second dropdown transaction between CST and CrossAmerica 
      and the first to include our New to Industry stores,” said Kim Lubel, 
      Chairman and CEO of CST Brands. “In the nine short months since we 
      acquired the general partner of CrossAmerica, the Partnership has 
      executed over one half billion dollars of acquisitions and dropdowns.”
    

Dropdown of “New To Industry” Stores and Fuel Supply


      CST Brands has agreed to sell to CrossAmerica the real property 
      associated with 29 recently constructed “New to Industry” (“NTI”) stores 
      for an aggregate consideration of approximately $135.5 million. The NTI 
      stores are larger formatted stores that accommodate broader merchandise 
      categories and food offerings and have more fuel dispensers than CST 
      Brands’ legacy stores. CrossAmerica will lease the acquired real 
      property to CST Brands at a “triple net” lease rate of 7.5% for a ten 
      year initial term, which will renew automatically at predetermined lease 
      rate increases.
    

      CrossAmerica has also agreed to acquire an additional 12.5% limited 
      partner interests in CST Fuel Supply LP (CST’s U.S. wholesale fuel 
      supply business) for total consideration of approximately $126.0 
      million. CST Fuel Supply LP (and its subsidiaries) provides fuel to 
      substantially all of CST’s U.S. company operated convenience stores and 
      largely maintains the fuel supply agreements between CST and its fuel 
      suppliers. CST Fuel Supply LP distributed approximately 1.9 billion 
      gallons of fuel in 2014, and is expected to earn a net profit margin of 
      approximately 5 cents per gallon of wholesale motor fuel distributed.
    

      The aggregate consideration of approximately $261.5 million will consist 
      of $142.0 million in cash and approximately $119.5 million or 3.6 
      million newly issued common units representing limited partner interests 
      in CrossAmerica.
    

      The independent executive committee of the board of directors of CST 
      Brands and the independent conflicts committee of the board of directors 
      of the general partner of CrossAmerica have, as applicable, approved the 
      terms of the dropdowns of the 29 NTI stores and 12.5% interest in CST 
      Fuel Supply from CST Brands to CrossAmerica.
    

      The conflicts committee of the board of directors of the general partner 
      was advised by Evercore Partners as its independent financial advisor 
      and Richards, Layton & Finger as its independent legal counsel. Paul 
      Hastings acted as legal counsel to CST Brands.
    

Acquisition of One Stop Network of Stores


      CrossAmerica has agreed to purchase the 41 company-operated One Stop 
      convenience store network (“One Stop”) based in Charleston, West 
      Virginia, along with 4 commission agent sites, 9 dealer fuel supply 
      agreements and one freestanding franchised quick service restaurant.
    

      Of the 45 company-operated and commission agent sites, 30 are owned fee 
      simple locations. Five of the company-operated locations have quick 
      service restaurants. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 
      2014, the aggregate 54 sites sold approximately 36 million gallons of 
      motor fuel primarily under the Marathon and Exxon fuel brands, and had 
      approximately $40.5 million in inside sales.
    

      "We are delighted to acquire the One Stop portfolio,” said CEO Joe 
      Topper. "Michael Graney, President of One Stop, has built a regional 
      powerhouse organization with a strong basis for future growth. This 
      acquisition further solidifies Cross America’s commitment to West 
      Virginia and Virginia," Joe added.
    

      "We are excited to join the CrossAmerica Team and look forward to a 
      bright future for our valued and loyal employees and customers and the 
      communities we serve," said Michael Graney, President of One Stop.
    

      The NTI and fuel drop downs and the One Stop convenience store network 
      acquisition are subject to customary conditions to closing, including 
      financing, and are expected to close in the third quarter of 2015.

CST Brands Plans Second Dropdown to CrossAmerica
Forty new-to-industry stores will be transitioned this summer.

May 8, 2015, 04:36 pm
By Brian Berk, Convenience Store News 


 



SAN ANTONIO  — CST Brands Inc. will drop down approximately 40 new-to-industry (NTI) stores to CrossAmerica Partners LP this summer, CST Chairman and CEO Kim Lubel ​confirmed Friday during a joint 2015 first-quarter earnings call for both companies. These dropdowns will be stores that have been built since CST was spun off from former parent company Valero Energy Corp. in May 2013. 
A price associated with the deal has not yet been determined, according to Lubel. Along with passing ownership of the real estate of these stores to CrossAmerica, CST will hand over the wholesale fuel supply contracts. However, the parent of Corner Store convenience stores will continue to operate these stores.
CST purchased 100 percent of the membership interests of the general partner and 100 percent of the outstanding incentive distribution rights of Allentown, Pa.-based CrossAmerica, a master limited partnership (MLP), effective Oct 1.
This summer's transaction will mark the second dropdown CST has made to CrossAmerica this year. In January, it closed on the sale of a 5-percent limited partner equity interest in CST Fuel Supply to CrossAmerica in exchange for common units representing an approximate 6.1-percent limited partner interest in CrossAmerica.
STRATEGY FOR CONTINUED GROWTH
As it drops down stores, CST will continue to build NTI stores and seek acquisitions. The company plans to build 35 to 40 new Corner Store locations in the United States in 2015, along with 10 to 12 Dépanneur Du Coin convenience stores in Canada.
On the merger and acquisition front, Lubel said the market remains “fragmented.” There are more potential sellers and acquirers than in the past, but plenty of opportunities still exist.
“We think we are a very attractive buyer,” she said. “We know how to run core stores and have done so for decades.”

CST is looking for acquisitions in areas of strong economic conditions, and a solid network in terms of stores. One potential region CST is looking at for growth is the upper Midwest, Lubel revealed, adding that CrossAmerica’s purchase of Erickson Oil Products Inc., which included 64 c-stores, has been very successful thus far.
CST EARNINGS RISE
CST saw overall net earnings rise by $3 million for its latest quarter ended March 31, to $14 million.
“Led by a strong U.S. fuel margin along with continued growth in same-store merchandise sales, both in the U.S. and Canada, we delivered solid results for the first quarter of 2015,” said Lubel. “The momentum in inside-store traffic has positioned us well for the upcoming summer driving season.”
Looking at U.S. retail operations more in-depth, total operating income rose $18 million year over year to $42 million. Fuel margins increased 4 cents per gallon year over year to 14 cents per gallon, which Lubel noted was especially impressive considering the first quarter is seasonally weaker in this category.
Merchandise gross profits rose $5 million to $97 million, with same-store sales increasing 3 percent — the fourth consecutive quarter in terms of growth in this area.
On a core per-store basis, CST’s U.S. retail division sold 4,966 gallons of fuel per site per day. In terms of dollars, motor fuel sales were $10,967 per site per day. Inside the store, merchandise sales per site per day came in at $3,488, an increase of $267 per site per day.
NTI stores led the way in in-store merchandise sales. CST also cited fountain drinks as an area of excellent growth, which often leads to purchases of other high-margin in-store merchandise items. CST believes this growth can continue as it recently installed 160 Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain machines in the Southwest.
As for its current fiscal second quarter, CST provided initial guidance that U.S. gallons sold per store per day will be in the range of 5,100-5,200. Merchandise sales per store per day are expected to be in the $3,950-$4,050 range, with merchandise gross margins ranging between 29.5 percent and 30.5 percent.
The San Antonio-based retailer operated 1,035 c-stores as of March 31.
CROSSAMERICA INCREASES PROFITS
Allentown, Pa.-based CrossAmerica’s companywide earnings totaled $35 million in its most recent quarter ended March 31, compared to $16.7 million during the same quarter in 2014.
Its retail division, primarily consisting of its Erickson Oil and Petroleum Marketers Inc. acquisitions, sold 46.1 million gallons of fuel at a gross margin of 10.2 cents per gallon, vs. 15.3 million gallons at a 2.1-cent margin in the first quarter of 2014.
CrossAmerica’s in-store merchandise gross margins totaled $7.8 million in its most recent quarter. The MLP did not have these retail operations in the first quarter of 2014.

NTI Backup Now EZ Frequently Asked Questions



 


What is the difference between the OEM version of Backup Now EZ and the Retail version of Backup Now EZ: 
The difference between the OEM version of Backup Now EZ and the Retail version of Backup EZ is that with the OEM version you can only backup to the Toshiba External Drive as in the retail version you can backup to any external drives, CD/DVD, or network hard drives.
I performed a 'complete system backup' recently. I noticed a message this morning that said that I had never backed up my registry. How do I make sure my registry gets backed up? 
That message is from a different application telling you it has not backed up your registry. The Complete System Backup backs up everything on all the partitions on you first physical hard drive. This includes your Windows registry. Since applications do not know what other applications have done, the program that is giving you that message is telling you that it also wants to backup your registry.
My destination drive is filling up very fast, as the folder of the 'Images' and ‘My Files’ generated from the backups are very large. Is there a way to identify and delete old backups? If so, can this be done automatically? 
Backup Now EZ runs an initial full backup for the baseline backup and then runs incremental backups. Because of this if you delete any backup files; you need to delete them all. When you do that, the next time the backup runs it will create a new full baseline backup followed by more incremental backups. If you have enough space, you can rename the backup folder, run the backup to create the new baseline backup and then delete the old, renamed backup folder.
Is it necessary to make a new bootable disc each time I run a complete system backup? 
While the message to create a bootable disc appears at the end of every run of the Complete System Backup, there is no difference in the discs created, once you have made one, you do not need to make another.
I have 6 HD in my computer. C:, E:, F:, G:, H:, I:. How do I change the system drive in the backup program? It is not getting my C drive but it is getting the H drive. How can I change the drive what my system is in? 
The Complete System Backup in Backup Now EZ backs up the first physical drive. If your drives are SATA, that would be the drive connected to your lowest SATA port. If your drives are IDE that would be the Primary Master IDE drive. Backup Now EZ only works for IDE and SATA drives in the Complete System Backup.
I have a specific folder on the C drive that I would like to backup, but the software doesn’t backup that folder at all. It backs up rest of the files and folders. Why? 
The File and Folder Backup job from Backup Now EZ backs up all files on your C drive based on a filter. The filter selects photos, videos, audio files, Word documents, Excel files, PDF files, PowerPoint files, IE and Firefox favorites and email from Outlook, Outlook Express and Windows Mail. If you want it to back up any other files, you need to modify the source and select the file or folder in the Advanced tab. Then it will backup that file or folder.
When I first ran a backup, 'Status Details' indicated 'backups did not run' and 'completed with errors' appeared under the 'backup schedule' icon under File and Folder Backup and Complete System Backup. 
Try running CHKDSK to look for and attempt repair of bad sectors and file system errors; you can do this by opening My Computer and right clicking on C drive and select Properties. In the properties window, click on the Tools tab, in the Tools tab click on the check now button in the Error Checking section. In the window that opens select both options and the click on OK. You computer will need to reboot to run CHKDSK. Also, from your antivirus software, delete everything from the quarantine. And if you have a Vista or Windows 7, try turning off the User Account Control (UAC) and see if you still have this issue. You can turn off the UAC by opening the Windows Control Panel and going into the User Accounts function. If you are in the Control Panel Home view, you will need to click on User Accounts twice. In User Accounts, click on the link that says “turn User Account Control on or off”. Then uncheck the checkbox where it says “Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer” and click on the OK button. Then restart your computer.
How do I restore a single file from an image backup? 
If you did a complete system backup, you cannot pick and choose what you want to restore. With complete system backup you need to restore everything.
All of my backup files on my external hard drive are .NBF file extension, how do I restore? 
In the My Files folder on your destination drive, you should have a File and Fodler.CAL file and your File and Folder*.NBF files. The CAL file is used to track which files are in which NBF files. To restore this, you can click on the Restore button in the mail screen for Backup Now EZ or you can open the action menu and click on restore from the main screen for Backup Now EZ. Then your backup will be automatically selected and you will be able to select your restore points. Then you will be able to select the files you want to restore and restore them. The Complete system backup can only be restored by booting from a bootable CD or DVD made in Backup Now EZ by running the Create Bootable Disc tool in the Tools menu in Backup Now EZ.
Main NTI Backup Now EZ screen shows 'Status Details: this computer is fully protected' and scheduled backups are running. How do I test the Complete System Backup to make sure it will work in case of system failure? Clicking 'restore' button on the main screen it only seems to give me the option to restore files and folders not the complete system. 
To test the Complete System Backup, you need to boot into the Complete System Backup restore system. This can be done by booting from the bootable DVD from the Tools menu in Backup Now EZ. To tsets it, you do not want to restore to your current primary drive. You need to replace it. If your drive is an IDE drive, you will need to install a different drive as the Primary Master IDE drive. If your drive is a SATA drive, you will need to connect it to the lowest SATA port on your mother board. If you system is a lap top. You just need to remove your current drive and replace it with a different drive. After the drive is replaced, you can boot into the bootable disc made from Backup Now EZ. Your backup will be automatically found and selected. Then you can select your restore point and restore to the new drive.
After installing the software, which came installed on the Toshiba USB drive I do not see any external device on the welcome screen when I try to open the modify button. My Toshiba USB drive is shown in windows as well as in device manager. 
With your Toshiba drive connected go to Device Manager. In Device Manager, go to the Universal Serial Bus Controllers. Under the Universal Bus Controllers select the USB Mass Storage Device and open its properties window. In the properties windows, select the Details tab. In the Details tab select Hardware IDs in the drop down list. The entries there should start with USB\VID_0480. If it does not, there is something wrong with your drive and you should contact Toshiba Storage Device Technical Support at www.toshibastorage.com. If the entries do start with USB\VID_0480, then try un-installing and re-installing Backup Now EZ for it may be corrupted.
How to view File and Folder backup files? 
To view the contents of your file and folder backup, you just need to click on the restore button on the bottom of the main screen for Backup Now EZ. This will open the file and folder restore. The file and folder restore should automatically find your File and Folder.CAL file and display your most recent restore point. If the restore point it finds is not for the system, you can click on the browse button (folder icon) to browse to your File and Folder.CAL file. If you want to look at an earlier restore point, you can change the restore point by clicking on the restore point drop down list and selecting your desired restore point. If you want to view the contents of your file and folder backup on a system that does not have Backup Now EZ installed, you can go into your Toshiba drive, open the Restore folder and run the RestoreStarter application. This will start the standalone restore application.
Can I do a full backup of two separate computers using this program? If so, how? 
You should be able to do backup multiple computers to the same destination. By default the complete system backup and file and folder backup will have the name of the computer in parenthesis so when restoring you will know which computer to restore what to.
What is the difference between Complete System Backup and File & Folder backup? 
The difference between complete system back up and file and folder backup is that file and folder backup backs up your files and folders only. File and folder backup will not backup any program files. Complete system backup will do an image backup of your entire drive.

Mergers & Acquisitions News
CST Brand BuildingCEO expects new-store momentum to continue, along with network optimizationBy 

Greg Lindenberg,
Editor, CSP










November 11, 2014
Kim LubelSAN ANTONIO -- Kim Lubel, chairman, president and CEO of
CST Brands Inc., expressed confidence during the third-quarter 2014 earnings call that the company will meet its goal of opening 38 new-to-industry (NTI) convenience stores this year, and she was equally optimistic that the company will build between 45 and 55 NTI sites in 2015."We anticipate this level of organic growth to continue in future years supported by our partnership with CrossAmerica," said Lubel.  "We're not letting any grass grow beneath our feet," she said, referring to both organic growth plans and synergies from acquisitions."To date, we've opened 25 stores and plan to open 13 more between now and the end of the year," she continued. "By the end of 2014, we [will] have built and opened 60 new to industry stores in the last two years alone, 11 more than the total built over the previous five years. … [and] our new, larger-format stores generate on average almost twice the inside store sales and fuel sales as our core legacy stores."Lubel also offered an update on the sale of the approximately 100 convenience stores that the company is divesting as part of its network optimization plan."Bids for these convenience stores have been received and evaluated by our management team, and we expect to close on the sale of 85 to 95 of these convenience stores over the next two quarters. As of today, we've already closed on 12 of those sites," she announced.CST Brands also recently closed on the purchase of the general partner and incentive distribution rights of
CrossAmerica Partners LP, the former
Lehigh Gas Partners, Allentown, Pa., and on the acquisition of Canastota, N.Y.-based
Nice N Easy Grocery Shoppes Inc. with CrossAmerica.The new builds and these deals show that the company will "continue to grow in the future both organically and through acquisitions. We believe that the convenience retail market remains fragmented with many retail, wholesale and combined opportunities," she said. "We intend to focus on and prioritize those opportunities that make the most economic sense" for CST Brands and CrossAmerica.Lubel would not provide an exact dropdown schedule for c-stores to CrossAmerica, but said, "We are looking at NTIs that are potential dropdowns as those that have been built and open since we've spun out [of Valero in May 2013]. … We would expect to drop those down here in the coming months, but we haven't set out a specific schedule for those yet, so that's how we view the NTI drop-down piece, including eventually over time, as we've said before, the fuel supply to both our NTIs and our legacy stores is another MLP [master limited partnership] asset that will over time be dropped into the partnership."As for the current mergers-and-acquisition landscape, she said "it is certainly a market that is ripe for consolidation, and I think between CST and CrossAmerica combined, we're really at the forefront of that consolidation process. As we look at acquisition opportunities, we don't have a specific network size in mind. We really want to look at stores that fit both kind of what CST's perspective is on in-store sales opportunities, but also have decent fuel volume sales to help out with the partnership side of things."She continued, "In terms of geography, one of the reasons that we changed the name from Lehigh Gas to CrossAmerica was really to reflect the fact that we expect to grow across the U.S. with our partnership with CrossAmerica, and I think our acquisition of Nice N Easy shows just that. We stepped out, pretty far out of our marketplace up to upstate New York for that acquisition, and with that got some terrific store operations and some strong fuel sales that will also help on the MLP side."Minimizing that geographic leap, Lubel said, "Where those stores are located, they're actually not that far from our Canadian base and clearly driving distance from Allentown as well, so there is some scale that we're building up in that part of the country as well. … This is a national world, and CPG [consumer packaged goods] companies are national companies, and we have strong relationships with the CPG companies that we do business with. They're the same companies that are doing business in New York, so we expect that many of the synergies that we get will come fast."CST Brands is one of the largest independent retailers of motor fuels and convenience merchandise in North America. Based in San Antonio, it has approximately 1,900 locations throughout the Southwestern United States and Eastern Canada. In the U.S., CST Corner Stores sell fuel and signature products such as Fresh Choices baked and packaged goods, U Force energy and sport drinks, Cibolo Mountain coffee, FC Soda and Flavors2Go fountain drinks. In Canada, CST is the exclusive provider of Ultramar fuel and its Dépanneur du Coin and Corner Stores sell signature Transit Café coffee and pastries. CST also owns the general partner of CrossAmerica Partners LP, an MLP and wholesale distributor of fuels.

The Low-Cost NTI ST-IPHD-LC HDMI Over IP Extender consists of a local unit that connects to an HDMI source, and a remote unit that connects to an HDMI display. The local and remote units can be connected together for a Point-to-Point connection via CATx or a Point-to-Many connection via a network switch. Support for multiple transmitters requires a managed network switch. NTI ST-IPHD-LC Features and Benefits:Supports HDTV resolutions to 1080p and computer resolutions to 1920x1200.Ideal solution for digital signage applications.Broadcast real-time HDMI video and audio signals to multiple display locations with a managed or non-managed network switch.Transmits an HDMI signal over one CAT5e/6 cable.Plug-and-Play installation allows receivers to find the transmitters automatically on the same subnet. (Network configuration may be required for managed network switch.)Web interface for changing IP addresses, firmware updates and resetting units to factory default settings.Easily expandable. Add remote units as you add monitors.Inexpensive CAT5e/6 cable replaces bulky video cables.Supports 10/100 Ethernet connection.Built in default EDID table. HDCP compliant.Support for multiple transmitters requires a managed network switch with VLAN/IGMP support. Standard LAN switches can only support one transmitter. The managed switch must support port based IEEE 802.1Q VLAN, IGMP, and permit duplicate IP addresses across the VLAN domains.Each VLAN acts as a separate HDMI Over IP Channel on the network.Number of local and remote units that can be used is dependent on the backplane bandwidth of the switch.Cascade manage switches up to 3 levels, allowing the farthest display to be located up to 1,000 feet away from the source device. Each receiver can be located up to 330 feet away.If a non-managed network switch is used for a point-to-many connection, it is not recommended to use other network devices on the same switch as it may cause a degradation in performance.Uses M-JPEG technology to process image compression on a fixed bandwidth. Note: at high resolutions, characters on PCs get noticeably fuzzy due to image compression and decompression process.Local and remote units must be in the same LAN. The units do not support WAN connections.NTI HDMI over IP Extender Diagram(ST-IPHD-LC depicted here)NTI ST-IPHD-LC Specifications:MechanicalWidth2.28 in.Height1.02 in.Depth4.33 in.PowerAC Adapter100 to 240 VAC @ 50/60HzPower Consumption3W (Receiver and Transmitter)Environmental Operating/Storage Temperature14 to 140�F (-10 to 60�C)Operating/Storage Humidity20 to 90% non-condensing RHLocal Unit Connectors1 x HDMI-A port for source connection;1 x RJ45 port for sending video/audio signalsRemote Unit Connectors1 x HDMI-A port for HDTV or computer display;1 x RJ45 port for receiving video/audio signals;ResolutionHDTV: Up to 1080p;Computer: Up to 1920 x 1200Regulatory ApprovalsCE, FCC, RoHSQuestion: I want to take advantage of sending one signal 1,000 ft. away over my companies current LAN network. How do I do that? What do I need? How much does it cost? Thanks!
Answer: Thank you for your inquiry.  A number of factors will determine the type of device/system best suited for your deployment.  

Please contact your KVM Switches Online representative directly at 1-877-586-6654 or via our online chat feature to discuss your project in greater detail.Question: Do you have software that can read the feeds from the transmitter, or is it only the receiver that can pickup the stream?
Answer: Thank you for your inquiry. There is a web based interface for this device, used to set IP addresses and upgrade firmware, but we are not aware of any software to read the stream.  The only way to pick up the data and render the video is through the receiver.  Question: Customer spec ST-IPHD-LC, is this good part no?
Answer: Thank you for your inquiry,

As far as the quality of the ST-IPHD-LC, I have personally heard good feedback on the reliability and intuitive setup process. I haven't heard of any negative feedback on this unit or other IP range extenders - since this is plugged directly in the network, unlike with wireless extenders, you shouldn't notice any drop in quality or any major latency.

If you would like a recommendation based on your setup, please feel free to contact your KVM Switches Online sales representative directly at 1-877-586-6654, at sales@kvm-switches-online.com, or via our online Chat functionality.Question: is "ST-IPHD-LC" a good/complete number? What is above pull-down? IP
Answer: Thank you for your inquiry,

Northern Tier Energy - Crack Spread Is Key To Next Earnings Report - Northern Tier Energy (NYSE:NTI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Northern Tier Energy - Crack Spread Is Key To Next Earnings ReportJul.10.15 | About: Northern Tier (NTI) Bruder Capital, LLC Long/short equity, dividend investing, event-driven, bondsBruder CapitalSummaryNorthern Tier Energy LP share prices are rebounding from a dip at Q2 end.NTI shares' trade price is very much linked to crack spreads and, specifically, the 6:3:2:1 crack spread.Here's what you should know in advance of the August 4th earnings report date.Northern Tier Energy LP (NYSE: NTI) is up 15% year to date but that figure includes a 6.2% price drop in Q2'15. The second quarter price drop occurred even after NTI posted excellent Q1'15 results and upped its dividend from 49 cents per share in February to $1.09 in May. That implied a 12 month dividend yield of 12.22%. I suspect that 12 month dividend yield will go higher when NTI reports Q2'15 results on August 4th. Good results, higher expectations, rising dividends - but, until the China and Greece crises dissipated, a lower price. It begs the question: why did NTI common shares drop so hard last quarter…? Moreover, should investors expect similar treatment from the market after NTI pays out its next dividend in mid-August…?
Getting Down With My NTI Self. Northern Tier Energy LP is an independent downstream energy company headquartered in Tempe, AZ with refining, retail and pipeline operations that serve the PADD II (Midwest) region of the United States.
NTI's St. Paul Park, Minnesota refinery processes 97,800 barrels per stream day. The refinery is in a geographically advantageous position, able to source Bakken crude at a cheaper price than what other refiners pay for West Texas Intermediate crude. Canadian crude is 38% of its feedstock while 58% is sourced in the US. NTI's end products are 48% gasoline, 35% distillates, 11% asphalt, and 6% other. Along with the refinery, NTI owns storage and transportation assets, including a light products terminal, a heavy products terminal, storage tanks, rail loading/unloading facilities and a Mississippi river dock.
On its retail side, NTI operates 165 SuperAmerica trademarked convenience stores and franchises another 95 convenience stores. The SuperAmerica stores are concentrated in the Twin Cities in Minnesota and in western Wisconsin. Between 40% and 50% of the St. Paul Park refinery's gasoline is sold through the SuperAmerica system. Last, NTI owns a bakery and commissary under the SuperMom's brand. NTI is headquartered in Tempe, Arizona.

NTI's general partner is Western Refining Inc (NYSE: WNR). WNR owns 38% of NTI's limited partnership interests and, at a $4.4 billion equity market capitalization, dwarfs NTI's $2.4 billion market capitalization. In November 2013, WNR purchased its NTI partnership position for $775 million - the sellers were TPG Capital and other private equity holders. WNR separately owns refineries in El Paso, TX and Gallup, NM, retail service stations, convenience stores, and unmanned fleet fueling locations in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, and 66% of the limited partnership interest of Western Refining Logistics, LP (NYSE:WNRL).
On the mergers and acquisitions front, WNR may decide to purchase the remaining 62% of NTI that it doesn't already own. And NTI management is separately considering the sale of logistics assets. For now, however, investors should evaluate NTI on a stand-alone basis which means you are looking at a single refinery partnership paying a variable dividend based on distributable cash flow that changes over time. Since investors don't know exactly what they will be paid from quarter to quarter, there is a tendency to discount NTI common units based on expectations of its distributable cash flow.
How NTI's Doing. For the 12 months ending Q1'15, NTI generated $5.0 billion revenue, $452 million adjusted EBITDA and $170 million of free cash flow. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA fell to 0.5x. From the financial summary table below, the most salient operating statistics you should note are the spike up in Q1'15 operating and EBITDA margins. Operating margin ran 15.1% in Q1'15 (versus 2.3% in Q4'14 and 6.5% in Q1'14) and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.5% in Q1'15 (versus 11.6% in Q4'14 and 7.7% in Q1'14). The solid increase in margins translated into $1.20 of earnings per share (or $1.08 Adjusted EPS). This allowed NTI to distribute $1.08 per common unit on May 29th, dramatically up from the previous quarter's $0.49 cent distribution.
I've included in the table below consensus estimates for the June and September quarters. What drives the partnership's ability to make higher distributions is the crack spread and, implicitly, any estimate of NTI's profitability will revolve around an estimate of what its crude oil feedstock cost will look like. Before we get to that discussion, first let me draw your attention to why that crack spread is so important.

It's the Refinery, Stupid. NTI's St. Paul Park refinery operations are easily the most important part of the company. Per the segment analysis in the table below, last quarter NTI booked $690 million revenue from its refinery operations and $123 million in Adjusted EBITDA. By comparison, its retail operations generated $249 million revenue and $4 million EBITDA in Q1'15. I have detailed this in the segment analysis below. There are intercompany eliminations that tie in to the consolidated numbers but any analysis of NTI should logically start with the company's most important revenue and profit contributor, its refinery business.
I most want to draw your attention to the additional information I've included in this segment analysis viz WTI crude prices and the 6:3:2:1 crack spread. I am showing you in the table what the average crude price was in each quarter (a proxy for but not NTI's actual feedstock cost). I am using the WTI Cushing Crude Oil 6321 ULSD Crack Spread/NY Harbor as a proxy for, but not NTI's actual margin per barrel of throughput. Note that when that crack spread is higher, NTI's gross margin per barrel of throughput tends to be higher. At an average $14.06 crack spread in Q4'14, NTI's gross margin was $11.54 per barrel. But at an average $17.22 crack spread in Q1'15, NTI's gross margin was $20.77 per barrel.

Given the St. Paul Park refinery's location and its flexibility (i.e., the ability to crack different types of crude), that $20.77 gross margin per barrel is one of the highest you will see among independent refiners in Q1'15. In Q2'15, however, investors watching for clues beyond crack spreads also saw the Canadian crude differential to WTI and Bakken crude differential to WTI tighten up. That's the most likely explanation for the dip at Q2'15 end.

I'm Looking Forward to August 4th. NTI is scheduled to release its Q2'15 results on Tuesday, August 4th before the market opens. (Note: A conference call with management is scheduled for 11:30 am the same day, domestic call in number 877-474-9503; use PIN code 56201148).
For Q2'15, management guidance is 95,000 to 99,000 of throughput at the refinery with 20% to 26% coming from heavy crude. Management tends to be conservative in its guidance. Direct operating expenses at Saint Paul Park are expected by management to be $4.80-$5.30 per barrel of throughput, not including turnaround expenditures. That's higher than the $4.30-$4.90 figure that management expected for Q1'15. Management also expects capital expenditures to be higher in Q2'15 at $19 million versus the $6 million expenditure in Q1'15. Management had previously forecast an $11 million capex spend for Q1'15 at the end of last year.

I'm looking forward to seeing the earnings release. In particular, I will want to know what gross margin per barrel of throughput looked like in Q2. But I can already take a stab at what it might be. Note that at $17.53 the average 6:3:2:1 crack spread in Q2'15 was slightly above what we saw in Q1'15. Unless throughput volumes were down significantly from the first quarter, I'd expect NTI to report a Q2'15 level of distributable cash flow that was fairly close to Q1'15 and a dividend payment that could easily beat the $1.08 we saw in Q1'15.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.

Good morning, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call for both Western Refining and Northern Tier Energy. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded. And your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank You.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Beyersdorfer, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations of Western Refining. Mr.Beyersdorfer, Please go ahead, sir.
Jeffrey S. Beyersdorfer
Thanks Jackie, and good morning. I would like to thank you for taking the time to listen in today. My name is Jeff Beyersdorfer, I am Western's Treasure and Director of IR.
With our recent acquisition of the general partnership interest of Northern Tier Energy, we are conducting a joint call with Executives from both companies to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings.
Joining me for today's call from Western is Jeff Stevens, our President and CEO; Gary Dalke, our CFO; Mark Smith, our President, Refining and Marketing; and other members of our senior management team. From Northern Tier, Chet Kuchta, COO, and Dave Bonczek, Vice President and CFO. We will start with comments on Western's results, then we will hear remarks of NTI's results, and finally question and answers.
I'll remind you that beginning with this quarter, Western consolidates financial results for all 3 entities, Western, WNRL and NTI. We will be referencing both WNR and NTI earnings call slides, which in addition to each earnings release can be found in the Investor Relations section of our respective websites at wnr.com and ntenergy.com.
Before we proceed, I would like to make the following Safe Harbor statement. Today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements and I refer you to the forward-looking statement section of our earnings release and recent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new or changed events or circumstances. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, both WNR and NTI report certain non-GAAP financial results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which can be found in both companies' respective press releases.
I will now turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff A. Stevens
Thanks, Jeff. Welcome to everyone on the call. I'd like to begin today by thanking Hank Kuchta for his service as President and CEO of Northern Tier Energy. Hank has led the Northern Tier team through a number of changes and was very supportive of bringing these 2 companies together. We appreciate his leadership and wish him the best going forward.

We're excited about the announcement that Dave Lamp will be joining NTI as President and CEO in March. Dave brings a wealth of industry knowledge and experience to Northern Tier and will be a valuable addition to the leadership team.
Last year at this time, I outlined our goals for 2013, which were to improve performance in safety and reliability, increase our investment in the business, particularly logistics, and continue to return cash to shareholders.
I would like to briefly discuss some of Western Refining's achievements related to these goals. We had a good year from a safety and reliability standpoint. Operationally, our refineries ran well with the El Paso refinery having a particularly strong second half of the year. We successfully completed the IPO of Western Refining Logistics. As part of the offering, we secured a $300 million revolver. This revolver, along with the $75 million in IPO proceeds, which we retained at WNRL, will be available to fund both organic and acquisition growth.
In April, we began operations of our Delaware basin logistic system, a 100,000 barrel per day pipeline and a 38,000 barrel per day truck offloading station. As we've discussed previously, this logistics system will allow El Paso to process up to a 100,000 barrels per day of higher yielding cost advantage crude oil from the Delaware basin. We also added 40 crude oil transports in 2013 and are currently gathering about 13,000 barrels per day in the Permian basin.
In November, we purchased the general partner and 38.7% of the limited partnership interest in NTI. We're very excited about the addition of St. Paul Park refinery, which shares key characteristics of our El Paso and Gallup refineries. Specifically, direct pipeline access to cost advantage crude oil from growing basins and attractive product regions. In 2013, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares for $253 million at an average cost of $31.27. During the year, we increased the dividend 3 times and paid out total dividends of approximately $52 million. Including both share repurchases and dividend payments, Western Refinery returned approximately $305 million to shareholders in 2013. I'm very proud of our team here at Western and I'd like to thank them for helping us achieve our goals in delivering a very successful year.
Turning to the fourth quarter, we reported net income, excluding special items, of $57 million. The Brent WTI spread widened in the fourth quarter from the second and third quarters. Southwest frac [ph] pricing strengthened relative to Q3, particularly Phoenix gas cracks, and West Coast margins also increased in the third quarter.
Our wholesale business performed well in the quarter with volumes up by 10% compared to Q4 2012. This was largely due to expanding our geographical footprint in the Southwest. We continued to opportunistically grow our retail business. During the fourth quarter, we added 7 new locations in Yuma, Arizona. As you know, the retail business is important to us, as it provides a secure outlet for our refinery production and helps with our RIN compliance.
As we look forward at the first quarter of 2014, the Brent WTI spread remained volatile and we are seeing a stronger Gulf Coast 3-2-1 of approximately $17 per barrel. In addition, the WTI Midland Cushing differentials have continued to widen during the quarter. Operationally, we are wrapping up our planned turnaround on the south side of the El Paso refinery this week. Western does not have any additional turnarounds planned for the remainder of 2014.
For 2014, we have established the following corporate goals. First, we will continue to focus on safety and reliability. Second, Western's board has approved the 2014 capital budget of $230 million of which $145 million is for discretionary projects. The 2 biggest projects are the completion of the TexNew Mex pipeline reversal and the construction of 70-mile extension pipeline connecting the TexNew Mex pipeline to the Delaware basin. Third, we will continue to realize synergies related to Western's investment in NTI. And finally, we'll continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In January, Western's board approved a first quarter 2014 dividend of $0.26 per share. The board also authorized an additional $200 million in share repurchases. These actions are consistent with our goal of returning cash to shareholders.

Now I will turn the call over to Gary, who will go through our fourth quarter financials in more detail.
Gary R. Dalke
Thank you, Jeff. Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that beginning with the fourth quarter, we are required to consolidate all 3 entities Western, WNRL and NTI. NTI and WNRL will continue to report on a standalone basis. However, in the WNR press releases, we provide consolidating information.
Refining gross margins in the fourth quarter of 2013 are not entirely comparable to prior periods as a result of fees paid by our refining segment to WNRL starting October 16, 2013. Similarly, refining direct operating expenses were reduced in the fourth quarter due to certain expenses now being recorded by WNRL that were previously included in refining. We have provided pro forma information on these statistics for comparison purposes. For the fourth quarter, gross margins per barrel for El Paso and Gallup were $13.85 and $14.43, respectively. Margins as compared to the prior year quarter were impacted primarily by both the margin environment and by fees paid to WNRL.
Direct operating expenses for the quarter were $164.6 million, as compared to $122.8 million for the prior year quarter. The main driver behind the increase was the inclusion of NTI with Q4 operating expenses of $35.1 million. On a per-barrel basis, El Paso and Gallup operating expenses for the quarter were $3.97 and $11.24, respectively.
Gallup's operating costs were elevated due to a $1.5 million environmental reserve adjustment and lower throughput for the quarter, primarily as a result of a power failure in October. Pro forma, excluding WNRL gross margins and operating expenses per barrel, are included in our supporting slides.
Total company SG&A for the quarter was $52.2 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $38.6 million for the quarter. Interest expense was $21.9 million for Q4 2013.
A bridge showing changes in cash position for the quarter can be found on Page 6 of our slide deck. There were a number of onetime items associated with both the NTI and WNRL transactions. Consolidated year-end cash ended up at $468.1 million, of which $298.3 million was attributable to Western's standalone. Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $57.9 million.
As of December 31, total consolidated debt stood at $1.4 billion. Excluding debt attributable to NTI, Western's total debt was $1.1 billion. A summary of our consolidated capital structure and Western's standalone capital structure is available on Page 5 of our slides.
Total liquidity, which we define as cash and availability under our revolver, was approximately $745 million at the end of the year. Liquidity has averaged approximately $830 million thus far in 2014.
Wrapping up, you can find our first quarter operating guidance on Page 7 of our slides. Our Q1 guidance includes the impact of the El Paso turnaround.
That concludes our remarks for Western Refining. I will now turn the call over to Chet Kuchta, COO for NTI.
Chester J. Kuchta
Thanks, Gary. This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results, and earlier this month we declared our quarterly distribution of $0.41 per unit. This distribution was effected by our planned turnaround on our catalytic cracking unit and some unplanned downtime, both of which I will go into further.
We have declared distributions totaling $2.63 per unit for 2013 and $5.38 per unit since our initial public offering.
As you can see on Slide 2 of the NTI slide presentation, our fourth quarter 2013 operating income was $32 million, compared to $144 million for the fourth quarter of 2012. This decrease in operating income was primarily the result of a significant decrease in the Group 3 6-3-2-1 benchmark. And a decrease in the throughput resulting from our planned cat unit turnaround during the month of October and some unplanned downtime at the St. Paul Park refinery.

The unplanned downtime was primarily as a result of a fire in our larger crude tower, which caused us to run at reduced rates for approximately 3 weeks during the third and fourth quarters. The cost of the repairs and clean up of this fire amounted to less than $3 million.
For the full year of 2013, we reported operating income of $239 million compared to $571 million in 2012. Again, this decrease was affected by a reduced throughput and due to a 38% decrease in the 6-3-2-1 crack spread in 2013.
As you can see on Slide 3, our gross product margin per barrel throughput averaged $15.34 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to $24.49 in the 2012 fourth quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by a more modest market crack as the Group 3 6-3-2-1 crack spread averaged $4.91 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2013, as compared to $21.36 per barrel in the 2012 quarter. The St. Paul Park refinery was able to recognize a considerably higher gross margin into wider crude differentials.
During the fourth quarter of 2013, NTI's total throughput averaged approximately 80,000 barrels per day compared to 90,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2012. The decrease in throughput was primarily due to our planned and unplanned downtime at the St. Paul Park refinery, which I mentioned earlier.
Full year throughput was 75,000 barrels per day in 2013 compared to 84,000 barrels per day in 2012. Operating expenses per barrel of throughput, excluding turnaround expenses, were $5 in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to $4.43 in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in operating expenses per barrel of throughput is primarily due to the lower throughput levels I just mentioned.
The commercial environment in 2013 was not as favorable as it was in 2012. Given that, we planned for our major turnaround work in 2013, we also took advantage of downtime in order to make certain strategic investments at the refinery. These projects, which are referred to on Slide 4, resulted in an expansion of over 10% of our capacity and also resulted in providing enhanced distillate yields.
Lastly, NTI's retail segment achieved a record year and we continue to opportunistically grow that business.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave Bonczek for further discussions of our quarterly financial results.
David Bonczek
Thanks, Chet. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $20.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to $84.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2013 was approximately $69 million, compared to fourth quarter 2012 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $162 million. As we previously noted these decreases are primarily due to lower throughput rates caused by our planned and unplanned downtime, in addition to a weaker benchmark crack. As of now, we're operating at economically justifiable rates unaffected by any downtime. Our throughput for the month of January was approximately 88,000 barrels per day.
As you can see on Slide 2, we continue to maintain ample liquidity and minimum leverage in the company. We had approximately $86 million in cash on hand and total liquidity of $220 million, as of December 31, 2013. Our leverage ratio, measured by total debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA, is at 0.8x.
Cash flow from operations was $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Cash flow from operations was impacted this quarter as a result of our planned and unplanned downtime and increases in working capital as we return to normal operations. We expect to see improvements in both our cash flow from operations and our liquidity position, as we continue to operate the refinery at economically justifiable rates and capture improving margins and healthy crude differentials.

Cash available for distribution amounted to approximately $38 million for this quarter, which equates to a $0.41 distribution per unit. Slide 5 shows the detailed calculation of cash available for distribution. As we have said in the past, we are a variable rate MLP, and quarterly distribution will vary as a direct result of variations in certain factors, including fluctuations in throughput, the prices of crude oil and other feedstocks, refined product prices, capital expenditures and other cash reserves deemed necessary and appropriate by the Board of Directors of our General Partner. Unlike most publicly traded partnerships, we do not have a minimum quarterly distribution. Finally, you can find our updated key metric guidance for the first quarter of 2014 on Slide 6.
I will now turn it back to Jeff Stevens for closing remarks.
Jeff A. Stevens
Thanks, Dave. Over the past few years, Western's strong financial performance has allowed us to improve our balance sheet and provide us the platform to transform the company. In 2013, we grew our business substantially by adding Western Refining Logistics, and Northern Tier Energy, while continuing to return cash to shareholders. With this expanded asset base and the unique geographic location of our refineries, we believe Western is well positioned to continue this performance in 2014.
Jackie, we will now open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake from Crédit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Let's start with logistics. I mean obviously you've talked about the new TexMex pipe reversal, but maybe give us a sort of a color on the run rate of where you are. It would be helpful if you included the EBITDA on NTI logistics as well. And where you expect to be able to get to over the next couple of years?
Jeff A. Stevens
Sure, Ed. As far as growing the logistics, like we said in the script, we really set a platform for both organic growth and the potential of drop-downs. From an organic standpoint, as we highlighted, the Delaware basin has quite a bit of capacity to increase and we believe as the new wells comes on that we believe the throughput will increase quite a bit through that system. In the first -- in the fourth quarter, and we are seeing a little bit of this in January because of the glut of oil that we've seen in just the overall Permian Basin, along with some weather issues and our turnaround. Our throughputs have kind of leveled off, but we believe that as we come back up on run rate, we'll see a significant increase in the Delaware business. So that's just pure organic growth that we'll see utilizing existing assets within the MLP. As far as the TexNew Mex and the 70-mile extension, we believe those -- the TexNew Mex will be ready to operate in the fourth quarter of 2014 and then the additional 70 miles to bring crude all the way to the El Paso refinery out of the 4 corners will be available, probably, in early first quarter of 2015. So those are, obviously, 2 projects that we're very excited about that are well on their way to being developed, and be in a position for drop-downs into WNRL. Now, with regards to Northern Tier's logistic assets, obviously they have some very attractive assets to an MLP. They have interest in a crude pipeline. They have other tankage and traditional storage type assets. And right now, we're evaluating the EBITDA, but we think it's in a range of probably $50 million to $60 million for those NTI potential drop-down assets. And as we get further down in the process and as we look at the right opportunity, the right time to potentially have those in WNRL, we'll continue to evaluate it. And we're just excited about those assets and their potential in WNRL someday.

Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Yes, I think investors are excited also. But maybe just on the sort of WNR EBITDA run rate for logistics as a current run rate or 2014 run rate would be helpful, not WNRL but including everything that you have at the parent as well if you have that number?
Jeff A. Stevens
Well, yes. We have not established a tariff yet for the TexNew Mex system, so until we do that, we really can't give any guidance relative to what that exactly will be. But we've guided people relative to the growth at WNRL, somewhere between 10% and 12%, just based on the organic and the existing drop-downs at WNR.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Robert Kessler with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
I had a few questions about Western's intended use of the NTI variable MLP structure and kind of the tax implications of that. I suppose the first and perhaps, most obvious, is will you and when will you drop another refinery down into NTI? And then assuming you do, how would you -- would you take back units in NTI to get installment sale gain treatment for tax purposes? And then would you then take those NTI units and distribute those to WNR shareholders? And would that in turn, be a taxable event?
Jeff A. Stevens
Sure. Robert, our thoughts right now around, obviously, we're excited about the NTI investment. Obviously, the profile of that refinery and its direct pipeline access to both the Bakken and Canadian crudes is very attractive to us. As far as the potential of dropping down WNR assets or refineries into the variable rate. Obviously, by making this investment, it gives us the optionality to look at that. Right now, the multiples on variable MLPs and C-Corps have narrowed in and it's something that we're watching and looking at. But ultimately, the decisions that we'll make relative to the potential drop-downs of WNR refineries into NTI will -- we're going to look at what's in the best interest of the shareholders and the unitholders of NTI. And as we get down the road, we'll be able to get more guidance relative to what our thought processes is around that.
Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
Any early look at the tax scenarios? I mean, you've undoubtedly taken some consideration of that even if you haven't made a decision. Any kind of early read on how that will be structured?
Jeff A. Stevens
No. Robert, we're still evaluating that and looking at all our options.
Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
Can I ask on the NTI midstream side, in particular, the 17% interest in the Minnesota pipeline, how that would work for a presumed sale to WNRL? I'm assuming that NTI is the primary customer for 100% of that line and yet, only having a minority interest in the pipeline, it seems to me like that can be a little bit different than what we typically see for a refinery pipeline interest transferred to the MLP on the midstream side, in that you don't get the markup and the EBITDA. Or if you do, it would be kind of dilutive because you're giving away 100% of the EBITDA on the refining side only to get back 17% at the premium multiple. That's one kind of question I had and the other is, you're taking this from one tax-advantaged entity and putting into another tax-advantaged entity, do you lose some of the mark-up advantage on that side that you would typically have on a refinery to MLP drop-down?
Jeff A. Stevens
Sure. In relationship to the Minnesota pipeline, we're not the only customer. In fact, there is another substantial customer that makes up a large portion of that volume. That pipeline's capacity is around 400,000 barrels a day. And it runs full most of the time and we're only running about 90,000 to 95,000 barrels of that capacity. So there are other parties that have, obviously, ownership and ship on that line. With regards to -- obviously, that interest can be dropped down from NTI into WNRL and what we would look at is, it would only make sense, Robert, if we got a pickup, a multiple pickup and it made sense. But right now, where the variable MLP is trading at, versus where traditional MLPs are trading at, that probably looks pretty attractive to us right now.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
Unknown Analyst
This is Monha Suri [ph] Quick question. You mentioned the Midland spread is widening as you go in the quarter but it's volatile also. Any reasons you see out there? Is it turnarounds? Are you actually seeing a very strong rebound in Permian production? What is causing this spread to be so volatile and wider?
Jeff A. Stevens
Yes. I think it's all of the above. Clearly, our turnaround has an impact. There is another refinery in the region that's getting ready for turnaround. And then there's a couple more turnarounds that we'll see later here in March and into April. And obviously, as we've talked about on calls before, the takeaway capacity is such that any reduction in takeaway from the local refineries is going to create volatility in that Midland spread. But I would not discount the fact that there clearly is more crude being produced and it's growing at a pretty rapid rate. And I think when you see spreads, we saw spreads the other day as wide as $10. That takes a combination of all those factors to see that spread that wide. So I think, looking forward, we obviously don't plan our business around a $10 Midland Cushing crack spread. But I do think the volatility and anytime there is either a planned or an unplanned outage by one or more of the refineries in the region, we're going to continue to see the Mid Cushing be volatile. And obviously, when El Paso is running full, that makes a big impact on their overall margin.
Unknown Analyst
One quick question follow-up was, is there any kind of -- are there any specifications on the pipeline in terms of light crude, which the pipelines are not willing to carry out of the region because of which, there is also volatility over there?
Jeff A. Stevens
Well, clearly, some of the new crude coming on is high in gravity and we're starting to see pipelines address that either through deducts or just not taking that crude at all. That's something that we believe will continue to be a challenge for the producers and for the pipeline companies, is to figure out how to get a lighter crude out of the market. There will be some obviously -- for us that have assets and access to different grades of crude, there will be blending economics there for us but longer-term, there is going to have to be something, either a dedicated pipeline or some way to get the lighter ends out of the market. But that continues to be an issue.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chi Chow with Macquarie.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research
On the Western side, you've got some moving pieces on the company's debt position this year with the new term loan facility from the in-trial [ph] transaction, the convert coming due. Can you give us a roadmap on what we can expect on how you positioned -- your debt position going to change as you go through this year?
Jeff A. Stevens
Yes, Chi. The way we look at it obviously, the converted, the first piece that needs to be addressed it's a June settlement that we'll need to make. And right now, as you know, we have basically, 3 options out there to settle that. We can do it either through stock only or cash only or a combination. And we're still evaluating what the best scenario is and we'll address that obviously, in June. When we look at the term piece, that's obviously a pretty attractive piece of paper. But as we get further in the year and we start looking for uses of free cash flow, we're going to continue to focus on potential share repurchases and dividends. But we might look at taking down some debt towards the end of the year based on how the year is going relative to crack spreads.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research
What's the interest rate on the term loan?

Jeff A. Stevens
It's about 4.25%.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research
Okay, great. And then, on the new financial reporting. I guess, are the retailers also being consolidated in 4Q? It just doesn't seem like the store count really rose at all. And are the Northern Tier retail financials in that number?
Gary R. Dalke
Yes, Chi, this is Gary. What's included in our NTI are basically 6 weeks of results starting November 12 through the end of the year. So for that time period, it does include the results of retail from NTI as well as the refinery results for NTI. So our store count is 229, and NTI's is 200-plus with their franchise stores. So the 6 weeks results from NTI are definitely included in our results.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research
Okay. And then I guess on the turnaround expense, you're showing $4 million consolidated, Northern Tier is showing $24 million, is that just a timing issue at Northern Tier?
Gary R. Dalke
Yes, Northern Tier basically spent that prior to November 12. So the $4 million that you see that came through in the fourth quarter really relates to the El Paso turnaround, some spending going into that turnaround.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research
Okay, great. And then on the Northern Tier side, Chet, maybe you can talk about -- can you talk about your Canadian crude purchases? How much you are buying that right now and are those purchases on a 2 months lag on a trade-month basis? That's my understanding, but I just wanted to get that confirmed.
Chester J. Kuchta
Yes, sure, Chi. The Canadian crude for us is roughly a 2-month lag. We're buying our typical volumes of Canadian versus synthetic, which were in the range of 20 to 23 a day heavy and somewhere between 12 and 15 of synthetic. Was there anything else?
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research
Do those volumes change at all in the winter months versus the summer on the heavy?
Chester J. Kuchta
On the heavy, they do. It's all around the economics, we -- heavy crude has been economic for us, pretty much the whole -- for the past several years, with a few instances where it kind of fell out of favor. And when it does, when the economics go south on that, when asphalt gets too cheap and the differential doesn't support it, then we'll trim back on the heavies and go to a lighter slate. But for the majority of the time in the recent past, it has been justified around full on heavy.

Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Sorry, because I did miss part of the first answer from Ed's question. I just wanted to come back on the MLP thing that everyone else is obviously interested in. Timing wise, if you decide to start moving things in between the various MLPs for the obvious favorable directions, what should we think about there? I mean, is this a -- could happen by midyear, happens later in the year, sooner than that? I'm just trying to understand sort of the when, not so much the if or the magnitude at this particular point.
Jeff A. Stevens
I think, Roger, when you're looking at WNRL and you look at, like I said, they've got 2 paths they're going down right now. They've got the organic growth with the existing assets and some smaller projects that we'll be funding this year that will be growing it. We have existing drop downs within WNR that would be ready to drop down. And I would expect something to be looked at here as we get further into the year. With regards to the NTI assets, they're in a similar position that WNR was last year, where they have never kept those assets on a standalone basis. So there's some work that has to be done from the financial side of getting those in a position to be dropped down. So I wouldn't expect any of that, probably till early next year as we prepared the -- potentially prepare the books financially to be in a position to do that. But I think what we're looking at is we obviously have quite a bit of organic growth and we have these drop downs. And I think you'll see the drop downs come in. The growth will be somewhat lumpy, where the timing between some of the growth may lag and you'll see us opportunistically drop down during those times.

Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
And then to a true operational question here. So El Paso, you're building out a lot of the pipelines into the various shale play areas there in West Texas. Could you give us an idea of maybe how many barrels now are sort of your captured system versus the legacy pipeline system in there? And then maybe how the unit's been running on those barrels? Not necessarily something we can see with the actual results, given all the other moving parts, but just how the unit is performing?
Jeff A. Stevens
Yes. I think when we talk about the shale crude that we're acquiring for El Paso, we're upwards around 30,000 to 35,000 barrels per day with a target of about 100,000. So we're just about 1/3 there of where we want to be. But obviously with the turnaround and having the South side down for the last 30 days, we haven't really been able to measure, exactly, the results. But clearly, we believe that we'll see a higher yield pattern of gas and diesel out of the shale crude and less of the lower value products like asphalt and residual. So we're still very confident in the direction we're going and like I said, we're coming out of that turnaround as we speak right now. And in March, we'll be running 100% full at the facility and we believe as crude kind of makes its way out of Midland and the whole system in the Permian basin becomes less backed up, we have producers that have the crude that we want ready to come into our system. And we'll be able to start really ramping it up as we get in here to the second quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Mohit Bhardwaj with Citigroup.
Mohit Bhardwaj - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I just had a question on the convertible, the value in access at the end of September was $496 million. Do you guys have an updated value at the end of the year?
Jeff A. Stevens
On the convert?
Jeffrey S. Beyersdorfer
The total convert value at the end of the year, the price was -- or currently, it's about $400 per bond. So the total market value probably starts with our $900 million [ph] handle, about $900 million. Again, of which, we've repurchased shares equivalent to about half of that value of the $900 million.
Mohit Bhardwaj - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
And Jeff, as you outlined too many things during this call today, including NTI's logistics and you're potentially looking at say Gallup or probably the El Paso in the available MLP structure. Just looking forward this year, you guys have your organic growth projects and also potentially, the drop-down of your wholesale assets into WNRL. If that, if this timing for that drop-down would be around the time you settled for your convertible to use the cash that's generated or is that how you guys are thinking about it?
Jeff A. Stevens
Obviously, that would be an option that we would look at. I would say that the timing, it doesn't have to be the same. But it's probably fair to say that the timing of that would be in the same time frame.
Mohit Bhardwaj - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
And if I could, just one more. On the acquisition side, you guys have stated before that you're also looking at acquisition opportunities both on the refining and logistics side, any update on that?
Jeff A. Stevens
I think that right now, I wouldn't anticipate any major acquisition right now. We obviously have a full plate and we have a lot of just great organic and internal options here over the next couple of years. I think that from a standpoint of adding small logistic assets to complement what we already have, whether they're in the Permian Basin, San Juan or now in the Bakken, I think we're looking at those type of acquisitions but those are small in nature.
Operator
Our final question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Crédit Suisse.

Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
While we're all looking at the MLP cookie jar, I thought I'd just ask one around the retail, following on one of Chi's question. Do you think there's a point or what's the point where you think your combined retail business would have critical mass to sort of stand on its own? Have you given any thought to that?
Jeff A. Stevens
Well, I mean certainly, since the acquisition of the combined -- potentially combining the NTI and the WNR, it certainly changes our thought process relative to size. And if there was an opportunity out there that made sense as the standalone, that's certainly something that we'll look at. But it's approaching that number now, Ed, based just by combining the 2 together.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay, that's helpful. I'm going to guess the logistics and capturing crude probably more profitable in the short term but...
Jeff A. Stevens
No question about it, Ed. We were very fortunate to be in the locations we are and it's going to be our job to make sure that we capitalize on this because there is plenty to do and plenty of opportunity out there. So we're going to stay focused and really concentrate on that.
Operator
I would now like to return the call to Mr. Jeff Stevens.
