It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View Ann’s Full ProfileSummary"Love is in the details." Add the art-director's axiom, "You're as good as your worst piece," and you'll understand why I am so passionate about quality-control. I am freakishly gifted at it, in copy, art, and layout/mechanics. I have a perfect record in error-free, on-time and within-budget projects, with a significant number of under-budget projects. I have improved every piece I've worked on, and have never had to re-print or re-publish due to an in-house error. I have caught errors in client-supplied product specs. I am reminded way too many times a day that advertisers and their resources are not necessarily paying attention to the all-important details--that I love.ExperienceOwnerEagleEye Proofreading/Editing and Production Management, LLCNovember 2012  –  Present (4 years 9 months)I have the DNA and experience(s) required to make great work even greater.

McDANIEL, Ann Ann Whitworth McDaniel, 86, of Austin and Dallas Texas, passed away peacefully on Sunday morning, May 21, 2017. She had been surrounded for several days by her husband of 60 1/2 years, Faries, and her children, Paul McDaniel (and wife Andrea), and Martha McDaniel Muth (and husband Ian), and given her Christian faith, Sunday was the perfect day for her. She was preceded in death by her father, Allen Whitworth, her Mother Lillian (Kinzer) Whitworth, and brother Rev. Forrest K. Whitworth. She is also survived by her sister, Jane W. Rankin, and numerous nieces and nephews. Her family would like to greatly thank Sandra Rodriguez and her staff in memory care at Elmcroft of Austin, for their exemplary care of Ann during her last year. Ann was born on April 10, 1931 in Wewoka, Oklahoma, and raised in Wewoka and Norman, graduating from Norman High School in 1949; but had been a Texan for many decades. Ann graduated from Austin College in Sherman, Texas in 1953, and taught first and second grade for many years at several schools beginning in the 1950's. These included Robert E. Lee Elementary School in Dallas, John B. Wynn Elementary School in Austin, and Hamilton Park, and J. Frank Dobie in the Richardson School District, and she retired as a teacher. She and Faries married in Dallas on November 2, 1956, and celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary last November. She resided in Dallas from the 1950's to 1995, when she and Faries retired to Austin to be near their children. She was a lifelong Presbyterian, attending Shepherd of the Hills Presbyterian Church in SW Austin since she and Faries moved to Austin. Ann had a love of music her entire life and was still singing almost up until the very end. While recently living at the Continental Independent Living Center in Austin, she and Faries briefly lived across the hall from famous singer and actress Morgana King, who after a few sing-a-longs with Ann, commented that "she has a beautiful voice!" She sang in the Dallas Civic Chorus for many years in the 1960's and 1970's, and sang with the Chorus at the halftime show of numerous Thanksgiving day Dallas Cowboy games at the Cotton Bowl and Texas Stadium. She also taught Sunday school, and was active in the church choir and hand bells for many years. She was a seasoned traveler, and if she didn't travel to all 50 states, she got close, including Alaska twice. She also traveled to Canada, South America, Europe, Egypt, and experienced two total eclipses of the sun. She had a terrific sense of humor and used it naturally throughout life in almost any situation. She was a wonderful mother, and friend to many, immediately affecting all she met in a positive way. The family will hold a memorial to celebrate her life at Shepherd of the Hills Presbyterian Church in SW Austin on Saturday, June 3rd at 2:00 p.m. If you are able to attend, Ann requested no dark colors, only bright earth tones!
