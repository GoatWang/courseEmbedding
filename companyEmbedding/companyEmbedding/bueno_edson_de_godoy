Brazil’s Richest Healthcare Billionaire Bueno Dies At 73



Brazil’s Richest Healthcare Billionaire Bueno Dies At 73Wednesday, 15 Feb 2017 










Edson de Godoy Bueno, Brazil’s richest healthcare billionaire and one of U.S. insurance firm UnitedHealth Group’s largest individual shareholders, died this morning at age 73. Bueno amassed a net worth of US$3.1 billion. He and his ex-wife Dulce sold a 90% stake in Brazilian health insurer and hospital manager Amil to UnitedHealth Care for US$4.9 billion in 2012. The cause of his death was reported to be a heart attack.
 
The son of a truck driver, Godoy got his start as a shoeshine boy at age 10 and was reportedly inspired by Dr. Moacyr Carneiro, the only doctor in the small town he lived in, to become a doctor. He left his home in the town of Guaranta, Sao Paulo, to study at Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. While he was a medical student, he worked shifts at a struggling medical clinic. In 1972 Edson bought the clinic and within five years turned it into the largest private maternity hospital in the state of Rio de Janeiro. He then continued to acquire other medical clinics.

About Edson de Godoy Bueno
Brazilian billionaire and businessman Edson de Godoy Bueno has an estimated net worth of $2.3 billion as of April 2016 according to Forbes. He is best known as the ex-husband of fellow billionaire Dulce de Godoy Bueno. Most of Edson Bueno’s massive net worth is derived from Amil, a health plan company. Along with his wife Dulce, Edson founded Amil in 1972.

While working in a clinic, Edson de Godoy Bueno attended Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. After graduation in 1971, he bought the struggling clinic. In the last five years, Edson Bueno has purchased more than 15 firms which made Amil as the largest health care company in Brazil.
Towards the end of 2012, it was reported that United Health Group (UHG), a giant health insurance in the U.S., purchased Amil’s 90% stake for $4.9 billion. UHG took 60% of Amil’s stake from Edson and Dulce Bueno while the remaining 30% was taken from the public shareholders of the company. Today, the couple owns 10% of Amil and Edson still serves as the company’s Chief Executive. Furthermore, the couple owns stakes in Dasa which is considered as the Latin America’s largest chain of laboratories. They also hold interests in Totalcare which is a private holding company that specializes in managing investments in many hospitals based in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

In a statement, UnitedHealth said Bueno, 73, had a heart attack earlier in the day in Buzios, a beach resort in Rio de Janeiro state. Bueno, a physician, had sold Amil Participações SA, the company he founded almost four decades ago, to UnitedHealth for $4.9 billion in 2010. Bueno held the post of chief executive officer of Amil and a series of medical industry leadership roles. He was currently UnitedHealth's chairman for Latin America and the largest individual shareholder in the Hopkins, Minnesota-based company. According to Forbes Magazine, Bueno was worth $3.1 billion as of February, making him Brazil's richest healthcare industry figure. Bueno has been singled out as one of Brazil's most prominent self-made businessmen, with a penchant for acquisitions in medical services, hospitals and diagnostics laboratories. He started working as a shoeshiner at age 10, and studied and worked simultaneously until becoming a surgeon. He founded Amil in the 1970s with his then-wife, Dulce Pugliese, with whom he also invested in Diagnósticos da America SA, one of Brazil's biggest listed laboratories. He was currently divorced, according to several local media reports.
