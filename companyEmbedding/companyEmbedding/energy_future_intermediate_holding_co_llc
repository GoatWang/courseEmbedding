The Future of Energy Future Holdings

On Oct. 3, 2016, TCEH Corp. (“TCEH”), including operating businesses Luminant and TXU Energy, emerged from the Chapter 11 financial restructuring process as a standalone company effected through a tax-free spinoff from parent company Energy Future Holdings Corp. (“EFH”). This emergence reflects satisfaction of all closing conditions, including certain regulatory conditions, included in TCEH’s Third Amended Plan of Reorganization, which was confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on Aug. 26, 2016.
On Nov. 4, 2016, TCEH announced its new name and brand: Vistra Energy.

More information is available at vistraenergy.com.
EFH and Energy Future Intermediate Holdings Corp., which owns an indirect 80 percent equity interest in Oncor, are proceeding toward Chapter 11 emergence on a separate schedule and have not yet emerged from the process. For more information concerning this ongoing process, please visit the case administrator website.

Energy Future Holdings files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy








04/29/2014

















































Energy Future Holdings said it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to reduce $40 billion of debt while maintaining business operations.
EFH said in a release it would separate from its subsidiary, Texas Competitive Electric Holdings, the holding company for Luminant and TXU Energy. The plan also calls for the elimination of $2.5 billion of funded debt from Energy Future Intermediate Holding Co. LLC. (EFIH) through a capital infusion of up to $1.9 billion. EFIH is the holding company for Oncor Electric Delivery Co., which is not part of the bankruptcy filing.
EFH said it expects to complete restructuring in about 11 months and also expects day-to-day operations to continue during reorganization.
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) said it has been monitoring the situation and has been in contact with the subsidiaries to address concerns that could impact system reliability or the efficiency of the market.
“It is our understanding that EFH and its affected subsidiaries expect to continue operating generation assets and serving retail customers in Texas,” the statement said. “Additionally, Oncor’s transmission business is not included in the bankruptcy filing. Therefore, ERCOT sees no immediate concerns related to system reliability or market efficiency associated with this filing.”[Native Advertisement]

                    One of the perks of writing the Nuclear Reactions column for Power Engineering is that I get to write about a wide variety of nuclear-related topics. I also get the opportunity on occasion to point out linkages (or differences) between seemingly unconnected topics. This column squarely fits into this latter category.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Energy Future Holdings Reports Third Quarter 2013 Results 
DALLAS  November 5, 2013  Energy Future Holdings Corp. (EFH) today reported consolidated financial results for the third quarter ended
September 30, 2013. The third quarter results were reported in EFHs Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this morning. 
Our nuclear and coal-fueled generation units delivered safe, strong and efficient operational performance in the third quarter. Also, our focus on
customer care and product innovation continues to improve customer retention rates for our retail business, said John Young, President and Chief Executive Officer of EFH. 
Third Quarter GAAP Results  For the third quarter 2013,
EFH reported consolidated net income (in accordance with GAAP) of $5 million compared with a reported consolidated net loss of $407 million for the third quarter 2012. Third quarter 2013 net income included $269 million (after tax) in unrealized
mark-to-market net gains on interest rate swaps that hedge our variable-rate interest expense, $105 million (after tax) in unrealized commodity-related mark-to-market net losses largely related to positions in our natural gas hedging program, a $38
million favorable income tax adjustment in the competitive business related to the resolution of certain Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit matters, and $19 million (after tax) of asset impairments. 
In comparison, the third quarter 2012 reported consolidated net loss (in accordance with GAAP) included (all after tax) $339 million in unrealized
commodity-related mark-to-market net losses largely related to positions in our natural gas hedging program, $20 million in asset impairments, and $14 million in unrealized mark-to-market net losses on interest rate swaps. 
Third Quarter Adjusted (Non-GAAP) Operating Results 
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating results for the third quarter 2013 totaled a net loss of $178 million compared with a net loss of $34 million for the third
quarter 2012. For a reconciliation of reported GAAP results to adjusted (non-GAAP) operating results for the third quarter 2013 and 2012, see Tables A1 and A2. 
Third quarter 2013 adjusted (non-GAAP) operating results from the competitive business declined $149 million (after tax) compared with third quarter 2012. The
decrease reflected (all after tax) a $106 million decrease in contribution margin, driven by lower realized net gains from our natural gas hedging program due to lower volumes and prices. Other factors contributing to the lower operating results
included $23 million in lower income tax benefit driven by a lower lignite depletion deduction, $19 million in higher professional service fees related to the companys liability management program, and $16 million in higher net interest
expense reflecting higher average borrowings. These factors were partially offset by $8 million in lower nuclear generation maintenance costs reflecting the fall 2012 planned refueling outage as compared to a spring outage in 2013, and a net $7
million of other less significant items.

Exchange
Offers and Consent Solicitation

On
July 16, 2010, Energy Future Intermediate Holding Company LLC
(“EFIH”), a subsidiary of Energy Future Holdings Corp.
(“EFH Corp.”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, EFIH
Finance Inc., filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a
registration statement on Form S-4 relating to exchange offers and
consent solicitation for outstanding debt securities of EFH Corp.
Attached and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit 99.1 is a
copy of the press release of EFH Corp. dated July 16, 2010,
announcing such exchange offers and such consent solicitation. The
information set forth below is contained in the prospectus that
forms a part of the registration statement.

Selected
Preliminary Financial Data for the Quarterly Period Ended
June 30, 2010

Management
of EFH Corp. and EFIH (collectively, the “Companies”)
have prepared the selected preliminary financial data below in good
faith based upon the most current information available to
management. The Companies’ normal quarterly closing and
financial reporting processes with respect to such preliminary
financial data have not been fully completed. As a result, the
actual financial results could be different from such preliminary
financial data, and any differences could be material. The
Companies expect to file their quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with
the SEC on or about August 3, 2010. The Companies’
independent accountants have not performed their customary review
procedures with respect to the preliminary financial data provided
below, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of
assurance on such information.

The
preliminary financial data provided below for EFH Corp. reflects
the investment in Oncor Holdings and its subsidiaries under the
equity method of accounting for the 2010 period only, due to new
accounting rules that resulted in the deconsolidation of Oncor
Holdings and its subsidiaries as of January 1, 2010, which EFH
Corp. adopted on a prospective basis as discussed in Note 3 to
EFH Corp.’s historical condensed consolidated financial
statements for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The
prospective adoption resulted in EFH Corp.’s preliminary
operating revenues provided below being lower in the 2010 period as
compared to the 2009 period. The information presented below for
EFIH reflects the investment in Oncor Holdings and its subsidiaries
under the equity method of accounting for both periods because EFIH
adopted the new accounting rules on a retrospective basis as
discussed in EFIH’s historical condensed consolidated
financial statements for the three months ended March 31,
2010.

While the
financial data provided are preliminary and subject to change, EFH
does not expect actual operating revenues for the three months
ended June 30, 2010 to be different by more than 5% from the
preliminary amount provided below. The Companies also do not expect
actual net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA for the three months
ended June 30, 2010 to be different by more than 10% and 5%,
respectively, from the preliminary amounts provided below. The
preliminary net income (loss) amounts for the three months ended
June 30, 2010 exclude non-cash asset impairment charges,
although the Companies do not anticipate any such charges to be
recorded in the period.

The
preliminary financial data below has been prepared on a basis
consistent with the Companies’ historical condensed
consolidated financial statements for the three months ended
March 31, 2010 included elsewhere in this prospectus. The
results of operations for an interim period, including the
preliminary interim financial data provided below, may not give a
true indication of the results to be expected for a full year or
any future period. 

EFH Corp.
Preliminary Financial Data

Selected
preliminary financial data for EFH Corp. for the three months ended
June 30, 2010 and actual data for the three months ended
June 30, 2009 (amounts in millions) are provided in the table
below:

EFH Corp.
management continues to evaluate the effect of declining wholesale
power prices, due to lower natural gas prices, on the carrying
value of goodwill related to the TCEH reporting unit. This
evaluation may ultimately result in the recording of a non-cash
goodwill impairment charge. Such charge, if any, would be recorded
no sooner than in the three month period ended September 30,
2010.

As shown
(in millions) in the table below, EFH’s available liquidity
(excluding Oncor) at June 30, 2010 totaled $3.6 billion as
compared to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2009.

As of

Credit Facility includes $199 million and $141 million,
respectively, of commitments from an affiliate of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. that is currently in bankruptcy that are only
available from the fronting banks and the swingline
lender.





 



(b)



December
31, 2009 amount includes $425 million cash investment (including
accrued interest) and $65 million in letters of credit posted
related to certain interest rate and commodity hedge transactions.
Pursuant to the related agreement, the collateral was returned in
March 2010.




Set forth
below is a reconciliation (amounts in millions) of net income
(loss) to EBITDA and then to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and
twelve months ended June 30, 2010 (preliminary) and 2009
(actual). For more information on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and
why management believes Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure, see

(a)



EBITDA
refers to earnings (net income) before interest expense, income
taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA refers to
EBITDA adjusted to exclude non-cash items, unusual items and other
adjustments allowable under certain of EFH Corp.’s debt
arrangements. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are not recognized terms
under GAAP and, thus, are non-GAAP financial measures. EFH Corp. is
providing its Adjusted EBITDA solely because of the important role
that Adjusted EBITDA plays in respect of the certain covenants
contained in its debt arrangements. EFH Corp. does not intend for
Adjusted EBITDA (or EBITDA) to be an alternative to net income as a
measure of operating performance or an alternative to cash flows
from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or an
alternative to any other measure of financial performance presented
in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, EFH Corp. does not intend
for Adjusted EBITDA (or EBITDA) to be used as a measure of free
cash flow available for management’s discretionary use, as
the measure excludes certain cash requirements such as interest
payments, tax payments and other debt service requirements. Because
not all companies use identical calculations, EFH Corp.’s
presentation of Adjusted EBITDA (and EBITDA) may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures of other companies.





(b)



Twelve
months ended June 30, 2009 amount includes $1.253 billion
distribution of net proceeds from the sale of Oncor noncontrolling
interests in November 2008.





(c)



Purchase
accounting adjustments include amortization of the intangible net
asset value of retail and wholesale power sales agreements,
environmental credits, coal purchase contracts, nuclear fuel
contracts and power purchase agreements and the stepped up value of
nuclear fuel. Also include certain credits not recognized in net
income due to purchase accounting.





(d)



Impairment
of assets includes impairments of emission allowances and trade
name intangible assets, impairments of land and the natural
gas-fueled generation fleet and charges related to the cancelled
development of coal-fueled generation facilities.





(e)



Noncash
compensation expenses are accounted for under accounting standards
related to stock compensation and exclude capitalized
amounts.





(f)



Severance
expense includes amounts incurred related to outsourcing,
restructuring and other amounts deemed to be in excess of normal
recurring amounts.





(g)



Transition
and business optimization costs include professional fees primarily
for retail billing and customer care systems enhancements and
incentive compensation.





(h)



Transaction
and merger expenses include costs related to the Merger and
abandoned strategic transactions, outsourcing transition costs,
administrative costs related to the cancelled program to develop
coal-fueled generation facilities, the Sponsor Group management
fee, costs related to certain growth initiatives and costs related
to the Oncor sale of noncontrolling interests.





(i)



Insurance
settlement proceeds include the amount received for property damage
to certain mining equipment.





(j)



Restructuring
and other for twelve months ended June 30, 2010 primarily
represents reversal of certain liabilities accrued in purchase
accounting and recorded as other income, partially offset by
restructuring and nonrecurring activities and for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2009 includes a litigation accrual and a charge
related to the bankruptcy of a subsidiary of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and other restructuring initiatives and nonrecurring
activities.





(k)



Expenses
incurred to upgrade or expand a generation station reflect
noncapital outage costs.





(l)



Calculated
pursuant to the terms of the Old Notes Indenture, in particular the
debt incurrence covenant, which excludes Oncor’s EBITDA,
except to the extent distributions are received from
Oncor.





(m)



Calculated
pursuant to the terms of the Old Notes Indenture, in particular the
restricted payments covenant, which includes Oncor’s
EBITDA.

(a)



EBITDA
refers to earnings (net income) before interest expense, income
taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA refers to
EBITDA adjusted to exclude non-cash items, unusual items and other
adjustments allowable under the indenture governing the EFIH 9.75%
Notes due in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are not recognized
terms under GAAP and, thus, are non-GAAP financial measures. EFIH
is providing its Adjusted EBITDA solely because of the important
role that Adjusted EBITDA plays in respect of certain covenants
contained in the indenture governing the EFIH 9.75% Notes. EFIH
does not intend for Adjusted EBITDA (or EBITDA) to be an
alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or
an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure
of liquidity or an alternative to any other measure of financial
performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, EFIH
does not intend for Adjusted EBITDA (or EBITDA) to be used as a
measure of free cash flow available for management’s
discretionary use, as the measure excludes certain cash
requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and other debt
service requirements. Because not all companies use identical
calculations, EFIH’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA (and
EBITDA) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies.

Forward-Looking
Statements

The
information set forth in this report and in Exhibit 99.1 contains
forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from management’s current projections, forecasts, estimates
and expectations. All statements, other than statements of
historical facts, that are included in this current report that
address activities, events or developments that EFH Corp., EFIH or
Energy Future Competitive Holdings Company (“EFCH”)
expect or anticipate to occur in the future (often, but not always,
through the use of words or phrases such as “will likely
result,” “are expected to,” “will
continue,” “is anticipated,”
“estimated,” “projection,”
“target,” “goal,” “objective,”
and “outlook”), are forward-looking statements.
Although EFH Corp., EFIH and EFCH believe that in making any such
forward-looking statement their expectations are based on
reasonable assumptions, any such forward-looking statement involves
uncertainties and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
discussion of risk factors in EFH Corp.’s, EFIH’s and
EFCH’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (including the sections entitled “Risk
Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and

“ Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio ” means, with respect to any Person for any period,
the ratio of EBITDA of such Person for such period to the Fixed
Charges of such Person for such period. In the event that EFIH or
any Restricted Subsidiary incurs, assumes, guarantees, redeems,
retires or extinguishes any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness
incurred under any revolving credit facility unless such
Indebtedness has been permanently repaid and has not been replaced)
or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to or
simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the “ Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio Calculation Date ”), then the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma
effect to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, redemption,
retirement or extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance or
redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same
had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter
period.

For purposes of making the
computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, consolidations and disposed operations (as
determined in accordance with GAAP) that have been made by EFIH or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the four-quarter
reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or
prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma
basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, consolidations and disposed operations (and
the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the
change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day
of the four-quarter reference period. If, since the beginning of
such period, any Person that subsequently became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was merged with or into EFIH or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any
Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, consolidation or
disposed operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to
this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such
period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,
consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning
of the applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition,
whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a
transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made
in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of
EFIH.
 
20


If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of
interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in
effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been
the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any
Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a
Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an
interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of EFIH to be the rate of interest implicit in
such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For
purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on
any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a
pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the
average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable
period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this
definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be
determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or
similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate or other rate
shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen,
or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as EFIH may
designate.

(a) Any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may be
embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of
substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by
an agent duly appointed in writing. Except as herein otherwise
expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such
instrument or instruments or record or both are delivered to the
Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Issuer.
Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing
appointing any such agent, or the holding by any Person of a Note,

to Section 7.01 hereof) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and
the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this
Section 1.05.

(b) The fact and date of the
execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be
proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by the
certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized by law
to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual
signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the
execution thereof. Where such execution is by or on behalf of any
legal entity other than an individual, such certificate or
affidavit shall also constitute proof of the authority of the

any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person
executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner that the
Trustee deems sufficient.

(c) The ownership of Notes shall be
proved by the Note Register.

(d) Any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
by the Holder of any Note shall bind every future Holder of the
same Note and the Holder of every Note issued upon the registration
of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, in
respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Trustee or
the Issuer in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such
action is made upon such Note.

(e) The Issuer may, in the
circumstances permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, set a record
date for purposes of determining the identity of Holders entitled
to give any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or take any other act, or to vote or consent to any
action by vote or consent authorized or permitted to be given or
taken by Holders. Unless otherwise specified, if not set by the
Issuer prior to the first solicitation of a Holder made by any
Person in respect of any such action, or in the case of any such
vote, prior to such vote, any such record date shall be the later
of 10 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent or the
date of the most recent list of Holders furnished to the Trustee
prior to such solicitation.

(f) Without limiting the foregoing,
a Holder entitled to take any action hereunder with regard to any
particular Note may do so with regard to all or any part of the
principal amount of such Note or by one or more duly appointed
agents, each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with
regard to all or any part of such principal amount. Any notice
given or action taken by a Holder or its agents with regard to
different parts of such principal amount pursuant to this paragraph
shall have the same effect as if given or taken by separate Holders
of each such different part.

(g) Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, a Holder, including DTC that is the Holder of a
Global Note, may make, give or take, by a proxy or proxies duly
appointed in writing, any request, demand, authorization,
direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided in this
Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders, and DTC that is
the Holder of a Global Note may provide its proxy or proxies to the
beneficial owners of interests in any such Global Note through such
depositary’s standing instructions and customary
practices.

(h) The Issuer may fix a record date
for the purpose of determining the Persons who are beneficial
owners of interests in any Global Note held by DTC entitled under
the procedures of such depositary to make, give or take, by a proxy
or proxies duly appointed in writing, any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
provided in this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders.
If such a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date or
their duly appointed proxy or proxies, and only such Persons, shall
be entitled to make, give or take such request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action,
whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date.
No such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other action shall be valid or effective if made, given
or taken more than 90 days after such record date.

part of this Indenture and the Issuer, the Guarantors and the
Trustee, by their execution and delivery of this Indenture,
expressly agree to such terms and provisions and to be bound

At least one Officer shall execute
the Notes on behalf of the Issuer by manual or facsimile

authenticated, the Note shall nevertheless be valid.

A Note shall not be entitled to any
benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any
purpose until authenticated substantially in the form of Exhibit
A attached hereto by the manual signature of the Trustee. The
signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Note has been duly
authenticated and delivered under this Indenture.

On the Issue Date, the Trustee
shall, upon receipt of a written order of the Issuer signed by an
Officer (an “ Issuer Authentication Order ”),
authenticate and deliver the Initial Notes. In addition, at any
time, and from time to time, the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an

that such issuance is in compliance with Sections 4.09 and 4.12
hereof.

The Trustee may appoint an
authenticating agent acceptable to the Issuer to authenticate
Notes. An authenticating agent may authenticate Notes whenever the
Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to

and exchange. The Issuer may appoint one or more co-registrars and
one or more additional paying agents. The term “
Registrar ” includes any co-registrar and the term
“ Paying Agent ” includes any additional paying
agent. The Issuer may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without
prior notice to any Holder.

The Issuer shall notify the Trustee
in writing of the name and address of any Agent not a party to this
Indenture. If the Issuer fails to appoint or maintain another
entity as Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such
Registrar or Paying Agent. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
may act as Registrar or Paying Agent.

all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of
or premium or cash interest (including Additional Interest, if any)
on the Notes, and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the
Issuer in making any such payment. While any such default
continues, the Trustee may require a Paying Agent to pay all money
held by it to the Trustee. The Issuer at any time may require a
Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon
payment over to the Trustee, the Paying Agent (if other than the

or reorganization proceedings relating to the Issuer, the Trustee
shall serve as Paying Agent for the Notes.

Restricted Global Note to an Unrestricted Global Note, such

to a holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note or to a
Holder of a Definitive Note for any registration of transfer or
exchange, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in
connection therewith (other than any such transfer taxes or similar
governmental charge payable upon exchange or transfer pursuant to
Sections 2.07, 2.10, 3.06, 3.09, 4.10, 4.14 and 9.05
hereof).

(iii) Neither the Registrar nor the
Issuer shall be required to register the transfer of or exchange
any Note selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the
unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part.

(iv) All Global Notes and Definitive
Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of
Global Notes or Definitive Notes shall be the valid obligations of
the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same
benefits under this Indenture, as the Global Notes or Definitive
Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or
exchange.

(v) The Issuer shall not be required
(A) to issue, to register the transfer of or to exchange any
Notes during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days
before the day of any selection of Notes for redemption under
Section 3.02 hereof and ending at the close of business on the
day of selection; (B) to register the transfer of or to
exchange any Note so selected for redemption in whole or in part,
except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part;

other purposes, and none of the Trustee, any Agent or the Issuer
shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

registration of transfer of any Note at the office or agency of the
Issuer designated pursuant to Section 4.02 hereof, the Issuer
shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and mail, in the
name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more
replacement Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations
of a like aggregate principal amount.

Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of any authorized
denomination or denominations of a like aggregate principal amount

receives evidence to its satisfaction of the ownership and
destruction, loss or theft of any Note, the Issuer shall issue and
the Trustee, upon receipt of an Issuer Authentication Order, shall
authenticate a replacement Note if the Trustee’s requirements
are met. If required by the Trustee or the Issuer, an indemnity
bond must be supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in the
judgment of the Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the
Trustee, any Agent and any authenticating agent from any loss that
any of them may suffer if a Note is replaced. The Issuer and the
Trustee may charge for their expenses in replacing a
Note.

Every replacement Note is a
contractual obligation of the Issuer and shall be entitled to all
of the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with
all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

Section 2.08 Outstanding
Notes .

The Notes outstanding at any time
are all the Notes authenticated by the Trustee except for those
canceled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, those
reductions in the interest in a Global Note effected by the Trustee
in accordance with the provisions hereof, and those described in
this Section 2.08 as not outstanding. Except as set forth in
Section 2.09 hereof, a Note does not cease to be outstanding
because the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer holds the
Note.

If a Note is replaced pursuant to
Section 2.07 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the
Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is
held by a protected purchaser.

If the principal amount of any Note
is considered paid under Section 4.01 hereof, it ceases to be
outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue.

If the Paying Agent (other than the
Issuer, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of any thereof) holds, on a
Redemption Date or maturity date, money sufficient to pay Notes
payable on that date, then on and after that date such Notes shall
be deemed to be no longer outstanding and shall cease to accrue
interest.

Section 2.09 Treasury
Notes .

In determining whether the Holders
of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Issuer or any
Affiliate of the Issuer, shall be considered as though not
outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether
the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction,
waiver or consent, only Notes that a Responsible Officer of the
Trustee knows are so owned, shall be so disregarded. Notes so owned
which have been pledged in good faith shall not be disregarded if
the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the
pledgee’s right to deliver any such direction, waiver or
consent with respect to the Notes and that the pledgee is not the
Issuer or any obligor upon the Notes or any Affiliate of the Issuer
or of such other obligor.
 
64



Section 2.10 Temporary
Notes .

Until certificates representing
Notes are ready for delivery, the Issuer may prepare and the
Trustee, upon receipt of an Issuer Authentication Order, shall
authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary Notes shall be
substantially in the form of certificated Notes but may have
variations that the Issuer considers appropriate for temporary
Notes and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Without
unreasonable delay, the Issuer shall prepare and the Trustee shall
authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary
Notes.

Holders and beneficial holders, as
the case may be, of temporary Notes shall be entitled to all of the
benefits accorded to Holders, or beneficial holders, respectively,
of Notes under this Indenture.

Section 2.11
Cancellation .

The Issuer at any time may deliver
Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and Paying
Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them
for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee or,
at the direction of the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agent
and no one else shall cancel all Notes surrendered for registration
of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and
shall destroy cancelled Notes (subject to the record retention
requirement of the Exchange Act). Certification of the destruction
of all cancelled Notes shall be delivered to the Issuer upon the
Issuer’s written request. The Issuer may not issue new Notes
to replace Notes that it has paid or that have been delivered to
the Trustee for cancellation.

Section 2.12 Defaulted Cash
Interest .

If the Issuer defaults in a payment
of cash interest (including Additional Interest, if any) on the
Notes, it shall pay the defaulted cash interest (including
Additional Interest, if any) in any lawful manner plus, to the
extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted cash interest
(including Additional Interest, if any), to the Persons who are
Holders on a subsequent special record date, in each case at the
rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof. The
Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of
defaulted cash interest (including Additional Interest, if any)
proposed to be paid on each Note and the date of the proposed
payment and at the same time the Issuer shall deposit with the
Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed
to be paid in respect of such defaulted cash interest or shall make
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to
the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be
held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such
defaulted cash interest as provided in this Section 2.12. The
Trustee shall fix or cause to be fixed each such special record
date and payment date; provided that no such special record
date shall be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date
for such defaulted cash interest. The Trustee shall promptly notify
the Issuer of such special record date. At least 15 days before the
special record date, the Issuer (or, upon the written request of
the Issuer, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the
Issuer) shall mail or cause to be mailed, first-class postage
prepaid, to each Holder a notice at his or her address as it
appears in the Note Register that states the special record date,
the related payment date and the amount of such interest to be
paid. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12
and for greater certainty, each Note delivered under this Indenture
upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of
any other Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued and
unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other
Note.

Section 2.13 CUSIP and ISIN
Numbers .

The Issuer in issuing the Notes may
use CUSIP and/or ISIN numbers (if then generally in use) and, if
so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP and/or ISIN numbers in notices of
redemption as a convenience to
 
65


Holders; provided that any such notice
may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of
such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any
notice of redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the
other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such
redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of
such numbers. The Issuer shall as promptly as practicable notify
the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP or ISIN numbers.

Section 2.14 Listing
.

The Issuer shall promptly notify the
Trustee when the Notes become listed or cease to be listed on any
U.S. national or regional securities exchange.

of the principal national securities exchange on which the Notes
are listed, (b) on a pro rata basis to the extent practicable

prepaid, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the
Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at such
Holder’s registered address or otherwise delivered in
accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that notices of
redemption may be mailed or delivered more than 60 days prior to a
Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with
Article 8 or Article 12 hereof. Except as set forth in
Sections 3.04, 3.07(c) and 3.07(d) hereof, notices of
redemption may not be conditional.

The notice shall identify the Notes
to be redeemed and shall state:

(a) the Redemption Date;

(b) the redemption price;

(c) if any Note is to be redeemed in
part only, the portion of the principal amount of that Note that is
to be redeemed and that, after the Redemption Date upon surrender
of such Note, a new Note or Notes in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of the original Note representing the same
indebtedness to the extent not redeemed shall be issued in the name
of the Holder of the Notes upon cancellation of the original
Note;

(d) the name and address of the
Paying Agent;

(e) that Notes called for redemption
must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption

Date;

(g) the paragraph or subparagraph of
the Notes and/or Section of this Indenture pursuant to which
the Notes called for redemption are being redeemed;

(h) that no representation is made
as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP and/or ISIN number,
if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Notes;
and

(i) if in connection with a
redemption pursuant to Section 3.07(c) or Section 3.07(d)

At the Issuer’s request, the
Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Issuer’s
name and at its expense; provided that the Issuer shall have
delivered to the Trustee, at least five Business Days (or such
lesser number of days as shall be acceptable to the Trustee) before

Section 3.04 Effect of

Once notice of redemption is mailed
or delivered in accordance with Section 3.03 hereof or
otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, Notes called
for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the Redemption
Date at the redemption price (except as provided for in
Sections 3.07(c) and 3.07(d) hereof). The notice, if mailed or
delivered in a manner herein provided, shall

be conclusively presumed to have been given,
whether or not the Holder receives such notice. In any case,
failure to give such notice by mail or delivery or any defect in
the notice to the Holder of any Note designated for redemption in
whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings
for the redemption of any other Note. Subject to Section 3.05
hereof, on and after the Redemption Date, interest ceases to accrue
on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

or purchased on that date. The Trustee or the Paying Agent shall
promptly return to the Issuer any money deposited with the Trustee
or the Paying Agent by the Issuer in excess of the amounts
necessary to pay the redemption price of, and accrued and unpaid
interest (including Additional Interest, if any) on, all Notes to
be redeemed or purchased.

If the Issuer complies with the
provisions of the preceding paragraph, on and after the redemption
or purchase date, interest shall cease to accrue on the Notes or
the portions of Notes called for redemption or purchase. If a Note
is redeemed or purchased on or after a Record Date but on or prior
to the related Interest Payment Date, then any accrued and unpaid
interest (including Additional Interest, if any) to the redemption
or purchase date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such
