Common Questions
Modified Endowment Contract



What is a MEC - Modified Endowment Contract?
The federal tax law definition of "life insurance" limits your ability to pay certain high levels of premiums. In addition, if your cumulative premium payments exceed certain amounts specified under the Internal Revenue Code, your policy will become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC). If your policy is a MEC, the tax treatment of any death benefit provided under the contract will still qualify for income tax free treatment but you may be subject to additional taxes and penalties on any distributions from your policy during the life of the insured.
You can ask your financial professional to provide you with an illustration of policy benefits that shows you the amount of premium you can pay, based on various assumptions, without exceeding these tax law limits.


What policies are "grandfathered" from becoming Modified Endowment Contracts?
Life insurance contracts entered into before June 21, 1988 are generally "grandfathered" from this premium limit test. However, certain changes made to the contract could invalidate the policy's "grandfathered" status and subject it to premium limit testing.


What changes could cause a loss of "grandfathered" status?
A face amount increase, the addition of a rider or an increase in its amount, a reduction in rating, a change to non-smoker status or a substitution of insured are all considered material changes and could result in a loss of "grandfathered" status. With the change, a new 7-pay period is started effective with the date of the transaction and a new 7-pay premium is determined. Premiums will need to be limited to the 7-pay premium for seven years following the change in order to avoid Modified Endowment Contract (MEC) status.


What is the effect of a MEC (Modified Endowment Contract)?
If your policy is a MEC (Modified Endowment Contract) the tax treatment of any death benefit provided under the contract will still qualify for income tax free treatment. However, you may be subject to additional taxes and penalties on any distributions from your policy during the lifetime of the insured. Any distribution from a policy that is a MEC will be taxed on an "income-first" basis. Distributions for this purpose include a loan (including any increase in the loan amount to pay interest on an existing loan or an assignment or a pledge to secure a loan) or withdrawal. Any such distributions will be considered taxable income to you to the extent there is gain in the policy at the time of distribution. That is, the distribution will be includible in income up to the amount your account value exceeds your basis in the policy.
A 10% penalty tax also will apply to the taxable portion of most pre-age 59 1/2 distributions from a policy that is a Modified Endowment Contract.


When will the 10% penalty apply to a distribution from a MEC?
A 10% penalty tax will apply to the taxable portion of most distributions from a policy that is a Modified Endowment Contract.The penalty tax will not apply to:

distributions to taxpayers whose actual age is at least 59 1/2,
distributions in the case of a disability (as defined in the Code) or,
distributions received as part of a series of substantially equal periodic annuity payments for the life (or life expectancy) of the taxpayer or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the taxpayer and his or her beneficiary.



How is MEC status determined?
A Modified Endowment Contract (MEC) is a life insurance policy that has had cumulative premium payments made during the first seven years that exceed a limit defined in the tax code. This limit is called the 7-pay limit and depends in part on the amount of the policy's death benefit and the age of the insured. At any point in time during the first seven policy years, premiums paid cannot exceed the sum of the annual 7-pay limits or the policy will become a MEC. This means your total limit will increase each of your first seven policy years. After seven years, MEC testing will not apply unless at any point in time a "material change" requires your policy to start a new 7- pay testing period with new 7- pay limits.
Whenever there is a "material change" under a policy, the policy will generally be (a) treated as a new contract for purposes of determining whether the policy is a Modified Endowment Contract and (b) subjected to a new 7-pay period and new 7-pay limit. Material changes include: a face amount increase, the addition of a rider or an increase in its amount, a reduction in rating, a change to non-smoker status or a substitution of insured and all could result in a loss of "grandfathered" status.
There are also changes considered reductions in benefits during a 7-pay test period that trigger a retroactive recalculation and testing of premiums. A reduction in benefits during a 7-pay test period causes the policy to be retested as if the policy had been issued at the reduced level of benefits. This could cause the policy to become a Modified Endowment Contract based upon premiums paid prior to the reduction in benefits.


What is the "basis" in a life insurance policy?
Your basis, sometimes also referred to as your investment in the contract, generally will equal the premiums you have paid, less the amount of any previous distributions from your policy that were not taxable. For Modified Endowment Contracts, your basis is also increased by the amount of any prior loan under your policy that was considered taxable income to you.


What are taxable events?
If your policy is not a MEC (Modified Endowment Contract):

Upon full surrender, any amount by which the proceeds we pay (including amounts we use to repay any policy loan and unpaid loan interest) exceed your basis in the policy will be includible in income. 
If a policy terminates after a grace period, the repayment of any then-outstanding policy loan and unpaid loan interest will be treated as a distribution and could be subject to tax to the extent the distribution exceeds your basis in the policy.
If you make a partial withdrawal during the first 15 years of your policy, all or part of the withdrawal may be taxable if there is gain in your policy, even if the withdrawal does not exceed the cost basis.
If you make an assignment of rights or benefits under your policy and the policy is a MEC or subject to a policy loan, you may be deemed to have received a distribution from your policy, all or part of which may be taxable.
If you reduce your benefits under a policy, it is possible that amounts previously paid as premiums will exceed the amount the tax law permits for your policy to be treated as life insurance. This could cause amounts to be forced out of the contract to keep its qualification as life insurance. These force-outs could be required at the time of the reduction and/or in future years. All or a portion of any amounts forced out may be taxable to the extent there is gain in your policy.

All amounts includible in income under a life insurance policy will be considered ordinary income as opposed to capital gain.
If your policy is a MEC, any distribution from your policy will be taxed on an "income -first" basis. Distributions for this purpose include a loan (including any increase in the loan amount to pay interest on an existing loan or an assignment or a pledge to secure a loan) or withdrawal.
A 10% penalty tax also will apply to the taxable portion of most pre-age 59 1/2 distributions from a policy that is a Modified Endowment Contract.
AXA Advisors does not provide legal or tax advice. You must consult your legal and tax advisors for specific advice pertaining to your situation.

Investment information



How can I obtain investment information?
The AXA web site, your online information source for the status and current values of your AXA life and annuity contracts, does provide you with the most recent closing price for all the investment portfolios you have available to you.
In addition, online access also displays monthly and quarterly annualized rates of return for the portfolios available within most of our variable life and annuity contracts. Choose the Performance Information option from the dropdown box on the right side of the Portfolio Summary page.


How is the value of the investment options determined?
Amounts that you allocate under your variable life policy to any of the investment options are invested in a corresponding "Portfolio" that is part of EQ Advisors Trust. The value of your variable investment option is measured in "units".
Each unit has a "unit value". While the unit value relates to the net asset value of the shares of the corresponding portfolio, there is not a one-to-one correlation in the dollar amount. For example, if at the time of the portfolio's inception the net asset value of the portfolio was $10.00 per share, the unit value of the corresponding investment option may actually have been $100.00 per unit. If the portfolio's net asset value grew to $11.00 per share the next day, the unit value of the corresponding variable investment option would have increased proportionately, but not by the exact same dollar amount.
The value of each unit will increase or decrease each day and reflect all reinvested dividends and distributions from the corresponding Portfolio. The daily unit value calculation will also take into account the deduction of any mortality and expense risk charges that apply under your contract/policy.
The number of your units in any variable investment option does not change, unless there is an event or transaction under your contract/policy that involves moving assets into or out of that option. Whenever any amount is withdrawn or deducted from one of your contract/policy's variable investment options, we "redeem" the number of units that has a value equal to that amount, on the effective date of the redemption. This happens, for example, when all or a portion of monthly deductions and transaction-based charges are allocated to that option, or when loans, transfers, withdrawals and surrenders are made from that option.
Your investment results in a variable investment option will depend on those of the related Portfolio. Any gains will generally be tax deferred and the life insurance benefits we pay upon the death of the Insured will generally be federal income tax free.
Daily Unit Values are available online, for most variable life and annuity contracts, through the AXA web site. Login or Register .


What is the current Guaranteed Interest Account?
The GIA rate is the rate credited to monies that are invested in the guaranteed investment option on your variable life insurance contract. It is determined periodically by AXA. The current interest rate that is credited can never be lower than the minimum specified in your policy. This rate is not guaranteed or is guaranteed only for a limited duration; see your policy for specifics.
Your Guaranteed Interest Account (GIA) rate can be found in the annual report that is sent to you at your policy anniversary. Refer to the "Table of Interest Rates" in your annual report, which will provide interest rates for the current and past year.
Note that transfers out of the GIA are subject to certain restrictions. One GIA transfer request is permitted in each policy year within a period beginning 30 days prior to your policy anniversary and ending 60 days after the anniversary. A transfer request received before the anniversary will be effective on the policy anniversary. Transfers are limited to the greatest of $500, 25% of your then current balance in the GIA, or the amount transferred from the GIA in the immediately preceding policy year. Twelve transfers per policy year are currently permitted free of charge; over twelve, a $25 fee may apply, depending on your policy. There may be product variations, please check your policy prospectus for complete details.


Are there any transfer restrictions on the Guaranteed Interest Account?
Transfers out of the Guaranteed Investment Account (GIA) are subject to certain restrictions. One GIA transfer request is permitted in each policy year within a period beginning 30 days prior to your policy anniversary and ending 60 days after the anniversary. A transfer request received before the anniversary will be effective on the policy anniversary. Transfers received after the policy anniversary (within the 60 day period) are effective on the date received at our Administrative Office. Transfers are limited to the greatest of $500, 25% of your then current balance in the GIA, or the amount transferred from the GIA in the immediately preceding policy year.
We are currently relaxing our policy rules so that you may transfer any amount of unloaned policy account value out of the guaranteed interest option to any other investment option whether or not you are within the GIA Transfer Period.
Twelve transfers per policy year from all investment options (not just GIA) are currently permitted free of charge; over twelve, a $25 fee may apply, depending on your policy. There may be product variations, please check your policy prospectus for complete details.



Performance information



How can I obtain performance information?
The AXA web site displays monthly and quarterly annualized rates of return for the portfolios available within most of our variable life and annuity contracts. Select the "View" link under "Performance Information" on the Portfolio Summary page.
Performance information is a two-page report, showing the month-end and the quarter-end annualized rates of return of the EQ Advisors Trust Portfolios. To ensure that you have a clear understanding of the numbers that are presented, it is essential that you read both of the reports and the footnotes on each. Use the page down key or the scroll bar to view the second report.Some information to keep in mind as you review these reports:

Annualized rates of return are based on the percentage change in net asset value with dividends and capital gains reinvested 
Investment Performance of the Equitable Advisors Trust (the Trust is a mutual fund which holds portfolios that correspond to the investment options available under your variable life policy) is calculated after deduction of investment management fees and direct operating expense of the Trust
This performance calculation is not representative of the actual return you would receive under your variable life insurance policy. Changes in policy values depend not only on the investment performance of the Trust but also on the insurance and administrative charges, sales charges and the mortality and expense risk charges applicable under a policy. These policy charges effectively reduce the dollar amount of any net gains and increase the dollar amount of any net losses.
The investment options available under your variable life contract are not publicly traded mutual funds. As such, they do not have security or ticker symbols like publicly traded mutual funds and cannot be accessed via public mutual fund lookup sites.
Please note that while some of these investment options may have similar names, investment managers and investment objectives as publicly traded mutual funds, they are completely separate portfolios that are collectively administered through the Equitable Advisors Trust. In general, you should be aware of the differences when comparing performance of mutual funds and their variable annuity or variable life counterpart portfolios.Major factors that can contribute to these differences include: 

The portfolio's underlying fee structure (management and administrative expenses
Insurance and contract related charges in addition to management expenses (not applicable to mutual funds
The timing of the portfolio's purchase and sale of securities
Differences in cash flows (new sales and redemptions)
Other strategies employed by the fund manager for tax purposes (not applicable to variable portfolios given their tax-deferred status)





Why does the rate of return differ, between different variable products, for the same investment option?
Annualized rates of return may differ because the fees and expenses associated with the particular investment option are different under the two products. Check your policy/contract prospectus for detail on the fees and expenses of the investment portfolios.
Note that Annualized Rates of Return are not representative of the actual return you would receive under your policy. Changes in policy values depend not only on the investment performance of the various options, but also on applicable insurance and administrative charges, applicable sales charges and the mortality and expense risk charges that are deducted. Premiums or contributions made to your policy, as well as any loans or withdrawals, will also affect its values.



Investment transactions



Can I automatically rebalance the amounts in the investment options?
Asset rebalancing is a feature that has been added to AXA's variable life policies purchased after 1985, excluding SP-Flex. Having established your personal investment strategy, you may want to ensure that your original percentages allocated to each investment option remain constant. Asset rebalancing enables clients to periodically redistribute the amounts in the variable investment options of their life insurance policy to restore their original asset allocation. Rebalancing may be done at quarterly, semiannual, or annual intervals. In addition, you pay no income taxes on these transactions.
You may specify asset allocation percentages for up to eight variable investment options. (The GIA is not available for asset rebalancing.) The allocation percentage you specify for each selected investment option must be at least 5% (whole percentage only); the sum of the percentages must equal 100%. You may not elect the asset rebalancing service if you already participate in the dollar cost averaging service (also referred to as the "automatic transfer service").
There is no cost for this service. You may request asset rebalancing at any time. You may change the asset rebalancing allocation instructions or terminate the asset rebalancing service at any time.

Living Benefits



What is Living Benefits?
Living Benefits is an enhancement to your AXA insurance policy. It allows you to use a portion of the death benefit from your policy if the insured person is medically diagnosed with a condition limiting life expectancy to six months or less (twelve months or less in Vermont and Oklahoma).


How do I include Living Benefits in my policy?
When introduced, Living Benefits was made automatically available - free of charge - to almost all AXA policies with face amounts of $5,000 or more that were issued prior to March 1, 1994 (or the date of state insurance department approval, if later) on an as needed basis.
Today, generally speaking, if you apply for an AXA life insurance policy with a face amount of at least $50,000 and which is subject to underwriting, the Living Benefits rider is automatically included - unless you specifically asked to have it excluded. There is no charge if the rider is included at issue. If, however, you initially excluded the Living Benefits rider and wish to add it after the policy has been issued, you will be charged an administrative fee of $100. In addition, we may require that the insured undergo blood testing and provide evidence of insurability to add the rider at a later date.


How much money can I get as Living Benefits?
Generally, you can receive any amount between $5,000 and 75% of the proceeds (25% in Vermont, Oklahoma and Illinois) that would be payable at death, up to a maximum of $500,000. If you own more than one policy, the combined maximum you may request for all policies issued by each AXA subsidiary is $500,000.


If I receive a Living Benefits payment, does it affect how much is left to my beneficiaries?
Yes. A Living Benefits payment acts as a lien against your policy. It reduces the death benefit payable to your beneficiaries. It also reduces the amount of money available for loans as well as the cash value of your policy. The lien equals the amount of the Living Benefits payment you receive, plus accrued interest.


Is a Living Benefits payment taxable to me?
It may be. You should consult with your personal tax advisor on this issue.


What happens to my policy if I receive a payment and the insured person lives longer than expected?
Nothing, unless the amount of the lien (including interest, plus policy premiums advanced by AXA, if any) reaches a point where it equals the total death benefit payable under the policy. In this case, you may repay the lien or let the policy terminate.

Loans



How can I confirm my policy's current cash value?
Online through the AXA web site. Login or Register The Portfolio Summary screen will list your policy's Net Cash Surrender Value and the date this value was calculated. Net Cash Surrender Value reflects deductions from your policy's cash value for any loan and loan interest and any surrender charges, if they apply, but does not reflect any payments made under a Living Benefits Rider.

The available loan amount and current interest rate (which is subject to change by AXA) that would apply to a loan is shown in the" Loan Information" section. Before deciding that a policy loan is the best option, you may want to discuss it with your Financial Advisor and ask for an illustration of how a loan may impact your policy's values. If you choose to process a loan request, you will also want to carefully review the Terms and Conditions available in the AXA web site.
AXA VOICEIT Interactive Voice Response System offers you the convenience of requesting Loans on your policy 24 hours a day/7 days a week. You can reach AXA VOICEIT, Toll Free at (800) 777-6510. Assisted Service is readily available if you require assistance during business hours.
The amount that you can borrow, as well as the current interest rate (which is subject to change by AXA) that will be charged on the outstanding loan amount, will be voiced.
Please note that values given may not reflect transactions, credits or deductions processed during the prior or current business day. You can request a cash loan, if you are the Owner of the policy, by requesting a "Loan Request".
If your policy is a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC), a policy loan will be taxable to the extent of gain in the policy, and a 10% penalty tax may also apply to the taxable portion of the distribution.
Please note that any unpaid policy loan balance and interest will reduce your policy's death benefit and cash value. Interest will be billed annually, on your policy's anniversary. If you do not pay the amount due, it will be added to the amount of the loan and next year's interest will be based on this new loan amount. You may make policy loan repayments at any time.


How do I request a loan check?
You can request a loan:

Online through the AXA web site. Login or Register Click on "Loan Request" from the "Choose an Option" drop down box. 
AXA VOICEIT Interactive Voice Response offers you the convenience of requesting loans on your policy 24 hours a day/7 days a week. You can reach AXA Equitaable VOICEIT Toll Free at (800) 777-6510. Assisted Service is readily available if you require assistance during business hours.



Do I have to repay the loan?
You can repay all or part of your loan at any time. Please note that unpaid policy loan balance and interest will reduce your policy's death benefit and cash value.
Interest will be billed annually, on your policy's anniversary. If you do not pay the amount due, it will be added to the amount of the loan and next year's interest will be based on this new loan amount.


What is the effect of a loan on a policy that is a MEC (Modified Endowment Contract)?
If your policy is a MEC (Modified Endowment Contract) the tax treatment of any death benefit provided under the contract will still qualify for income tax free treatment. However, you may be subject to additional taxes and penalties on any distributions from your policy during the lifetime of the insured. Any distribution from a policy that is a MEC will be taxed on an "income-first" basis. Distributions for this purpose include a loan (including any increase in the loan amount to pay interest on an existing loan or an assignment or a pledge to secure a loan) or withdrawal. Any such distributions will be considered taxable income to you to the extent there is gain in the policy at the time of distribution. That is, the distribution will be includible in income up to the amount your account value exceeds your basis in the policy.
A 10% penalty tax also will apply to the taxable portion of most pre-age 59 1/2 distributions from a policy that is a Modified Endowment Contract.



Unit prices



How can I check daily unit prices?
Daily unit prices can be obtained:

Online, through the AXA web site. Login or Register. Click on "Unit Values" from the "Choose an Option" drop down box.
AXA VOICEIT Interactive Voice Response offers you the convenience of requesting the Unit Prices on your policy funds, 24 hours a day/ 7 days a week. You can reach AXA VOICEIT, Toll Free at (800) 777-6510. Assisted Service is readily available if you require assistance during business hours.



Can I check the investment options mutual fund listings?
The investment options available to you through your AXA variable life insurance policy are not publicly traded funds and do not appear in the mutual fund listings that are published in many daily newspapers. Barron's, a financial weekly newspaper, does include a listing for variable annuities and life accounts in its "Market Week" section. The unit price, four-week percent total return and a 52- week percent total return is reported (as of a specified date) for the investment portfolios available for selected AXA variable life policies.


Can I download values into Quicken?
Programs like Quicken and Microsoft Money use ticker symbols of publicly-traded stocks and retail mutual funds to gather their data. Neither your AXA policies nor the funds that back them are retail mutual funds and therefore do not have ticker symbols. The investment portfolios that you have access to within your policy or contract do not have ticker symbols, so you won't be able to look them up on mutual fund sites to determine their most current price.
The AXA web site, your online information source for the status and current values of your AXA life and annuity contracts, does provide you with the most recent closing price for all the investment portfolios you have available to you. In addition, EQAccess also displays monthly and quarterly annualized rates of return for the portfolios available within our variable life and annuity contracts. Login or Register 
Please remember that while several of your variable investment options do indeed have substantially similar investment strategies and policies of publicly traded mutual funds, they are subject to different management fees and expenses. Furthermore, the actual performance under your individual policy or contract reflects insurance-related charges, which would not apply in a typical mutual fund. In general, you should be aware of the differences when comparing performance of mutual funds and their variable annuity or variable life counterpart portfolios. Major factors that can contribute to these differences include:

The portfolio's underlying fee structure (management and administrative expenses)
Insurance and contract related charges in addition to management expenses (not applicable to mutual funds)
The timing of the portfolio's purchase and sale of securities; differences in cash flows (new sales and redemptions); and, other strategies employed by the fund manager for tax purposes (not applicable to variable portfolios given their tax-deferred status)



Why is "Unit Value" shown as NA in the AXA web site?
Due to a technical problem, the AXA web site is currently unable to retrieve the value of units in that fund. This is only a temporary problem and you should try again later.


Why do the unit values for the same investment option differ?
Unit values for the same investment option under different variable products may differ because:

The types or level of charges deducted before the unit value is calculated may differ by product. Check your policy/contract prospectus for detail on charges for the particular product. 
The policies/contracts were introduced in different years and a new set of unit prices was established.

Note that although the two products may have different unit values for the same investment option, the annualized rates of return for the products may in fact be the same. You can access performance/rate of return information from the Portfolio Summary screen of the AXA web site.

Henry Hyde leaves the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York to start his own firm, then known as Equitable Life Assurance Society of America. In its tenth year, Equitable writes more new business than any other company in the world.



The company's new headquarters is the first office building with steam elevators, paving the way for future skyscrapers. By 1879, it will expand to be the tallest office building in the world at that time.



Equitable markets the first joint and survivor annuity and pioneers the practice of paying death claims immediately. Miss Ray Wilner appointed Equitable's first woman agency manager.



Equitable supported the American College in launching the CLU professional designation program. Equitable started new agent training classes in 1902.



Equitable introduces its first line of individual variable annuity products and in 1976 pioneers variable life insurance, an investment-oriented policy that commands significant market share.



With a $1 billion investment from the AXA Group, Equitable completes the largest-ever conversion from a mutual to a stock company at that time and soon becomes a member of the Global AXA Group.



AXA celebrates its eighth consecutive year as the #1 insurance brand in the world as measured by the Interbrand annual report.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

You should read this Supplement in conjunction with the Prospectuses and retain

Effective January 3, 2005, please note the following changes:                   

     1.    In "Telephone operated program support ("TOPS") and EQAccess systems"
      under "Who is Equitable Life," please note the following change:

       The first paragraph following the bullets is deleted and replaced
with the following:                                       

           "TOPS and EQAccess are normally available seven days a week, 24 hours
         a day. You may use TOPS by calling toll free 1-888-909-7770. If you
        are a client of AXA Advisors, you may use EQAccess by visiting our
        web site at http://www.axaonline.com and clicking on EQAccess. All
         other clients may access EQAccess by visiting our other web site at
          http://www.equitable.com. Of course, for reasons beyond our control,
these services may sometimes be unavailable."             

2. A. In "Distribution of the contracts" under "More Information," the
           first four paragraphs are deleted in their entirety and replaced with
the following:                                            

    "The contracts are distributed by both AXA Advisors, LLC ("AXA
         Advisors") and AXA Distributors, LLC ("AXA Distributors"). Both AXA
      Advisors and AXA Distributors serve as principal underwriters of
         Separate Account A. The offering of the contracts is intended to be
continuous.                                               

           AXA Advisors, an affiliate of AXA Equitable, and AXA Distributors, an
       indirect wholly owned subsidiary of AXA Equitable, are registered
    with the SEC as broker dealers and are members of the National
      Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Their principal business
      address is 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10104. Both
     broker dealers also act as distributors for other AXA Equitable
annuity products.                                         

           The contracts are sold by financial professionals of AXA Advisors and
          its affiliates and by financial professionals of our affiliate, MONY
       Securities Corporation ("MSC"), a retail broker-dealer that has a
selling agreement with AXA Distributors.                  

          We pay broker-dealer sales compensation to AXA Advisors. We also pay
          broker-dealer sales compensation to AXA Distributors which, in turn,
       pays MSC. In general, broker-dealers receiving sales compensation
         will pay a portion of it to individual financial representatives as
commissions related to the sales of the contracts.        

    Compensation paid to AXA Advisors for individual qualified and
         non-qualified EQUI-VEST(R) contracts generally will not exceed 8.5%
       of the total contributions made under the contracts for first and
    subsequent years. AXA Advisors, in turn, may pay its financial
           professionals either a portion of the contribution-based compensation
    or a reduced portion of the contribution-based compensation in
combination with ongoing annual compensation ("asset-based
          compensation") up to 0.30% of the account value of the contract sold
      based on the financial professional's choice. Contribution-based
      compensation, when combined with asset-based compensation, could
      exceed 8.5% of the total contributions made under the contracts.
      Compensation paid for qualified periodic premium contracts under
        EQUI-VEST(R) employer sponsored programs generally will not exceed
         16.0% of first year contributions and 6.0% of contributions made in
     subsequent years. AXA Advisors, in turn, will pay the financial
    professional a portion of the contribution-based compensation.

           Sales compensation paid to AXA Distributors generally will not exceed
         6.50% of total contributions for all EQUI-VEST(R) contracts, except
           the rate paid for periodic contributions made to certain TSA and EDC*
         contracts (up to a limit) under the EQUI-VEST(R) employer sponsored

                                                                          X00866

       programs contracts generally will not exceed 12.00% of first year
        contributions and 2.80% of contributions made in subsequent years.
           AXA Distributors, in turn, will pay selling broker-dealers either the
  contribution-based compensation, or a reduced portion of the
     contribution-based compensation in combination with asset-based
          compensation of up to 0.60% of the account value of all or a portion
of the contracts sold through the selling broker-dealer.  
     Contribution-based compensation, when combined with asset-based
      compensation, could exceed 6.50% of the total contributions made
under the contracts.                                      

          AXA Distributors may also receive compensation and reimbursement for
          its marketing services under the terms of its distribution agreement
         with AXA Equitable, as well as payments from portfolio advisers for
sales meetings and/or seminar sponsorships.               

       AXA Equitable and/or AXA Advisors and/or AXA Distributors may use
         their respective past profits or other resources to pay brokers and
       other financial intermediaries for certain expenses they incur in
      providing services intended to promote the sales of our products
        and/or shares in the underlying Trusts. These services may include
        sales personnel training, prospectus review, marketing and related
        services as well as support services that benefit contract owners.

        * except for governmental EDC contracts issued in New York State."

         Advisors (and AXA Distributors, with respect to our affiliate, MSC)
           may provide its financial professionals and managerial personnel with
          a higher percentage of sales commissions and/or compensation for the
      sale of an affiliated variable product than it would the sale of
another product."
