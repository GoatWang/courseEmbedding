Marine market[edit]
The company services the merchant, offshore, cruise and ferry, naval, and special vessel markets, and the offering includes ship design, main and auxiliary engines, auxiliary power systems, electrical and automation packages, propulsors (such as water jets, thrusters, propellers, and nozzles), seals, bearings, gears, rudders, scrubbers, boilers, and all related services, such as repair, configuration, upgrading, training, maintenance, and environmental services.
Customers comprise both shipyards and ship owners. Wärtsilä Ship Power delivers everything from a single product to entire life cycle support, from initial building to operational use, of complex systems powering ships.
The environmental services range from reduction of air emissions, such as NOx, SOx, CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to oily waste water treatment and other water solutions.
Wärtsilä Marine was an important Finnish shipbuilder 1935–1989, building e.g. cruiseferries and a large share of the icebreakers of the world. The shipyards are now owned by Meyer Werft.
Energy market[edit]
Wärtsilä is a provider of power plants in distributed and flexible power generation.[3]
The product portfolio consists of installations up to 600 MW, running on any gaseous or liquid fuels, such as Heavy fuel oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), different types and qualities of fuel oils, and renewable fuels like biogas and biofuel. In addition for the reliability of traditional base power generation, the engines have the capability to start and stop quickly and they maintain their efficiency in part load, which makes them well suited for peaking power production, smart grids, and emergency power systems. They can also utilize the combined cycle and cogeneration to produce steam or hot water for heating, and trigeneration for chilled water, which can be used for air conditioning.
Wärtsilä also provides products and services for grid stability management, utilization of gas flares, pumping applications (such as pump and compression drives), financial services, and project management services for projects concerning power generation.
In 2006, Wärtsilä delivered the Dr. Bird II, a 49.5 MW power barge, to accompany Dr. Bird I (delivered in 1995) in Jamaica. These barges produce in total 123.6 MW and are now owned by Jamaica Energy Partners.[4]
Services market[edit]
The wholly owned service network consist of over 5,000 field services professionals in more than 160 locations in over 70 countries globally, with the installed base of over 180 000 MW. The focus lies on optimising operations and lifecycle performance of land based power plants and ship installations.[5]
Wärtsilä provides services, spare parts, maintenance, upgrades, and fuel conversions solutions for medium and low-speed gas and diesel engines and other related systems, propulsion systems, electrical & automation systems boilers including environmental solutions regarding particulates and NOx, covering scrubber, selective catalytic reduction (SCRs), oxidation catalysts,[6] ballast water treatment systems and oily-water systems, long-term service agreements, training, condition monitoring, and condition-based maintenance and advisory services.
Market share and competitors[edit]
At the end of 2016, Wärtsilä’s market share in marine medium-speed main engines was 51% and in auxiliary engines 18%. Wärtsilä’s market share for gas and liquid fuel power plants was 13%.[7]
Wärtsilä’s biggest competitors in the marine market are MAN Diesel & Turbo, Caterpillar Inc. and Rolls-Royce plc. and in the energy market the biggest competitors are mainly gas turbine manufacturers like General Electric and Siemens.
Engines[edit]




Emma Mærsk is powered by a single low-speed Wärtsilä-Sulzer RT-flex96C engine.


Wärtsilä produces a wide range of low- and medium-speed diesel, gas and dual- and multi-fuel engines for marine propulsion, electricity generation on board ships and for land-based power stations. The engine models are generally identified by the cylinder bore diameter in centimeters, which as of 2012[update] range from 20 to 64 centimetres (7.9 to 25.2 inches) for medium-speed and 35 to 96 centimetres (14 to 38 inches) for low-speed engines. The smallest engine series, four-stroke medium-speed Wärtsilä 20, produces a modest 200 kW (270 hp) per cylinder while the largest, two-stroke low-speed Wärtsilä RT-flex96C, has a maximum output of 5,720 kW (7,670 hp) per cylinder. In addition, Wärtsilä also produces the most powerful medium-speed engine series in the world, Wärtsilä 64, with an output of 2,150 kW (2,880 hp) per cylinder. Depending on the engine model, Wärtsilä offers medium-speed engines in both straight and V configurations with the number of cylinders ranging from four (4L20) to twenty (20V46F), and low-speed engines in inline configuration with five (5RT-flex35) to fourteen cylinders (14RT-flex96C). The most powerful low-speed engine produced by Wärtsilä, a 14-cylinder version of the RT-flex96C, produces 80,080 kW (107,390 hp) and is used to propel the Mærsk E-class container ships.
Wärtsilä admitted manipulation of fuel consumption tests after an internal audit in 2016, with a few hundred engines affected.[8][9]

Marine market[edit]
The company services the merchant, offshore, cruise and ferry, naval, and special vessel markets, and the offering includes ship design, main and auxiliary engines, auxiliary power systems, electrical and automation packages, propulsors (such as water jets, thrusters, propellers, and nozzles), seals, bearings, gears, rudders, scrubbers, boilers, and all related services, such as repair, configuration, upgrading, training, maintenance, and environmental services.
Customers comprise both shipyards and ship owners. Wärtsilä Ship Power delivers everything from a single product to entire life cycle support, from initial building to operational use, of complex systems powering ships.
The environmental services range from reduction of air emissions, such as NOx, SOx, CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to oily waste water treatment and other water solutions.
Wärtsilä Marine was an important Finnish shipbuilder 1935–1989, building e.g. cruiseferries and a large share of the icebreakers of the world. The shipyards are now owned by Meyer Werft.
Energy market[edit]
Wärtsilä is a provider of power plants in distributed and flexible power generation.[3]
The product portfolio consists of installations up to 600 MW, running on any gaseous or liquid fuels, such as Heavy fuel oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), different types and qualities of fuel oils, and renewable fuels like biogas and biofuel. In addition for the reliability of traditional base power generation, the engines have the capability to start and stop quickly and they maintain their efficiency in part load, which makes them well suited for peaking power production, smart grids, and emergency power systems. They can also utilize the combined cycle and cogeneration to produce steam or hot water for heating, and trigeneration for chilled water, which can be used for air conditioning.
Wärtsilä also provides products and services for grid stability management, utilization of gas flares, pumping applications (such as pump and compression drives), financial services, and project management services for projects concerning power generation.
In 2006, Wärtsilä delivered the Dr. Bird II, a 49.5 MW power barge, to accompany Dr. Bird I (delivered in 1995) in Jamaica. These barges produce in total 123.6 MW and are now owned by Jamaica Energy Partners.[4]
Services market[edit]
The wholly owned service network consist of over 5,000 field services professionals in more than 160 locations in over 70 countries globally, with the installed base of over 180 000 MW. The focus lies on optimising operations and lifecycle performance of land based power plants and ship installations.[5]
Wärtsilä provides services, spare parts, maintenance, upgrades, and fuel conversions solutions for medium and low-speed gas and diesel engines and other related systems, propulsion systems, electrical & automation systems boilers including environmental solutions regarding particulates and NOx, covering scrubber, selective catalytic reduction (SCRs), oxidation catalysts,[6] ballast water treatment systems and oily-water systems, long-term service agreements, training, condition monitoring, and condition-based maintenance and advisory services.
Market share and competitors[edit]
At the end of 2016, Wärtsilä’s market share in marine medium-speed main engines was 51% and in auxiliary engines 18%. Wärtsilä’s market share for gas and liquid fuel power plants was 13%.[7]
Wärtsilä’s biggest competitors in the marine market are MAN Diesel & Turbo, Caterpillar Inc. and Rolls-Royce plc. and in the energy market the biggest competitors are mainly gas turbine manufacturers like General Electric and Siemens.
Engines[edit]




Emma Mærsk is powered by a single low-speed Wärtsilä-Sulzer RT-flex96C engine.


Wärtsilä produces a wide range of low- and medium-speed diesel, gas and dual- and multi-fuel engines for marine propulsion, electricity generation on board ships and for land-based power stations. The engine models are generally identified by the cylinder bore diameter in centimeters, which as of 2012[update] range from 20 to 64 centimetres (7.9 to 25.2 inches) for medium-speed and 35 to 96 centimetres (14 to 38 inches) for low-speed engines. The smallest engine series, four-stroke medium-speed Wärtsilä 20, produces a modest 200 kW (270 hp) per cylinder while the largest, two-stroke low-speed Wärtsilä RT-flex96C, has a maximum output of 5,720 kW (7,670 hp) per cylinder. In addition, Wärtsilä also produces the most powerful medium-speed engine series in the world, Wärtsilä 64, with an output of 2,150 kW (2,880 hp) per cylinder. Depending on the engine model, Wärtsilä offers medium-speed engines in both straight and V configurations with the number of cylinders ranging from four (4L20) to twenty (20V46F), and low-speed engines in inline configuration with five (5RT-flex35) to fourteen cylinders (14RT-flex96C). The most powerful low-speed engine produced by Wärtsilä, a 14-cylinder version of the RT-flex96C, produces 80,080 kW (107,390 hp) and is used to propel the Mærsk E-class container ships.
Wärtsilä admitted manipulation of fuel consumption tests after an internal audit in 2016, with a few hundred engines affected.[8][9]

Marine market[edit]
The company services the merchant, offshore, cruise and ferry, naval, and special vessel markets, and the offering includes ship design, main and auxiliary engines, auxiliary power systems, electrical and automation packages, propulsors (such as water jets, thrusters, propellers, and nozzles), seals, bearings, gears, rudders, scrubbers, boilers, and all related services, such as repair, configuration, upgrading, training, maintenance, and environmental services.
Customers comprise both shipyards and ship owners. Wärtsilä Ship Power delivers everything from a single product to entire life cycle support, from initial building to operational use, of complex systems powering ships.
The environmental services range from reduction of air emissions, such as NOx, SOx, CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to oily waste water treatment and other water solutions.
Wärtsilä Marine was an important Finnish shipbuilder 1935–1989, building e.g. cruiseferries and a large share of the icebreakers of the world. The shipyards are now owned by Meyer Werft.
Energy market[edit]
Wärtsilä is a provider of power plants in distributed and flexible power generation.[3]
The product portfolio consists of installations up to 600 MW, running on any gaseous or liquid fuels, such as Heavy fuel oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), different types and qualities of fuel oils, and renewable fuels like biogas and biofuel. In addition for the reliability of traditional base power generation, the engines have the capability to start and stop quickly and they maintain their efficiency in part load, which makes them well suited for peaking power production, smart grids, and emergency power systems. They can also utilize the combined cycle and cogeneration to produce steam or hot water for heating, and trigeneration for chilled water, which can be used for air conditioning.
Wärtsilä also provides products and services for grid stability management, utilization of gas flares, pumping applications (such as pump and compression drives), financial services, and project management services for projects concerning power generation.
In 2006, Wärtsilä delivered the Dr. Bird II, a 49.5 MW power barge, to accompany Dr. Bird I (delivered in 1995) in Jamaica. These barges produce in total 123.6 MW and are now owned by Jamaica Energy Partners.[4]
Services market[edit]
The wholly owned service network consist of over 5,000 field services professionals in more than 160 locations in over 70 countries globally, with the installed base of over 180 000 MW. The focus lies on optimising operations and lifecycle performance of land based power plants and ship installations.[5]
Wärtsilä provides services, spare parts, maintenance, upgrades, and fuel conversions solutions for medium and low-speed gas and diesel engines and other related systems, propulsion systems, electrical & automation systems boilers including environmental solutions regarding particulates and NOx, covering scrubber, selective catalytic reduction (SCRs), oxidation catalysts,[6] ballast water treatment systems and oily-water systems, long-term service agreements, training, condition monitoring, and condition-based maintenance and advisory services.
Market share and competitors[edit]
At the end of 2016, Wärtsilä’s market share in marine medium-speed main engines was 51% and in auxiliary engines 18%. Wärtsilä’s market share for gas and liquid fuel power plants was 13%.[7]
Wärtsilä’s biggest competitors in the marine market are MAN Diesel & Turbo, Caterpillar Inc. and Rolls-Royce plc. and in the energy market the biggest competitors are mainly gas turbine manufacturers like General Electric and Siemens.
Engines[edit]




Emma Mærsk is powered by a single low-speed Wärtsilä-Sulzer RT-flex96C engine.


Wärtsilä produces a wide range of low- and medium-speed diesel, gas and dual- and multi-fuel engines for marine propulsion, electricity generation on board ships and for land-based power stations. The engine models are generally identified by the cylinder bore diameter in centimeters, which as of 2012[update] range from 20 to 64 centimetres (7.9 to 25.2 inches) for medium-speed and 35 to 96 centimetres (14 to 38 inches) for low-speed engines. The smallest engine series, four-stroke medium-speed Wärtsilä 20, produces a modest 200 kW (270 hp) per cylinder while the largest, two-stroke low-speed Wärtsilä RT-flex96C, has a maximum output of 5,720 kW (7,670 hp) per cylinder. In addition, Wärtsilä also produces the most powerful medium-speed engine series in the world, Wärtsilä 64, with an output of 2,150 kW (2,880 hp) per cylinder. Depending on the engine model, Wärtsilä offers medium-speed engines in both straight and V configurations with the number of cylinders ranging from four (4L20) to twenty (20V46F), and low-speed engines in inline configuration with five (5RT-flex35) to fourteen cylinders (14RT-flex96C). The most powerful low-speed engine produced by Wärtsilä, a 14-cylinder version of the RT-flex96C, produces 80,080 kW (107,390 hp) and is used to propel the Mærsk E-class container ships.
Wärtsilä admitted manipulation of fuel consumption tests after an internal audit in 2016, with a few hundred engines affected.[8][9]

Marine market[edit]
The company services the merchant, offshore, cruise and ferry, naval, and special vessel markets, and the offering includes ship design, main and auxiliary engines, auxiliary power systems, electrical and automation packages, propulsors (such as water jets, thrusters, propellers, and nozzles), seals, bearings, gears, rudders, scrubbers, boilers, and all related services, such as repair, configuration, upgrading, training, maintenance, and environmental services.
Customers comprise both shipyards and ship owners. Wärtsilä Ship Power delivers everything from a single product to entire life cycle support, from initial building to operational use, of complex systems powering ships.
The environmental services range from reduction of air emissions, such as NOx, SOx, CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), to oily waste water treatment and other water solutions.
Wärtsilä Marine was an important Finnish shipbuilder 1935–1989, building e.g. cruiseferries and a large share of the icebreakers of the world. The shipyards are now owned by Meyer Werft.
Energy market[edit]
Wärtsilä is a provider of power plants in distributed and flexible power generation.[3]
The product portfolio consists of installations up to 600 MW, running on any gaseous or liquid fuels, such as Heavy fuel oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), different types and qualities of fuel oils, and renewable fuels like biogas and biofuel. In addition for the reliability of traditional base power generation, the engines have the capability to start and stop quickly and they maintain their efficiency in part load, which makes them well suited for peaking power production, smart grids, and emergency power systems. They can also utilize the combined cycle and cogeneration to produce steam or hot water for heating, and trigeneration for chilled water, which can be used for air conditioning.
Wärtsilä also provides products and services for grid stability management, utilization of gas flares, pumping applications (such as pump and compression drives), financial services, and project management services for projects concerning power generation.
In 2006, Wärtsilä delivered the Dr. Bird II, a 49.5 MW power barge, to accompany Dr. Bird I (delivered in 1995) in Jamaica. These barges produce in total 123.6 MW and are now owned by Jamaica Energy Partners.[4]
Services market[edit]
The wholly owned service network consist of over 5,000 field services professionals in more than 160 locations in over 70 countries globally, with the installed base of over 180 000 MW. The focus lies on optimising operations and lifecycle performance of land based power plants and ship installations.[5]
Wärtsilä provides services, spare parts, maintenance, upgrades, and fuel conversions solutions for medium and low-speed gas and diesel engines and other related systems, propulsion systems, electrical & automation systems boilers including environmental solutions regarding particulates and NOx, covering scrubber, selective catalytic reduction (SCRs), oxidation catalysts,[6] ballast water treatment systems and oily-water systems, long-term service agreements, training, condition monitoring, and condition-based maintenance and advisory services.
Market share and competitors[edit]
At the end of 2016, Wärtsilä’s market share in marine medium-speed main engines was 51% and in auxiliary engines 18%. Wärtsilä’s market share for gas and liquid fuel power plants was 13%.[7]
Wärtsilä’s biggest competitors in the marine market are MAN Diesel & Turbo, Caterpillar Inc. and Rolls-Royce plc. and in the energy market the biggest competitors are mainly gas turbine manufacturers like General Electric and Siemens.
Engines[edit]




Emma Mærsk is powered by a single low-speed Wärtsilä-Sulzer RT-flex96C engine.


Wärtsilä produces a wide range of low- and medium-speed diesel, gas and dual- and multi-fuel engines for marine propulsion, electricity generation on board ships and for land-based power stations. The engine models are generally identified by the cylinder bore diameter in centimeters, which as of 2012[update] range from 20 to 64 centimetres (7.9 to 25.2 inches) for medium-speed and 35 to 96 centimetres (14 to 38 inches) for low-speed engines. The smallest engine series, four-stroke medium-speed Wärtsilä 20, produces a modest 200 kW (270 hp) per cylinder while the largest, two-stroke low-speed Wärtsilä RT-flex96C, has a maximum output of 5,720 kW (7,670 hp) per cylinder. In addition, Wärtsilä also produces the most powerful medium-speed engine series in the world, Wärtsilä 64, with an output of 2,150 kW (2,880 hp) per cylinder. Depending on the engine model, Wärtsilä offers medium-speed engines in both straight and V configurations with the number of cylinders ranging from four (4L20) to twenty (20V46F), and low-speed engines in inline configuration with five (5RT-flex35) to fourteen cylinders (14RT-flex96C). The most powerful low-speed engine produced by Wärtsilä, a 14-cylinder version of the RT-flex96C, produces 80,080 kW (107,390 hp) and is used to propel the Mærsk E-class container ships.
Wärtsilä admitted manipulation of fuel consumption tests after an internal audit in 2016, with a few hundred engines affected.[8][9]
