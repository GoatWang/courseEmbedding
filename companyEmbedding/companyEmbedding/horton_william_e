Horton Plane Photos from Popular Science Magazine
Horton Aircraft Corporation, Santa Ana, California, was founded by
William Horton who dreamed of a wingless airplane. Instead of
a long high aspect ratio wing the fuselage was to create the lift and
tip plates which he called sealers were to tip losses that otherwise
plague such airfoils.Not truly wingless, but essentially a highly-modified Cessna UC-78 with a more airfoil-shaped fuselage than wing. Although this innovative protoype flew successfully, no backers were attracted, and the project was abandoned, with the plane eventually being deliberately burned.The following is part of the 24th Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1958Horton Aircraft Corporation. -- This registrant, a Nevada corporation, was
organized for the purpose of manufacturing and selling a so-called Horton
Wingless Airplane. The company filed two registration statements with the
Commission. The first statement, filed in 1955, covered a proposed offering of
500,000 shares of no par value common stock of which 400,000 shares were to
be offered by the registrant and 100,000 shares by the president, William E.
Horton, at $1.00 per share or the market price, whichever was higher. The other
registration statement, filed in 1956, covered 100,000 shares of common stock ofthe registrant held by Horton which was to be offered at $25.00 per share. A
consolidated hearing was held as to both registration statements and the
Commission issued a stop order suspending the effectiveness of both
statements.The Commission found the registration statements false and misleading in the
following material respects, among others.The representation, in the registration statements that Horton had assigned to
the registrant a patent with respect to the wingless airplane was materially
misleading in view of the fact that Horton had previously assigned all of his right,title and interest in his "invention" to another person. The description in theregistration statements of the Horton Wingless Airplane, the aeronautical
principles involved, and the coverage of the patent obtained by Horton, was also materially false and misleading. False and misleading statements were also
made with respect to the performance of Horton's model of the wingless plane.
The registration statements also contained false and misleading statements with respect to the use of the proceeds from the previous sale of unregistered
securities, the price of the securities being registered and the proposed use of
the proceeds therefrom.In addition, the Commission found that while the second registration statement
disclosed the entry of an injunction against registrant and Horton based on false
and misleading claims and the return of an indictment against Horton based on
fraud, registrant nevertheless omitted to disclose the nature of the false and
misleading statements and the fraud involved. Product #: newitem123797874Normal Price: $495.00Our Sales Price: $395.00 (You Save: 20%)Qty:

                                            Frances was a beautiful woman inside & out!! She will definitely be missed! I remember her teaching my son at the church, she just loved him!! I will never forget her!

                                            I will never forget the first day I met this wonderful woman. She invited me to sit beside her in a new church I had never been to before. She made me feel welcomed and loved from day one, To this day she still sits beside me in my thoughts, as I learn those things that were well versed and precious to her. To have known the love she exemplifies will forever strengthen me. My prayers for the family during this painful time. I will rejoice in my heart always for the great love and kindness that she freely gave to me and all those around her. Forever in my thoughts and memories, will be this great woman of character, beauty, and faith in God.

Most Flash content now HTML5 During a marathon session during Christmas, almost all of our Flash learning examples were converted to HTML5! Yay! We also converted Quick Instructional Design and Designing Tests, several of our recorded presentations.
We used iSpring Suite and Google's Swiffy for most of the conversions. A few drag-and-drop practices were reimagined in Excel and Numbers (really!!!)

New recorded presentations!!! Take a look at our newly added recorded presentations. Learn about quick instructional design, designing tests, and building topics and lessons.

Buzzword generator

Here is Gerry Cohen, arch-enemy of gobbledygook and crusader for clear writing. Back in the 70s he developed his Dial-A-Buzzword to highlight the inappropriate use of buzzwords in everyday speech.
We have taken Gerry’s idea and built a Web-based version. Have fun creating your own gobbledygook and nonsense.
Here is a picture Gerry’s original cellulose-based buzzword generator (1/5 scale). Click to picture to see an enlargement.
To learn about Gerry and his workshops on clear writing, drop him a line at  gcohen@mindspring.com
