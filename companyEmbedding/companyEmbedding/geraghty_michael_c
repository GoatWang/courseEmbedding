			Michael C. Geraghty		
Attorney General at State Of Alaska
MICHAEL C. GERAGHTY is Attorney General with State Of Alaska. Prior to his appointment as Alaska’s Attorney General, Michael C. Geraghty was a partner in the Anchorage law firm DeLisio Moran Geraghty & Zobel, PC.  Geraghty began working at the firm in 1979 with a practice devoted exclusively to litigation and appeals before state and federal courts.  He appeared as lead counsel in civil and criminal law matters, as well as proceedings before the OSHA Review Board, the Alaska State Commission on Human Rights, and the US Land Commission.  He has tried cases to verdict before juries across Alaska including Fairbanks, Anchorage, Barrow, Kenai, and Dillingham. Born and raised in Fairbanks, Alaska,  Geraghty's private practice focused on areas and industries reflecting Alaska's growth and history, including natural resources, oil and gas, and construction.  He has been involved in numerous complex cases, including class actions and anti-trust.  Geraghty has appeared  before  the Alaska Supreme Court in numerous cases involving sovereign immunity, administrative law, insurance and bad faith, attorney-client privilege, OSHA regulations, contract claims, shareholder disputes, products liability, and premises-landowner liability. In 2005 he was appointed by the Governor to serve Alaska as a Uniform Law Commissioner to the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.  In 2007 he was honored by his peers when he received the Alaska Bar Association Board of Governors Professionalism Award “in recognition of exemplary conduct in his association with the public, his colleagues and the legal community.”  Starting in 2007 Geraghty was recognized as one of The Best Lawyers in America in the specialties of Construction Law and Personal Injury Litigation.  He was recognized as a Superlawyer by Washington Law & Politics magazine starting in 2008.  In 2011 he was elected to the Fellows of the American Bar Foundation "in recognition of outstanding dedication to the welfare of the community, the traditions of the profession and the advancement of the objectives of the American Bar Association."
