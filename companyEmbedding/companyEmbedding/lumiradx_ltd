Better Outcomes.
Here. Now.


LumiraDx Helps achieve better health care, social care, and financial outcomes, affordably, in the here and now.


Healthcare organizations continue to wrestle with avoidable costs, preventable errors, and operational inefficiency, all while aspiring to improve their consumer experience, outcomes, and bottom line. Meanwhile our economies continue to be challenged by rising healthcare costs attributable to fragmented care and long term conditions, especially diabetes, heart failure, COPD, and their co-morbidities. Common approaches to address these challenges – rip-and-replace information systems, deploy siloed programs that hope to “manage” high-risk patients, use minimally interconnected systems to coordinate care – have proven exorbitantly expensive, unduly cumbersome, financially unsustainable, and eventually inadequate to achieve desired benefits.


LumiraDx Offers proven solutions to help achieve your health care transformation goals, practically and reliably, in the here and now.

Remarkably intuitive software that engages individuals and seamlessly blends into routine workflows of their health and social care providers 

An integrated yet modular and open cloud platform that joins up and extends existing clinical, financial, and workflow systems to enable, measure, and improve patient-centered care

Wirelessly connected diagnostic devices and wearables that encourage behavior change, enable proactive intervention
and reduce hospitalization, especially for individuals with long term conditions

Ground breaking care solutions for diabetes, heart failure, COPD and other conditions to help individuals change behavior, improve their health, and become self-determining


Our solutions improve clinical integration, especially across transitions of care, help move care into the community and home when appropriate, and better engage individuals with long term conditions to change behavior to become self-determining under the supervision of their health and social care providers, with the help of their friends and families.


LumiraDx’s clients universally deliver more integrated, more informed, patient-centered care that is safer, more efficient, and with demonstrably better outcomes.

“Our physician-owned regional health information exchange is the most robust I have ever seen. We can see all important clinical information collected and presented in a way we can quickly digest, and that is so much easier to use than other systems – regardless of source, including from doctors offices, hospitals, nursing homes, and pharmacies using many different IT systems. We can finally pick up care across transitions easily. And our patients can easily communicate with their doctors, look up their records, and manage their consents online. We now have the platform to enter into risk-bearing contracts. LumiraDx has not only made it possible, but also affordable!”

If you are not present for or unavailable prior to a disclosure (e.g., when we receive a telephone call from a family member or other caregiver), we may exercise our reasonable judgment to determine whether a disclosure is in your best interests.

LUMIRADX’S SOLUTIONS
Here. Now.


LumiraDx Believes that individuals deserve better, here, now. Their health care and social care records available to them and their care givers, joined up from all venues of care, structured to be usefully actionable. Their care givers not having to guess about their history, and losing precious time chasing it down. Having the knowledge, the data, the tools, and the motivation to become and remain activated to live healthy lifestyles. Being able to benefit from solutions that can help them reverse their diabetes or better manage their coagulation therapy or prevent debilitating heart failure. Enjoying a quality of  interaction with health care organizations that resembles the best other service industries have perfected.
LumiraDx believes that care givers and their organizations deserve better, here, now. To not struggle with information technology just to get their jobs done. To not have to hunt and peck for patient information across disjointed systems just to know what happened since the last visit or to find a patient’s current medications. To not have to spend the next many years with incredible cost and disruption ripping-and-replacing all their systems before information becomes available when and where it is needed, and then only in new silos. To become agile, constantly measuring, deriving new insights, driving better outcomes and an improved bottom line.
LumiraDx’s solutions help give individuals and their health and social care providers what they deserve, practically, in the here and now.




Remarkably Intuitive Software
LumiraDx invests heavily in the entire user experience, from signing up to the smallest details of reviewing a patient’s longitudinal history. We strive to be unobtrusive, blending into existing workflows, so our users can get their work done easily and effectively, without struggling with technology. And be enchanted along the way.
Engage allows individuals to view, manage, and share their own history from across all venues of care with their health and social care providers, be motivated to learn about and take charge of their conditions, and engage with their care team and social collaborative network to get the help they need.
Consult allows health and social care providers – physicians, nurses, care managers, social care workers – and their staff to view and manage patient records that are always joined up across all venues of care, from the doctor’s office to a patient’s home. It also helps identify patients at risk, enables users to collaborate with others in their care, and allows participants to see their progress on quality measures and outcomes.




Proven Cloud Platform
LumiraDx’s fifth generation solution brings together two decades of learnings to deliver the world’s leading cloud platform for patient-centered clinical integration and population health management. Its modular architecture allows it to co-exist with your current infrastructure, integrating it all rather than requiring you to rip-and-replace. And its scalability allows you to serve communities small and large, from a group of affiliated physicians to entire regional and national initiatives.
The platform connects with dozens of third-party systems – electronic health records, patient health records, patient administration and hospital information systems, pharmacies, laboratories, imaging centers, and ambulance services, social care systems, financial and claims processing services, diagnostics and personal monitoring devices. It builds data sharing networks and longitudinal records of patient history across all venues of care – from the home to the doctor’s office. And it communicates information – history, alerts, messages – across these systems to allow the right information to be available at the right place at the right time in the user’s system of choice.
The platform utilizes this information to identify and stratify patients at risk, produce disease registries, deliver actionable predictive evidence-based alerts and recommendations to appropriate providers and patients, and provides real-time reports and dashboards to evaluate performance and outcomes relative to quality measures. The solution’s big-data engine allows organizations to derive new insights from joined-up activity, clinical, financial, and operational data to help improve care delivery, the customer experience, and bottom line.




Wirelessly Connected Diagnostic Devices and Wearables
LumiraDx’s platform connects with a growing list of home and point-of-care diagnostic devices – glucose meters, weight scales, blood pressure cuffs, INR meters – and personal biometric devices that record real-time activity including continuous heart rate, surface temperature, posture, sleep, stress levels – to seamlessly integrate this data into individual longitudinal records. LumiraDx’s platform automatically and wirelessly collects this data, eliminating issues related to data entry and compliance.
Individuals benefit from knowing how they are doing in real time, which is proven to positively influence diet, exercise, sleep, stress, and adherence to care plans, and which helps create sustainable behavior change.
Their care givers benefit from knowing when help is needed to prevent adverse conditions or reinforce healthy behaviors, and to respond well in time when an individual is at risk to prevent higher acuity, hospitalization, or further complications.




Ground Breaking Care Solutions
LumiraDx’s care solutions – currently focused on type 2 diabetes, heart failure, COPD, and anticoagulation – help activate individuals living with long term conditions to improve their health and become self-determining under the supervision of their health and social care providers and with the help of friends and family.
Our care solutions bring together the best science – physiology and metabolic health, behavior change, medical evidence, process improvement – with LumiraDx’s software and connected diagnostic devices and wearables, unified via LumiraDx’s platform. We surround these with a seamless user experience and engaging content for both individuals and their care givers that is unprecedented in healthcare – from enrolling, to learning about condition and establishing baselines, to changing behaviors that affect physiology, and moving through program levels until individuals are free living, and then sustaining their changes and healthy habits for the long term.
LumiraDx’s care solutions are customizable to account for local preferences and clinical pathways, and leverage local health and social care providers where possible to achieve sustainable outcomes. When compared with siloed approaches to managing long term conditions, LumiraDx’s impact on individual well being, population health, and the bottom line is nothing short of ground breaking.

We are all aware of the issues facing healthcare today, ultimately leading to a disappointing consumer experience.

The Patient Comes First

Helen Figge03.2016 
 

It is becoming apparent to the consumer that the current models of health care delivery are still leading to poor health outcomes and disappointing experiences. Only through individual involvement into one’s own care, coupled with more accessible and less expensive care and with opportunity for home-based care monitoring will healthcare consumerism be accepted and utilized to the level necessary to … Read More







Knock Knock, Is the Patient There?

Helen Figge02.2016 
 

As healthcare continues to evolve with advances in technologies and increasingly effective pharmaceuticals, we continue the struggle to support a population that is living longer and getting older. Yet, to date, we have not truly grasped how to break the healthcare cycle of chronic diseases, which often times can be prevented – but yet adds significantly to the burden of … Read More

Healthcare Saviors “aka” The Disruptors

Helen Figge12.2015 
 

I read with dismay statistics from the federal government that the US spending on health care is now reaching $3 trillion dollars per year and could extend to 34 percent of our GDP by 2040. Contrast that with the magnitude of healthcare technology solutions in use today that can document, treat, track and support, to cure the various illnesses we … Read More







It’s all about the Patient

Helen Figge11.2015 
 

We are hearing more and more these days about “engaging the patient” or the “patient engagement experience”. This “represented group” is truly the key stakeholder who is impacted the most by our healthcare successes and failures. With “would be” technology solutions and healthcare outcomes companies flooding the market to entice the patient to “care” for their health, real industry leaders … Read More







What makes us sick?

Cybersecurity in Healthcare

Helen Figge10.2015 
 

The healthcare landscape is evolving, becoming more decentralized, creating a global connected environment with health information technologies and solutions at its core. We are also recognizing that technology solutions such as electronic health records and patient portals holding and transporting healthcare information, coupled together, are strategic assets for the healthcare environment. These assets potentially synergize with each other, creating a … Read More







Motivations for Better Health

Helen Figge09.2015 
 

In the September 9, 2015 issue of Modern Healthcare researchers found that rates of diabetes and obesity in the U.S. are leveling off but attempting to reverse these disease states will require positive lifestyle interventions. A study, commissioned by the American Medical Association, the American Diabetes Association and the YMCA of the USA found that about one in eight Americans … Read More
