About PDL
PDL > About PDL








PDL BioPharma (NASDAQ: PDLI) seeks to provide a significant return for its shareholders by acquiring and managing a portfolio of companies, products, royalty agreements and debt facilities in the biotech, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. In late 2012, PDL began providing alternative sources of capital through royalty monetization and debt facilities and in 2016, began making equity investments in commercial stage companies, the first being Noden Pharma DAC.
PDL evaluates its investments based on the quality of the income generating assets and potential returns on investment. PDL is currently focused on acquiring new income generating assets, with an emphasis on diversification via acquisition of additional specialty pharma products, or companies with a focus on under commercialized products. With this emphasis, PDL expects fewer future investments in royalty transactions and still fewer debt investments.
The company was formerly known as Protein Design Labs, Inc. and changed its name to PDL BioPharma, Inc. in 2006. PDL was founded in 1986 and is headquartered in Incline Village, Nevada. PDL pioneered the humanization of monoclonal antibodies and, by doing so, enabled the discovery of a new generation of targeted treatments for cancer and immunologic diseases for which it previously received significant royalty revenue.
