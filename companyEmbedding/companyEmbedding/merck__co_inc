Vaccines & Prescribing Information 










Vaccines are one of the greatest public health success stories in history, and Merck has played its part in that story.
Merck and its legacy companies have been working to discover and develop vaccines for more than a century. Our unique vaccines have helped prevent a number of diseases, including ones never thought preventable. Today, we remain dedicated to the complex business of researching and producing vaccines.

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), d.b.a. Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside the United States and Canada, is an American pharmaceutical company and one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.
The company was established in 1891 as the United States subsidiary of the German company Merck, which was founded in 1668 by the Merck family. Merck & Co. was nationalized by the US government during World War I and subsequently established as an independent American company in 1917. While it operates as Merck & Co. in North America, the original Merck based in Darmstadt holds the rights to the Merck name everywhere else. Merck & Co. is the world's seventh largest pharmaceutical company by market capitalization and revenue. Its headquarters is located in Kenilworth, New Jersey.[2]
Merck & Co. publishes The Merck Manuals, a series of medical reference books for physicians, nurses, and technicians. These include the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, the world's best-selling medical reference. The Merck Index, a compendium of chemical compounds, was formerly published by Merck & Co. before being acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2012.

Company history[edit]
Roots and early history[edit]
Main article: Merck Group




The Angel Pharmacy in Darmstadt, the beginning of the Merck company


Merck & Co. traces its origins to its original German parent company Merck, which was established by the Merck family in 1668 when Jacob Friedrich Merck purchased a drug store in Darmstadt. In the 19th century, the Merck company in Darmstadt evolved from a pharmacy to a major pharmaceutical company which pioneered the commercial manufacture of morphine.
In 1891, family member George (Georg) Merck emigrated to the United States and set up Merck & Co. in New York as the US subsidiary of the family company. Merck & Co. operated from 1891 to 1917 as the US subsidiary of the Merck Group.
Nationalization[edit]
The Merck Group's US subsidiary Merck & Co. was nationalized by the US government in 1917 and re-established as an independent American company. Until the end of World War II, the company was led by George W. Merck. Merck & Co. hold the trademark rights to the "Merck" name in North America, while its former parent company retains the rights in the rest of the world.[3][4]
In 1929, H. K. Mulford Company merged with Sharpe and Dohme, Inc. This company brought to the future Merck & Co, Inc vaccine technology, including immunization of cavalry horses in World War I and delivery of a diphtheria antitoxin in 1925.[5]
1950 to 2000[edit]
In 1953, Merck & Co. merged with Philadelphia-based Sharp & Dohme, Inc., founded by Alpheus Phineas Sharp and Carl Friedrich Louis Dohme in 1845, becoming the largest US drugmaker.[6][7] The merger combined Merck & Co.'s strength in scientific research and chemical manufacturing with Sharp & Dohme's sales and distribution system and its marketing expertise. The combined company kept the trade name Merck in the United States and Canada, and as Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside North America. In 1965 Merck & Co. acquired Charles E. Frosst Ltd. of Montreal, Canada (founded 1899) and created Merck-Frosst Canada, Inc., as its Canadian subsidiary and pharmaceutical research facility. Merck & Co. closed this facility in July 2010,[8] and the company was renamed Merck Canada in 2011.
The company was incorporated in New Jersey in 1970.[9] It has an operating subsidiary, KBI Inc., which was originally formed as a joint venture with AstraZeneca.[9] In November 1993, Merck & Co. completed a $6 billion purchase of Medco Containment Services Inc., one of the largest mail-order pharmacy and managed-care drug companies.[10] Merck & Co. spun Medco off ten years later, and on August 20, 2003, Medco Health Solutions began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] (In 2012, Medco merged with, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of, Express Scripts Holding Co.)[12]
2001 to present[edit]
In November 2009, Merck & Co. announced that it would merge with competitor Schering-Plough in a US$41 billion deal.[13][14][15][16] Although Merck & Co. was in reality acquiring Schering-Plough, the purchase was structured on paper as a "reverse merger", in which "Old" Merck & Co. was renamed Merck Sharpe & Dohme, and Schering-Plough renamed as "Merck & Co., Inc." so that it could, technically, continue as the surviving public corporation.[17] The maneuver was an attempt to preserve Schering-Plough's rights to market Remicade, which was ultimately decided by arbitration.[18] The merger was completed on 2009-11-04. As of 2015[update], Merck Sharp & Dohme remains a subsidiary of the Merck & Co. parent.[19]
As of December 2013, the US company had approximately 76,000 employees in 120 countries with 31 factories worldwide. It is one of the world's seven largest pharmaceutical companies. The Merck Company Foundation has distributed more than $480 million to educational and non-profit organizations since it was founded in 1957 (and $740 million in overall charitable distributions).[20][21] On December 7, 2012, the foundation announced that it was ending its donations to the Boy Scouts of America because of "its policy that excludes members on the basis of sexual orientation", which "directly conflicts with the Merck Foundation's giving guidelines."[22] In October 2013, Merck & Co. announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in an attempt to cut $2.5bn (£1.5bn) from its costs by 2015. The company's shares rose 2.35% to US$48.73 in New York trading after it announced the cuts. The new losses, combined with 7,500 job cuts announced in 2011 and 2012, amount in total to 20% of its workforce.[23]
In June 2014 Merck & Co. announced its acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals for approximately $3.85 billion.[24] In December 2014 Merck & Co. announced they would be spending $8.4 billion to buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals.[25] Later in the same month the company acquired the Swiss biotechnology company OncoEthix for up to $375 million dependent upon certain milestone achievements.[26]
In July 2015 Merck & Co. and Ablynx expanded their 18 month old immuno-oncology collaboration by four years, generating a potential $4.4 billion in milestone payments for the Abylnx.[27] Days later Merck & Co. announced it would spend $95 million up front on collaborating with cCAM Biotherapeutics and its lead candidate (an early-stage treatment similar to Keytruda). The company is due up to $510 million more, which is tied to clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Merck & Co. will bring in CM-24, an antibody designed to block the immune checkpoint CEACAM1.[28]
In January 2016 Merck & Co. announced two new partnerships; the first with Quartet Medicine and its small molecule pain treatments,[29] the second with Complix investigating intracellular cancer targets,[30] with both collaborations potentially generating up to $595 million and $280 million respectively. Days later the company announced it would acquire IOmet Pharma, with IOmet becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co. The acquisition includes IOmets IDO (indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1), TDO (Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase), and dual-acting inhibitors.[31] In June, the company announced its acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals for $1.25 billion, gaining Afferents lead compound - AF-219 - used to block P2X3 receptors.[32]
In April 2017, Merck Animal Health acquired Brazilian animal health product manufacturer, Vallée S.A..[33]
"Merck" name legal dispute[edit]
In 191 of 193 countries the original Merck company, the Merck Group of Darmstadt, owns the rights to the "Merck" name. In the United States and Canada the company trades under the name EMD (an abbreviation of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt). In the United States and Canada Merck & Co. holds the rights to the trademark "Merck", while in the rest of the world the company trades under the name MSD (an abbreviation of Merck, Sharp & Dohme).
In 2015 the Merck Group adopted a new logo and said it will be "much more aggressive" about protecting the brand of "the real Merck."[34] Merck of Darmstadt has initiated litigation against its former subsidiary, Merck & Co. (MSD) of Kenilworth, in several countries over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom.[35] The judge also held that MSD's use of "Merck" as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck's trade mark rights in the UK.[36]
In response to the ruling, MSD initiated counter-litigation in the United States in January 2016 by filing a federal lawsuit which accused its former parent company of "infringing on its trademark" through actions that included the increased usage of “Merck KGaA” and “MERCK” in branding in the US as well as on its social media presence. Further Merck & Co. has also accused the Merck Group of federal trademark dilution, unfair competition, false advertising, deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and cybersquatting. The case came to a head when a research scientist believed he was communicating with Merck & Co regarding a research grant in oncology, when in fact they were talking with the Merck Group. As a result, Merck & Co. asked the federal court to stop the Merck Group from using “Merck” on any products or marketing materials in the United States. As a direct result, Merck & Co is seeking “all monetary gains, profits, and advantages” made by the Merck Group and three-times the damage, plus additional punitive damages.[37]

On April 23, 2014, Robert M. Davis, formerly CFO of Baxter International, became Merck's CFO.[39] Davis replaced Peter N. Kellogg, who held the post from 2007.[39]
Products[edit]




Gardasil


Current[edit]
As of August 2014, Merck's research and development effort has led to the approval of more new drugs than that of any other company. Research performed at Merck has led to U.S. FDA approval of 63 New Molecular Entities.[40] In 2014, Merck's major products included[41]

Januvia (sitagliptin), a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In 2013, Januvia was the second largest selling diabetes drug worldwide,[42] with $4.0 billion in worldwide sales. Januvia is commonly paired with the generic anti-diabetes drug metformin. It has been popular due in part because unlike many other diabetes drugs, it causes little or no weight gain and is not associated with hypoglycemic episodes.[43][44] Merck also sells a single pill combination drug containing both Januvia and metformin under the trade name Janumet. There has been some concern that treatment with Januvia and other DPP-IV inhibitors may be associated with a modestly increased risk of pancreatitis.[45]
Zetia (ezetimibe) is a drug for hypercholesterolemia that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Sales in 2013 amounted to $2.7 billion. Zetia has been controversial, as it was initially approved based on its impact on serum cholesterol levels without proof that it actually impacted the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Results of the IMPROVE-IT study, however, introduced at the 2014 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, showed a statistically significant, albeit modest, benefit in adding Zetia to simvastatin for high-risk, post-acute-coronary-syndrome patients.[46]
Remicade (infliximab) is a monoclonal antibody directed toward the cytokine TNF-alpha and used for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and others. Remicade and other TNF-alpha inhibitors exhibit additive therapeutic effects with methotrexate and improve quality of life. Adverse effects include increased risk of infection and certain cancers.[47]
Gardasil (recombinant human papilloma virus vaccine) is a vaccine against multiple serotypes of human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer worldwide.[48]
Isentress (raltegravir) is a human immunodeficiency virus integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. It is the first anti-HIV compound having this mechanism of action.[49] Sales in 2013 were $1.8 billion. It is part of one of several first line treatment regimens recommended by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.[50]
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is an immune modulator for the treatment of cancer. On September 4, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as a breakthrough therapy for melanoma treatment.[51] In clinical trials, pembrolzumab provided partial tumor regression in about one quarter of patients, many of whom have not seen further progression of their disease in over 6 months of follow-up.[52]
Invanz (Ertapenem) is an injectable antibiotic, rights to which Merck has owned since 1999.[19] As of 2015. Merck was in a legal dispute with the Taiwanese company Savior Lifetec over their attempt to secure rights to sell a generic version of this drug in the United States.[19]

Other products[edit]

Mexsana, an antiseptic medicated powder

Legacy products[edit]
Vaccines[edit]
Medically important vaccines developed at Merck include the first mumps vaccine,[53] the first rubella vaccine,[54] and the first trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR vaccine),[55] each of which was developed by Merck scientist Maurice Hilleman. The incidence of rubella-associated birth defects fell from up to 10,000 per year in the U.S. to zero in the aftermath of the rubella vaccine's development.[56] Hilleman also developed the first Hepatitis B vaccine[57] and the first varicella vaccine, for chickenpox.[58]
Thiazide anti-hypertensives[edit]
The thiazide diuretics were discovered developed by scientists Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of Merck and Co. in the 1950s,[59] and led to the marketing of the first drug of this class, chlorothiazide, under the trade name Duiril in 1958.[60] The research leading to the discovery of chlorothiazide, leading to "the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension" was recognized by a special Public Health Award from the Lasker Foundation in 1975.[61]
First statin[edit]
Merck scientists also developed lovastatin, the first drug of the statin class.[62] It was marketed under the trade name Mevacor.
Antibacterials[edit]
Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were a ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.[63])[64] Although Merck's agreement with Rutgers gave it exclusive rights to streptomycin, at Wakman's request the company renegotiated the agreement, returning the rights to the university in exchange for a royalty. The university then set up non-exclusive licenses with seven companies to ensure a reliable supply of the antibiotic.[65]
In 1985 Merck received approval for imipenem, the first member of the carbapenem class of antibiotics. Antibiotics of the carbapenem class play an important role in treatment guidelines for certain hospital-acquired and multi-drug resistant infections.[66][67]
Vioxx[edit]
In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as rofecoxib), a Merck product for treating arthritis. Vioxx was designed as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. Such compounds were expected to cause less gastrointestinal bleeding than older anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, which were associated with 20,000 hospitalizations and 2000 deaths each year.[68][non-primary source needed] Vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history.[citation needed]
Thereafter, studies by Merck and by others found an increased risk of heart attack associated with Vioxx use when compared with naproxen. Merck adjusted the labeling of Vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002.[citation needed]
On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a clinical trial it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months.[69] On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on September 30. An analysis for the period 1999-2004, based on U.S. Medical Expenditure Survey data, reported that Vioxx was associated with 46,783 heart attacks, and along with the other popular COX-2 inhibitor Celebrex, an estimated 26,603 deaths from both.[70][non-primary source needed]
About 50,000 people sued Merck, claiming they or their family members had suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx.[71] In November 2007, Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle most of the pending Vioxx lawsuits.[72] The settlement required that claimants provide medical and pharmacy records confirming the occurrence of a heart attack, ischemic stroke, or sudden cardiac death; the receipt of at least 30 Vioxx pills within 60 days prior to the injury or death; and confirmation of Vioxx being used within 14 days of the Vioxx-related event.[73] The settlement was generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for Merck, considering that original estimates of Merck's liability reached between $10 billion and $25 billion.[72] In fact, as of mid-2008, when the plaintiff class had reached the threshold percentage required by Merck to go through with the settlement, plaintiffs had prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that had reached juries, all with relatively small awards.[71]
According to internal e-mail traffic released at a later lawsuit, Merck had a list of doctors critical of Vioxx to be "neutralized" or "discredited." "We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live," wrote an employee. A Stanford Medical School professor said that Merck was engaged in intimidation of researchers and infringement upon academic freedom.[74]
On May 20, 2008, Merck settled for $58 million with 30 states alleging that Merck engaged in deceptive marketing tactics to promote Vioxx.[75] All its new television pain-advertisements must be vetted by the Food and Drug Administration and changed or delayed upon request until 2018.[76]
Mectizan[edit]
In 1987, Merck & Co. began a program with UNICEF to donate its new drug Mectizan to "all that need it for as long as needed"[77] in an effort to combat Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, primarily in Africa. Up to that point, the World Health Organization had fought the disease through the use of insecticides to lower the population of its primary vector, the Black Fly.[78] However, when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease, the WHO agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies. Merck's involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world,[79] and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used as part of the Mectizan Donation Program that covers countries such as Yemen and in African countries.[80]
More than 700 million people have been treated since the inception of the program with 80 million people still undergoing treatment in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen. Blindness caused by onchocerciasis is decreasing and there are regions of Latin America and Africa that have been shown to have completely eliminated the disease altogether.[80]
Fosamax[edit]
Fosamax (alendronate) is a bisphosphonate used for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and for the prevention of skeletal problems in certain cancers. The American College of Clinical Endocrinology, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the North American Menopause Society and the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommend alendronate and certain other bisphosphonates as first line treatments for post-menopausal osteopotosis.[81][82][83][84] Long-term treatment with bisphosponates produces anti-fracture and bone mineral density effects that persist for 3–5 years after an initial 3–5 years of treatment.[85] Alendronate reduces the risk of hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures by 35-39%.[86][87]
In December 2013, Merck agreed to pay a total of $27.7 million to 1,200 plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit alleging that the company's osteoporosis drug had caused them to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw. Prior to the settlement, Merck had prevailed in 3 of 5 so-called bellwether trials. Approximately 4000 cases still await adjudiction or settlement as of August 2014.[88]
Society and culture[edit]
Patient assistance programs[edit]
Merck & Co. was one of the first American pharmaceutical companies to offer assistance to those unable to afford its medications, beginning a program in the 1950s.[89] Merck & Co. offers seven patient assistance programs, each with specific eligibility requirements.[90][91]
Mass retrenchment[edit]
As of January 2015, 30000 people have been forced to leave the company due to economic reasons and Singapore's branch has been the most affected.
Sham medical journal[edit]
From 2002 through 2005 the Australian affiliate of Merck paid Elsevier an undisclosed amount to publish eight issues of a medical journal, the Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine. Although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer-reviewed journal, without any indication that Merck had paid for it, the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to Merck. The misleading publication came to light in 2009 during a personal injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx; 9 of 29 articles in the journal's second issue referred positively to Vioxx.[92] In 2009, the CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Michael Hansen, admitted that the practice was "unacceptable".[93]
Hilleman Laboratories[edit]
Merck and the Wellcome trust jointly fund the Hilleman Laboratories, an India-based non-profit research organization dedicated to the development of low cost vaccines for use in developing countries. Current projects include the development of low cost, thermostable vaccines for the prevention of cholera, rotavirus, and meningitis.[94]
Medicaid overbilling[edit]
A US Justice Department fraud investigation began in 2000 when allegations were brought in two separate lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act.[95] They alleged that Merck failed to pay proper rebates to Medicaid and other health care programs and paid illegal remuneration to health care providers.[96] On February 7, 2008 Merck agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle charges that it routinely overbilled Medicaid for its most popular medicines. The settlement was one of the largest pharmaceutical settlements in history. The federal government received more than $360 million, plus 49 states and Washington, DC, received over $290 million. One whistleblower received a $68 million reward.[95][97] Merck made the settlement without an admission of liability or wrongdoing.[98]
Environmental record[edit]
Merck & Co. once used methylene chloride, an animal carcinogen on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's list of pollutants, as a solvent in some of its manufacturing processes. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced.[99]
In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for volatile organic compound (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by 680,000 lb (310,000 kg) a year.[100]

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), d.b.a. Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside the United States and Canada, is an American pharmaceutical company and one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.
The company was established in 1891 as the United States subsidiary of the German company Merck, which was founded in 1668 by the Merck family. Merck & Co. was nationalized by the US government during World War I and subsequently established as an independent American company in 1917. While it operates as Merck & Co. in North America, the original Merck based in Darmstadt holds the rights to the Merck name everywhere else. Merck & Co. is the world's seventh largest pharmaceutical company by market capitalization and revenue. Its headquarters is located in Kenilworth, New Jersey.[2]
Merck & Co. publishes The Merck Manuals, a series of medical reference books for physicians, nurses, and technicians. These include the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, the world's best-selling medical reference. The Merck Index, a compendium of chemical compounds, was formerly published by Merck & Co. before being acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2012.

Company history[edit]
Roots and early history[edit]
Main article: Merck Group




The Angel Pharmacy in Darmstadt, the beginning of the Merck company


Merck & Co. traces its origins to its original German parent company Merck, which was established by the Merck family in 1668 when Jacob Friedrich Merck purchased a drug store in Darmstadt. In the 19th century, the Merck company in Darmstadt evolved from a pharmacy to a major pharmaceutical company which pioneered the commercial manufacture of morphine.
In 1891, family member George (Georg) Merck emigrated to the United States and set up Merck & Co. in New York as the US subsidiary of the family company. Merck & Co. operated from 1891 to 1917 as the US subsidiary of the Merck Group.
Nationalization[edit]
The Merck Group's US subsidiary Merck & Co. was nationalized by the US government in 1917 and re-established as an independent American company. Until the end of World War II, the company was led by George W. Merck. Merck & Co. hold the trademark rights to the "Merck" name in North America, while its former parent company retains the rights in the rest of the world.[3][4]
In 1929, H. K. Mulford Company merged with Sharpe and Dohme, Inc. This company brought to the future Merck & Co, Inc vaccine technology, including immunization of cavalry horses in World War I and delivery of a diphtheria antitoxin in 1925.[5]
1950 to 2000[edit]
In 1953, Merck & Co. merged with Philadelphia-based Sharp & Dohme, Inc., founded by Alpheus Phineas Sharp and Carl Friedrich Louis Dohme in 1845, becoming the largest US drugmaker.[6][7] The merger combined Merck & Co.'s strength in scientific research and chemical manufacturing with Sharp & Dohme's sales and distribution system and its marketing expertise. The combined company kept the trade name Merck in the United States and Canada, and as Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside North America. In 1965 Merck & Co. acquired Charles E. Frosst Ltd. of Montreal, Canada (founded 1899) and created Merck-Frosst Canada, Inc., as its Canadian subsidiary and pharmaceutical research facility. Merck & Co. closed this facility in July 2010,[8] and the company was renamed Merck Canada in 2011.
The company was incorporated in New Jersey in 1970.[9] It has an operating subsidiary, KBI Inc., which was originally formed as a joint venture with AstraZeneca.[9] In November 1993, Merck & Co. completed a $6 billion purchase of Medco Containment Services Inc., one of the largest mail-order pharmacy and managed-care drug companies.[10] Merck & Co. spun Medco off ten years later, and on August 20, 2003, Medco Health Solutions began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] (In 2012, Medco merged with, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of, Express Scripts Holding Co.)[12]
2001 to present[edit]
In November 2009, Merck & Co. announced that it would merge with competitor Schering-Plough in a US$41 billion deal.[13][14][15][16] Although Merck & Co. was in reality acquiring Schering-Plough, the purchase was structured on paper as a "reverse merger", in which "Old" Merck & Co. was renamed Merck Sharpe & Dohme, and Schering-Plough renamed as "Merck & Co., Inc." so that it could, technically, continue as the surviving public corporation.[17] The maneuver was an attempt to preserve Schering-Plough's rights to market Remicade, which was ultimately decided by arbitration.[18] The merger was completed on 2009-11-04. As of 2015[update], Merck Sharp & Dohme remains a subsidiary of the Merck & Co. parent.[19]
As of December 2013, the US company had approximately 76,000 employees in 120 countries with 31 factories worldwide. It is one of the world's seven largest pharmaceutical companies. The Merck Company Foundation has distributed more than $480 million to educational and non-profit organizations since it was founded in 1957 (and $740 million in overall charitable distributions).[20][21] On December 7, 2012, the foundation announced that it was ending its donations to the Boy Scouts of America because of "its policy that excludes members on the basis of sexual orientation", which "directly conflicts with the Merck Foundation's giving guidelines."[22] In October 2013, Merck & Co. announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in an attempt to cut $2.5bn (£1.5bn) from its costs by 2015. The company's shares rose 2.35% to US$48.73 in New York trading after it announced the cuts. The new losses, combined with 7,500 job cuts announced in 2011 and 2012, amount in total to 20% of its workforce.[23]
In June 2014 Merck & Co. announced its acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals for approximately $3.85 billion.[24] In December 2014 Merck & Co. announced they would be spending $8.4 billion to buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals.[25] Later in the same month the company acquired the Swiss biotechnology company OncoEthix for up to $375 million dependent upon certain milestone achievements.[26]
In July 2015 Merck & Co. and Ablynx expanded their 18 month old immuno-oncology collaboration by four years, generating a potential $4.4 billion in milestone payments for the Abylnx.[27] Days later Merck & Co. announced it would spend $95 million up front on collaborating with cCAM Biotherapeutics and its lead candidate (an early-stage treatment similar to Keytruda). The company is due up to $510 million more, which is tied to clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Merck & Co. will bring in CM-24, an antibody designed to block the immune checkpoint CEACAM1.[28]
In January 2016 Merck & Co. announced two new partnerships; the first with Quartet Medicine and its small molecule pain treatments,[29] the second with Complix investigating intracellular cancer targets,[30] with both collaborations potentially generating up to $595 million and $280 million respectively. Days later the company announced it would acquire IOmet Pharma, with IOmet becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co. The acquisition includes IOmets IDO (indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1), TDO (Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase), and dual-acting inhibitors.[31] In June, the company announced its acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals for $1.25 billion, gaining Afferents lead compound - AF-219 - used to block P2X3 receptors.[32]
In April 2017, Merck Animal Health acquired Brazilian animal health product manufacturer, Vallée S.A..[33]
"Merck" name legal dispute[edit]
In 191 of 193 countries the original Merck company, the Merck Group of Darmstadt, owns the rights to the "Merck" name. In the United States and Canada the company trades under the name EMD (an abbreviation of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt). In the United States and Canada Merck & Co. holds the rights to the trademark "Merck", while in the rest of the world the company trades under the name MSD (an abbreviation of Merck, Sharp & Dohme).
In 2015 the Merck Group adopted a new logo and said it will be "much more aggressive" about protecting the brand of "the real Merck."[34] Merck of Darmstadt has initiated litigation against its former subsidiary, Merck & Co. (MSD) of Kenilworth, in several countries over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom.[35] The judge also held that MSD's use of "Merck" as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck's trade mark rights in the UK.[36]
In response to the ruling, MSD initiated counter-litigation in the United States in January 2016 by filing a federal lawsuit which accused its former parent company of "infringing on its trademark" through actions that included the increased usage of “Merck KGaA” and “MERCK” in branding in the US as well as on its social media presence. Further Merck & Co. has also accused the Merck Group of federal trademark dilution, unfair competition, false advertising, deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and cybersquatting. The case came to a head when a research scientist believed he was communicating with Merck & Co regarding a research grant in oncology, when in fact they were talking with the Merck Group. As a result, Merck & Co. asked the federal court to stop the Merck Group from using “Merck” on any products or marketing materials in the United States. As a direct result, Merck & Co is seeking “all monetary gains, profits, and advantages” made by the Merck Group and three-times the damage, plus additional punitive damages.[37]

On April 23, 2014, Robert M. Davis, formerly CFO of Baxter International, became Merck's CFO.[39] Davis replaced Peter N. Kellogg, who held the post from 2007.[39]
Products[edit]




Gardasil


Current[edit]
As of August 2014, Merck's research and development effort has led to the approval of more new drugs than that of any other company. Research performed at Merck has led to U.S. FDA approval of 63 New Molecular Entities.[40] In 2014, Merck's major products included[41]

Januvia (sitagliptin), a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In 2013, Januvia was the second largest selling diabetes drug worldwide,[42] with $4.0 billion in worldwide sales. Januvia is commonly paired with the generic anti-diabetes drug metformin. It has been popular due in part because unlike many other diabetes drugs, it causes little or no weight gain and is not associated with hypoglycemic episodes.[43][44] Merck also sells a single pill combination drug containing both Januvia and metformin under the trade name Janumet. There has been some concern that treatment with Januvia and other DPP-IV inhibitors may be associated with a modestly increased risk of pancreatitis.[45]
Zetia (ezetimibe) is a drug for hypercholesterolemia that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Sales in 2013 amounted to $2.7 billion. Zetia has been controversial, as it was initially approved based on its impact on serum cholesterol levels without proof that it actually impacted the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Results of the IMPROVE-IT study, however, introduced at the 2014 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, showed a statistically significant, albeit modest, benefit in adding Zetia to simvastatin for high-risk, post-acute-coronary-syndrome patients.[46]
Remicade (infliximab) is a monoclonal antibody directed toward the cytokine TNF-alpha and used for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and others. Remicade and other TNF-alpha inhibitors exhibit additive therapeutic effects with methotrexate and improve quality of life. Adverse effects include increased risk of infection and certain cancers.[47]
Gardasil (recombinant human papilloma virus vaccine) is a vaccine against multiple serotypes of human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer worldwide.[48]
Isentress (raltegravir) is a human immunodeficiency virus integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. It is the first anti-HIV compound having this mechanism of action.[49] Sales in 2013 were $1.8 billion. It is part of one of several first line treatment regimens recommended by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.[50]
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is an immune modulator for the treatment of cancer. On September 4, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as a breakthrough therapy for melanoma treatment.[51] In clinical trials, pembrolzumab provided partial tumor regression in about one quarter of patients, many of whom have not seen further progression of their disease in over 6 months of follow-up.[52]
Invanz (Ertapenem) is an injectable antibiotic, rights to which Merck has owned since 1999.[19] As of 2015. Merck was in a legal dispute with the Taiwanese company Savior Lifetec over their attempt to secure rights to sell a generic version of this drug in the United States.[19]

Other products[edit]

Mexsana, an antiseptic medicated powder

Legacy products[edit]
Vaccines[edit]
Medically important vaccines developed at Merck include the first mumps vaccine,[53] the first rubella vaccine,[54] and the first trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR vaccine),[55] each of which was developed by Merck scientist Maurice Hilleman. The incidence of rubella-associated birth defects fell from up to 10,000 per year in the U.S. to zero in the aftermath of the rubella vaccine's development.[56] Hilleman also developed the first Hepatitis B vaccine[57] and the first varicella vaccine, for chickenpox.[58]
Thiazide anti-hypertensives[edit]
The thiazide diuretics were discovered developed by scientists Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of Merck and Co. in the 1950s,[59] and led to the marketing of the first drug of this class, chlorothiazide, under the trade name Duiril in 1958.[60] The research leading to the discovery of chlorothiazide, leading to "the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension" was recognized by a special Public Health Award from the Lasker Foundation in 1975.[61]
First statin[edit]
Merck scientists also developed lovastatin, the first drug of the statin class.[62] It was marketed under the trade name Mevacor.
Antibacterials[edit]
Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were a ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.[63])[64] Although Merck's agreement with Rutgers gave it exclusive rights to streptomycin, at Wakman's request the company renegotiated the agreement, returning the rights to the university in exchange for a royalty. The university then set up non-exclusive licenses with seven companies to ensure a reliable supply of the antibiotic.[65]
In 1985 Merck received approval for imipenem, the first member of the carbapenem class of antibiotics. Antibiotics of the carbapenem class play an important role in treatment guidelines for certain hospital-acquired and multi-drug resistant infections.[66][67]
Vioxx[edit]
In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as rofecoxib), a Merck product for treating arthritis. Vioxx was designed as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. Such compounds were expected to cause less gastrointestinal bleeding than older anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, which were associated with 20,000 hospitalizations and 2000 deaths each year.[68][non-primary source needed] Vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history.[citation needed]
Thereafter, studies by Merck and by others found an increased risk of heart attack associated with Vioxx use when compared with naproxen. Merck adjusted the labeling of Vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002.[citation needed]
On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a clinical trial it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months.[69] On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on September 30. An analysis for the period 1999-2004, based on U.S. Medical Expenditure Survey data, reported that Vioxx was associated with 46,783 heart attacks, and along with the other popular COX-2 inhibitor Celebrex, an estimated 26,603 deaths from both.[70][non-primary source needed]
About 50,000 people sued Merck, claiming they or their family members had suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx.[71] In November 2007, Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle most of the pending Vioxx lawsuits.[72] The settlement required that claimants provide medical and pharmacy records confirming the occurrence of a heart attack, ischemic stroke, or sudden cardiac death; the receipt of at least 30 Vioxx pills within 60 days prior to the injury or death; and confirmation of Vioxx being used within 14 days of the Vioxx-related event.[73] The settlement was generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for Merck, considering that original estimates of Merck's liability reached between $10 billion and $25 billion.[72] In fact, as of mid-2008, when the plaintiff class had reached the threshold percentage required by Merck to go through with the settlement, plaintiffs had prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that had reached juries, all with relatively small awards.[71]
According to internal e-mail traffic released at a later lawsuit, Merck had a list of doctors critical of Vioxx to be "neutralized" or "discredited." "We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live," wrote an employee. A Stanford Medical School professor said that Merck was engaged in intimidation of researchers and infringement upon academic freedom.[74]
On May 20, 2008, Merck settled for $58 million with 30 states alleging that Merck engaged in deceptive marketing tactics to promote Vioxx.[75] All its new television pain-advertisements must be vetted by the Food and Drug Administration and changed or delayed upon request until 2018.[76]
Mectizan[edit]
In 1987, Merck & Co. began a program with UNICEF to donate its new drug Mectizan to "all that need it for as long as needed"[77] in an effort to combat Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, primarily in Africa. Up to that point, the World Health Organization had fought the disease through the use of insecticides to lower the population of its primary vector, the Black Fly.[78] However, when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease, the WHO agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies. Merck's involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world,[79] and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used as part of the Mectizan Donation Program that covers countries such as Yemen and in African countries.[80]
More than 700 million people have been treated since the inception of the program with 80 million people still undergoing treatment in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen. Blindness caused by onchocerciasis is decreasing and there are regions of Latin America and Africa that have been shown to have completely eliminated the disease altogether.[80]
Fosamax[edit]
Fosamax (alendronate) is a bisphosphonate used for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and for the prevention of skeletal problems in certain cancers. The American College of Clinical Endocrinology, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the North American Menopause Society and the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommend alendronate and certain other bisphosphonates as first line treatments for post-menopausal osteopotosis.[81][82][83][84] Long-term treatment with bisphosponates produces anti-fracture and bone mineral density effects that persist for 3–5 years after an initial 3–5 years of treatment.[85] Alendronate reduces the risk of hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures by 35-39%.[86][87]
In December 2013, Merck agreed to pay a total of $27.7 million to 1,200 plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit alleging that the company's osteoporosis drug had caused them to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw. Prior to the settlement, Merck had prevailed in 3 of 5 so-called bellwether trials. Approximately 4000 cases still await adjudiction or settlement as of August 2014.[88]
Society and culture[edit]
Patient assistance programs[edit]
Merck & Co. was one of the first American pharmaceutical companies to offer assistance to those unable to afford its medications, beginning a program in the 1950s.[89] Merck & Co. offers seven patient assistance programs, each with specific eligibility requirements.[90][91]
Mass retrenchment[edit]
As of January 2015, 30000 people have been forced to leave the company due to economic reasons and Singapore's branch has been the most affected.
Sham medical journal[edit]
From 2002 through 2005 the Australian affiliate of Merck paid Elsevier an undisclosed amount to publish eight issues of a medical journal, the Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine. Although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer-reviewed journal, without any indication that Merck had paid for it, the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to Merck. The misleading publication came to light in 2009 during a personal injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx; 9 of 29 articles in the journal's second issue referred positively to Vioxx.[92] In 2009, the CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Michael Hansen, admitted that the practice was "unacceptable".[93]
Hilleman Laboratories[edit]
Merck and the Wellcome trust jointly fund the Hilleman Laboratories, an India-based non-profit research organization dedicated to the development of low cost vaccines for use in developing countries. Current projects include the development of low cost, thermostable vaccines for the prevention of cholera, rotavirus, and meningitis.[94]
Medicaid overbilling[edit]
A US Justice Department fraud investigation began in 2000 when allegations were brought in two separate lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act.[95] They alleged that Merck failed to pay proper rebates to Medicaid and other health care programs and paid illegal remuneration to health care providers.[96] On February 7, 2008 Merck agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle charges that it routinely overbilled Medicaid for its most popular medicines. The settlement was one of the largest pharmaceutical settlements in history. The federal government received more than $360 million, plus 49 states and Washington, DC, received over $290 million. One whistleblower received a $68 million reward.[95][97] Merck made the settlement without an admission of liability or wrongdoing.[98]
Environmental record[edit]
Merck & Co. once used methylene chloride, an animal carcinogen on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's list of pollutants, as a solvent in some of its manufacturing processes. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced.[99]
In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for volatile organic compound (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by 680,000 lb (310,000 kg) a year.[100]

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), d.b.a. Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside the United States and Canada, is an American pharmaceutical company and one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.
The company was established in 1891 as the United States subsidiary of the German company Merck, which was founded in 1668 by the Merck family. Merck & Co. was nationalized by the US government during World War I and subsequently established as an independent American company in 1917. While it operates as Merck & Co. in North America, the original Merck based in Darmstadt holds the rights to the Merck name everywhere else. Merck & Co. is the world's seventh largest pharmaceutical company by market capitalization and revenue. Its headquarters is located in Kenilworth, New Jersey.[2]
Merck & Co. publishes The Merck Manuals, a series of medical reference books for physicians, nurses, and technicians. These include the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, the world's best-selling medical reference. The Merck Index, a compendium of chemical compounds, was formerly published by Merck & Co. before being acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2012.

Company history[edit]
Roots and early history[edit]
Main article: Merck Group




The Angel Pharmacy in Darmstadt, the beginning of the Merck company


Merck & Co. traces its origins to its original German parent company Merck, which was established by the Merck family in 1668 when Jacob Friedrich Merck purchased a drug store in Darmstadt. In the 19th century, the Merck company in Darmstadt evolved from a pharmacy to a major pharmaceutical company which pioneered the commercial manufacture of morphine.
In 1891, family member George (Georg) Merck emigrated to the United States and set up Merck & Co. in New York as the US subsidiary of the family company. Merck & Co. operated from 1891 to 1917 as the US subsidiary of the Merck Group.
Nationalization[edit]
The Merck Group's US subsidiary Merck & Co. was nationalized by the US government in 1917 and re-established as an independent American company. Until the end of World War II, the company was led by George W. Merck. Merck & Co. hold the trademark rights to the "Merck" name in North America, while its former parent company retains the rights in the rest of the world.[3][4]
In 1929, H. K. Mulford Company merged with Sharpe and Dohme, Inc. This company brought to the future Merck & Co, Inc vaccine technology, including immunization of cavalry horses in World War I and delivery of a diphtheria antitoxin in 1925.[5]
1950 to 2000[edit]
In 1953, Merck & Co. merged with Philadelphia-based Sharp & Dohme, Inc., founded by Alpheus Phineas Sharp and Carl Friedrich Louis Dohme in 1845, becoming the largest US drugmaker.[6][7] The merger combined Merck & Co.'s strength in scientific research and chemical manufacturing with Sharp & Dohme's sales and distribution system and its marketing expertise. The combined company kept the trade name Merck in the United States and Canada, and as Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside North America. In 1965 Merck & Co. acquired Charles E. Frosst Ltd. of Montreal, Canada (founded 1899) and created Merck-Frosst Canada, Inc., as its Canadian subsidiary and pharmaceutical research facility. Merck & Co. closed this facility in July 2010,[8] and the company was renamed Merck Canada in 2011.
The company was incorporated in New Jersey in 1970.[9] It has an operating subsidiary, KBI Inc., which was originally formed as a joint venture with AstraZeneca.[9] In November 1993, Merck & Co. completed a $6 billion purchase of Medco Containment Services Inc., one of the largest mail-order pharmacy and managed-care drug companies.[10] Merck & Co. spun Medco off ten years later, and on August 20, 2003, Medco Health Solutions began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] (In 2012, Medco merged with, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of, Express Scripts Holding Co.)[12]
2001 to present[edit]
In November 2009, Merck & Co. announced that it would merge with competitor Schering-Plough in a US$41 billion deal.[13][14][15][16] Although Merck & Co. was in reality acquiring Schering-Plough, the purchase was structured on paper as a "reverse merger", in which "Old" Merck & Co. was renamed Merck Sharpe & Dohme, and Schering-Plough renamed as "Merck & Co., Inc." so that it could, technically, continue as the surviving public corporation.[17] The maneuver was an attempt to preserve Schering-Plough's rights to market Remicade, which was ultimately decided by arbitration.[18] The merger was completed on 2009-11-04. As of 2015[update], Merck Sharp & Dohme remains a subsidiary of the Merck & Co. parent.[19]
As of December 2013, the US company had approximately 76,000 employees in 120 countries with 31 factories worldwide. It is one of the world's seven largest pharmaceutical companies. The Merck Company Foundation has distributed more than $480 million to educational and non-profit organizations since it was founded in 1957 (and $740 million in overall charitable distributions).[20][21] On December 7, 2012, the foundation announced that it was ending its donations to the Boy Scouts of America because of "its policy that excludes members on the basis of sexual orientation", which "directly conflicts with the Merck Foundation's giving guidelines."[22] In October 2013, Merck & Co. announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in an attempt to cut $2.5bn (£1.5bn) from its costs by 2015. The company's shares rose 2.35% to US$48.73 in New York trading after it announced the cuts. The new losses, combined with 7,500 job cuts announced in 2011 and 2012, amount in total to 20% of its workforce.[23]
In June 2014 Merck & Co. announced its acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals for approximately $3.85 billion.[24] In December 2014 Merck & Co. announced they would be spending $8.4 billion to buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals.[25] Later in the same month the company acquired the Swiss biotechnology company OncoEthix for up to $375 million dependent upon certain milestone achievements.[26]
In July 2015 Merck & Co. and Ablynx expanded their 18 month old immuno-oncology collaboration by four years, generating a potential $4.4 billion in milestone payments for the Abylnx.[27] Days later Merck & Co. announced it would spend $95 million up front on collaborating with cCAM Biotherapeutics and its lead candidate (an early-stage treatment similar to Keytruda). The company is due up to $510 million more, which is tied to clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Merck & Co. will bring in CM-24, an antibody designed to block the immune checkpoint CEACAM1.[28]
In January 2016 Merck & Co. announced two new partnerships; the first with Quartet Medicine and its small molecule pain treatments,[29] the second with Complix investigating intracellular cancer targets,[30] with both collaborations potentially generating up to $595 million and $280 million respectively. Days later the company announced it would acquire IOmet Pharma, with IOmet becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co. The acquisition includes IOmets IDO (indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1), TDO (Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase), and dual-acting inhibitors.[31] In June, the company announced its acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals for $1.25 billion, gaining Afferents lead compound - AF-219 - used to block P2X3 receptors.[32]
In April 2017, Merck Animal Health acquired Brazilian animal health product manufacturer, Vallée S.A..[33]
"Merck" name legal dispute[edit]
In 191 of 193 countries the original Merck company, the Merck Group of Darmstadt, owns the rights to the "Merck" name. In the United States and Canada the company trades under the name EMD (an abbreviation of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt). In the United States and Canada Merck & Co. holds the rights to the trademark "Merck", while in the rest of the world the company trades under the name MSD (an abbreviation of Merck, Sharp & Dohme).
In 2015 the Merck Group adopted a new logo and said it will be "much more aggressive" about protecting the brand of "the real Merck."[34] Merck of Darmstadt has initiated litigation against its former subsidiary, Merck & Co. (MSD) of Kenilworth, in several countries over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom.[35] The judge also held that MSD's use of "Merck" as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck's trade mark rights in the UK.[36]
In response to the ruling, MSD initiated counter-litigation in the United States in January 2016 by filing a federal lawsuit which accused its former parent company of "infringing on its trademark" through actions that included the increased usage of “Merck KGaA” and “MERCK” in branding in the US as well as on its social media presence. Further Merck & Co. has also accused the Merck Group of federal trademark dilution, unfair competition, false advertising, deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and cybersquatting. The case came to a head when a research scientist believed he was communicating with Merck & Co regarding a research grant in oncology, when in fact they were talking with the Merck Group. As a result, Merck & Co. asked the federal court to stop the Merck Group from using “Merck” on any products or marketing materials in the United States. As a direct result, Merck & Co is seeking “all monetary gains, profits, and advantages” made by the Merck Group and three-times the damage, plus additional punitive damages.[37]

On April 23, 2014, Robert M. Davis, formerly CFO of Baxter International, became Merck's CFO.[39] Davis replaced Peter N. Kellogg, who held the post from 2007.[39]
Products[edit]




Gardasil


Current[edit]
As of August 2014, Merck's research and development effort has led to the approval of more new drugs than that of any other company. Research performed at Merck has led to U.S. FDA approval of 63 New Molecular Entities.[40] In 2014, Merck's major products included[41]

Januvia (sitagliptin), a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In 2013, Januvia was the second largest selling diabetes drug worldwide,[42] with $4.0 billion in worldwide sales. Januvia is commonly paired with the generic anti-diabetes drug metformin. It has been popular due in part because unlike many other diabetes drugs, it causes little or no weight gain and is not associated with hypoglycemic episodes.[43][44] Merck also sells a single pill combination drug containing both Januvia and metformin under the trade name Janumet. There has been some concern that treatment with Januvia and other DPP-IV inhibitors may be associated with a modestly increased risk of pancreatitis.[45]
Zetia (ezetimibe) is a drug for hypercholesterolemia that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Sales in 2013 amounted to $2.7 billion. Zetia has been controversial, as it was initially approved based on its impact on serum cholesterol levels without proof that it actually impacted the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Results of the IMPROVE-IT study, however, introduced at the 2014 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, showed a statistically significant, albeit modest, benefit in adding Zetia to simvastatin for high-risk, post-acute-coronary-syndrome patients.[46]
Remicade (infliximab) is a monoclonal antibody directed toward the cytokine TNF-alpha and used for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and others. Remicade and other TNF-alpha inhibitors exhibit additive therapeutic effects with methotrexate and improve quality of life. Adverse effects include increased risk of infection and certain cancers.[47]
Gardasil (recombinant human papilloma virus vaccine) is a vaccine against multiple serotypes of human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer worldwide.[48]
Isentress (raltegravir) is a human immunodeficiency virus integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. It is the first anti-HIV compound having this mechanism of action.[49] Sales in 2013 were $1.8 billion. It is part of one of several first line treatment regimens recommended by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.[50]
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is an immune modulator for the treatment of cancer. On September 4, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as a breakthrough therapy for melanoma treatment.[51] In clinical trials, pembrolzumab provided partial tumor regression in about one quarter of patients, many of whom have not seen further progression of their disease in over 6 months of follow-up.[52]
Invanz (Ertapenem) is an injectable antibiotic, rights to which Merck has owned since 1999.[19] As of 2015. Merck was in a legal dispute with the Taiwanese company Savior Lifetec over their attempt to secure rights to sell a generic version of this drug in the United States.[19]

Other products[edit]

Mexsana, an antiseptic medicated powder

Legacy products[edit]
Vaccines[edit]
Medically important vaccines developed at Merck include the first mumps vaccine,[53] the first rubella vaccine,[54] and the first trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR vaccine),[55] each of which was developed by Merck scientist Maurice Hilleman. The incidence of rubella-associated birth defects fell from up to 10,000 per year in the U.S. to zero in the aftermath of the rubella vaccine's development.[56] Hilleman also developed the first Hepatitis B vaccine[57] and the first varicella vaccine, for chickenpox.[58]
Thiazide anti-hypertensives[edit]
The thiazide diuretics were discovered developed by scientists Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of Merck and Co. in the 1950s,[59] and led to the marketing of the first drug of this class, chlorothiazide, under the trade name Duiril in 1958.[60] The research leading to the discovery of chlorothiazide, leading to "the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension" was recognized by a special Public Health Award from the Lasker Foundation in 1975.[61]
First statin[edit]
Merck scientists also developed lovastatin, the first drug of the statin class.[62] It was marketed under the trade name Mevacor.
Antibacterials[edit]
Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were a ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.[63])[64] Although Merck's agreement with Rutgers gave it exclusive rights to streptomycin, at Wakman's request the company renegotiated the agreement, returning the rights to the university in exchange for a royalty. The university then set up non-exclusive licenses with seven companies to ensure a reliable supply of the antibiotic.[65]
In 1985 Merck received approval for imipenem, the first member of the carbapenem class of antibiotics. Antibiotics of the carbapenem class play an important role in treatment guidelines for certain hospital-acquired and multi-drug resistant infections.[66][67]
Vioxx[edit]
In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as rofecoxib), a Merck product for treating arthritis. Vioxx was designed as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. Such compounds were expected to cause less gastrointestinal bleeding than older anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, which were associated with 20,000 hospitalizations and 2000 deaths each year.[68][non-primary source needed] Vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history.[citation needed]
Thereafter, studies by Merck and by others found an increased risk of heart attack associated with Vioxx use when compared with naproxen. Merck adjusted the labeling of Vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002.[citation needed]
On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a clinical trial it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months.[69] On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on September 30. An analysis for the period 1999-2004, based on U.S. Medical Expenditure Survey data, reported that Vioxx was associated with 46,783 heart attacks, and along with the other popular COX-2 inhibitor Celebrex, an estimated 26,603 deaths from both.[70][non-primary source needed]
About 50,000 people sued Merck, claiming they or their family members had suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx.[71] In November 2007, Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle most of the pending Vioxx lawsuits.[72] The settlement required that claimants provide medical and pharmacy records confirming the occurrence of a heart attack, ischemic stroke, or sudden cardiac death; the receipt of at least 30 Vioxx pills within 60 days prior to the injury or death; and confirmation of Vioxx being used within 14 days of the Vioxx-related event.[73] The settlement was generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for Merck, considering that original estimates of Merck's liability reached between $10 billion and $25 billion.[72] In fact, as of mid-2008, when the plaintiff class had reached the threshold percentage required by Merck to go through with the settlement, plaintiffs had prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that had reached juries, all with relatively small awards.[71]
According to internal e-mail traffic released at a later lawsuit, Merck had a list of doctors critical of Vioxx to be "neutralized" or "discredited." "We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live," wrote an employee. A Stanford Medical School professor said that Merck was engaged in intimidation of researchers and infringement upon academic freedom.[74]
On May 20, 2008, Merck settled for $58 million with 30 states alleging that Merck engaged in deceptive marketing tactics to promote Vioxx.[75] All its new television pain-advertisements must be vetted by the Food and Drug Administration and changed or delayed upon request until 2018.[76]
Mectizan[edit]
In 1987, Merck & Co. began a program with UNICEF to donate its new drug Mectizan to "all that need it for as long as needed"[77] in an effort to combat Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, primarily in Africa. Up to that point, the World Health Organization had fought the disease through the use of insecticides to lower the population of its primary vector, the Black Fly.[78] However, when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease, the WHO agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies. Merck's involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world,[79] and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used as part of the Mectizan Donation Program that covers countries such as Yemen and in African countries.[80]
More than 700 million people have been treated since the inception of the program with 80 million people still undergoing treatment in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen. Blindness caused by onchocerciasis is decreasing and there are regions of Latin America and Africa that have been shown to have completely eliminated the disease altogether.[80]
Fosamax[edit]
Fosamax (alendronate) is a bisphosphonate used for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and for the prevention of skeletal problems in certain cancers. The American College of Clinical Endocrinology, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the North American Menopause Society and the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommend alendronate and certain other bisphosphonates as first line treatments for post-menopausal osteopotosis.[81][82][83][84] Long-term treatment with bisphosponates produces anti-fracture and bone mineral density effects that persist for 3–5 years after an initial 3–5 years of treatment.[85] Alendronate reduces the risk of hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures by 35-39%.[86][87]
In December 2013, Merck agreed to pay a total of $27.7 million to 1,200 plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit alleging that the company's osteoporosis drug had caused them to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw. Prior to the settlement, Merck had prevailed in 3 of 5 so-called bellwether trials. Approximately 4000 cases still await adjudiction or settlement as of August 2014.[88]
Society and culture[edit]
Patient assistance programs[edit]
Merck & Co. was one of the first American pharmaceutical companies to offer assistance to those unable to afford its medications, beginning a program in the 1950s.[89] Merck & Co. offers seven patient assistance programs, each with specific eligibility requirements.[90][91]
Mass retrenchment[edit]
As of January 2015, 30000 people have been forced to leave the company due to economic reasons and Singapore's branch has been the most affected.
Sham medical journal[edit]
From 2002 through 2005 the Australian affiliate of Merck paid Elsevier an undisclosed amount to publish eight issues of a medical journal, the Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine. Although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer-reviewed journal, without any indication that Merck had paid for it, the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to Merck. The misleading publication came to light in 2009 during a personal injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx; 9 of 29 articles in the journal's second issue referred positively to Vioxx.[92] In 2009, the CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Michael Hansen, admitted that the practice was "unacceptable".[93]
Hilleman Laboratories[edit]
Merck and the Wellcome trust jointly fund the Hilleman Laboratories, an India-based non-profit research organization dedicated to the development of low cost vaccines for use in developing countries. Current projects include the development of low cost, thermostable vaccines for the prevention of cholera, rotavirus, and meningitis.[94]
Medicaid overbilling[edit]
A US Justice Department fraud investigation began in 2000 when allegations were brought in two separate lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act.[95] They alleged that Merck failed to pay proper rebates to Medicaid and other health care programs and paid illegal remuneration to health care providers.[96] On February 7, 2008 Merck agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle charges that it routinely overbilled Medicaid for its most popular medicines. The settlement was one of the largest pharmaceutical settlements in history. The federal government received more than $360 million, plus 49 states and Washington, DC, received over $290 million. One whistleblower received a $68 million reward.[95][97] Merck made the settlement without an admission of liability or wrongdoing.[98]
Environmental record[edit]
Merck & Co. once used methylene chloride, an animal carcinogen on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's list of pollutants, as a solvent in some of its manufacturing processes. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced.[99]
In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for volatile organic compound (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by 680,000 lb (310,000 kg) a year.[100]

Merck & Co. publishes The Merck Manuals, a series of medical reference books for physicians, nurses, and technicians.

Company history[edit]
Roots and early history[edit]
Main article: Merck Group




The Angel Pharmacy in Darmstadt, the beginning of the Merck company


Merck & Co. traces its origins to its original German parent company Merck, which was established by the Merck family in 1668 when Jacob Friedrich Merck purchased a drug store in Darmstadt. In the 19th century, the Merck company in Darmstadt evolved from a pharmacy to a major pharmaceutical company which pioneered the commercial manufacture of morphine.
In 1891, family member George (Georg) Merck emigrated to the United States and set up Merck & Co. in New York as the US subsidiary of the family company. Merck & Co. operated from 1891 to 1917 as the US subsidiary of the Merck Group.
Nationalization[edit]
The Merck Group's US subsidiary Merck & Co. was nationalized by the US government in 1917 and re-established as an independent American company. Until the end of World War II, the company was led by George W. Merck. Merck & Co. hold the trademark rights to the "Merck" name in North America, while its former parent company retains the rights in the rest of the world.[3][4]
In 1929, H. K. Mulford Company merged with Sharpe and Dohme, Inc. This company brought to the future Merck & Co, Inc vaccine technology, including immunization of cavalry horses in World War I and delivery of a diphtheria antitoxin in 1925.[5]
1950 to 2000[edit]
In 1953, Merck & Co. merged with Philadelphia-based Sharp & Dohme, Inc., founded by Alpheus Phineas Sharp and Carl Friedrich Louis Dohme in 1845, becoming the largest US drugmaker.[6][7] The merger combined Merck & Co.'s strength in scientific research and chemical manufacturing with Sharp & Dohme's sales and distribution system and its marketing expertise. The combined company kept the trade name Merck in the United States and Canada, and as Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside North America. In 1965 Merck & Co. acquired Charles E. Frosst Ltd. of Montreal, Canada (founded 1899) and created Merck-Frosst Canada, Inc., as its Canadian subsidiary and pharmaceutical research facility. Merck & Co. closed this facility in July 2010,[8] and the company was renamed Merck Canada in 2011.
The company was incorporated in New Jersey in 1970.[9] It has an operating subsidiary, KBI Inc., which was originally formed as a joint venture with AstraZeneca.[9] In November 1993, Merck & Co. completed a $6 billion purchase of Medco Containment Services Inc., one of the largest mail-order pharmacy and managed-care drug companies.[10] Merck & Co. spun Medco off ten years later, and on August 20, 2003, Medco Health Solutions began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] (In 2012, Medco merged with, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of, Express Scripts Holding Co.)[12]
2001 to present[edit]
In November 2009, Merck & Co. announced that it would merge with competitor Schering-Plough in a US$41 billion deal.[13][14][15][16] Although Merck & Co. was in reality acquiring Schering-Plough, the purchase was structured on paper as a "reverse merger", in which "Old" Merck & Co. was renamed Merck Sharpe & Dohme, and Schering-Plough renamed as "Merck & Co., Inc." so that it could, technically, continue as the surviving public corporation.[17] The maneuver was an attempt to preserve Schering-Plough's rights to market Remicade, which was ultimately decided by arbitration.[18] The merger was completed on 2009-11-04. As of 2015[update], Merck Sharp & Dohme remains a subsidiary of the Merck & Co. parent.[19]
As of December 2013, the US company had approximately 76,000 employees in 120 countries with 31 factories worldwide. It is one of the world's seven largest pharmaceutical companies. The Merck Company Foundation has distributed more than $480 million to educational and non-profit organizations since it was founded in 1957 (and $740 million in overall charitable distributions).[20][21] On December 7, 2012, the foundation announced that it was ending its donations to the Boy Scouts of America because of "its policy that excludes members on the basis of sexual orientation", which "directly conflicts with the Merck Foundation's giving guidelines."[22] In October 2013, Merck & Co. announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in an attempt to cut $2.5bn (£1.5bn) from its costs by 2015. The company's shares rose 2.35% to US$48.73 in New York trading after it announced the cuts. The new losses, combined with 7,500 job cuts announced in 2011 and 2012, amount in total to 20% of its workforce.[23]
In June 2014 Merck & Co. announced its acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals for approximately $3.85 billion.[24] In December 2014 Merck & Co. announced they would be spending $8.4 billion to buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals.[25] Later in the same month the company acquired the Swiss biotechnology company OncoEthix for up to $375 million dependent upon certain milestone achievements.[26]
In July 2015 Merck & Co. and Ablynx expanded their 18 month old immuno-oncology collaboration by four years, generating a potential $4.4 billion in milestone payments for the Abylnx.[27] Days later Merck & Co. announced it would spend $95 million up front on collaborating with cCAM Biotherapeutics and its lead candidate (an early-stage treatment similar to Keytruda). The company is due up to $510 million more, which is tied to clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Merck & Co. will bring in CM-24, an antibody designed to block the immune checkpoint CEACAM1.[28]
In January 2016 Merck & Co. announced two new partnerships; the first with Quartet Medicine and its small molecule pain treatments,[29] the second with Complix investigating intracellular cancer targets,[30] with both collaborations potentially generating up to $595 million and $280 million respectively. Days later the company announced it would acquire IOmet Pharma, with IOmet becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co. The acquisition includes IOmets IDO (indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1), TDO (Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase), and dual-acting inhibitors.[31] In June, the company announced its acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals for $1.25 billion, gaining Afferents lead compound - AF-219 - used to block P2X3 receptors.[32]
In April 2017, Merck Animal Health acquired Brazilian animal health product manufacturer, Vallée S.A..[33]
"Merck" name legal dispute[edit]
In 191 of 193 countries the original Merck company, the Merck Group of Darmstadt, owns the rights to the "Merck" name. In the United States and Canada the company trades under the name EMD (an abbreviation of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt). In the United States and Canada Merck & Co. holds the rights to the trademark "Merck", while in the rest of the world the company trades under the name MSD (an abbreviation of Merck, Sharp & Dohme).
In 2015 the Merck Group adopted a new logo and said it will be "much more aggressive" about protecting the brand of "the real Merck."[34] Merck of Darmstadt has initiated litigation against its former subsidiary, Merck & Co. (MSD) of Kenilworth, in several countries over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom.[35] The judge also held that MSD's use of "Merck" as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck's trade mark rights in the UK.[36]
In response to the ruling, MSD initiated counter-litigation in the United States in January 2016 by filing a federal lawsuit which accused its former parent company of "infringing on its trademark" through actions that included the increased usage of “Merck KGaA” and “MERCK” in branding in the US as well as on its social media presence. Further Merck & Co. has also accused the Merck Group of federal trademark dilution, unfair competition, false advertising, deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and cybersquatting. The case came to a head when a research scientist believed he was communicating with Merck & Co regarding a research grant in oncology, when in fact they were talking with the Merck Group. As a result, Merck & Co. asked the federal court to stop the Merck Group from using “Merck” on any products or marketing materials in the United States. As a direct result, Merck & Co is seeking “all monetary gains, profits, and advantages” made by the Merck Group and three-times the damage, plus additional punitive damages.[37]

On April 23, 2014, Robert M. Davis, formerly CFO of Baxter International, became Merck's CFO.[39] Davis replaced Peter N. Kellogg, who held the post from 2007.[39]
Products[edit]




Gardasil


Current[edit]
As of August 2014, Merck's research and development effort has led to the approval of more new drugs than that of any other company. Research performed at Merck has led to U.S. FDA approval of 63 New Molecular Entities.[40] In 2014, Merck's major products included[41]

Januvia (sitagliptin), a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In 2013, Januvia was the second largest selling diabetes drug worldwide,[42] with $4.0 billion in worldwide sales. Januvia is commonly paired with the generic anti-diabetes drug metformin. It has been popular due in part because unlike many other diabetes drugs, it causes little or no weight gain and is not associated with hypoglycemic episodes.[43][44] Merck also sells a single pill combination drug containing both Januvia and metformin under the trade name Janumet. There has been some concern that treatment with Januvia and other DPP-IV inhibitors may be associated with a modestly increased risk of pancreatitis.[45]
Zetia (ezetimibe) is a drug for hypercholesterolemia that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Sales in 2013 amounted to $2.7 billion. Zetia has been controversial, as it was initially approved based on its impact on serum cholesterol levels without proof that it actually impacted the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Results of the IMPROVE-IT study, however, introduced at the 2014 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, showed a statistically significant, albeit modest, benefit in adding Zetia to simvastatin for high-risk, post-acute-coronary-syndrome patients.[46]
Remicade (infliximab) is a monoclonal antibody directed toward the cytokine TNF-alpha and used for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and others. Remicade and other TNF-alpha inhibitors exhibit additive therapeutic effects with methotrexate and improve quality of life. Adverse effects include increased risk of infection and certain cancers.[47]
Gardasil (recombinant human papilloma virus vaccine) is a vaccine against multiple serotypes of human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer worldwide.[48]
Isentress (raltegravir) is a human immunodeficiency virus integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. It is the first anti-HIV compound having this mechanism of action.[49] Sales in 2013 were $1.8 billion. It is part of one of several first line treatment regimens recommended by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.[50]
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is an immune modulator for the treatment of cancer. On September 4, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as a breakthrough therapy for melanoma treatment.[51] In clinical trials, pembrolzumab provided partial tumor regression in about one quarter of patients, many of whom have not seen further progression of their disease in over 6 months of follow-up.[52]
Invanz (Ertapenem) is an injectable antibiotic, rights to which Merck has owned since 1999.[19] As of 2015. Merck was in a legal dispute with the Taiwanese company Savior Lifetec over their attempt to secure rights to sell a generic version of this drug in the United States.[19]

Other products[edit]

Mexsana, an antiseptic medicated powder

Legacy products[edit]
Vaccines[edit]
Medically important vaccines developed at Merck include the first mumps vaccine,[53] the first rubella vaccine,[54] and the first trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR vaccine),[55] each of which was developed by Merck scientist Maurice Hilleman. The incidence of rubella-associated birth defects fell from up to 10,000 per year in the U.S. to zero in the aftermath of the rubella vaccine's development.[56] Hilleman also developed the first Hepatitis B vaccine[57] and the first varicella vaccine, for chickenpox.[58]
Thiazide anti-hypertensives[edit]
The thiazide diuretics were discovered developed by scientists Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of Merck and Co. in the 1950s,[59] and led to the marketing of the first drug of this class, chlorothiazide, under the trade name Duiril in 1958.[60] The research leading to the discovery of chlorothiazide, leading to "the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension" was recognized by a special Public Health Award from the Lasker Foundation in 1975.[61]
First statin[edit]
Merck scientists also developed lovastatin, the first drug of the statin class.[62] It was marketed under the trade name Mevacor.
Antibacterials[edit]
Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were a ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.[63])[64] Although Merck's agreement with Rutgers gave it exclusive rights to streptomycin, at Wakman's request the company renegotiated the agreement, returning the rights to the university in exchange for a royalty. The university then set up non-exclusive licenses with seven companies to ensure a reliable supply of the antibiotic.[65]
In 1985 Merck received approval for imipenem, the first member of the carbapenem class of antibiotics. Antibiotics of the carbapenem class play an important role in treatment guidelines for certain hospital-acquired and multi-drug resistant infections.[66][67]
Vioxx[edit]
In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as rofecoxib), a Merck product for treating arthritis. Vioxx was designed as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. Such compounds were expected to cause less gastrointestinal bleeding than older anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, which were associated with 20,000 hospitalizations and 2000 deaths each year.[68][non-primary source needed] Vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history.[citation needed]
Thereafter, studies by Merck and by others found an increased risk of heart attack associated with Vioxx use when compared with naproxen. Merck adjusted the labeling of Vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002.[citation needed]
On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a clinical trial it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months.[69] On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on September 30. An analysis for the period 1999-2004, based on U.S. Medical Expenditure Survey data, reported that Vioxx was associated with 46,783 heart attacks, and along with the other popular COX-2 inhibitor Celebrex, an estimated 26,603 deaths from both.[70][non-primary source needed]
About 50,000 people sued Merck, claiming they or their family members had suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx.[71] In November 2007, Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle most of the pending Vioxx lawsuits.[72] The settlement required that claimants provide medical and pharmacy records confirming the occurrence of a heart attack, ischemic stroke, or sudden cardiac death; the receipt of at least 30 Vioxx pills within 60 days prior to the injury or death; and confirmation of Vioxx being used within 14 days of the Vioxx-related event.[73] The settlement was generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for Merck, considering that original estimates of Merck's liability reached between $10 billion and $25 billion.[72] In fact, as of mid-2008, when the plaintiff class had reached the threshold percentage required by Merck to go through with the settlement, plaintiffs had prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that had reached juries, all with relatively small awards.[71]
According to internal e-mail traffic released at a later lawsuit, Merck had a list of doctors critical of Vioxx to be "neutralized" or "discredited." "We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live," wrote an employee. A Stanford Medical School professor said that Merck was engaged in intimidation of researchers and infringement upon academic freedom.[74]
On May 20, 2008, Merck settled for $58 million with 30 states alleging that Merck engaged in deceptive marketing tactics to promote Vioxx.[75] All its new television pain-advertisements must be vetted by the Food and Drug Administration and changed or delayed upon request until 2018.[76]
Mectizan[edit]
In 1987, Merck & Co. began a program with UNICEF to donate its new drug Mectizan to "all that need it for as long as needed"[77] in an effort to combat Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, primarily in Africa. Up to that point, the World Health Organization had fought the disease through the use of insecticides to lower the population of its primary vector, the Black Fly.[78] However, when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease, the WHO agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies. Merck's involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world,[79] and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used as part of the Mectizan Donation Program that covers countries such as Yemen and in African countries.[80]
More than 700 million people have been treated since the inception of the program with 80 million people still undergoing treatment in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen. Blindness caused by onchocerciasis is decreasing and there are regions of Latin America and Africa that have been shown to have completely eliminated the disease altogether.[80]
Fosamax[edit]
Fosamax (alendronate) is a bisphosphonate used for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and for the prevention of skeletal problems in certain cancers. The American College of Clinical Endocrinology, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the North American Menopause Society and the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommend alendronate and certain other bisphosphonates as first line treatments for post-menopausal osteopotosis.[81][82][83][84] Long-term treatment with bisphosponates produces anti-fracture and bone mineral density effects that persist for 3–5 years after an initial 3–5 years of treatment.[85] Alendronate reduces the risk of hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures by 35-39%.[86][87]
In December 2013, Merck agreed to pay a total of $27.7 million to 1,200 plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit alleging that the company's osteoporosis drug had caused them to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw. Prior to the settlement, Merck had prevailed in 3 of 5 so-called bellwether trials. Approximately 4000 cases still await adjudiction or settlement as of August 2014.[88]
Society and culture[edit]
Patient assistance programs[edit]
Merck & Co. was one of the first American pharmaceutical companies to offer assistance to those unable to afford its medications, beginning a program in the 1950s.[89] Merck & Co. offers seven patient assistance programs, each with specific eligibility requirements.[90][91]
Mass retrenchment[edit]
As of January 2015, 30000 people have been forced to leave the company due to economic reasons and Singapore's branch has been the most affected.
Sham medical journal[edit]
From 2002 through 2005 the Australian affiliate of Merck paid Elsevier an undisclosed amount to publish eight issues of a medical journal, the Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine. Although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer-reviewed journal, without any indication that Merck had paid for it, the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to Merck. The misleading publication came to light in 2009 during a personal injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx; 9 of 29 articles in the journal's second issue referred positively to Vioxx.[92] In 2009, the CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Michael Hansen, admitted that the practice was "unacceptable".[93]
Hilleman Laboratories[edit]
Merck and the Wellcome trust jointly fund the Hilleman Laboratories, an India-based non-profit research organization dedicated to the development of low cost vaccines for use in developing countries. Current projects include the development of low cost, thermostable vaccines for the prevention of cholera, rotavirus, and meningitis.[94]
Medicaid overbilling[edit]
A US Justice Department fraud investigation began in 2000 when allegations were brought in two separate lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act.[95] They alleged that Merck failed to pay proper rebates to Medicaid and other health care programs and paid illegal remuneration to health care providers.[96] On February 7, 2008 Merck agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle charges that it routinely overbilled Medicaid for its most popular medicines. The settlement was one of the largest pharmaceutical settlements in history. The federal government received more than $360 million, plus 49 states and Washington, DC, received over $290 million. One whistleblower received a $68 million reward.[95][97] Merck made the settlement without an admission of liability or wrongdoing.[98]
Environmental record[edit]
Merck & Co. once used methylene chloride, an animal carcinogen on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's list of pollutants, as a solvent in some of its manufacturing processes. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced.[99]
In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for volatile organic compound (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by 680,000 lb (310,000 kg) a year.[100]

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), d.b.a. Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside the United States and Canada, is an American pharmaceutical company and one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.
The company was established in 1891 as the United States subsidiary of the German company Merck, which was founded in 1668 by the Merck family. Merck & Co. was nationalized by the US government during World War I and subsequently established as an independent American company in 1917. While it operates as Merck & Co. in North America, the original Merck based in Darmstadt holds the rights to the Merck name everywhere else. Merck & Co. is the world's seventh largest pharmaceutical company by market capitalization and revenue. Its headquarters is located in Kenilworth, New Jersey.[2]
Merck & Co. publishes The Merck Manuals, a series of medical reference books for physicians, nurses, and technicians. These include the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, the world's best-selling medical reference. The Merck Index, a compendium of chemical compounds, was formerly published by Merck & Co. before being acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2012.

Company history[edit]
Roots and early history[edit]
Main article: Merck Group




The Angel Pharmacy in Darmstadt, the beginning of the Merck company


Merck & Co. traces its origins to its original German parent company Merck, which was established by the Merck family in 1668 when Jacob Friedrich Merck purchased a drug store in Darmstadt. In the 19th century, the Merck company in Darmstadt evolved from a pharmacy to a major pharmaceutical company which pioneered the commercial manufacture of morphine.
In 1891, family member George (Georg) Merck emigrated to the United States and set up Merck & Co. in New York as the US subsidiary of the family company. Merck & Co. operated from 1891 to 1917 as the US subsidiary of the Merck Group.
Nationalization[edit]
The Merck Group's US subsidiary Merck & Co. was nationalized by the US government in 1917 and re-established as an independent American company. Until the end of World War II, the company was led by George W. Merck. Merck & Co. hold the trademark rights to the "Merck" name in North America, while its former parent company retains the rights in the rest of the world.[3][4]
In 1929, H. K. Mulford Company merged with Sharpe and Dohme, Inc. This company brought to the future Merck & Co, Inc vaccine technology, including immunization of cavalry horses in World War I and delivery of a diphtheria antitoxin in 1925.[5]
1950 to 2000[edit]
In 1953, Merck & Co. merged with Philadelphia-based Sharp & Dohme, Inc., founded by Alpheus Phineas Sharp and Carl Friedrich Louis Dohme in 1845, becoming the largest US drugmaker.[6][7] The merger combined Merck & Co.'s strength in scientific research and chemical manufacturing with Sharp & Dohme's sales and distribution system and its marketing expertise. The combined company kept the trade name Merck in the United States and Canada, and as Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside North America. In 1965 Merck & Co. acquired Charles E. Frosst Ltd. of Montreal, Canada (founded 1899) and created Merck-Frosst Canada, Inc., as its Canadian subsidiary and pharmaceutical research facility. Merck & Co. closed this facility in July 2010,[8] and the company was renamed Merck Canada in 2011.
The company was incorporated in New Jersey in 1970.[9] It has an operating subsidiary, KBI Inc., which was originally formed as a joint venture with AstraZeneca.[9] In November 1993, Merck & Co. completed a $6 billion purchase of Medco Containment Services Inc., one of the largest mail-order pharmacy and managed-care drug companies.[10] Merck & Co. spun Medco off ten years later, and on August 20, 2003, Medco Health Solutions began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] (In 2012, Medco merged with, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of, Express Scripts Holding Co.)[12]
2001 to present[edit]
In November 2009, Merck & Co. announced that it would merge with competitor Schering-Plough in a US$41 billion deal.[13][14][15][16] Although Merck & Co. was in reality acquiring Schering-Plough, the purchase was structured on paper as a "reverse merger", in which "Old" Merck & Co. was renamed Merck Sharpe & Dohme, and Schering-Plough renamed as "Merck & Co., Inc." so that it could, technically, continue as the surviving public corporation.[17] The maneuver was an attempt to preserve Schering-Plough's rights to market Remicade, which was ultimately decided by arbitration.[18] The merger was completed on 2009-11-04. As of 2015[update], Merck Sharp & Dohme remains a subsidiary of the Merck & Co. parent.[19]
As of December 2013, the US company had approximately 76,000 employees in 120 countries with 31 factories worldwide. It is one of the world's seven largest pharmaceutical companies. The Merck Company Foundation has distributed more than $480 million to educational and non-profit organizations since it was founded in 1957 (and $740 million in overall charitable distributions).[20][21] On December 7, 2012, the foundation announced that it was ending its donations to the Boy Scouts of America because of "its policy that excludes members on the basis of sexual orientation", which "directly conflicts with the Merck Foundation's giving guidelines."[22] In October 2013, Merck & Co. announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in an attempt to cut $2.5bn (£1.5bn) from its costs by 2015. The company's shares rose 2.35% to US$48.73 in New York trading after it announced the cuts. The new losses, combined with 7,500 job cuts announced in 2011 and 2012, amount in total to 20% of its workforce.[23]
In June 2014 Merck & Co. announced its acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals for approximately $3.85 billion.[24] In December 2014 Merck & Co. announced they would be spending $8.4 billion to buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals.[25] Later in the same month the company acquired the Swiss biotechnology company OncoEthix for up to $375 million dependent upon certain milestone achievements.[26]
In July 2015 Merck & Co. and Ablynx expanded their 18 month old immuno-oncology collaboration by four years, generating a potential $4.4 billion in milestone payments for the Abylnx.[27] Days later Merck & Co. announced it would spend $95 million up front on collaborating with cCAM Biotherapeutics and its lead candidate (an early-stage treatment similar to Keytruda). The company is due up to $510 million more, which is tied to clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Merck & Co. will bring in CM-24, an antibody designed to block the immune checkpoint CEACAM1.[28]
In January 2016 Merck & Co. announced two new partnerships; the first with Quartet Medicine and its small molecule pain treatments,[29] the second with Complix investigating intracellular cancer targets,[30] with both collaborations potentially generating up to $595 million and $280 million respectively. Days later the company announced it would acquire IOmet Pharma, with IOmet becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co. The acquisition includes IOmets IDO (indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1), TDO (Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase), and dual-acting inhibitors.[31] In June, the company announced its acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals for $1.25 billion, gaining Afferents lead compound - AF-219 - used to block P2X3 receptors.[32]
In April 2017, Merck Animal Health acquired Brazilian animal health product manufacturer, Vallée S.A..[33]
"Merck" name legal dispute[edit]
In 191 of 193 countries the original Merck company, the Merck Group of Darmstadt, owns the rights to the "Merck" name. In the United States and Canada the company trades under the name EMD (an abbreviation of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt). In the United States and Canada Merck & Co. holds the rights to the trademark "Merck", while in the rest of the world the company trades under the name MSD (an abbreviation of Merck, Sharp & Dohme).
In 2015 the Merck Group adopted a new logo and said it will be "much more aggressive" about protecting the brand of "the real Merck."[34] Merck of Darmstadt has initiated litigation against its former subsidiary, Merck & Co. (MSD) of Kenilworth, in several countries over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom.[35] The judge also held that MSD's use of "Merck" as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck's trade mark rights in the UK.[36]
In response to the ruling, MSD initiated counter-litigation in the United States in January 2016 by filing a federal lawsuit which accused its former parent company of "infringing on its trademark" through actions that included the increased usage of “Merck KGaA” and “MERCK” in branding in the US as well as on its social media presence. Further Merck & Co. has also accused the Merck Group of federal trademark dilution, unfair competition, false advertising, deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and cybersquatting. The case came to a head when a research scientist believed he was communicating with Merck & Co regarding a research grant in oncology, when in fact they were talking with the Merck Group. As a result, Merck & Co. asked the federal court to stop the Merck Group from using “Merck” on any products or marketing materials in the United States. As a direct result, Merck & Co is seeking “all monetary gains, profits, and advantages” made by the Merck Group and three-times the damage, plus additional punitive damages.[37]

On April 23, 2014, Robert M. Davis, formerly CFO of Baxter International, became Merck's CFO.[39] Davis replaced Peter N. Kellogg, who held the post from 2007.[39]
Products[edit]




Gardasil


Current[edit]
As of August 2014, Merck's research and development effort has led to the approval of more new drugs than that of any other company. Research performed at Merck has led to U.S. FDA approval of 63 New Molecular Entities.[40] In 2014, Merck's major products included[41]

Januvia (sitagliptin), a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In 2013, Januvia was the second largest selling diabetes drug worldwide,[42] with $4.0 billion in worldwide sales. Januvia is commonly paired with the generic anti-diabetes drug metformin. It has been popular due in part because unlike many other diabetes drugs, it causes little or no weight gain and is not associated with hypoglycemic episodes.[43][44] Merck also sells a single pill combination drug containing both Januvia and metformin under the trade name Janumet. There has been some concern that treatment with Januvia and other DPP-IV inhibitors may be associated with a modestly increased risk of pancreatitis.[45]
Zetia (ezetimibe) is a drug for hypercholesterolemia that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Sales in 2013 amounted to $2.7 billion. Zetia has been controversial, as it was initially approved based on its impact on serum cholesterol levels without proof that it actually impacted the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Results of the IMPROVE-IT study, however, introduced at the 2014 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, showed a statistically significant, albeit modest, benefit in adding Zetia to simvastatin for high-risk, post-acute-coronary-syndrome patients.[46]
Remicade (infliximab) is a monoclonal antibody directed toward the cytokine TNF-alpha and used for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and others. Remicade and other TNF-alpha inhibitors exhibit additive therapeutic effects with methotrexate and improve quality of life. Adverse effects include increased risk of infection and certain cancers.[47]
Gardasil (recombinant human papilloma virus vaccine) is a vaccine against multiple serotypes of human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer worldwide.[48]
Isentress (raltegravir) is a human immunodeficiency virus integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. It is the first anti-HIV compound having this mechanism of action.[49] Sales in 2013 were $1.8 billion. It is part of one of several first line treatment regimens recommended by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.[50]
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is an immune modulator for the treatment of cancer. On September 4, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as a breakthrough therapy for melanoma treatment.[51] In clinical trials, pembrolzumab provided partial tumor regression in about one quarter of patients, many of whom have not seen further progression of their disease in over 6 months of follow-up.[52]
Invanz (Ertapenem) is an injectable antibiotic, rights to which Merck has owned since 1999.[19] As of 2015. Merck was in a legal dispute with the Taiwanese company Savior Lifetec over their attempt to secure rights to sell a generic version of this drug in the United States.[19]

Other products[edit]

Mexsana, an antiseptic medicated powder

Legacy products[edit]
Vaccines[edit]
Medically important vaccines developed at Merck include the first mumps vaccine,[53] the first rubella vaccine,[54] and the first trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR vaccine),[55] each of which was developed by Merck scientist Maurice Hilleman. The incidence of rubella-associated birth defects fell from up to 10,000 per year in the U.S. to zero in the aftermath of the rubella vaccine's development.[56] Hilleman also developed the first Hepatitis B vaccine[57] and the first varicella vaccine, for chickenpox.[58]
Thiazide anti-hypertensives[edit]
The thiazide diuretics were discovered developed by scientists Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of Merck and Co. in the 1950s,[59] and led to the marketing of the first drug of this class, chlorothiazide, under the trade name Duiril in 1958.[60] The research leading to the discovery of chlorothiazide, leading to "the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension" was recognized by a special Public Health Award from the Lasker Foundation in 1975.[61]
First statin[edit]
Merck scientists also developed lovastatin, the first drug of the statin class.[62] It was marketed under the trade name Mevacor.
Antibacterials[edit]
Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were a ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.[63])[64] Although Merck's agreement with Rutgers gave it exclusive rights to streptomycin, at Wakman's request the company renegotiated the agreement, returning the rights to the university in exchange for a royalty. The university then set up non-exclusive licenses with seven companies to ensure a reliable supply of the antibiotic.[65]
In 1985 Merck received approval for imipenem, the first member of the carbapenem class of antibiotics. Antibiotics of the carbapenem class play an important role in treatment guidelines for certain hospital-acquired and multi-drug resistant infections.[66][67]
Vioxx[edit]
In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as rofecoxib), a Merck product for treating arthritis. Vioxx was designed as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. Such compounds were expected to cause less gastrointestinal bleeding than older anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, which were associated with 20,000 hospitalizations and 2000 deaths each year.[68][non-primary source needed] Vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history.[citation needed]
Thereafter, studies by Merck and by others found an increased risk of heart attack associated with Vioxx use when compared with naproxen. Merck adjusted the labeling of Vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002.[citation needed]
On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a clinical trial it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months.[69] On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on September 30. An analysis for the period 1999-2004, based on U.S. Medical Expenditure Survey data, reported that Vioxx was associated with 46,783 heart attacks, and along with the other popular COX-2 inhibitor Celebrex, an estimated 26,603 deaths from both.[70][non-primary source needed]
About 50,000 people sued Merck, claiming they or their family members had suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx.[71] In November 2007, Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle most of the pending Vioxx lawsuits.[72] The settlement required that claimants provide medical and pharmacy records confirming the occurrence of a heart attack, ischemic stroke, or sudden cardiac death; the receipt of at least 30 Vioxx pills within 60 days prior to the injury or death; and confirmation of Vioxx being used within 14 days of the Vioxx-related event.[73] The settlement was generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for Merck, considering that original estimates of Merck's liability reached between $10 billion and $25 billion.[72] In fact, as of mid-2008, when the plaintiff class had reached the threshold percentage required by Merck to go through with the settlement, plaintiffs had prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that had reached juries, all with relatively small awards.[71]
According to internal e-mail traffic released at a later lawsuit, Merck had a list of doctors critical of Vioxx to be "neutralized" or "discredited." "We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live," wrote an employee. A Stanford Medical School professor said that Merck was engaged in intimidation of researchers and infringement upon academic freedom.[74]
On May 20, 2008, Merck settled for $58 million with 30 states alleging that Merck engaged in deceptive marketing tactics to promote Vioxx.[75] All its new television pain-advertisements must be vetted by the Food and Drug Administration and changed or delayed upon request until 2018.[76]
Mectizan[edit]
In 1987, Merck & Co. began a program with UNICEF to donate its new drug Mectizan to "all that need it for as long as needed"[77] in an effort to combat Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, primarily in Africa. Up to that point, the World Health Organization had fought the disease through the use of insecticides to lower the population of its primary vector, the Black Fly.[78] However, when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease, the WHO agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies. Merck's involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world,[79] and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used as part of the Mectizan Donation Program that covers countries such as Yemen and in African countries.[80]
More than 700 million people have been treated since the inception of the program with 80 million people still undergoing treatment in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen. Blindness caused by onchocerciasis is decreasing and there are regions of Latin America and Africa that have been shown to have completely eliminated the disease altogether.[80]
Fosamax[edit]
Fosamax (alendronate) is a bisphosphonate used for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and for the prevention of skeletal problems in certain cancers. The American College of Clinical Endocrinology, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the North American Menopause Society and the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommend alendronate and certain other bisphosphonates as first line treatments for post-menopausal osteopotosis.[81][82][83][84] Long-term treatment with bisphosponates produces anti-fracture and bone mineral density effects that persist for 3–5 years after an initial 3–5 years of treatment.[85] Alendronate reduces the risk of hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures by 35-39%.[86][87]
In December 2013, Merck agreed to pay a total of $27.7 million to 1,200 plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit alleging that the company's osteoporosis drug had caused them to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw. Prior to the settlement, Merck had prevailed in 3 of 5 so-called bellwether trials. Approximately 4000 cases still await adjudiction or settlement as of August 2014.[88]
Society and culture[edit]
Patient assistance programs[edit]
Merck & Co. was one of the first American pharmaceutical companies to offer assistance to those unable to afford its medications, beginning a program in the 1950s.[89] Merck & Co. offers seven patient assistance programs, each with specific eligibility requirements.[90][91]
Mass retrenchment[edit]
As of January 2015, 30000 people have been forced to leave the company due to economic reasons and Singapore's branch has been the most affected.
Sham medical journal[edit]
From 2002 through 2005 the Australian affiliate of Merck paid Elsevier an undisclosed amount to publish eight issues of a medical journal, the Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine. Although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer-reviewed journal, without any indication that Merck had paid for it, the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to Merck. The misleading publication came to light in 2009 during a personal injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx; 9 of 29 articles in the journal's second issue referred positively to Vioxx.[92] In 2009, the CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Michael Hansen, admitted that the practice was "unacceptable".[93]
Hilleman Laboratories[edit]
Merck and the Wellcome trust jointly fund the Hilleman Laboratories, an India-based non-profit research organization dedicated to the development of low cost vaccines for use in developing countries. Current projects include the development of low cost, thermostable vaccines for the prevention of cholera, rotavirus, and meningitis.[94]
Medicaid overbilling[edit]
A US Justice Department fraud investigation began in 2000 when allegations were brought in two separate lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act.[95] They alleged that Merck failed to pay proper rebates to Medicaid and other health care programs and paid illegal remuneration to health care providers.[96] On February 7, 2008 Merck agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle charges that it routinely overbilled Medicaid for its most popular medicines. The settlement was one of the largest pharmaceutical settlements in history. The federal government received more than $360 million, plus 49 states and Washington, DC, received over $290 million. One whistleblower received a $68 million reward.[95][97] Merck made the settlement without an admission of liability or wrongdoing.[98]
Environmental record[edit]
Merck & Co. once used methylene chloride, an animal carcinogen on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's list of pollutants, as a solvent in some of its manufacturing processes. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced.[99]
In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for volatile organic compound (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by 680,000 lb (310,000 kg) a year.[100]

Vaccines & Prescribing Information 










Vaccines are one of the greatest public health success stories in history, and Merck has played its part in that story.
Merck and its legacy companies have been working to discover and develop vaccines for more than a century. Our unique vaccines have helped prevent a number of diseases, including ones never thought preventable. Today, we remain dedicated to the complex business of researching and producing vaccines.

DELIVERING ON MERCK’S MISSION
Our employees meet daunting challenges head on in their quest to contribute to the health and well-being of people around the world.  Perhaps there is no greater challenge than conquering cancer and that is what Frank Clyburn set out to do when he began leading Merck’s oncology team in 2013.

			                           The oncology business was truly a start-up. I started with a team that I could count on one hand.  We put a cross-divisional leadership team in place and together we managed to bring one of our most innovative products to market.”

Merck's Patient Assistance Programs to Help Those in Need


 





 PRINT






TEXT SIZE











At Merck, we believe that no one should go without the 
	medicines or vaccines they need. That is why the company 
	provides its medicines and adult vaccines for free to people 
	who do not have prescription drug or health insurance 
	coverage and who, without our assistance, cannot afford 
	their Merck medicine and vaccines. This is consistent 
	with Merck's long-held values and traditions of putting patients first.
If you or someone you know needs help paying for medicines or adult vaccines, the Merck Patient Assistance Program, Inc., may be able to help.

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersMerck & Co.Merck & Co.Merck & Co. manufactures pharmaceutical drugs, vaccines and animal health products. It is the second-largest drug company in the United States and is headquartered on a 100-acre compound in Kenilworth, New Jersey. According to Merck’s annual report, it made about $40 billion in 2016.Jump To TopicHistoryProblematic Drugs & LitigationTax Fraud, Price Gouging & Lying Under OathPipeline of New DrugsJump To TopicSelect TopicHistoryProblematic Drugs & LitigationTax Fraud, Price Gouging & Lying Under OathPipeline of New DrugsEstablished: U.S. branch established in 1891
Headquarters: Kenilworth, New Jersey
Revenue: $39.8 billion (2016)
Founders: Friedrich and George Merck
Size: 70,000 employees (2015)
Products Include: Januvia (Type 2 diabetes drug), Gardasil (vaccine), Propecia (hair loss drug) and Fosamax (bone loss drug)
Merck & Co. manufactures products like Januvia (for Type 2 diabetes), Singulair (for asthma) and NuvaRing (for birth control). The animal health division has products such as vaccines for cattle and diabetes treatment for dogs and cats. The company has been largely successful.
But Merck has had its share of legal troubles, including personal injury lawsuits filed by people who say the company’s products injured them and patent lawsuits and criminal charges for illegal marketing and price gouging.
The drugmaker was ranked fourth-largest drug company in the world in 2016 and continues to develop new drugs for cancer and diabetes as well as vaccines, including one for Ebola.
The History of Merck
Merck & Co. began in 1668 when Friedrich Jacob Merck opened the Angel Pharmacy (Engel-Apotheke) in Darmstadt, Germany. He sold morphine, cocaine and codeine. The company became a manufacturer in 1827, when Heinrich Emmanuel Merck transformed the business and named it E. Merck. A U.S. sales office opened in 1887. George Merck, Heinrich’s grandson, was appointed head of the U.S. branch, called Merck & Co., which opened in 1891.
Merck & Co. sold the first commercially used smallpox vaccine in the U.S. in 1898. The next year, it published a guide for physicians and pharmacists known as The Merck Manual. The manual is translated in 17 languages today and is considered one of the most widely used texts in the world.
One of Merck & Co.'s office locationsMerck & Co.’s Split from ‘German Merck’
As the U.S. branch of Merck grew, the company established a manufacturing facility in Rahway, New Jersey, in 1902. In 1917, after World War I, the government confiscated Merck & Co. and set it up as an independent company. The original German Merck is now known as Merck KGaA and has no affiliation with Merck & Co. ― known as Merck, Sharpe & Dohme outside the U.S. and Canada.
In the following years, Merck & Co. set itself apart from Merck KGaA by focusing on pharmaceuticals, and its annual revenue quickly surpassed that of its original parent company.
In 1944, Merck’s researchers completed two major accomplishments: discovering streptomycin (an antibiotic to treat tuberculosis) while working with researchers at Rutgers University and creating a cortisone synthesis to treat pain.
Merck agreed to a company changing merger with Philadelphia pharmacy Sharp & Dohme in 1953. The move enabled Merck to remain competitive and granted it access to Sharp & Dohme’s established clients. Together, the companies became the largest U.S. manufacturer of prescription drugs at the time.
Vaccines were Merck’s next endeavor. In 1963, Merck manufactured the first measles vaccine, followed by the first mumps vaccine in 1967.
Mergers Grow Merck & Co.
Other companies completed mergers that would later affect Merck. In 1971, the Schering Corporation merged with Plough ― these later merged with Organon BioSciences ― and all of them merged with Merck in 2009.
In 1979, Merck sold a highly successful high blood pressure drug called Enalapril with sales that reached $550 million. In 1988, Vasotec (used to treat congestive heart failure) became Merck’s first drug to bring in a billion dollars in one year.
Throughout the 1980s and 90s, Merck worked with major pharmaceutical companies such as Astra AB, Zeneca and Johnson & Johnson. In 2000, Schering-Plough worked with Merck to create drugs for cholesterol and respiratory needs. Nine years later, the two companies merged when Merck bought Schering-Plough for $41.1 billion. The deal gave Merck access to name brands like Dr. Scholl’s and Coppertone and to Organon’s product line, which included NuvaRing.
In May 2014, Bayer bought Merck’s consumer care business for $14.2 billion, taking brands like Claritin and Coppertone.
Merck’s Problematic Drugs & Litigation
While Merck makes billions from its products each year, its pharmaceuticals have had their share of side effects, some deadly. These include a Type 2 diabetes drug linked to pancreatitis, hormonal birth control that led to dangerous blood clots and a recalled painkiller that caused fatal heart attacks. Injured consumers took Merck to court and the drugmaker paid billions in damages to patients and their families.
Vioxx

Learn About Vioxx

The most well-known of Merck’s legal troubles is the Vioxx scandal. The painkiller was introduced in 1999 and used by 25 million Americans before Merck recalled it in 2004 because of the drug’s heart attack and stroke risks. Vioxx was blamed for more than 3,400 deaths, and Merck paid nearly $7 billion to settle tens of thousands of Vioxx lawsuits and pay for legal costs.
Years after the recall of Vioxx, there’s still controversy about how the drug received approval from the FDA and why Merck kept it on the market for five years.
After denying reports of dangerous cardiac side effects for years, Merck recalled Vioxx in 2004. Tens of thousands of lawsuits followed, creating one of the largest pharmaceutical multidistrict litigations (MDL) in history. Merck settled with all the claimants ― paying out nearly $7 billion along the way ― but admitted no fault.
Shareholder Accusations
Injured consumers weren’t the only ones who went after Merck. Company shareholders and the U.S. Senate also had problems with Merck’s actions. The shareholders accused Merck of deceitfully marketing the painkiller, and the dispute ended with Merck spending millions in legal fees and agreeing to an appointed marketing monitor.
The U.S. Senate Finance Committee examined Merck’s relationship with the FDA, wary that Vioxx’s side effects were minimized and that Merck was responsible for questionable marketing tactics and fraud. Merck paid $950 million to settle allegations.
Fake Medical Journals
When news broke in 2009 that Merck had created a medical journal promoting Vioxx without disclosing financial interest, the controversy was reignited. The publications were published from 2002 to 2005 through Elsevier, an academic publisher. The journal had articles posing as medical studies endorsing Vioxx and Fosamax.
Medicaid Fraud
Merck’s troubles with Vioxx weren’t limited to side effects and journal articles. 

Medicaid Scandal
The company was also involved in a Medicaid scandal involving Vioxx that ended in a $650 million settlement.

In 2008, the Justice Department examined a whistleblower suit and another lawsuit that accused Merck of providing hospitals with major discounts on drugs, including Vioxx, in the hopes that Medicaid patients would be given the medications and continue them after they left the hospital.
Although Merck did not admit wrongdoing, it did agree to pay the $650 million settlement, including a payment of more than $360 million to the federal government. The agreement also stipulated that Merck sign a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement.
Merck Pleads Guilty to Vioxx Criminal Charges
In 2012, U.S. District Court Judge Patti B. Saris sentenced Merck to pay a criminal fine of nearly $322 million, according to the U.S. Department of Justice press release.


The drugmaker plead guilty to “violating the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) for introducing a misbranded drug, Vioxx, into interstate commerce.”

Specifically, Merck admitted to promoting Vioxx for treating rheumatoid arthritis before the FDA approved it for that use. The company promoted Vioxx for rheumatoid arthritis for nearly three years without FDA approval.
The fine was the culmination of a seven year investigation of Merck begun in 2004 led by the FBI. The civil damages and criminal charges combined cost the drug maker nearly a billion dollars.






Fosamax




Fosamax is used to prevent bone loss but is linked to osteonecrosis of the jaw, also known as Dead Jaw Syndrome. The condition can occur following dental work and causes the jaw to become infected and even collapse. The drug can also cause bones to weaken and crumble, leaving patients vulnerable to fractures.
The FDA updated warnings on the drug’s label to communicate the dangers and limitations of Fosamax. Thousands of patients filed lawsuits claiming Merck failed to warn of the side effects and the company paid millions in settlements and jury verdicts.

Januvia




Approved by the FDA in 2006, Januvia (sitagliptin) treats type 2 diabetes but studies linked the drug to pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and pancreatic cancer. The FDA issued an additional warning for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors like Januvia in 2015, stating the drugs could cause severe joint pain. The agency said it received 33 reports of severe, disabling pain from 2006-13.
Patients and family members of patients who took Januvia and then experienced problems filed lawsuits against Merck. According to claims, some former Januvia users died after using the drug.

NuvaRing




Organon, a subsidiary of Merck, manufactures NuvaRing, a birth control ring associated with life-threatening blood clots. Because of thee possible side effects, the FDA released drug safety communication in October 2011. NuvaRing patients filed more than a thousand federal lawsuits and the company settled almost all of them for $100 million in 2014.



Learn About NuvaRing




Propecia




In its first year on the market, more than 400,000 U.S. men used Propecia (finasteride), a drug that treats male-pattern baldness. But people who used the drug reported sexual side effects, including decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorder. The FDA made changes to the drug’s safety label in 2011 to reflect the possibility of cancer, sexual side effects and possibility of continued side effects post-use. Hundreds of men who experienced Propecia side effects filed lawsuits against Merck.

Tax Fraud, Price Gouging and Lying Under Oath
Outside of manufacturing drugs that later harmed consumers, Merck has also been in the spotlight for questionable business practices, including misleading shareholders and judges.



2007
The company agreed to pay $2.3 billion to settle a tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service for an offshore subsidiary it created in 1993 and continued to profit from until 2001.


2008
Merck paid $671 million to settle federal health care fraud claims for overcharging the government and bribing doctors to prescribe its brand name drugs.


2013
Merck paid $688 million to settle two shareholder lawsuits that accused the drug giant of delaying the release of bad study results for its cholesterol drugs to prevent a loss in revenue.


2016
Judge Beth Labson found Merck lied to the court and to its business partner. Merck claimed its patents covered Gilead’s blockbuster hepatitis C drug, Solvadi and demanded damages from Gilead. A jury originally awarded Merck $200 million. But Merck violated confidentiality agreements with business partners in order to obtain a victory. Labson overturned the $200 million verdict. The judge called Merck’s behavior a “systematic and outrageous deception in conjunction with unethical business practices and litigation misconduct.”



Merck’s Pipeline of New Drugs
Despite legal troubles, the drugmaker continues to post solid revenue and develop new pharmaceuticals. According to its new drug report as of February 24, 2017, the New Jersey-based company has several new compounds in various stages of development.
Some notable drugs in development include cancer, asthma, hepatitis C and diabetes drugs in Phase II trials. In Phase III trials, Merck has drugs for heart failure, bacterial infections, Alzheimer’s disease, HIV and diabetes. It also has vaccines for Ebola and shingles in this category.

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma and Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma is the nickname given to the world's vast and influential pharmaceutical industry and its trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA. Big Pharma and medical device companies make billions of dollars every year selling drugs and devices — including those that were recalled or involved in fraud or product liability lawsuits.Jump To TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryJump To TopicSelect TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryThe pharmaceutical industry — nicknamed Big Pharma — is one of the most powerful industries in the world. The global revenue for pharmaceuticals was over $1 trillion in 2014. But nowhere else in the world do the drug and medical device industries have as much power and make as much money as in the U.S.
In fact, Americans spent an all-time high of $457 billion on prescription drugs in 2015. By 2020, it will be $610 billion. Medical devices are also lucrative. The U.S. makes up about half of the world’s share of the market at about $148 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.

US based big pharma companies
Meanwhile, drug prices continue to rise. Consulting firm Segal Consulting expects drug prices for Americans under age 65 to rise 11.6 percent in 2017. In contrast, wages are only expected to rise 2.5 percent, leaving many American unable to afford their medications.
Big Pharma even contributes heavily to the annual budget of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through application fees (user fees) for its new products. Experts say the industry contributes about two thirds of the FDA’s budget.
Five of the top 10 pharma and medical device companies for 2016 are headquartered in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck, Gilead and AbbVie.
The underside of the industry reveals a history of fraud, bribery, product liability lawsuits and scandals that led to billions in settlements — a known cost of doing business for these companies who are “too big to jail.” Despite criminal charges and fines, the companies continue to do business.
Who is Big Pharma?
The majority of drugs and medical devices have ties to a small group of parent companies. Prescription drugs and devices manufactured by these companies bring in billions in profits. The biggest drug makers may also have subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices.
Pharmaceutical companies are typically larger and make more money than companies that focus on medical devices.


The most powerful drug and device companies are members of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) — the industry’s U.S. lobbying organization.

With the help of staggering profits and an army of 1,378 paid lobbyists, the industry spreads its influence on Capitol Hill. From 1998 to 2016, Big Pharma spent nearly $3.5 billion on lobbying expenses — more than any other industry. In 2016 alone, it spent about $246 million — more than the defense industries and corporate business lobbyists combined.

Fact
Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma.

Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma. In fact, they are the second most hated industry in the U.S. They are also the biggest defrauder of the Federal Government under the False Claims Act, according to consumer watchdog group Public Citizen.
The Reputation Institute evaluated public perception of 17 pharmaceutical companies for products and services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship and financial performance. The Institute based its results on 16,800 ratings from the U.S., U.K., Canada and other countries.
Of all the countries, the U.S. had the lowest opinion of pharmaceutical companies. Older people had the most favorable view of the industry.

Medical Device Manufacturers
Medical devices can be anything from hospital diagnostic equipment to hip and knee implants. Several companies only produce medical devices, but some drug manufacturers, such as Johnson & Johnson, also manufacture devices.

Fact
Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).

Like Big Pharma, medical device manufacturers also have a lobbying group to pursue their interests in Washington.Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).
In 2016, it contributed $1.2 million in lobbying funds. Its efforts concentrate on medical device friendly bills in Congress mostly related to how companies pay taxes.
Five of the top medical devices companies have their headquarters in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Baxter International, Abbott Laboratories, Stryker and Boston Scientific.

Big Pharma’s Influence
Critics contend that Big Pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers, the FDA and the public to increase sales.
The public is exposed to Pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising. For example, critics say AbbVie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as AndroGel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men. They created a marketing campaign around the condition “Low T” that featured a quiz for men to self-diagnose Low T symptoms.

Androgel, above, was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up
The testosterone market soared into the billions as a result. But few studies back up drug-company claims that the drug significantly enhances mood, vitality and sexual performance. Studies also link these drugs to heart problems. The FDA added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk.
The American public is not the only sector of society influenced by Big Pharma’s techniques. Doctors, scientists and research organizations, medical journals, teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to Big Pharma.
Doctors conduct research with funds from Big Pharma. Private charities and foundations account for a mere 5 percent of the estimated $100 billion spent on biomedical research in the U.S. each year. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately 60 percent.
Big Pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout.

 The trade group PhRMA has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena, including:

36 who worked for a member of Congress
13 who worked for a federal agency
12 who worked for a congressional committee
Two who worked for the White House
One who worked in the court system


Using these connections to pursue industry goals, Big Pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest.
Marketing, Research and Development (R&D) and Drug Cost
Americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases, thousands of dollars more per prescription. Big Pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug.

Cost Facts
While companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.

The truth is that U.S. law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from free-market competition. Other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug. The true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery, with many unverifiable figures reported by Big Pharma.
Donald Light, a professor and expert on the pharma business model, said that while companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.
The industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing, which is almost double what it spends on research.
Big Pharma Sways Opinions
The large amount of cash Big Pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on direct-to-consumer advertising. The U.S. is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on TV (the other is New Zealand).


In 2015, Big Pharma spent $5.4 billion on direct-to-consumer ads and fired off about 80 ads an hour, according to Nielsen.

Big Pharma also employs doctors, researchers and institutions.
The industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting, paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal.

Paid copywriters were used in advertising Paxil,
above
Often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product. Big Pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs, including the antidepressant Paxil, the recalled weight loss drug Fen-Phen, the anti-epilepsy drug Neurontin, the antidepressant Zoloft and painkiller Vioxx, to name a few.
In addition, even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal, it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on Big Pharma’s payroll.
These slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence. Yet Richard Smith, former editor of the British Medical Journal, says, “All journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry.”

Big Pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications. Consider the numbers:

Advertising instead of research: For every $1 spent on “basic research,” Big Pharma spends $19 on promotions and advertising.
Distribution of free drug samples: The U.S. has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five office-based physicians.
Sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions: Drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors, including covering meals, travel, seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations.


Many medical journals, including the esteemed Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), actively vie for the attention of Big Pharma advertising dollars, billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership.
How Big Pharma Influences Doctors and Researchers
Part of Big Pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive, brand name drugs.

Fact
In 2012, Big Pharma spent $24 billion on physician advertising, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.

Drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty. One 2016 study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than $20 they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug.
According to ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs investigation, 1,866 companies paid $6.25 billion to doctors and hospitals from August 2013 to December 2015.

Drug and Device Company Payments to Doctors from Select Companies, August 2013 to December 2015:



Company
PAYMENTS




DePuy (Johnson & Johnson)
$167 million


Stryker Corporation
$153 million


AstraZeneca
$145 million


Pfizer
$128 million


Janssen Pharmaceuticals
$106 million


GlaxoSmithKline
$86.3 million


Boston Scientific
$77 million




Big Pharma and Researchers
Then there are medical researchers, who are hardly immune to Big Pharma’s financial power. Because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer, too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers.
Sponsors keep the data, analyze it, write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication. Drug companies also stage-manage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light.
Medical Schools and Big Pharma
Big Pharma has also infiltrated medical schools. Teachers, department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors. This influences educational content. Money from Big Pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals, and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs.


The result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drug-intensive style of medicine.

Sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer, more expensive drugs are always better than old ones.
In most states, doctors must also take accredited education courses, called continuing medical education (CME). The pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on CME annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool.
In addition, academic centers are able to receive royalties from Big Pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds.
Columbia University, for example, received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the 17-year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products.
Columbia University received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesBig Pharma Fraud Settlements
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud, according to Public Citizen’s 2013 report Pharmaceutical Industry Settlements: 1991 through 2015.

Fact
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud.

The most common charge involved drug-pricing scams against state Medicaid programs. This meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while Big Pharma made billions.
Unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements. But these investigations take many years to complete. By then, drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion, while the U.S. Department of Justice fine is typically only a few million.
This makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies, according to Michael Bobelian of Forbes Magazine.
Manufacturer Directory
Several of the biggest drug and medical device companies sell the majority of their products in the U.S. Many of these products are involved in product liability litigation. Some of the companies’ best-selling drugs brought in over a billion in 2016, according to company annual reports.
AbbVie

Quick Facts:

Business: Sells and markets more than 40 drugs in the U.S.
Products Involved in Current or Past Litigation Include: AndroGel (testosterone replacement), Depakote (antiepileptic), Humira (arthritis, Crohn’s disease)
Top Selling Drugs 2016: Humira, Imbruvica (cancer)


AbbVie Inc. is a pharmaceutical company that spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013 and markets dozens of products. The Illinois-based group generates most of its revenue from Humira, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat arthritis, and from AndroGel, a testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) gel that treats low testosterone (“Low T”) in men. Humira was the world’s No. 1 drug in 2016, bringing in $16.7 billion. 
AstraZeneca

Report Card

Merck & Co., Inc.
Download the Report Card Download all Report Cards Stock Exchange: XNYS • Ticker: MRK • HQ: Kenilworth, NJ, US • Employees: 68,000
Index performance by Research Area
Performance
Merck & Co., Inc. has one of the largest vaccine revenues, above average geographic scope and a medium-sized portfolio, including key vaccines with few producers (e.g., for HPV and rotavirus). It focuses less on vaccine R&D than peers in scope. Overall, it falls in the middle of the pack of companies. Merck & Co., Inc.’s performance in Manufacturing & Supply is above average, with the strongest commitment to maintaining supply. In Pricing & Registration, it publishes its vaccine pricing policy. It has filed to register some vaccines in only some low-income countries (LICs). It performs below average in Research & Development, with relatively low R&D investments and a relatively small vaccine pipeline.
Sales and operations
Merck & Co., Inc. (known as MSD outside the US and Canada) has three businesses: pharmaceuticals; vaccines; and animal health. For its entire portfolio (all products including vaccines), it has sales in 81 countries in scope. Merck & Co., Inc. had a vaccines joint venture in Europe with Sanofi Pasteur (Sanofi Pasteur MSD) which ceased operation at the end of 2016. The company will take its vaccine assets back in-house. It now has 13 marketed vaccines.

Sales in countries in scope (all product types)
Number of doses sold in 2015
Sales by segment 2015
Vaccine portfolio
Merck & Co., Inc. has 13 vaccines on the market for 14 diseases in scope, including three combination vaccines. Its portfolio is diverse, from traditional childhood vaccines (e.g., measles, mumps, rubella combination vaccines) to newer vaccines with few other suppliers, including for HPV (Gardasil®) and rotavirus (RotaTeq®).
Opportunities
Strengthen internal process for aligning supply and demand. Merck & Co., Inc. can implement some or all of the strategies identified by the Index to strengthen its internal process for aligning supply and demand. For example, it could establish a clear process for escalation and action on identified supply issues; consider other suppliers when making supply allocation decisions; and set up a clear process for re-allocation of stocks in limited supply situations.
Apply a more specific pricing policy and reduce key vaccine prices. Merck & Co., Inc. can outline how it defines pricing tiers and explicitly state how it takes different countries’ ability to pay into account. In addition, it can work with stakeholders to reduce the price of key vaccines (e.g., Gardasil® for HPV and RotaTeq® for rotavirus) for all LICs and middle-income countries (MICs), particularly in the case of Gavi-transitioning countries in the future and current non-Gavi and non-PAHO countries. For this purpose, Merck & Co., Inc. can continue to work with pooled procurers and work directly with self-procuring countries. This can help increase the adoption of these vaccines in more MICs.
Invest more in R&D. Merck & Co., Inc. can invest more in vaccine R&D, and engage in new projects to develop and adapt vaccines that meet the needs of people in countries in scope. This will help the long-term sustainability of its vaccine business.
File vaccines for registration more widely where they are needed. Merck & Co., Inc. can expand the availability of existing and future key vaccines in more LICs and MICs, where needed, taking into account the availability of alternative products and domestic vaccine manufacturing, registration hurdles, and government demand and preferences. This can provide purchasers with more choice, create a more competitive environment, and improve supply reliability.
Research Areas

Research & Development
Proportionally low R&D investments. Compared to other companies measured, as a proportion of its global vaccines revenue, Merck & Co., Inc. made relatively low investments in vaccine R&D for diseases in scope in 2014 and 2015.
Relatively small vaccine pipeline. Merck & Co., Inc. has six R&D projects in its pipeline, including projects targeting Ebolavirus and pneumococcal disease. It received approval for two vaccines during the period of analysis, as well as a thermostability label update for its HPV vaccine (Gardasil®).
Access provisions in place for two late-stage projects. Merck & Co., Inc. has at least one access provision in place for two out of its four late-stage projects. It applied for WHO prequalification for its HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9®), which is not yet available in countries in scope.


Pricing & Registration
Pricing strategy takes multiple factors into account. Merck & Co., Inc. states that it uses tiered pricing to (a) expand access and (b) to ensure sufficient return on its investment in R&D over time. The company does not provide details of its pricing tiers. The company’s access to vaccines policy takes multiple factors into account, including the country’s level of economic development, fiscal capacity for investments in health, and actual health spending, which could be seen as proxies for the country’s ability to pay.
Extension of Gavi prices to Gavi-transitioning countries. Merck & Co., Inc. is extending the current Gavi prices for its quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil®) and rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq®) through 2025 to Gavi-transitioned countries with gross national income per capita not exceeding USD 3,200.
Above-average transparency. Like its peers, Merck & Co., Inc. does not systematically publish all prices for its vaccines in all countries in scope. Unlike most of its peers, the company publishes its detailed vaccine pricing policy. It states that it does not have a policy permitting or prohibiting governments from disclosing prices: it leaves this to each government’s discretion.
Limited registration filing in LICs. Merck & Co., Inc. files the majority of its relevant vaccines for registration in some lower middle-income countries, like its peers. However, it files only some of its vaccines for registration and in only some LICs. Merck & Co., Inc. states that its decision to file for registration is based on where vaccines are needed. The company commits to seeking WHO prequalification of eligible vaccines to expedite access in LICs.

Manufacturing & Supply
Very strong in aligning supply and demand. Merck & Co., Inc. makes the strongest commitment to maintaining supply of its vaccines as long as they are needed, and notifies stakeholders of plans to alter supply. It prioritises public health needs when re-allocating limited stock.
Building manufacturing capacity in Brazil. Merck & Co., Inc. undertakes some vaccine manufacturing capacity building activities. It is undertaking a technology transfer with capacity building components for its HPV vaccine (Gardasil®), and is beginning a technology transfer for its hepatitis A vaccine (Vaqta®), both to Instituto Butantan in Brazil.
Above-average performance in addressing local logistics needs. Merck & Co., Inc. has implemented presentations and packaging to overcome local barriers for several vaccines, with a focus on cold-chain requirements. For example, Gardasil® has been approved for Controlled Temperature Chain use as it does not require constant refrigeration.

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), d.b.a. Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside the United States and Canada, is an American pharmaceutical company and one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.
The company was established in 1891 as the United States subsidiary of the German company Merck, which was founded in 1668 by the Merck family. Merck & Co. was nationalized by the US government during World War I and subsequently established as an independent American company in 1917. While it operates as Merck & Co. in North America, the original Merck based in Darmstadt holds the rights to the Merck name everywhere else. Merck & Co. is the world's seventh largest pharmaceutical company by market capitalization and revenue. Its headquarters is located in Kenilworth, New Jersey.[2]
Merck & Co. publishes The Merck Manuals, a series of medical reference books for physicians, nurses, and technicians. These include the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, the world's best-selling medical reference. The Merck Index, a compendium of chemical compounds, was formerly published by Merck & Co. before being acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2012.

Company history[edit]
Roots and early history[edit]
Main article: Merck Group




The Angel Pharmacy in Darmstadt, the beginning of the Merck company


Merck & Co. traces its origins to its original German parent company Merck, which was established by the Merck family in 1668 when Jacob Friedrich Merck purchased a drug store in Darmstadt. In the 19th century, the Merck company in Darmstadt evolved from a pharmacy to a major pharmaceutical company which pioneered the commercial manufacture of morphine.
In 1891, family member George (Georg) Merck emigrated to the United States and set up Merck & Co. in New York as the US subsidiary of the family company. Merck & Co. operated from 1891 to 1917 as the US subsidiary of the Merck Group.
Nationalization[edit]
The Merck Group's US subsidiary Merck & Co. was nationalized by the US government in 1917 and re-established as an independent American company. Until the end of World War II, the company was led by George W. Merck. Merck & Co. hold the trademark rights to the "Merck" name in North America, while its former parent company retains the rights in the rest of the world.[3][4]
In 1929, H. K. Mulford Company merged with Sharpe and Dohme, Inc. This company brought to the future Merck & Co, Inc vaccine technology, including immunization of cavalry horses in World War I and delivery of a diphtheria antitoxin in 1925.[5]
1950 to 2000[edit]
In 1953, Merck & Co. merged with Philadelphia-based Sharp & Dohme, Inc., founded by Alpheus Phineas Sharp and Carl Friedrich Louis Dohme in 1845, becoming the largest US drugmaker.[6][7] The merger combined Merck & Co.'s strength in scientific research and chemical manufacturing with Sharp & Dohme's sales and distribution system and its marketing expertise. The combined company kept the trade name Merck in the United States and Canada, and as Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside North America. In 1965 Merck & Co. acquired Charles E. Frosst Ltd. of Montreal, Canada (founded 1899) and created Merck-Frosst Canada, Inc., as its Canadian subsidiary and pharmaceutical research facility. Merck & Co. closed this facility in July 2010,[8] and the company was renamed Merck Canada in 2011.
The company was incorporated in New Jersey in 1970.[9] It has an operating subsidiary, KBI Inc., which was originally formed as a joint venture with AstraZeneca.[9] In November 1993, Merck & Co. completed a $6 billion purchase of Medco Containment Services Inc., one of the largest mail-order pharmacy and managed-care drug companies.[10] Merck & Co. spun Medco off ten years later, and on August 20, 2003, Medco Health Solutions began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] (In 2012, Medco merged with, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of, Express Scripts Holding Co.)[12]
2001 to present[edit]
In November 2009, Merck & Co. announced that it would merge with competitor Schering-Plough in a US$41 billion deal.[13][14][15][16] Although Merck & Co. was in reality acquiring Schering-Plough, the purchase was structured on paper as a "reverse merger", in which "Old" Merck & Co. was renamed Merck Sharpe & Dohme, and Schering-Plough renamed as "Merck & Co., Inc." so that it could, technically, continue as the surviving public corporation.[17] The maneuver was an attempt to preserve Schering-Plough's rights to market Remicade, which was ultimately decided by arbitration.[18] The merger was completed on 2009-11-04. As of 2015[update], Merck Sharp & Dohme remains a subsidiary of the Merck & Co. parent.[19]
As of December 2013, the US company had approximately 76,000 employees in 120 countries with 31 factories worldwide. It is one of the world's seven largest pharmaceutical companies. The Merck Company Foundation has distributed more than $480 million to educational and non-profit organizations since it was founded in 1957 (and $740 million in overall charitable distributions).[20][21] On December 7, 2012, the foundation announced that it was ending its donations to the Boy Scouts of America because of "its policy that excludes members on the basis of sexual orientation", which "directly conflicts with the Merck Foundation's giving guidelines."[22] In October 2013, Merck & Co. announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in an attempt to cut $2.5bn (£1.5bn) from its costs by 2015. The company's shares rose 2.35% to US$48.73 in New York trading after it announced the cuts. The new losses, combined with 7,500 job cuts announced in 2011 and 2012, amount in total to 20% of its workforce.[23]
In June 2014 Merck & Co. announced its acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals for approximately $3.85 billion.[24] In December 2014 Merck & Co. announced they would be spending $8.4 billion to buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals.[25] Later in the same month the company acquired the Swiss biotechnology company OncoEthix for up to $375 million dependent upon certain milestone achievements.[26]
In July 2015 Merck & Co. and Ablynx expanded their 18 month old immuno-oncology collaboration by four years, generating a potential $4.4 billion in milestone payments for the Abylnx.[27] Days later Merck & Co. announced it would spend $95 million up front on collaborating with cCAM Biotherapeutics and its lead candidate (an early-stage treatment similar to Keytruda). The company is due up to $510 million more, which is tied to clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Merck & Co. will bring in CM-24, an antibody designed to block the immune checkpoint CEACAM1.[28]
In January 2016 Merck & Co. announced two new partnerships; the first with Quartet Medicine and its small molecule pain treatments,[29] the second with Complix investigating intracellular cancer targets,[30] with both collaborations potentially generating up to $595 million and $280 million respectively. Days later the company announced it would acquire IOmet Pharma, with IOmet becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co. The acquisition includes IOmets IDO (indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1), TDO (Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase), and dual-acting inhibitors.[31] In June, the company announced its acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals for $1.25 billion, gaining Afferents lead compound - AF-219 - used to block P2X3 receptors.[32]
In April 2017, Merck Animal Health acquired Brazilian animal health product manufacturer, Vallée S.A..[33]
"Merck" name legal dispute[edit]
In 191 of 193 countries the original Merck company, the Merck Group of Darmstadt, owns the rights to the "Merck" name. In the United States and Canada the company trades under the name EMD (an abbreviation of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt). In the United States and Canada Merck & Co. holds the rights to the trademark "Merck", while in the rest of the world the company trades under the name MSD (an abbreviation of Merck, Sharp & Dohme).
In 2015 the Merck Group adopted a new logo and said it will be "much more aggressive" about protecting the brand of "the real Merck."[34] Merck of Darmstadt has initiated litigation against its former subsidiary, Merck & Co. (MSD) of Kenilworth, in several countries over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom.[35] The judge also held that MSD's use of "Merck" as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck's trade mark rights in the UK.[36]
In response to the ruling, MSD initiated counter-litigation in the United States in January 2016 by filing a federal lawsuit which accused its former parent company of "infringing on its trademark" through actions that included the increased usage of “Merck KGaA” and “MERCK” in branding in the US as well as on its social media presence. Further Merck & Co. has also accused the Merck Group of federal trademark dilution, unfair competition, false advertising, deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and cybersquatting. The case came to a head when a research scientist believed he was communicating with Merck & Co regarding a research grant in oncology, when in fact they were talking with the Merck Group. As a result, Merck & Co. asked the federal court to stop the Merck Group from using “Merck” on any products or marketing materials in the United States. As a direct result, Merck & Co is seeking “all monetary gains, profits, and advantages” made by the Merck Group and three-times the damage, plus additional punitive damages.[37]

On April 23, 2014, Robert M. Davis, formerly CFO of Baxter International, became Merck's CFO.[39] Davis replaced Peter N. Kellogg, who held the post from 2007.[39]
Products[edit]




Gardasil


Current[edit]
As of August 2014, Merck's research and development effort has led to the approval of more new drugs than that of any other company. Research performed at Merck has led to U.S. FDA approval of 63 New Molecular Entities.[40] In 2014, Merck's major products included[41]

Januvia (sitagliptin), a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In 2013, Januvia was the second largest selling diabetes drug worldwide,[42] with $4.0 billion in worldwide sales. Januvia is commonly paired with the generic anti-diabetes drug metformin. It has been popular due in part because unlike many other diabetes drugs, it causes little or no weight gain and is not associated with hypoglycemic episodes.[43][44] Merck also sells a single pill combination drug containing both Januvia and metformin under the trade name Janumet. There has been some concern that treatment with Januvia and other DPP-IV inhibitors may be associated with a modestly increased risk of pancreatitis.[45]
Zetia (ezetimibe) is a drug for hypercholesterolemia that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Sales in 2013 amounted to $2.7 billion. Zetia has been controversial, as it was initially approved based on its impact on serum cholesterol levels without proof that it actually impacted the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Results of the IMPROVE-IT study, however, introduced at the 2014 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, showed a statistically significant, albeit modest, benefit in adding Zetia to simvastatin for high-risk, post-acute-coronary-syndrome patients.[46]
Remicade (infliximab) is a monoclonal antibody directed toward the cytokine TNF-alpha and used for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and others. Remicade and other TNF-alpha inhibitors exhibit additive therapeutic effects with methotrexate and improve quality of life. Adverse effects include increased risk of infection and certain cancers.[47]
Gardasil (recombinant human papilloma virus vaccine) is a vaccine against multiple serotypes of human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer worldwide.[48]
Isentress (raltegravir) is a human immunodeficiency virus integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. It is the first anti-HIV compound having this mechanism of action.[49] Sales in 2013 were $1.8 billion. It is part of one of several first line treatment regimens recommended by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.[50]
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is an immune modulator for the treatment of cancer. On September 4, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as a breakthrough therapy for melanoma treatment.[51] In clinical trials, pembrolzumab provided partial tumor regression in about one quarter of patients, many of whom have not seen further progression of their disease in over 6 months of follow-up.[52]
Invanz (Ertapenem) is an injectable antibiotic, rights to which Merck has owned since 1999.[19] As of 2015. Merck was in a legal dispute with the Taiwanese company Savior Lifetec over their attempt to secure rights to sell a generic version of this drug in the United States.[19]

Other products[edit]

Mexsana, an antiseptic medicated powder

Legacy products[edit]
Vaccines[edit]
Medically important vaccines developed at Merck include the first mumps vaccine,[53] the first rubella vaccine,[54] and the first trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR vaccine),[55] each of which was developed by Merck scientist Maurice Hilleman. The incidence of rubella-associated birth defects fell from up to 10,000 per year in the U.S. to zero in the aftermath of the rubella vaccine's development.[56] Hilleman also developed the first Hepatitis B vaccine[57] and the first varicella vaccine, for chickenpox.[58]
Thiazide anti-hypertensives[edit]
The thiazide diuretics were discovered developed by scientists Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of Merck and Co. in the 1950s,[59] and led to the marketing of the first drug of this class, chlorothiazide, under the trade name Duiril in 1958.[60] The research leading to the discovery of chlorothiazide, leading to "the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension" was recognized by a special Public Health Award from the Lasker Foundation in 1975.[61]
First statin[edit]
Merck scientists also developed lovastatin, the first drug of the statin class.[62] It was marketed under the trade name Mevacor.
Antibacterials[edit]
Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were a ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.[63])[64] Although Merck's agreement with Rutgers gave it exclusive rights to streptomycin, at Wakman's request the company renegotiated the agreement, returning the rights to the university in exchange for a royalty. The university then set up non-exclusive licenses with seven companies to ensure a reliable supply of the antibiotic.[65]
In 1985 Merck received approval for imipenem, the first member of the carbapenem class of antibiotics. Antibiotics of the carbapenem class play an important role in treatment guidelines for certain hospital-acquired and multi-drug resistant infections.[66][67]
Vioxx[edit]
In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as rofecoxib), a Merck product for treating arthritis. Vioxx was designed as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. Such compounds were expected to cause less gastrointestinal bleeding than older anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, which were associated with 20,000 hospitalizations and 2000 deaths each year.[68][non-primary source needed] Vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history.[citation needed]
Thereafter, studies by Merck and by others found an increased risk of heart attack associated with Vioxx use when compared with naproxen. Merck adjusted the labeling of Vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002.[citation needed]
On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a clinical trial it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months.[69] On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on September 30. An analysis for the period 1999-2004, based on U.S. Medical Expenditure Survey data, reported that Vioxx was associated with 46,783 heart attacks, and along with the other popular COX-2 inhibitor Celebrex, an estimated 26,603 deaths from both.[70][non-primary source needed]
About 50,000 people sued Merck, claiming they or their family members had suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx.[71] In November 2007, Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle most of the pending Vioxx lawsuits.[72] The settlement required that claimants provide medical and pharmacy records confirming the occurrence of a heart attack, ischemic stroke, or sudden cardiac death; the receipt of at least 30 Vioxx pills within 60 days prior to the injury or death; and confirmation of Vioxx being used within 14 days of the Vioxx-related event.[73] The settlement was generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for Merck, considering that original estimates of Merck's liability reached between $10 billion and $25 billion.[72] In fact, as of mid-2008, when the plaintiff class had reached the threshold percentage required by Merck to go through with the settlement, plaintiffs had prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that had reached juries, all with relatively small awards.[71]
According to internal e-mail traffic released at a later lawsuit, Merck had a list of doctors critical of Vioxx to be "neutralized" or "discredited." "We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live," wrote an employee. A Stanford Medical School professor said that Merck was engaged in intimidation of researchers and infringement upon academic freedom.[74]
On May 20, 2008, Merck settled for $58 million with 30 states alleging that Merck engaged in deceptive marketing tactics to promote Vioxx.[75] All its new television pain-advertisements must be vetted by the Food and Drug Administration and changed or delayed upon request until 2018.[76]
Mectizan[edit]
In 1987, Merck & Co. began a program with UNICEF to donate its new drug Mectizan to "all that need it for as long as needed"[77] in an effort to combat Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, primarily in Africa. Up to that point, the World Health Organization had fought the disease through the use of insecticides to lower the population of its primary vector, the Black Fly.[78] However, when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease, the WHO agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies. Merck's involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world,[79] and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used as part of the Mectizan Donation Program that covers countries such as Yemen and in African countries.[80]
More than 700 million people have been treated since the inception of the program with 80 million people still undergoing treatment in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen. Blindness caused by onchocerciasis is decreasing and there are regions of Latin America and Africa that have been shown to have completely eliminated the disease altogether.[80]
Fosamax[edit]
Fosamax (alendronate) is a bisphosphonate used for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and for the prevention of skeletal problems in certain cancers. The American College of Clinical Endocrinology, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the North American Menopause Society and the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommend alendronate and certain other bisphosphonates as first line treatments for post-menopausal osteopotosis.[81][82][83][84] Long-term treatment with bisphosponates produces anti-fracture and bone mineral density effects that persist for 3–5 years after an initial 3–5 years of treatment.[85] Alendronate reduces the risk of hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures by 35-39%.[86][87]
In December 2013, Merck agreed to pay a total of $27.7 million to 1,200 plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit alleging that the company's osteoporosis drug had caused them to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw. Prior to the settlement, Merck had prevailed in 3 of 5 so-called bellwether trials. Approximately 4000 cases still await adjudiction or settlement as of August 2014.[88]
Society and culture[edit]
Patient assistance programs[edit]
Merck & Co. was one of the first American pharmaceutical companies to offer assistance to those unable to afford its medications, beginning a program in the 1950s.[89] Merck & Co. offers seven patient assistance programs, each with specific eligibility requirements.[90][91]
Mass retrenchment[edit]
As of January 2015, 30000 people have been forced to leave the company due to economic reasons and Singapore's branch has been the most affected.
Sham medical journal[edit]
From 2002 through 2005 the Australian affiliate of Merck paid Elsevier an undisclosed amount to publish eight issues of a medical journal, the Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine. Although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer-reviewed journal, without any indication that Merck had paid for it, the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to Merck. The misleading publication came to light in 2009 during a personal injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx; 9 of 29 articles in the journal's second issue referred positively to Vioxx.[92] In 2009, the CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Michael Hansen, admitted that the practice was "unacceptable".[93]
Hilleman Laboratories[edit]
Merck and the Wellcome trust jointly fund the Hilleman Laboratories, an India-based non-profit research organization dedicated to the development of low cost vaccines for use in developing countries. Current projects include the development of low cost, thermostable vaccines for the prevention of cholera, rotavirus, and meningitis.[94]
Medicaid overbilling[edit]
A US Justice Department fraud investigation began in 2000 when allegations were brought in two separate lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act.[95] They alleged that Merck failed to pay proper rebates to Medicaid and other health care programs and paid illegal remuneration to health care providers.[96] On February 7, 2008 Merck agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle charges that it routinely overbilled Medicaid for its most popular medicines. The settlement was one of the largest pharmaceutical settlements in history. The federal government received more than $360 million, plus 49 states and Washington, DC, received over $290 million. One whistleblower received a $68 million reward.[95][97] Merck made the settlement without an admission of liability or wrongdoing.[98]
Environmental record[edit]
Merck & Co. once used methylene chloride, an animal carcinogen on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's list of pollutants, as a solvent in some of its manufacturing processes. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced.[99]
In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for volatile organic compound (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by 680,000 lb (310,000 kg) a year.[100]

Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), d.b.a. Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside the United States and Canada, is an American pharmaceutical company and one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.
The company was established in 1891 as the United States subsidiary of the German company Merck, which was founded in 1668 by the Merck family. Merck & Co. was nationalized by the US government during World War I and subsequently established as an independent American company in 1917. While it operates as Merck & Co. in North America, the original Merck based in Darmstadt holds the rights to the Merck name everywhere else. Merck & Co. is the world's seventh largest pharmaceutical company by market capitalization and revenue. Its headquarters is located in Kenilworth, New Jersey.[2]
Merck & Co. publishes The Merck Manuals, a series of medical reference books for physicians, nurses, and technicians. These include the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, the world's best-selling medical reference. The Merck Index, a compendium of chemical compounds, was formerly published by Merck & Co. before being acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2012.

Company history[edit]
Roots and early history[edit]
Main article: Merck Group




The Angel Pharmacy in Darmstadt, the beginning of the Merck company


Merck & Co. traces its origins to its original German parent company Merck, which was established by the Merck family in 1668 when Jacob Friedrich Merck purchased a drug store in Darmstadt. In the 19th century, the Merck company in Darmstadt evolved from a pharmacy to a major pharmaceutical company which pioneered the commercial manufacture of morphine.
In 1891, family member George (Georg) Merck emigrated to the United States and set up Merck & Co. in New York as the US subsidiary of the family company. Merck & Co. operated from 1891 to 1917 as the US subsidiary of the Merck Group.
Nationalization[edit]
The Merck Group's US subsidiary Merck & Co. was nationalized by the US government in 1917 and re-established as an independent American company. Until the end of World War II, the company was led by George W. Merck. Merck & Co. hold the trademark rights to the "Merck" name in North America, while its former parent company retains the rights in the rest of the world.[3][4]
In 1929, H. K. Mulford Company merged with Sharpe and Dohme, Inc. This company brought to the future Merck & Co, Inc vaccine technology, including immunization of cavalry horses in World War I and delivery of a diphtheria antitoxin in 1925.[5]
1950 to 2000[edit]
In 1953, Merck & Co. merged with Philadelphia-based Sharp & Dohme, Inc., founded by Alpheus Phineas Sharp and Carl Friedrich Louis Dohme in 1845, becoming the largest US drugmaker.[6][7] The merger combined Merck & Co.'s strength in scientific research and chemical manufacturing with Sharp & Dohme's sales and distribution system and its marketing expertise. The combined company kept the trade name Merck in the United States and Canada, and as Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside North America. In 1965 Merck & Co. acquired Charles E. Frosst Ltd. of Montreal, Canada (founded 1899) and created Merck-Frosst Canada, Inc., as its Canadian subsidiary and pharmaceutical research facility. Merck & Co. closed this facility in July 2010,[8] and the company was renamed Merck Canada in 2011.
The company was incorporated in New Jersey in 1970.[9] It has an operating subsidiary, KBI Inc., which was originally formed as a joint venture with AstraZeneca.[9] In November 1993, Merck & Co. completed a $6 billion purchase of Medco Containment Services Inc., one of the largest mail-order pharmacy and managed-care drug companies.[10] Merck & Co. spun Medco off ten years later, and on August 20, 2003, Medco Health Solutions began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] (In 2012, Medco merged with, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of, Express Scripts Holding Co.)[12]
2001 to present[edit]
In November 2009, Merck & Co. announced that it would merge with competitor Schering-Plough in a US$41 billion deal.[13][14][15][16] Although Merck & Co. was in reality acquiring Schering-Plough, the purchase was structured on paper as a "reverse merger", in which "Old" Merck & Co. was renamed Merck Sharpe & Dohme, and Schering-Plough renamed as "Merck & Co., Inc." so that it could, technically, continue as the surviving public corporation.[17] The maneuver was an attempt to preserve Schering-Plough's rights to market Remicade, which was ultimately decided by arbitration.[18] The merger was completed on 2009-11-04. As of 2015[update], Merck Sharp & Dohme remains a subsidiary of the Merck & Co. parent.[19]
As of December 2013, the US company had approximately 76,000 employees in 120 countries with 31 factories worldwide. It is one of the world's seven largest pharmaceutical companies. The Merck Company Foundation has distributed more than $480 million to educational and non-profit organizations since it was founded in 1957 (and $740 million in overall charitable distributions).[20][21] On December 7, 2012, the foundation announced that it was ending its donations to the Boy Scouts of America because of "its policy that excludes members on the basis of sexual orientation", which "directly conflicts with the Merck Foundation's giving guidelines."[22] In October 2013, Merck & Co. announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in an attempt to cut $2.5bn (£1.5bn) from its costs by 2015. The company's shares rose 2.35% to US$48.73 in New York trading after it announced the cuts. The new losses, combined with 7,500 job cuts announced in 2011 and 2012, amount in total to 20% of its workforce.[23]
In June 2014 Merck & Co. announced its acquisition of Idenix Pharmaceuticals for approximately $3.85 billion.[24] In December 2014 Merck & Co. announced they would be spending $8.4 billion to buy Cubist Pharmaceuticals.[25] Later in the same month the company acquired the Swiss biotechnology company OncoEthix for up to $375 million dependent upon certain milestone achievements.[26]
In July 2015 Merck & Co. and Ablynx expanded their 18 month old immuno-oncology collaboration by four years, generating a potential $4.4 billion in milestone payments for the Abylnx.[27] Days later Merck & Co. announced it would spend $95 million up front on collaborating with cCAM Biotherapeutics and its lead candidate (an early-stage treatment similar to Keytruda). The company is due up to $510 million more, which is tied to clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Merck & Co. will bring in CM-24, an antibody designed to block the immune checkpoint CEACAM1.[28]
In January 2016 Merck & Co. announced two new partnerships; the first with Quartet Medicine and its small molecule pain treatments,[29] the second with Complix investigating intracellular cancer targets,[30] with both collaborations potentially generating up to $595 million and $280 million respectively. Days later the company announced it would acquire IOmet Pharma, with IOmet becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co. The acquisition includes IOmets IDO (indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1), TDO (Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase), and dual-acting inhibitors.[31] In June, the company announced its acquisition of Afferent Pharmaceuticals for $1.25 billion, gaining Afferents lead compound - AF-219 - used to block P2X3 receptors.[32]
In April 2017, Merck Animal Health acquired Brazilian animal health product manufacturer, Vallée S.A..[33]
"Merck" name legal dispute[edit]
In 191 of 193 countries the original Merck company, the Merck Group of Darmstadt, owns the rights to the "Merck" name. In the United States and Canada the company trades under the name EMD (an abbreviation of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt). In the United States and Canada Merck & Co. holds the rights to the trademark "Merck", while in the rest of the world the company trades under the name MSD (an abbreviation of Merck, Sharp & Dohme).
In 2015 the Merck Group adopted a new logo and said it will be "much more aggressive" about protecting the brand of "the real Merck."[34] Merck of Darmstadt has initiated litigation against its former subsidiary, Merck & Co. (MSD) of Kenilworth, in several countries over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom.[35] The judge also held that MSD's use of "Merck" as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck's trade mark rights in the UK.[36]
In response to the ruling, MSD initiated counter-litigation in the United States in January 2016 by filing a federal lawsuit which accused its former parent company of "infringing on its trademark" through actions that included the increased usage of “Merck KGaA” and “MERCK” in branding in the US as well as on its social media presence. Further Merck & Co. has also accused the Merck Group of federal trademark dilution, unfair competition, false advertising, deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and cybersquatting. The case came to a head when a research scientist believed he was communicating with Merck & Co regarding a research grant in oncology, when in fact they were talking with the Merck Group. As a result, Merck & Co. asked the federal court to stop the Merck Group from using “Merck” on any products or marketing materials in the United States. As a direct result, Merck & Co is seeking “all monetary gains, profits, and advantages” made by the Merck Group and three-times the damage, plus additional punitive damages.[37]

On April 23, 2014, Robert M. Davis, formerly CFO of Baxter International, became Merck's CFO.[39] Davis replaced Peter N. Kellogg, who held the post from 2007.[39]
Products[edit]




Gardasil


Current[edit]
As of August 2014, Merck's research and development effort has led to the approval of more new drugs than that of any other company. Research performed at Merck has led to U.S. FDA approval of 63 New Molecular Entities.[40] In 2014, Merck's major products included[41]

Januvia (sitagliptin), a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In 2013, Januvia was the second largest selling diabetes drug worldwide,[42] with $4.0 billion in worldwide sales. Januvia is commonly paired with the generic anti-diabetes drug metformin. It has been popular due in part because unlike many other diabetes drugs, it causes little or no weight gain and is not associated with hypoglycemic episodes.[43][44] Merck also sells a single pill combination drug containing both Januvia and metformin under the trade name Janumet. There has been some concern that treatment with Januvia and other DPP-IV inhibitors may be associated with a modestly increased risk of pancreatitis.[45]
Zetia (ezetimibe) is a drug for hypercholesterolemia that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Sales in 2013 amounted to $2.7 billion. Zetia has been controversial, as it was initially approved based on its impact on serum cholesterol levels without proof that it actually impacted the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Results of the IMPROVE-IT study, however, introduced at the 2014 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, showed a statistically significant, albeit modest, benefit in adding Zetia to simvastatin for high-risk, post-acute-coronary-syndrome patients.[46]
Remicade (infliximab) is a monoclonal antibody directed toward the cytokine TNF-alpha and used for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and others. Remicade and other TNF-alpha inhibitors exhibit additive therapeutic effects with methotrexate and improve quality of life. Adverse effects include increased risk of infection and certain cancers.[47]
Gardasil (recombinant human papilloma virus vaccine) is a vaccine against multiple serotypes of human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer worldwide.[48]
Isentress (raltegravir) is a human immunodeficiency virus integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. It is the first anti-HIV compound having this mechanism of action.[49] Sales in 2013 were $1.8 billion. It is part of one of several first line treatment regimens recommended by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.[50]
Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is an immune modulator for the treatment of cancer. On September 4, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as a breakthrough therapy for melanoma treatment.[51] In clinical trials, pembrolzumab provided partial tumor regression in about one quarter of patients, many of whom have not seen further progression of their disease in over 6 months of follow-up.[52]
Invanz (Ertapenem) is an injectable antibiotic, rights to which Merck has owned since 1999.[19] As of 2015. Merck was in a legal dispute with the Taiwanese company Savior Lifetec over their attempt to secure rights to sell a generic version of this drug in the United States.[19]

Other products[edit]

Mexsana, an antiseptic medicated powder

Legacy products[edit]
Vaccines[edit]
Medically important vaccines developed at Merck include the first mumps vaccine,[53] the first rubella vaccine,[54] and the first trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR vaccine),[55] each of which was developed by Merck scientist Maurice Hilleman. The incidence of rubella-associated birth defects fell from up to 10,000 per year in the U.S. to zero in the aftermath of the rubella vaccine's development.[56] Hilleman also developed the first Hepatitis B vaccine[57] and the first varicella vaccine, for chickenpox.[58]
Thiazide anti-hypertensives[edit]
The thiazide diuretics were discovered developed by scientists Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of Merck and Co. in the 1950s,[59] and led to the marketing of the first drug of this class, chlorothiazide, under the trade name Duiril in 1958.[60] The research leading to the discovery of chlorothiazide, leading to "the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension" was recognized by a special Public Health Award from the Lasker Foundation in 1975.[61]
First statin[edit]
Merck scientists also developed lovastatin, the first drug of the statin class.[62] It was marketed under the trade name Mevacor.
Antibacterials[edit]
Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were a ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.[63])[64] Although Merck's agreement with Rutgers gave it exclusive rights to streptomycin, at Wakman's request the company renegotiated the agreement, returning the rights to the university in exchange for a royalty. The university then set up non-exclusive licenses with seven companies to ensure a reliable supply of the antibiotic.[65]
In 1985 Merck received approval for imipenem, the first member of the carbapenem class of antibiotics. Antibiotics of the carbapenem class play an important role in treatment guidelines for certain hospital-acquired and multi-drug resistant infections.[66][67]
Vioxx[edit]
In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as rofecoxib), a Merck product for treating arthritis. Vioxx was designed as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. Such compounds were expected to cause less gastrointestinal bleeding than older anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, which were associated with 20,000 hospitalizations and 2000 deaths each year.[68][non-primary source needed] Vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history.[citation needed]
Thereafter, studies by Merck and by others found an increased risk of heart attack associated with Vioxx use when compared with naproxen. Merck adjusted the labeling of Vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002.[citation needed]
On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a clinical trial it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months.[69] On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on September 30. An analysis for the period 1999-2004, based on U.S. Medical Expenditure Survey data, reported that Vioxx was associated with 46,783 heart attacks, and along with the other popular COX-2 inhibitor Celebrex, an estimated 26,603 deaths from both.[70][non-primary source needed]
About 50,000 people sued Merck, claiming they or their family members had suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx.[71] In November 2007, Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle most of the pending Vioxx lawsuits.[72] The settlement required that claimants provide medical and pharmacy records confirming the occurrence of a heart attack, ischemic stroke, or sudden cardiac death; the receipt of at least 30 Vioxx pills within 60 days prior to the injury or death; and confirmation of Vioxx being used within 14 days of the Vioxx-related event.[73] The settlement was generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for Merck, considering that original estimates of Merck's liability reached between $10 billion and $25 billion.[72] In fact, as of mid-2008, when the plaintiff class had reached the threshold percentage required by Merck to go through with the settlement, plaintiffs had prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that had reached juries, all with relatively small awards.[71]
According to internal e-mail traffic released at a later lawsuit, Merck had a list of doctors critical of Vioxx to be "neutralized" or "discredited." "We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live," wrote an employee. A Stanford Medical School professor said that Merck was engaged in intimidation of researchers and infringement upon academic freedom.[74]
On May 20, 2008, Merck settled for $58 million with 30 states alleging that Merck engaged in deceptive marketing tactics to promote Vioxx.[75] All its new television pain-advertisements must be vetted by the Food and Drug Administration and changed or delayed upon request until 2018.[76]
Mectizan[edit]
In 1987, Merck & Co. began a program with UNICEF to donate its new drug Mectizan to "all that need it for as long as needed"[77] in an effort to combat Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, primarily in Africa. Up to that point, the World Health Organization had fought the disease through the use of insecticides to lower the population of its primary vector, the Black Fly.[78] However, when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease, the WHO agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies. Merck's involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world,[79] and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used as part of the Mectizan Donation Program that covers countries such as Yemen and in African countries.[80]
More than 700 million people have been treated since the inception of the program with 80 million people still undergoing treatment in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen. Blindness caused by onchocerciasis is decreasing and there are regions of Latin America and Africa that have been shown to have completely eliminated the disease altogether.[80]
Fosamax[edit]
Fosamax (alendronate) is a bisphosphonate used for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and for the prevention of skeletal problems in certain cancers. The American College of Clinical Endocrinology, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the North American Menopause Society and the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommend alendronate and certain other bisphosphonates as first line treatments for post-menopausal osteopotosis.[81][82][83][84] Long-term treatment with bisphosponates produces anti-fracture and bone mineral density effects that persist for 3–5 years after an initial 3–5 years of treatment.[85] Alendronate reduces the risk of hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures by 35-39%.[86][87]
In December 2013, Merck agreed to pay a total of $27.7 million to 1,200 plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit alleging that the company's osteoporosis drug had caused them to develop osteonecrosis of the jaw. Prior to the settlement, Merck had prevailed in 3 of 5 so-called bellwether trials. Approximately 4000 cases still await adjudiction or settlement as of August 2014.[88]
Society and culture[edit]
Patient assistance programs[edit]
Merck & Co. was one of the first American pharmaceutical companies to offer assistance to those unable to afford its medications, beginning a program in the 1950s.[89] Merck & Co. offers seven patient assistance programs, each with specific eligibility requirements.[90][91]
Mass retrenchment[edit]
As of January 2015, 30000 people have been forced to leave the company due to economic reasons and Singapore's branch has been the most affected.
Sham medical journal[edit]
From 2002 through 2005 the Australian affiliate of Merck paid Elsevier an undisclosed amount to publish eight issues of a medical journal, the Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine. Although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer-reviewed journal, without any indication that Merck had paid for it, the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to Merck. The misleading publication came to light in 2009 during a personal injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx; 9 of 29 articles in the journal's second issue referred positively to Vioxx.[92] In 2009, the CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Michael Hansen, admitted that the practice was "unacceptable".[93]
Hilleman Laboratories[edit]
Merck and the Wellcome trust jointly fund the Hilleman Laboratories, an India-based non-profit research organization dedicated to the development of low cost vaccines for use in developing countries. Current projects include the development of low cost, thermostable vaccines for the prevention of cholera, rotavirus, and meningitis.[94]
Medicaid overbilling[edit]
A US Justice Department fraud investigation began in 2000 when allegations were brought in two separate lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act.[95] They alleged that Merck failed to pay proper rebates to Medicaid and other health care programs and paid illegal remuneration to health care providers.[96] On February 7, 2008 Merck agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle charges that it routinely overbilled Medicaid for its most popular medicines. The settlement was one of the largest pharmaceutical settlements in history. The federal government received more than $360 million, plus 49 states and Washington, DC, received over $290 million. One whistleblower received a $68 million reward.[95][97] Merck made the settlement without an admission of liability or wrongdoing.[98]
Environmental record[edit]
Merck & Co. once used methylene chloride, an animal carcinogen on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's list of pollutants, as a solvent in some of its manufacturing processes. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced.[99]
In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for volatile organic compound (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by 680,000 lb (310,000 kg) a year.[100]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
