 Welder CD music Product Description

Welder album for sale by Elizabeth Cook was released May 11, 2010 on the Thirty One Tigers label. Elizabeth Cook comes to country music naturally; her parents had a working honky tonk band and her first public performance was on-stage with them when she was just a tyke. Welder songs Early in her recording career, she tried going the mainstream Nashville major-label route, but she was probably too "pure country" for that. Making her home in the indie world, she's free to be herself -- which is how an album as individualistic as Welder came to be -- but her top-shelf talent still attracts big-timers like Don Was, who produced the record. It's telling that "Not California," the only track not written by either Cook or her husband/guitarist/right-hand man Tim Carroll, sounds immediately anomalous in its broad, power ballad feel and seems like a conscious attempt at a "radio song." The rest of the album is pure Cook, not only because her offbeat sensibility and potent, Dolly Parton-like delivery brand everything she does, but because there's more than a bit of autobiography going on here. Cook's mother passed away between Welder and its predecessor, and "Mama's Funeral" is an account of the titular event that paints a portrait devoid of mawkishness or manipulation, coming off more like the work of prime Parton or Tom T. Hall of the late '60s. When she sings unflinchingly -- though not without a touch of black humor -- about a "Heroin Addict Sister," it seems a pretty safe bet that Cook is speaking from some kind of real-life experience, if not being completely literal. And it also seems pretty certain that Carroll is the character at the center of "Rock n Roll Man."   ...See Full Description

Description
Mary Elizabeth’s War Time Recipes, Historic World War I Cook Book:  Subtitled “Containing Many Simple but Excellent Recipes, for Wheatless Cakes and Bread, Meatless Dishes, Sugarless Candies, Delicious War Time Desserts, and Many Other Delectable ‘Economy’ Dishes.”  Cookbook written by Mary Elizabeth Evans and published by Frederick A. Stokes Company, Publishers, New York, in 1918.  Hard cover cookbook with no dust jacket.  164 pages.  Near-mint condition.  Small tear on the back fly sheet.  Pages are all clean and clear.  Binding is tight.  Cover has very slight shelf wear.  Rare copy of an historic cookbook.
In her preface, Evans says she talked with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and learned that “Soldiers do not fight well if underfed, not have they good morale if their families at home are hungry.”  So, she decided, “women’s first war activity should be to cooperate fully with the United States Food Administration.”
Obviously, Evans was well connected, well informed and smart.  So I looked her up.  Wikipedia tells us that that Evans started her own candy company, and it became a group of candy stores and tea rooms run by a women-only business empire, with an anchor store on Fifth Avenue, New York City.  You can read the brief profile here:  https://restaurant-ingthroughhistory.com/2008/09/11/mary-elizabeths-a-new-york-institution/
