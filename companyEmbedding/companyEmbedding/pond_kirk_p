Pond, Kirk P. - The Wall Street Transcript













































 





































Kirk P. Pond
KIRK P. POND is President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the
Board, of Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. Mr. Pond has
worked in the semiconductor industry for more than 34 years, initially
serving in various management positions for Texas Instruments and Timex
Corporation before joining Fairchild Semiconductor as Vice President of
the Logic business in 1984. Four years after the acquisition of
Fairchild by National Semiconductor in 1987, he was named President of
the Standard Products Group representing 75% of National’s operations.
In 1994 he was named Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer
and a member of the Office of the President. In 1996, National chose to
sell its standard product businesses. Mr. Pond recognized an opportunity
to re-launch Fairchild in the pursuit of the underserved multi-market
segment. A year later he executed the first management-led buyout in the
history of the semiconductor industry. Mr. Pond has set the tone for
high growth through new product innovation and strategic acquisitions.
Under his leadership, more than 450 new products are launched each year
and the company has completed seven major acquisitions of international
companies. In August 1999, Fairchild was launched as a public company on
the New York Stock Exchange. He is recognized industry-wide for his
development of the innovative multi-market business model. Mr. Pond
holds a BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Arkansas and
a Master of Business Administration degree from the Wharton School of
the University of Pennsylvania. He has served as Chairman of the Maine
Science and Technology Foundation and on the boards of the National
Association of Manufacturers, Sybron Chemicals and Sematech, an
international semiconductor consortium.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

KIRK P. POND is President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the
Board, of Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. Mr. Pond has
worked in the semiconductor industry for more than 34 years, initially

history of the semiconductor industry. Mr. Pond has set the tone for
high growth through new product innovation and strategic acquisitions.
Under his leadership, more than 450 new products are launched each year
and the company has completed seven major acquisitions of international
companies. In August 1999, Fairchild was launched as a public company on
the New York Stock Exchange. He is recognized industry-wide for his
development of the innovative multi-market business model. Mr. Pond
holds a BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Arkansas and

Hot 25: Kirk Pond

What Kirk Pond says, Kirk Pond does. It's that simple.

When he took Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. out in a leveraged buyout from National Semiconductor Corp. in 1997, Pond, 56, stated his intentions to build a company that serves a variety of markets with high-performance "building block" products-low-priced logic, analog, and discrete semiconductors. Pond's strategy had three elements: develop a lot of products fast; build an efficient, cost-effective, and global manufacturing infrastructure; and deliver superior customer service. He hasn't

deviated one millimeter from that in three years.

Since 1997, when Fairchild's quarterly run rate was roughly $150 million, Pond boosted revenue threefold to $476 million in the third quarter and is projecting fourth-quarter revenue of $490 million. That represents about 5% of the total available market, according to Fairchild.

Operating margins are in the 20% range, which is comparable to companies serving the more glamorous sectors of the semiconductor market. And gross margins are close to 40%, thanks in part to a slew of new products that characteristically command higher prices.

Fairchild introduces about 100 products a quarter, which account for about 32% of revenue. The target is to up that to 40% in the next year or so.

Pond has accomplished these results through a combination of organic growth and acquisition. To date, Fairchild has acquired five businesses, including three that were carve-outs of large companies. Case in point was the 1999 acquisition of Samsung's power devices division for $415 million. While the unit was an important captive supplier for Samsung, it was not a strategic business for the company.

To beef up customer service, Fairchild has spent $55 million in the past two years putting in a PeopleSoft system to replace the myriad legacy systems it inherited from National. And Fairchild continues to spend 3% to 3.5% of its revenue on globalizing its ERP systems.

As for manufacturing operations, Pond reorganized the company at the beginning of the year to set up a global operations organization alongside the six product groups. The reason was to create more flexible global manufacturing and develop common processes for Fairchild's factories.

"It made sense to group all our operation's activities together and have our product divisions responsible for the development of new products, product marketing, and the management of P&Ls," Pond said.

In short, Pond has done what he said he would do: build a viable business.

Financial and market analysts give Fairchild high marks, particularly for integrating its acquisitions.

"Pond really understands the market," said Jim Feldhan, president of Semico Research Corp., Phoenix. "He's a real down-to-earth kind of guy, which is refreshing to see in a CEO."

Indeed, Pond is the antithesis of the fast-talking, high-rolling Silicon Valley chief executive. He's a low-key, straight-shooting leader who's active in his church and likes gardening and spending time with his family. He's also an action-movie buff. "The lower the rating, the better," he quipped.

Pond recently caught "The 6th Day," the latest Arnold Schwarzenegger film. "I wasn't able to make the 1 o'clock showing, but I made the 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon," he said.

His other passion: annihilating mosquitoes. Southern Maine, where Fairchild is headquartered, is a notorious breeding ground for mosquitoes and Pond has spent an inordinate amount of his free time scheming to rid his yard of the pests. His most recent acquisition was a barbecue-size unit that emits a cloud of carbon dioxide that attracts the females and vacuums them into a bag for convenient disposal.

"One ounce is about 86,000 dehydrated mosquitoes," Pond said.

His single-minded attitude toward killing mosquitoes is exceeded only by his zealousness for building his company.

"I have a reputation at Fairchild for absolutely never being satisfied with anything," Pond said. "I have the view that we have so much to do, there isn't a single moment that we don't need to be improving on something."

So get ready for Phase Two of Fairchild's master plan. Pond's goal is to own 10% market share of the building-block business within the next few years. That means doubling the company's revenue to between $4 billion and $5 billion while maintaining the same healthy operating margin.

"In this $50 billion to $60 billion space during the next few years, only a couple-maybe only one-$4 billion to $5 billion players will emerge. I intend for Fairchild to be one of those companies."
