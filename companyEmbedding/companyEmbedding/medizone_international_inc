The Developer of AsepticSure® | Medizone International Inc.


































































































Medizone International Announces a Retirement from the Board of DirectorsJune 21, 2017 – Medizone International, Inc. (OTCQB: MZEI) (Kalamazoo, MI) the developer of AsepticSure, a revolutionary disinfection technology that combines ozone and hydrogen peroxide to achieve unprecedented kill rates of bacteria and viral pathogens in a wide range of commercial applications including healthcare, biodefense, and public health preparedness, announced today that Daniel D. Hoyt has retired from the Board of Directors.
Effective June 21, 2017, Daniel D. Hoyt will retire from the Board and all positions within the company.
“On behalf of our employees, the board, and shareholders, I want to thank Dan for his leadership and commitment to the Company. Since January 2002, Dan has been an active member of the board and he has given a full measure to support our business and our people through the amazing journey of the company,” commented David Esposito. “We wish Dan all the best as he moves into this next chapter of life with his family.”
Medizone continues to execute on plans to establish AsepticSure as a superior solution worldwide to achieve unprecedented kill rates of bacteria and viral pathogens in a wide range of commercial applications including healthcare, biodefense, and public health preparedness. The near term priority market is the United States while the Company continues to support sales and distribution channels in several other markets across the globe.
About Medizone International, Inc.
Founded initially in 1986 to develop treatments for lipid-enveloped viruses, Medizone International, Inc. shifted focus in 2007 to develop a superior disinfectant technology. The company developed the AsepticSure system to combine oxidative compounds (O3 and H202) to produce a unique mixture of free radicals (H2O3 known as trioxidane) with much higher oxidative potential than ozone or hydrogen peroxide alone. After securing broad IP protection for the use of trioxidane for both healthcare facility disinfecting systems and bioterrorism applications, the company released its AsepticSure system for use in Canada, and several other global markets.

AsepticSure® Receives Full Approval of International Electrical Safety StandardsAsepticSure approval of international safety standards clears path for global commercialization
 
KALAMAZOO, Mich., June 21, 2017 – Medizone International, Inc. (OTCQB: MZEI), the developer of AsepticSure®, a revolutionary disinfection technology that combines ozone and hydrogen peroxide to achieve unprecedented kill rates of bacteria and viral pathogens in a wide range of commercial applications including healthcare, biodefense, and public health preparedness, announced today that the Company has received full electrical safety approval for all models of AsepticSure.
The testing and approval was administered by QPS Evaluation Services, a nationally and internationally accredited independent third-party testing, certification and field evaluation body headquartered in Toronto, Canada. The approval means that AsepticSure has achieved full compliance with the applicable international safety standards which provide a baseline requirement that must be met in order to pursue marketing in all jurisdictions, including Canada, USA, South America, EU, Asia, and the Middle East. Although Medizone will be required to apply for a separate approval in each country, compliance with these international safety standards will greatly facilitate this process.
“We are very pleased to announce that AsepticSure technology has received full approval for electrical safety,” said Dr. Michael Shannon, President and Director of Medical Affairs of Medizone International. “With respect to future marketing endeavors in North America, third-party certification of electrical products is mandated by law; without such certification, marketing would not be permitted. Approval of our AsepticSure system is a major step forward towards full commercialization.”
The achievement of full compliance with the relevant international safety standards provides the framework for detailed manufacturing specifications that will be incorporated in the Company’s expanded manufacturing plans.

Corporate History | Medizone International Inc.
























































































Corporate HistoryMedizone International, Inc. Corporate History
Medizone International, Inc. (OTCBB: MZEI) was originally organized to develop treatments for a family of viruses known as lipid enveloped. Diseases such as Hepatitis B and C, HIV/AIDS, Herpes and Epstein Barr are included in this family of common viruses.
While the company still believes there remains great promise in treating many human afflictions with properly administered 03 mixtures, this is no longer our focus at this time.
As of 2008 we began pursuing a new initiative that has since shown great promise in the area of hospital disinfection.
By redirecting the company into this area of growing global concern, management and Medizone’s science team rightly believed that a revenue stream could be developed quickly and at far less cost than through the pursuit of human therapies.
A series of research initiatives spanning 2009 through to late 2010 (investigating new and innovative equipment and protocols for use in destroying the main causative agents of hospital acquired infections) resulted in an unprecedented success across a broad spectrum of bacteria, spores, fungi and viruses.
The primary causative agents of HAI – to which AsepticSure boasts a minimum EPA validated kill of >5 logs, while independent research routinely confirms >6 logs for all bacterial and viral pathogens:

C difficile
E-coli
Pseudomonas aeruginous
MRSA  – Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus
VRE

MRSA – Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus
This is a strain of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria (“staph”) that is resistant to the broad-spectrum antibiotics commonly used to treat it. MRSA is often fatal.
According to the AAOS Study, “the number of hospital admissions for MRSA has exploded in the past decade. By 2005, admissions were triple the number in 2000 and 10-fold higher than in 1995. In 2005, in the United States alone, 368,600 hospital admissions for MRSA — including 94,000 invasive infections — resulted in 18,650 deaths. The number of MRSA fatalities in 2005 surpassed the number of fatalities from hurricane Katrina and AIDS combined and is substantially higher than fatalities at the peak of the U. S. polio epidemic.”

Biological contamination of medical treatment areas such as hospitals and chronic care facilities has recently been identified by several world renowned public health institutions, including the Centers for Disease Control or “CDC” (CDC Report 17 Oct, 2007, copy on file with the Company), as one of the greatest threats to public health and safety in the industrial world.
See CDC Report here: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/ar/InvasiveMRSA_JAMA2007.pdf
Report: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/ar_mrsa_Invasive_FS.html
This concern was reflected in an article recently published in the Science Magazine The Bacteria Fight Back , Vol. 321, No. 5887. (18 July 2008), pp. 356-361, by Gary Taubes which estimated that hospital-based infections in 2006 accounted for almost 100,000 deaths in the US alone.
Corporate Redirection towards Full Hospital Decontamination since 2008

As stated above, early in 2008 the Company’s management and board of directors began to consider other applications of the Company’s core technologies and new technologies with lower development costs with the objective of moving the Company to revenue production in the shortest period of time.
Since that time, management has succeeded in positioning the Company and its recently developed flagship disinfection and decontamination technology, AsepticSure, in readiness for what it believes will be a phenomenal growth opportunity in the field of hospital sterilization. This change in focus was based, in part, on a review of published data on hospital-derived infections, an area of rapidly growing concern in the medical community.
Management determined in early 2008 that there was an outstanding opportunity to build on the Company’s experience with ozone technologies and its bio-oxidative qualities in pursuing this initiative. The Company subsequently shifted its (then) near term efforts towards one of its founding tenets, namely that under the right conditions, ozone can be extremely effective at sterilizing virtually all biological fluids (blood, serum, and plasma and its fractionates) as well as all biologically contaminated equipment and spaces.
The Company believes that Medizone’s unique ozone generating technologies can and will play a vital role in addressing what public health officials and surgeons world-wide are beginning to recognize as “the silent epidemic” (American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, May 2008, copy on file with the Company (“AAOS Study”), a reference to MRSA (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) infection.
Today Medizone is poised to tackle the problems associated with hospital acquired infections ‘head on’ with the already underway roll out of its first production units of AsepticSure.

MRSA has gained tremendous ground since the 1970’s and 1980’s. In the mid-1980s, typically only 1% to 5% of all S. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant, says Henry Chambers, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.  A bug developed that was both far more difficult to treat and, as Chambers says, “pretty adaptive to surviving in hospitals.” Today, 70% to 80% of all S. aureus strains found in hospitals are multidrug-resistant MRSA.

Medizone International, Inc. Prior to 2008
Prior to 2008 the Medizone focus was:
(i) seeking regulatory approval of a precise mixture of ozone and oxygen, and its process of inactivating lipid-enveloped viruses for the intended purpose of decontaminating blood and blood products and assisting in the treatment of certain diseases;
(ii) developing or acquiring the related technology and equipment for the medical application of its products, including a drug production and delivery system; and
(iii) applying its novel technology to the problem of nosocomial infections world-wide. Beginning in 2008, management has re-positioned the Company to pursue an initiative in the field of hospital sterilization.

Code of Ethics | Medizone International Inc.
























































































Code of EthicsGuiding Principles
It is the belief of the Officers and Directors of Medizone that a for profit corporation can best serve the interests of its shareholders by pursuing the development of a corporate paradigm in which the corporation’s intentions remain focused on global need and the opportunity for social contribution in the area of activity the corporation is engaged.
While it is recognized that producing economic benefit for its shareholders is a primary responsibility of the Company and its management, we believe that the economic benefit of shareholders is best served by pursuing a course in which profit follows social contribution. In the long run we believe the planet, the Company and the shareholders will benefit most if the Company remains focused on providing its products and services to the good of as many in need as possible and develops pathways to reach that goal.
We have and always will instruct our principal officers, executive officers and our auditors to present as clear a picture as possible of the Company in its reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe that a corporation that engages in honest dealings should never have a problem with transparency.
The Board of Directors is also committed to the fair and humane treatment of its current and future employees. We believe a happy employee is a productive employee. It is our intention to maintain a personal, supportive, human connection with our present and future employees as the Company grows, just as we expect to maintain supportive and positive relationships with our other associates and customers.
The Company is committed to the highest ethical standards and integrity in its business activities. The Company expects this commitment to extend to its executive officers, directors and employees at all levels.
As customers and the investing public become acquainted with the outstanding products and services offered by the Company and choose to invest in the Company, it is important that they are able to trust that the operations of the Company meet the same high standards as the products and services it offers.
While every Medizone employee is responsible for the consequences of his or her actions, it is executive management, the Board of Directors and the corporate employees, including executive officers, who are the primary guardians of the Company’s ethics. The management and directors of the Company have the added responsibility of setting an example by their personal performance and an attitude that conveys the Company’s ethical values of honesty and respect.
Business Ethics
It is the policy of the Company that each employee of Medizone, regardless of position or location, shall conduct his or her affairs with uncompromising honesty and integrity. All employees, as well as executive officers and directors, shall adhere to the highest standard of conduct, honesty and integrity, regardless of local custom. All employees, officers and directors are expected to be honest and ethical in dealing with each other, with customers, regulators, vendors and other third parties.
Employees must respect the rights of fellow employees and third parties. Their actions must be free from illegal discrimination, libel, slander or harassment. Each person must be accorded equal opportunity, regardless of age, race, sex, sexual preference, color, creed, religion, national origin, marital status, veteran’s status, handicap or disability.
Misconduct will not be excused because it was directed or requested by another person. Each employee should alert management whenever an illegal, dishonest or unethical act is discovered or suspected. No person will ever be penalized for reporting such discoveries or suspicions. Reports may be made anonymously through procedures established by the Board of Directors.
The Company conducts its affairs consistent with the applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where it does business. Business practices, customs and laws differ from country to country.
When conflicts arise between the Company’s ethical practices, and the practices, customs, and the laws of a country or other jurisdiction, the Company will seek to resolve them consistent with its ethical beliefs. If the conflict cannot be resolved consistent with its ethical beliefs, the Company will not proceed with the proposed action giving rise to the conflict.
The following statements address various standards as applied to frequently raised ethical concerns. A violation of the standards contained in this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics will result in corrective action, including possible dismissal.
Public Reports
Medizone is a public company. The Company files periodic and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Its shares are traded publicly and may in the future be listed on one or more national exchanges or included in the Nasdaq Stock Market. The reports and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (and, when appropriate, the exchanges) are made publicly available and posted on the Company’s corporate website.
In addition, it is the Company’s practice to make public announcements on a current basis of material developments at the Company. The Company’s policy and practice will be to ensure that all disclosure made in reports and documents and statements that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications are full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable.
If an employee, officer or director is responsible for assisting in the preparation or review of any report filed under applicable state or federal securities laws or other regulatory standards, he or she must assure that the information contained in the report, particularly in the section or parts of the reports for which he or she is primarily responsible, are complete and accurate and that they are true in every respect.
Furthermore these reports must not contain any misrepresentation of any fact or omit any fact that might be material to a complete understanding of the Company’s results of operations or financial condition or in any other way be misleading to the public.
Employees, officers and directors should report any material misstatement or omission or any suspected fraud in connection with these reports to management or the Board of Directors without fear of reprisal or punishment.
Conflicts of Interest
Employees, as well as executive officers and directors, must avoid any personal activity, investment or association that could appear to interfere with good judgment concerning the best interests of the Company. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (or a committee of disinterested members of the Board of Directors if there is no Audit Committee) must review and approve all proposed transactions involving the Company on the one hand, and any officer or director or significant shareholder on the other.
No employee, officer or director may exploit his or her position or relationship with the Company for personal gain. All employees, officers and directors should avoid even the appearance of such a conflict. For example, there is a likely conflict of interest if an officer, director or employee should:
Cause the Company to engage in business transactions with relatives or friends that would not redound to the benefit of Medizone or that would place the employee, officer, or director or their relatives or friends in a position of conflict with the interests of the Company;
Use nonpublic company, customer, or vendor information for personal gain by the employee, officer, director or their relatives or friends Have more than a modest financial interest in any vendor, customer or competitor;
Receive a loan, or guarantee of obligations, from the Company or a third party as a result of his or her position at the Company; or Compete, or prepare to compete, with the Company while still employed by the Company or in violation of statutory or contractual duties or restrictions.
These are examples only. There are other situations in which a conflict of interest may arise.
Gifts, Bribes and Kickbacks
Other than modest gifts given or received in the normal course of business (including travel or entertainment), no employee, officer, or director or their respective relatives may give gifts to, or receive gifts from, the Company’s customers, clients and vendors. Other gifts may be given or accepted only with prior approval of senior management.
In no event should the employee, officer or director put the Company or himself or herself in a position that would be embarrassing if the gift was made public.
Dealing with government employees is often different from dealing with private persons. Many governmental bodies strictly prohibit the receipt of any gratuities by their employees, including meals and entertainment. Employees, officers and directors must be aware of and strictly follow these prohibitions.
Any employee, officer or director who pays or receives bribes or kickbacks will be immediately terminated and reported, as warranted, to the appropriate authorities. A kickback or bribe includes any item intended to improperly obtain favorable treatment, regardless of the appropriateness of such a practice in local custom or law.
Loans
No officer or director may request or accept a loan or advance from Medizone. As a general rule, the Company will not make loans or advances, including payroll advances, to any employee.
Improper Use or Theft of Company Property
Every employee, officer and director is expected to safeguard the Company’s property from loss or theft, and may not take such property for personal use. Company property includes confidential information, software, computers, office equipment, and supplies.
Employees, officers and directors must appropriately secure all Company property within their control to prevent its unauthorized use.
Using Company computers or communications systems to access or distribute personal or “non-business related” information, data or graphics in violation of the law, or the employee handbook and related policies is strictly prohibited.
Covering Up Mistakes; Falsifying Records; Document Preservation
Mistakes should never be covered up, but should be immediately fully disclosed and corrected. Falsification of any Company, client or third party record is prohibited. The Company’s policy for preservation of corporate documents must be adhered to.
Abuse of Company, Customer, Associate or Vendor Information
No employee, officer or director may use or reveal Company, customer, or vendor confidential or proprietary information to others. This includes business methods, pricing and marketing data, strategy, product information, computer code, screens, forms, experimental research, and information about the Company’s current, former and prospective products, markets, or customers.
Gathering Competitive Information
No employee, officer or director may accept, use or disclose the confidential information of competitors of the Company. When obtaining competitive information, employees, officers and directors must not violate competitors’ rights. Particular care must be taken when dealing with competitors’ clients, ex-clients and ex-employees.
Never ask for confidential or proprietary information. Never ask a person to violate a non-compete or non-disclosure agreement.
Sales: Defamation and Misrepresentation
Aggressive selling should not include misstatements, innuendo or rumors about our competition or their products and financial condition.
Do not make unsupportable promises concerning the Company’s products or services.
Use of Company and Third Party Software
Medizone and third party software may be distributed and disclosed only to persons authorized to use it under applicable license agreements.
Medizone and third party software may not be copied without specific authorization and may only be used to perform assigned responsibilities. All third-party software must be properly licensed. The license agreements for such third party software may place various restrictions on the disclosure, use and copying of software.
Developing Software
Employees involved in the design, development, testing, modification or maintenance of software must not tarnish or undermine the legitimacy and “cleanliness” of the Company’s products by copying or using unauthorized third party software or confidential information.
Employees may not possess, use or discuss proprietary computer code, output, documentation or trade secrets of a non-company party, unless authorized by such party. Intentional duplication or emulation of
the “look and feel” of others’ software is not permissible.
Fair Dealing
No employee, officer or director should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfairdealing practice.
Fair Competition and Antitrust Laws
The Company (including all employees, officers and directors) must comply with all applicable fair competition and antitrust laws. These laws attempt to ensure that businesses compete fairly and honestly and prohibit conduct seeking to reduce or restrain competition.
Political Contributions
No Company funds may be given directly to political candidates. Employees, officers and directors may, however, engage in political activity with their own resources on their own time.
Waivers
This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to all employees, officers and directors. There shall be no waiver of any part of the Code, except by the Board of Directors or a designated committee of the Board of Directors, which will ascertain whether a waiver is appropriate and ensure that the waiver is accompanied by appropriate controls designed to protect the Company.
In the event that any waiver is granted, the waiver will be posted on the Company’s website, thereby allowing the shareholders to evaluate the merits of the particular waiver. Additional disclosure of such a waiver will be contained, to the extent required by law, in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Reporting Ethical Violations
Individual conduct can reinforce an ethical atmosphere and positively influence the conduct of fellow employees and directors. If an individual is powerless to stop suspected misconduct or discover it after it has occurred, it should be report to a supervisor or to the appropriate level of management.
If an individual is still concerned after speaking with a supervisor and local management or if an individual feels uncomfortable speaking with them (for whatever reason), the matter may be reported anonymously by sending a note, with relevant documents, to:
Medizone International, Inc., 
Attention: Chief Executive Officer
4000 Bridgeway, Suite 401,
Sausalito, CA 94965
This report will be dealt with anonymously and confidentially and the person submitting any report will be protected from retaliation.
Conclusion
Any employee who ignores or violates any of Medizone’s ethical standards, and any manager who penalizes a subordinate for trying to follow these ethical standards, will be subject to corrective action, including immediate dismissal. However, it is not the threat of discipline that should govern an individual’s actions.
The Board of Directors, in adopting this code, hopes that all employees, officers and directors share the belief that a dedicated commitment to ethical behavior is the best way to protect the business interests of Medizone International, Inc., and its shareholders, as discussed in the Guiding Principles at the outset of this Code of Ethics.

Medizone International Announces a Retirement from the Board of Directors

		Wed, 21 Jun 2017 20:00:19 +0000



http://www.medizoneint.com/?p=7735

June 21, 2017 – Medizone International, Inc. (OTCQB: MZEI) (Kalamazoo, MI) the developer of AsepticSure, a revolutionary disinfection technology that combines ozone and hydrogen peroxide to achieve unprecedented kill rates of bacteria and viral pathogens in a wide range of commercial applications including healthcare, biodefense, and public health preparedness, announced today that Daniel D. Hoyt has retired from the Board of Directors.
Effective June 21, 2017, Daniel D. Hoyt will retire from the Board and all positions within the company.
“On behalf of our employees, the board, and shareholders, I want to thank Dan for his leadership and commitment to the Company. Since January 2002, Dan has been an active member of the board and he has given a full measure to support our business and our people through the amazing journey of the company,” commented David Esposito. “We wish Dan all the best as he moves into this next chapter of life with his family.”
Medizone continues to execute on plans to establish AsepticSure as a superior solution worldwide to achieve unprecedented kill rates of bacteria and viral pathogens in a wide range of commercial applications including healthcare, biodefense, and public health preparedness. The near term priority market is the United States while the Company continues to support sales and distribution channels in several other markets across the globe.
About Medizone International, Inc.
Founded initially in 1986 to develop treatments for lipid-enveloped viruses, Medizone International, Inc. shifted focus in 2007 to develop a superior disinfectant technology. The company developed the AsepticSure system to combine oxidative compounds (O3 and H202) to produce a unique mixture of free radicals (H2O3 known as trioxidane) with much higher oxidative potential than ozone or hydrogen peroxide alone. After securing broad IP protection for the use of trioxidane for both healthcare facility disinfecting systems and bioterrorism applications, the company released its AsepticSure system for use in Canada, and several other global markets.

AsepticSure approval of international safety standards clears path for global commercialization
 
KALAMAZOO, Mich., June 21, 2017 – Medizone International, Inc. (OTCQB: MZEI), the developer of AsepticSure®, a revolutionary disinfection technology that combines ozone and hydrogen peroxide to achieve unprecedented kill rates of bacteria and viral pathogens in a wide range of commercial applications including healthcare, biodefense, and public health preparedness, announced today that the Company has received full electrical safety approval for all models of AsepticSure.
The testing and approval was administered by QPS Evaluation Services, a nationally and internationally accredited independent third-party testing, certification and field evaluation body headquartered in Toronto, Canada. The approval means that AsepticSure has achieved full compliance with the applicable international safety standards which provide a baseline requirement that must be met in order to pursue marketing in all jurisdictions, including Canada, USA, South America, EU, Asia, and the Middle East. Although Medizone will be required to apply for a separate approval in each country, compliance with these international safety standards will greatly facilitate this process.
“We are very pleased to announce that AsepticSure technology has received full approval for electrical safety,” said Dr. Michael Shannon, President and Director of Medical Affairs of Medizone International. “With respect to future marketing endeavors in North America, third-party certification of electrical products is mandated by law; without such certification, marketing would not be permitted. Approval of our AsepticSure system is a major step forward towards full commercialization.”
The achievement of full compliance with the relevant international safety standards provides the framework for detailed manufacturing specifications that will be incorporated in the Company’s expanded manufacturing plans.

Esposito, Chairman and interim CEO of Medizone International. “This event builds on the work already underway to gain acceptance of AsepticSure in multiple government agencies.”
Medizone International plans to attend the event with a full display of the AsepticSure system and with several members from the sales and engineering teams to address any potential inquiries from attendees.

Recent study highlights the potential of AsepticSure to provide superior cleaning to athletic equipment – A critical need for players, coaches and families
 
KALAMAZOO, Mich., June 15, 2017 – Medizone International, Inc. (OTCQB: MZEI) announces the completion of a study that demonstrates the efficacy of AsepticSure in killing microorganisms found on athletic equipment such as hockey equipment and other protective gear.  This recent scientific evidence in support of AsepticSure opens up the athletic equipment industry within professional, collegiate, and organized sports at all levels as a viable commercial segment in the United States and other key markets in the world.
In this most recent study, conducted by Medizone researchers in Canada, AsepticSure was demonstrated to be an effective means of eliminating microorganisms on commonly used athletic equipment. This study confirms the findings from initial studies supporting the use of AsepticSure as a general environmental disinfectant. AsepticSure’s proprietary technology that combines oxidative compounds (O3 and H202) to produce a unique mixture of free radicals (H2O3 known as trioxidane) with much higher oxidative potential than ozone or hydrogen peroxide alone is safe and effective in support of general cleaning of athletic equipment.
“As part of our robust research and development program, this recent study supports another key advancement in the development of AsepticSure,” commented Michael Shannon, M.A., M.Sc., M.D., President and Director of Medical Affairs for Medizone International. “Our research team continues to be active in discovering new areas of unmet need to demonstrate the positive impact of AsepticSure. We have plans to continue to transfer our current research initiatives into immediate commercial opportunities for AsepticSure.”
The athletic equipment industry is a massive industry with over $65 billion in annual sales in the US alone. The utilization of AsepticSure to support general cleaning of athletic equipment represents an immediate market opportunity for Medizone International. The company is actively pursuing a wide range of business development initiatives with both cleaning companies that service the athletic industry and initiating direct contact with professional and collegiate sports teams.
“We are continually impressed with the leadership of Dr. Shannon and our team of talented researchers for continuing to identify new areas of use for AsepticSure,” said David A. Esposito, Chairman of the Board and interim CEO of Medizone International. “The athletic equipment cleaning industry is a significant, routine expense for professional and collegiate sports team.  In addition, any parent who shuttles kids around from football, hockey or some other sport would appreciate a technology that could provide superior cleaning to the current century old process. We see significant business potential for Medizone in this large market. The opportunity for ongoing, repeat customers is a key part of our commercial plan.”
About Medizone International, Inc.
Founded initially in 1986 to develop treatments for lipid-enveloped viruses, Medizone International, Inc. shifted focus in 2007 to develop a superior disinfectant technology. The company developed the AsepticSure system to combine oxidative compounds (O3 and H202) to produce a unique mixture of free radicals (H2O3 known as trioxidane) with much higher oxidative potential than ozone or hydrogen peroxide alone. After securing broad IP protection for the use of trioxidane for both healthcare facility disinfecting systems and bioterrorism applications, the company released its AsepticSure system for use in Canada, and several other global markets.

Internationally recognized expert Brad Goble to lead Medizone’s efforts to capitalize on government efforts to address bioterrorism countermeasures and public health risks
 
Medizone International, Inc. (OTCQB: MZEI) announces the appointment of bioterrorism expert Brad Goble to lead the company’s efforts to engage with government agencies and organizations tasked with coordinating global resources. He will be responsible for the advancement of AsepticSure® as a key component of programs in support of bioterrorism countermeasures and public health preparedness.
“As governments and affiliated agencies across the globe prepare to combat the growing risks of bioterrorism and major health outbreaks, AsepticSure is ideally positioned to help address these efforts,” commented David A. Esposito, Chairman of the Board and interim CEO of Medizone International. “We continue to look for talented executives with significant commercial experience in contracting with governments and organizations with global reach in the area of biodefense and public health preparedness. Brad Goble has decades of experience working directly with governments and organizations to address these major global concerns and we are pleased he will be leading our efforts to capitalize on the opportunity.”
AsepticSure has demonstrated, in well-designed clinical studies, to successfully eliminate known surrogates for Anthrax, Ebola, SARS, and MERS-CoV. The unique combination of low dose hydrogen peroxide and ozone is well ahead of other technologies in this area and can play a critical role in addressing the need for preparedness for government agencies and coordinated efforts around the world.  Medizone International has solid intellectual property rights in several countries in support of bioterrorism countermeasures.
Goble has played a major role in consulting with governments and public health preparedness agencies around the world, especially in the days after September 11, 2001. “He has had a seat at the table for major initiatives addressing bioterrorism and public health concerns around Ebola and SARS and is relied on for his expertise across the globe,” adds Esposito.
Goble is a native of Toronto, Canada and holds an honors degree in Economics and Commerce from the Royal Military College of Canada and a Master of Business Administration from Queen’s University.
“I am very excited to work with the Medizone team as we support the increasing demand for technology to address the major concerns of bioterrorism and public health outbreaks,” commented Goble. “The AsepticSure system has the potential to play a major role in assisting integrated response teams and well-funded programs across the globe to combat bioterrorism. I look forward to leveraging my existing relationships to open doors that could place AsepticSure on the forefront of meeting the global need for new tools to address these threats.”

Medizone International Announces Next Steps on AsepticSure®

Medizone International prepares plans to submit AsepticSure for FDA approval as a medical device
Kalamazoo, Michigan, Friday, April 7, 2017 — Medizone International, Inc. (OTCQB: MZEI) announced that in a scheduled conference call late Thursday, April 6, 2017, with representatives of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the FDA had advised the Company that they believed AsepticSure should be classified as a medical device.  The FDA representatives recommended that the Company submit a Premarket Notification (“PMN” or “510(k)”) to the FDA and invited Company representatives to schedule follow up meetings to discuss the best approach for introduction of the AsepticSure technology into the U.S. market.  Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) requires device manufacturers who must register, to notify FDA of their intent to market a medical device at least 90 days in advance. This is known as Premarket Notification – also called PMN or 510(k). This allows FDA to determine whether the device is equivalent to a device already placed into one of the three classification categories.  Specifically, medical device manufacturers are required to submit a premarket notification if they intend to introduce a device into commercial distribution for the first time or reintroduce a device that will be significantly changed or modified to the extent that its safety or effectiveness could be affected. Such change or modification could relate to the design, material, chemical composition, energy source, manufacturing process, or intended use.
In November 2016, Medizone received clearance from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) (Reg. No. 90607-3) to market AsepticSure ozone disinfectant formula for use for disinfection of non-porous surfaces in hospitals, clinics, hotels, sporting venues and in the food industry, long-term care facilities, and other critical infrastructures.  However, the FDA has indicated that it also believes it has jurisdiction over AsepticSure as a “medical device”.  The Company does not agree with the FDA’s position, however the Company has determined to work with its advisors on a response to the FDA to establish the most efficient route to gain regulatory approval of AsepticSure as a medical device under the FDCA.
The Company has informed the FDA that it will not market AsepticSure in the US under the previously announced EPA clearance until it has also obtained 510(k) clearance or other appropriate approvals from the FDA.
Medizone will continue to support commercial operations in markets outside the United States, which are not affected by this decision.  In addition to the EPA clearance, the AsepticSure technology has received market approval from regulators for use and distribution in Canada, New Zealand, and Chile, and is currently seeking approvals in other countries in South America, Europe and Asia.
This Press Release may contain certain forward looking statements that could involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the results of ongoing clinical studies, economic conditions, product and technology development, production efficiencies, product demand, competitive products, competitive environment, successful testing and government regulatory issues. Additional risks are identified in the company’s filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Board of Directors | Medizone International Inc.
























































































Board of DirectorsMedizone International, Inc. Board of Directors
David Esposito – Chairman of the Board
David Esposito served as President and General Manager of Phadia US Inc. from 2009-2011 (Phadia US, was the US division of privately held, Phadia AB, a premier global specialty diagnostics company prior to its acquisition by Thermo Fisher Scientific for $3.5B USD in August of 2011). David Esposito joined Phadia US as the senior vice president of sales and marketing in 2009 after a successful career in sales, marketing and commercial strategy with Merck and Co., Inc. David led several initiatives to accelerate the sales growth of Phadia’s core product ImmunoCAP during his early tenure in the assignment. David became the President and General Manager in Sept of 2009.
Under David’s leadership, Phadia US delivered double digit growth of the company’s core products ImmunoCAP® (specific IgE testing) and EliA® (autoimmune testing) for several years. In addition, David spearheaded the development of several commercial initiatives to support Phadia’s leadership in the area of bringing breakthrough diagnostics to the US marketplace for the allergy and autoimmune segments. The successful growth of the company culminated in the sale to Thermo Fisher Scientific for $3.5B USD in August of 2011. David served as Vice President for US Commercial Operations within the Specialty Diagnostics Group of Thermo Fisher Scientific for two years before leaving to pursue other professional interests.
Before joining Phadia, David played several key leadership roles for Merck & Co. Inc in the US market. David led the marketing team for Singulair®, Merck’s largest branded product at the time. He developed innovative, multi-channel marketing programs to continue to accelerate growth in a highly competitive and crowded asthma and allergy marketplace. As Merck embarked on a journey to create an “industry leading new commercial model” in 2007, David was called on to play a key role in developing and leading the customer facing arm of the new model. Through David’s skill in balancing strategy with realistic tactical execution, the initial work on the model drove increased sales, increased customer trust and value measures and increased employee engagement while reducing headcount and overall operational expenses by 35%. As a result, Merck’s new commercial model was rolled out nationally and David was moved into the pivotal role of leading the overall commercial strategy for the US Division at a time of unprecedented change in the pharmaceutical industry.
David’s leadership skills and ability to develop and articulate strategy with clear tactical discipline to drive execution were enhanced and nurtured during his 4 years at West Point and his subsequent leadership assignments in the US Army Infantry. As an Airborne Ranger Infantry officer, David led a rifle platoon of 39 men with the 101st Airborne Division in Operation Desert Shield/Storm (1990-1991) through several combat operations and was recognized with a Bronze Star for combat action on 24 February 1991.
David was born and raised in northern New Jersey. David, his wife Tracy, and their four active children, have enjoyed living in numerous areas of the country as a result of relocations for key assignments in the marketplace. They presently call Kalamazoo, MI “home.” Outside of work, David is very active with his family coaching sports teams, spending time outdoors and doing charitable work. In addition, David is the inventor/developer of a series of programs entitled Character Creates Opportunity® designed to improve the character development of children, adolescents and adults. Most recently, his conversation games Abundant Harvest® and Face to Face™ are being actively marketed to families, schools, counseling centers, and faith-based programs to support more effective communication and action planning in dealing with the often difficult and complex situations we find ourselves in today. David and Tracy are the founders and sponsors of Harvest Time Partners Foundation; a charitable organization supporting youth and young adults in pursuit of character building opportunities.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

	Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities



	 



	Effective November 12, 2015, Medizone International, Inc. (“Registrant”) entered into an agreement with GYD S.A., a corporation formed under the laws of Chile (“GYD”), for the distribution and sale of the Registrant’s AsepticSure® disinfection system in certain countries in South America (the “Distribution Agreement”).  Additional detail regarding the Distribution Agreement is contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K under Item 8.01.



	 



	In connection with the negotiation and execution of the Distribution Agreement, the Registrant also entered into subscription agreements with GYD and three other investors in Chile for the purchase of common stock and warrants of the Registrant. The investors purchased 10,000,000 shares of common stock of the Registrant for $1,000,000 ($0.10 per share), as well as warrants to purchase up to $1,000,000 of additional shares of common stock. The warrants are exercisable through November 12, 2016. The exercise price of the warrants is 40% of the trading price of the Registrant’s common stock at the date of exercise; provided that if the warrants are exercised on or before March 30, 2016, the exercise price per share of common stock purchased under the warrant will be the lesser of 40% discount to market or $0.25 per share.



	 



	Funding and closing of the sale of the shares and warrants and finalization of the Distribution Agreement occurred on November 13, 2015, subsequent to the filing of the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The effectiveness of the Distribution Agreement was conditioned upon the receipt of funds and closing of the sale of shares and warrants.



	 





	The Registrant offered and sold the shares to the investors without registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) in reliance on an exemption from registration for the private placement of securities pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”) and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D or Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act. Each investor represented to the Registrant that it is was a non-US person purchasing in an offshore transaction, and/or an “accredited investor” as defined in Rule 501 of the Securities Act and that the common stock and the warrants were acquired for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends will be affixed to any certificates evidencing the shares of common stock. The common stock is subject to a one-year lock-up pursuant to the subscription agreements.

	On November 17, 2015, the Registrant issued a press release summarizing the terms of the Distribution Agreement and the stock issuances to GYD and the investors.  A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.

Distributor shall also have the right to purchase Products from Medizone for its proposed Service Business according to this Agreement.  Medizone may in its sole discretion sell the Product to any other Person outside the Territory;

	provided

	, however, that Medizone will not solicit Customers in the Territory and will refer promptly all inquiries for sales within the Territory to Distributor. Distributor will not solicit sales of or sell Products outside the Territory and will refer promptly all inquiries for the sale of the Products outside the Territory to Medizone.  By accepting this appointment, Distributor agrees to conform to all reasonable quality standards established from time to time by Medizone for its distributors worldwide. These quality standards are subject to change by Medizone on 15 Business Days’ prior Notice to Distributor.

	(b)  







	Exclusivity of Appointment

	.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to Medizone’s rights set forth in Section 6(a) herein:  Distributor’s appointment in

	Section 2(a)

	, above, shall be exclusive as to Third Parties within the Territory.



	As used in this Agreement, “exclusive” means that Medizone shall not, during the Term, have any right to make, have made, market, distribute, sell or otherwise commercially exploit the Products in the Territory or to authorize any affiliate or third party to do so.  Medizone undertakes not to appoint any third party to import, market and distribute the Products in the Territory, nor will it import, market, distribute or sell the Products itself to Customers in the Territory.  Medizone agrees that it will not appoint another distributor within the Territory so long as this Agreement remains in force. Medizone will prohibit its distributors outside the Territory from soliciting Customers and selling to Customers within the Territory.  Medizone’s written agreements with Customers will provide that such Customers and any of their affiliates are prohibited from marketing, distributing, selling or otherwise commercially exploiting the Products in the Territory.







	 









	(c)

	  









	No Right to Appoint a Subdistributor


	.


	Distributor shall not, without the prior written consent of Medizone,

	 

	which shall not be unreasonably withheld:







	 







	(i)  









	appoint any subdistributor or other Person or entity to sell or distribute Product at the wholesale level; or










	 







	(ii)  






	sell the Product to any person or entity who Distributor knows or has reason to believe is purchasing Product for resale other than at retail to Customers within the Territory.







	 








	(d)

	  







	No Manufacturing Rights

	.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to grant to Distributor any right to manufacture or to contract for the manufacture of the Products or to contact or deal directly or indirectly with Medizone’s manufacturers of the Products.







	 







	(e)  







	Limitations on Offering

	.  Distributor may not sell or distribute the Products outside the Territory and shall not offer the Products for sale or delivery outside the Territory, without the express written consent signed by Medizone.



	  For resale purposes, Medizone shall supply the Products only to the Distributor for resale in the Territory.  Medizone will prohibit other distributors to which it sells the Products from making sales of the Products to Customers in the Territory.







	 








	(f)

	  







	No Franchise or Business Opportunity Agreement

	. The Parties to this Agreement are independent contractors and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or constructed as creating a joint venture, partnership, agency relationship, franchise or business opportunity between Medizone and Distributor. Neither Party, by virtue of this Agreement, will have any right, power or authority to act or create an obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other Party. Each Party assumes responsibility for the actions of their personnel under this Agreement and will be solely responsible for their supervision, daily direction and control, wage rates, withholding income taxes, disability benefits, or the manner and means through which the work under this Agreement will be accomplished. Except as provided otherwise in this Agreement, Distributor has the sole discretion to determine Distributor’s methods of operation, Distributor’s accounting practices, the types and amounts of insurance Distributor carries, Distributor’s personnel practices, Distributor’s advertising and promotion, Distributor’s Customers, and Distributor’s service areas and methods. The relationship created hereby between the Parties is solely that of seller and distributor. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed to create a franchise relationship between the Parties, then the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the Parties’ original intent as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as a distribution agreement and not a franchise agreement.

	Annex A

	) in any particular Territory country during a period of four (4) consecutive years (ie. after all sales of Distributor in that country are aggregated for the entire four-year period), then Medizone shall have the right (but not be obligated) to terminate Distributor’s exclusivity rights with respect to that particular Territory country, as provided in Section 2(b) of this Agreement and as further explained and described in

	Annex A

	attached hereto and by this reference incorporated herein;

	On expiration of the Initial Term (and each Renewal Term as defined below), this Agreement automatically renews for additional successive four-year terms unless and until (i) Distributor provides Notice of non-renewal at least 60 Business Days before the end of the then-current term, or (ii) Medizone provides Notice of non-renewal at least 60 Business Days before the end of the then-current term, provided Distributor has failed to achieve at least 60% of the mutually agreed upon sales goals for each calendar year as may be established by the Parties.  If there is no agreement on the sales goals, those stated in column 3 of the table in

	Annex A

	attached hereto will prevail.  For purposes of this Section 18.2, calculations shall be based upon total sales by Distributor within the Territory during the immediately preceding 4-year Term, compared to the total sales Distributor would have achieved during the Term had it met its calendar year sales goals provided for in the mutually agreed-upon goals, or if none, the goals set forth in column 3 of the table in

	Annex A

	, or (iii) termination by the Parties as otherwise permitted under this Agreement or applicable Law (each a “

	Renewal Term

	” and together with the Initial Term, the “

	Term

	”). If the Term is renewed for any Renewal Term(s) pursuant to this Section, the terms and conditions of this Agreement during each such Renewal Term are the same as the terms in effect immediately before such renewal, subject to any change in Prices payable for the Product and payment terms during the applicable Renewal Term as determined by Medizone.







	 







	18.3  






	In the event that Medizone issues such Notice, except for termination by Medizone under

	Section 18.4

	, Distributor may operate as a distributor in the Territory for twelve (12) months from the date of the Notice of non-renewal provided for in Section 18.2 (the “

	Post-term Sale Period

	”).  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the Post-term Sale Period, Medizone will give effect to applicable Purchase Orders for Products and/or spare parts with reasonable promptness, and under no circumstances in a longer average delivery time than the rest of the distributors or direct customers.

	(e)  






	if Distributor fails to observe or perform any term, covenant or condition of Distributor’s under any agreement with Medizone, other than this Agreement, and the default continues beyond any grace period set out in the other agreement for the remedying of the default;







	 







	(f)

	Distributor’s Right to Continue Service Only Business

	.  Upon termination of this Agreement, including the termination of Distributor’s distribution, exclusivity, and other rights as provided in Sections 2 and 4.3 through 4.5, Distributor shall retain the limited right to continue to own (not distribute) any Products previously purchased by Distributor and to continue to use such Products within the Territory only in its Service Business (as defined in Recital paragraph B).  Such rights by Distributor shall continue indefinitely (the “

	Medizone International – GYD S.A. Distribution Agreement








	Page 22 of 32










	 





	 







	26.  







	Third Party Products

	. Distributor acknowledges and agrees that Product purchased by Distributor under this Agreement may contain, be contained in, incorporated into, attached to or packaged together with the products manufactured by a third party (“

	Third Party Products

	”). Third Party Products are not covered by the Limited Warranty. For the avoidance of doubt, Medizone makes no representations or warranties regarding any Third Party Products.







	 







	27.  







	Right of First Refusal

	. At any time after this Agreement has been in effect for a minimum of three (3) years following the Effective Date (the “

	ROFR Period

	”), Distributor shall not, directly or indirectly through an Affiliate, enter into any agreement or consummate any transaction relating to the sale of all or substantially all of Distributor’s assets or a transaction or series of transactions resulting in a Change of Control of Distributor with any Person other than Medizone (a “

	Third-party Transaction

	”) except in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Section.







	 







	(a)  






	If, at any time during the ROFR Period, Distributor receives a bona fide written offer for a Third-party Transaction that Distributor desires to accept (each, a “

	Third-party Offer

	”), Distributor shall, immediately following receipt of the Third-party Offer, notify Medizone in writing (the “

	Offer Notice

	”) of the identity of all proposed parties to such Third-party Transaction and the material financial and other terms and conditions of such Third-party Offer (the “

	Material Terms

	”). Each Offer Notice constitutes an offer made by Distributor to enter into an agreement with Medizone on the same Material Terms of such Third-party Offer (the “

	ROFR Offer

	”).







	 







	(b)  






	At any time prior to the expiration of the 15-day period following Medizone’s receipt of the Offer Notice (the “

	Exercise Period

	”), Medizone may accept the ROFR Offer by delivery to Distributor of a written notice of acceptance/binding letter of intent containing the Material Terms and any standard and customary conditions applicable to a transaction of this nature, executed by Medizone; provided, however, that Medizone is not required to accept any non-financial terms or conditions contained in any Material Terms that cannot be fulfilled by Medizone as readily as by any other Person (e.g., an agreement conditioned upon the services of a particular individual or the supply of a product exclusively under the control of such third-party offeror).







	 







	(c)  






	If, by the expiration of the Exercise Period, Medizone has not accepted the ROFR Offer, and provided that Distributor has complied with all of the provisions of this Section, at any time following the expiration of the Exercise Period, Distributor may consummate the Third-party Transaction with the counterparty identified in the applicable Offer Notice, on Material Terms that are the same or more favorable to Distributor as the Material Terms set forth in the Offer Notice. If such Third-party Transaction is not consummated, the terms and conditions of this Section will again apply and Distributor shall not enter into any Third-party Transaction during the ROFR Period without affording Medizone the right of first refusal on the terms and conditions of this Section.







	 







	Medizone International – GYD S.A. Distribution Agreement








	Page 23 of 32










	 





	 







	(d)  






	For the avoidance of doubt, the terms and conditions of this Section apply to each Third-party Offer received by Distributor during the ROFR Period.







	 







	28.  







	Sale of Medizone

	.  In the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Medizone, or the sale of a majority of the equity securities of Medizone (“

	Change of Control Transaction

	”), and consistent with the purpose and intent of the assignment provisions of Section 32(g) herein, Medizone agrees that in connection with and as a condition to the closing of any such Change of Control Transaction, subject to the provisos set forth in Section 32(g), Medizone shall secure the written agreement of any buyer or successor in any such Change of Control Transaction to abide by the terms of this Agreement that are applicable to Medizone herein.  Medizone also agrees to give Distributor written notice, within three business days of Medizone and any third party executing any non-binding letter of intent or memorandum of understanding with respect to any such proposed Change of Control Transaction.







	 







	29.  







	Indemnification

	.







	 







	(a)  






	Each Party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the other Party harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, judgments, costs, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of (i) any breach of such Party’s obligations, warranties, covenants or representations in this Agreement; or (ii) any unrelated third party claim that such Party’s products or Intellectual Property infringes or misappropriates a third party’s Intellectual Property.







	 







	(b)  







	Indemnification Procedure

	.  With respect to any third party claims falling within the scope of this indemnification obligation, (i) each Party agrees to promptly notify the other of any claim or lawsuit for which it believes it is entitled to be indemnified; (b) the indemnifying Party shall assume, at its sole expense, the defense of such claim or lawsuit; (c) the Party being indemnified shall have the right to participate in the defense of any such claim or lawsuit with separate counsel, at its sole expense; and (d) the indemnified Party shall provide the indemnifying Party with the assistance, information and authority reasonably necessary to defend against the third party claim, at the indemnifying Party’s expense.







	 







	(c)  







	Infringement Cure

	.  If a material component of the Product is finally held or believed by the indemnifying Party to infringe or its distribution is enjoined, the indemnifying Party will use reasonable efforts to obtain a license or grant of rights under the rights that have been infringed, modify the Product so it is non-infringing or provide a substitute Product or component thereof that is non-infringing, or if the foregoing are not commercially reasonable or the indemnifying Party fails to so cure the problems, either Party may terminate the license and distribution rights for the infringing Product upon written notice to the other Party.  Neither Party shall be liable for infringement based on modification of the Product by any other Party (excluding such Party’s own agents), or the combination or use of the Product with any other product, equipment, or process not furnished by such Party, if use of the Product alone and in its unmodified form would not have been an infringement.







	 






	Medizone International – GYD S.A. Distribution Agreement







	Page 24 of 32










	 





	 







	(d)  







	Limitation of Warranties

	.  THIS SECTION STATES THE PARTIES’ ENTIRE OBLIGATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM FOR INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.







	 







	30.  







	Limitations of Damages

	.  IN NO EVENT SHALL MEDIZONE OR Distributor BE LIABLE FOR, AND EACH PARTY COVENANTS NOT TO BRING ANY CLAIM FOR, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES), WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE OR THE PARTY WAS SPECIFICALLY ADVISED CONCERNING THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE PARTIES’ INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OR TO A PARTY’S BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT.







	 







	31.  







	Point of Sale Reports

	.  Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, Distributor shall deliver to Medizone a written report setting forth, in reasonable detail, the total net Products sold by it in such month.  Such report shall include: 1) Name and address of Distributor’s end customer, 2) Invoice date, 3) Quantity of each product sold, 4) Medizone part number, 5) Unit price, and 6) Extended price.







	 







	32.  







	Miscellaneous

	.







	 







	(a)  







	Entire Agreement; Amendment

	. The complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the Parties relating to this subject matter shall consist of this Agreement.  For example, any prior discussions or understandings are superseded by the terms of this Agreement.  This Agreement may not be amended except by a written document signed by an authorized representative of both Parties.







	 







	(b)  







	No Waiver

	.  The waiver by either Party of any default or breach of this Agreement, or any obligation hereunder, shall be ineffective unless in writing.  No failure to exercise any right or power under this Agreement or to insist on strict compliance by the other Party shall constitute a waiver of the right subsequently to exercise such right or power or to insist on strict compliance.







	 







	(c)  







	Choice of Law

	.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Nevada, U.S.A., including its implementation of the Uniform Commercial Code.  The prevailing Party shall be entitled to an award of its costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees in any such action.







	 







	(d)  







	Force Majeure

	.  Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing hereunder, if such failure or delay is due to war, strike, government requirements, acts of nature, acts or omissions of carriers, or other cause(s) beyond its reasonable control (“

	Force Majeure

	”);

	provided, however

	, that if a Party’s performance of any material obligation is reasonably expected to be delayed more than three (3) months due to any such cause, the other Party may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice.

	(e)  







	Severability

	.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court or authority of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified by such court or authority to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable.  If the provision cannot be so modified, it shall be severed and all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. If a provision is held illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the Parties also agree to negotiate reasonably and in good faith to modify this Agreement with a new provision that approximates the intent and purpose of the original provision as closely as possible, without being illegal or unenforceable.







	 







	(f)  







	Notices

	.  All notices (“

	Notice

	”) between the Parties shall be in writing and shall be sent by certified or registered mail or commercial delivery service, with provisions for a receipt, or facsimile (confirmed in writing thereafter), to the following addresses, or such other address a Party may specify by written notice:

	Status of Undersigned

	.



	 



	(i)


	 


	The undersigned has such knowledge, skill and experience in business, financial and investment matters that the undersigned is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Securities.

The undersigned understands that the Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or any State Securities Laws by reason of specific exemptions under the provisions thereof which depend in part upon the investment intent of the undersigned and of the other representations made by the undersigned in this Subscription Agreement. The undersigned understands that the Company is relying upon the representations and agreements contained in this Subscription Agreement (and any supplemental information) for the purpose of determining whether this transaction meets the requirements for such exemptions.

	(iv)


	 


	The undersigned acknowledges that neither the Company nor any other person offered to sell the Securities to it by means of any form of general solicitation or advertising, including but not limited to: (A) any advertisement, article, notice or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or broadcast over television or radio or (B) any seminar or meeting whose attendees were invited by any general solicitation or general advertising.

	Exhibit 99.1



	 




	The AsepticSure® Hospital Disinfection System




	Introduced to South America







	AsepticSure

	â

	, the only hospital disinfection system in the world that achieves 100% bactericidal kill, dramatically reducing new rates of hospital acquired infections in the rooms treated, will be distributed in South America by GYD S.A.







	Santiago, Chile and San Francisco, California, November 17, 2015.  Medizone International, Inc. (OTCQB:MZEI) or Medizone, manufacturer of the AsepticSure® Hospital Disinfection System, and GYD S.A. today announced that they have entered into an agreement for the introduction and distribution of AsepticSure® in South America (the “Distribution Agreement”). Medizone granted GYD S.A exclusive distribution rights for the AsepticSure® system in Chile, Brazil, Colombia and Peru.  GYD S.A. will lead the regulatory approval process throughout South America and exclusive distribution rights will be expanded to other countries in South America on a country by country basis as GYD S.A. achieves regulatory approvals and establishes channels of distribution.







	GYD S.A. Investment in Medizone International




	 








	In connection with the negotiation and execution of the Distribution Agreement, GYD S.A. and three other investors in Chile have invested $1 million in Medizone.  The funding included the sale of 10,000,000 shares of Medizone common stock at a price of $0.10 per share. In addition, the investors acquired stock purchase warrants exercisable for one year to purchase an additional $1 million of common stock. The exercise price of the warrant shares is fixed at a 40% discount to market at the time of the exercise, however, in the event the warrants are exercised on or before March 30, 2016, the exercise price per share will be capped at the lesser of 40% discount to market or $0.25 per share. There is a one-year lock up on the shares acquired in the initial stock purchase.















	Medizone’s CEO, Edwin Marshall commented, “GYD S.A.’s founder and Chief Executive Officer, Gerardo Guzman Hargous, is a grad

	uate of Pontificia Universidad Catolica and holds an MBA from the University of Chicago. Mr. Hargous has a successful history of starting businesses in Chile and expanding them throughout South America.  For example, he is the founder of GMS Productos Grбf

	icos Ltda. (“GMS”), a graphics business in Chile.  After building the business successfully for 20 years, in 2003 Mr. Hargous sold GMS to Antalis Group.  GMS  also had the representation of Fuji S.A. a division of Fuji, Japan. Later, he founded and expanded Best Way Group, a pest control company, which he sold in 2014 to Rentokil Initial plc, traded on the London Stock Exchange. In addition to his entrepreneurial activity in South America, Mr. Hargous also taught options trading at the University of Chile in Santiago.















	“In addition to GYD providing Medizone International a single point of contact for regulatory approval and distribution in South America, Mr. Hargous will add to the company’s global strategic strength by assuming an advisory role to our board of directors.  Medizone welcomes him as a strategic partner to its global AsepticSure distribution plan,” added Mr. Marshall.








	 








	 








	This Press Release may contain certain forward looking statements that could involve substantial risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the results of ongoing clinical studies, economic conditions, product and technology development, production efficiencies, product demand, competitive products, competitive environment, successful testing and government regulatory issues. Additional risks are identified in the company’s filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Developer of AsepticSure® | Medizone International Inc.


































































































Medizone International Announces a Retirement from the Board of DirectorsJune 21, 2017 – Medizone International, Inc. (OTCQB: MZEI) (Kalamazoo, MI) the developer of AsepticSure, a revolutionary disinfection technology that combines ozone and hydrogen peroxide to achieve unprecedented kill rates of bacteria and viral pathogens in a wide range of commercial applications including healthcare, biodefense, and public health preparedness, announced today that Daniel D. Hoyt has retired from the Board of Directors.
Effective June 21, 2017, Daniel D. Hoyt will retire from the Board and all positions within the company.
“On behalf of our employees, the board, and shareholders, I want to thank Dan for his leadership and commitment to the Company. Since January 2002, Dan has been an active member of the board and he has given a full measure to support our business and our people through the amazing journey of the company,” commented David Esposito. “We wish Dan all the best as he moves into this next chapter of life with his family.”
Medizone continues to execute on plans to establish AsepticSure as a superior solution worldwide to achieve unprecedented kill rates of bacteria and viral pathogens in a wide range of commercial applications including healthcare, biodefense, and public health preparedness. The near term priority market is the United States while the Company continues to support sales and distribution channels in several other markets across the globe.
About Medizone International, Inc.
Founded initially in 1986 to develop treatments for lipid-enveloped viruses, Medizone International, Inc. shifted focus in 2007 to develop a superior disinfectant technology. The company developed the AsepticSure system to combine oxidative compounds (O3 and H202) to produce a unique mixture of free radicals (H2O3 known as trioxidane) with much higher oxidative potential than ozone or hydrogen peroxide alone. After securing broad IP protection for the use of trioxidane for both healthcare facility disinfecting systems and bioterrorism applications, the company released its AsepticSure system for use in Canada, and several other global markets.

AsepticSure® Receives Full Approval of International Electrical Safety StandardsAsepticSure approval of international safety standards clears path for global commercialization
 
KALAMAZOO, Mich., June 21, 2017 – Medizone International, Inc. (OTCQB: MZEI), the developer of AsepticSure®, a revolutionary disinfection technology that combines ozone and hydrogen peroxide to achieve unprecedented kill rates of bacteria and viral pathogens in a wide range of commercial applications including healthcare, biodefense, and public health preparedness, announced today that the Company has received full electrical safety approval for all models of AsepticSure.
The testing and approval was administered by QPS Evaluation Services, a nationally and internationally accredited independent third-party testing, certification and field evaluation body headquartered in Toronto, Canada. The approval means that AsepticSure has achieved full compliance with the applicable international safety standards which provide a baseline requirement that must be met in order to pursue marketing in all jurisdictions, including Canada, USA, South America, EU, Asia, and the Middle East. Although Medizone will be required to apply for a separate approval in each country, compliance with these international safety standards will greatly facilitate this process.
“We are very pleased to announce that AsepticSure technology has received full approval for electrical safety,” said Dr. Michael Shannon, President and Director of Medical Affairs of Medizone International. “With respect to future marketing endeavors in North America, third-party certification of electrical products is mandated by law; without such certification, marketing would not be permitted. Approval of our AsepticSure system is a major step forward towards full commercialization.”
The achievement of full compliance with the relevant international safety standards provides the framework for detailed manufacturing specifications that will be incorporated in the Company’s expanded manufacturing plans.
