Note: Trading products are independent, unaffiliated software programs that contain objective rules to enter and exit the market. No customized or other trading advice or recommendations are made by these products.
HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM.
ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.

                    About
                

                    IQ is an innovative financial technology company that provides a suite of predictive analytic tools and autotrading services to self-directed investors and traders worldwide. Our mission is to help people at all skill levels systematically create wealth by combining the power of historical big data, predictive analytics and investment automation with first-class tools, training and support.

InvestiQuant's strategies adapt automatically to changing market conditions, volatility and performance. We utilize sophisticated algorithms that auto-learn and auto-adapt. Our strategies are highly selective and trigger only set-ups matching our strict criteria.

IQ's strategies are market-neutral. Most tend to perform well in all types of market environments, including volatile and bear markets. With the right strategies, volatility can be your friend.

Duke University's Center for Quantitative Modeling has tested IQ's core methods and systems. Director Daniel Egger writes, “Aggregate potential returns from InvestiQuant’s strategies can be significant. Maximum hypothetical drawdowns over the 8-year analysis period with limited leverage were less than 15%. The potential results are impressive.”

IQ's strategy inventory is limited for all the right reasons. Limiting the total number of contracts that may be traded with each strategy helps protect its integrity and performance. Inventory levels are carefully monitored by InvestiQuant and once an individual trading strategy is sold out, that strategy is removed from the store.

For eight years and counting, InvestiQuant's strategies have been utilized by experienced and professional investors from around the world to trade a wide range of financial markets. Today, InvestiQuant offers fully automated, hands-off strategies to active investors and traders who are looking for diversification alternatives and proven ways to expand their capital. Engage with InvestiQuant and let us show you the way.™

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.

                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 09/22/2016
            

                BBB has determined that InvestiQuant, Inc meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Our Story








Our Story


The spark for our company started in 1999, when our Founder, Scott Andrews, took a technology company public on the NASDAQ exchange. Scott’s company was one of those dot com darlings and his backstage pass to Wall Street as the CEO of a public company provided him with a front row view of the inner workings of the stock market. What he saw and experienced was eye-opening to say the least. (Learn more about Scott’s unique public company experiences in this Bloomberg article, “Scott Andrews: Cool Under Fire in the B2B Ground War.”)
Despite the company’s ultimate success on Wall Street, Scott was dumbfounded by the rapid and extraordinary swings in stock market prices – not just his own, but that of companies like Microsoft and Intel too:

Figure 1. Historical price chart of Intel Corporation (symbol: INTC)

“It was clear that the price action of the world’s greatest free market was massively and consistently distorted by hype, conflicted analysts, and simple human emotions. Though the investment bank’s analysts attempted to justify valuations using P/E ratios and inflated projections, it was clear that the real driver of irrational prices was the collective fear and greed of market participants – not fundamentals.”

 Scott’s view of Wall Street would never be the same. 
After leaving the corporate world, Scott was faced with the challenge of protecting and growing his financial nest egg. Recognizing both the increasing risks and opportunities afforded by Wall Street’s inefficiencies and conflicts, he became interested in self-directed investment strategies. 

He explains, “My goal was to take advantage of the short term price swings, while minimizing my capital’s exposure to the increasingly volatile and unpredictable markets. As if the bursting of the dot com bubble was not enough, the unimaginable nature of 9/11 really rattled my confidence and interest in buy and hold investing.”

With the help of a West Point classmate, David Skowron, who was also an active investor and programmer (and original developer at SciQuest), they developed a backtesting software application and tested hundreds of strategies and ideas across multiple timeframes. Ultimately, an intraday, mean-reversion strategy that traded the New York Stock Exchange open generated the most compelling and consistent results. 

In Scott’s words, “Day in and day out, even the smartest investors make emotional-based decisions at the open that are not in their best interest. So, we learned how to take advantage of those persistent tendencies for short term gains by trading the opening gap. In fact, the change in prices that occurs overnight often results in predictable behavior after the markets open and that is very counter-intuitive.” 

Scott and David also realized that the sweet spot for turning their capital and minimizing market risk appeared to be in “placing a handful of quick-hitting trades each month using the efficient leverage of futures to capture these intraday moves in high volume indices like the S&P 500.” With nearly immediate success, their strategy was validated and Scott began trading and refining their opening gap strategies full time. 
By 2007, and on the cusp of the historic financial crisis, Scott started a blog called “The Gap Guy” – where he shared his research and trading plan (prior to his execution) with fellow traders. Scott’s live trading results and unusual transparency garnered a large following of other traders hungry for a quantitative strategy based on real trading edges that worked. As the markets collapsed in 2008, Scott continued executing his plan and generated impressive returns using his historical analysis despite having never actively traded a bear market. With growing demand, Scott founded Master The Gap (MTG) in 2008 to teach self-directed investors how to trade the opening gap using historical probabilities and futures.
By 2014, Master The Gap had grown into a nicely profitable business when Scott was encouraged by clients to expand the company and its research to cover more strategies and markets. Seeing the need for a trusted provider of high quality, quantitative research and inspired by the idea of making an even bigger impact on the lives of individual investors, many of whom were still trying to recover from the financial collapse of 2008, Scott was compelled to action. Eight weeks later he closed on a private round of equity financing from about 20 long term clients and renamed the company: InvestiQuant. David joined the company soon thereafter to lead its technology and software development. 
Some of the company’s investors were also clients of Rob Hanna – a quantitative trader and innovative researcher he had long admired and with whom he had collaborated previously on various research projects. The synergies of their approaches and skill sets were obvious to them and their mutual clients. Shortly after the financing, Rob agreed to merge his Overnight Edges service with InvestiQuant and joined the team to lead its research and strategy development. 
The Company Today and Tomorrow
InvestiQuant (iQ) is a company of innovative technologists, data scientists, market technicians, and highly experienced traders. We are committed to serving two distinct, but highly complementary clients groups: Investors and Traders. 
Our legacy is in serving traders and helping them ‘get out of their own way’ by using robust, quantified trading strategies that they can trust. Our trader community is integral to our past and future success. Traders help us identify, create, test, and refine our methodologies and strategies. Serving and satisfying seasoned trading pros makes us smarter and differentiates us from those who solely rely on risky data mining techniques. 
Our future is in leveraging our trader community, market experience and technology to deliver the most robust, automated strategies to the investor community possible. We believe that alternative investments do not have to be complicated, expensive or risky. By offering quality, hedge fund like performance without the expense or customary restrictions, InvestiQuant’s strategies provide a unique, cost-effective pathway to alternative investments and futures trading. 
Predictive analytics, automation and the use of computing have disrupted and improved every facet of the American economy. InvestiQuant is at the forefront of such changes in the investment and personal finance communities.
