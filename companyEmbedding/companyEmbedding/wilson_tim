Description



Product Description
TIM WILSON
 Tim started making knives in 1998 under the guidance of Frank Centofante and Mel Pardue.  As he developed his own style he drew upon his past experience as an NCIS Agent and his time spent Active Duty DEA Agent.   
Fort Henry Custom Knives is proud to be a Dealer for Tim Wilson 

Just Received ~ Direct from the Maker
 This gorgeous knife is one version of Tim’s Gentleman’s Liner Lock.

Tim chose the best Presentation grade Mastodon Ivory that he could find. The Blue / Green Mammoth is the hardest to locate and the most prized. The scales still retain a bit of their beautiful exterior Bark texture.  
The Bolster is a stunning Mike Norris Ladder Damascus and the Thumbstud is inset with a Jewlery Grade Ruby. 

The 154 CM blade has a wonderful Hand Rubbed finish, it opens very smoothly and the Titanium Liner locks up early and very securely.  The blade is perfectly centered. 

 The Titanium Liners are Anodized Gold and they are uniformly Fileworked around the entire perimeter of the knife.

A Gorgeous Gentleman’s knife in the highest Quality materials. 

Complete with a Stingray skin Slip Pouch.
 
  A wonderful package!
