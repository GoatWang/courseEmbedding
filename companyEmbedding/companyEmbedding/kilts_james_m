Synopsis
James M. Kilts has led three major companies - Gillette, Nabisco, and Kraft -into prosperity by doing what matters on the fundamentals. In Doing What Matters, a vivid first-person account of his executive experiences, he reveals his system for success that is both cutting-edge and back-to-basics. Mr. Kilts has a worldwide and world-class reputation as a business leader. Dubbed a "brand mechanic" by The Wall Street Journal, he is especially well-known for reviving brands and turning around established companies like Nabisco and Gillette. He successfully integrated the Kraft and General Foods divisions within the Philip Morris Companies. As president and CEO at Nabisco, he revitalized several famous but flagging brands, introduced successful new brands, and gained market share for virtually every product line. He did the same thing as CEO of Gillette, increasing sales 5% in the first year and almost 10% in the next, and increasing stock price by 20% - then led Gillettes acquisition by Procter & Gamble. Currently, Mr. Kilts is a Founding Partner of Centerview Partners, a private equity and financial advisory firm.

James M. Kilts

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

James M. Kilts was a chief executive officer of The Gillette Company. He negotiated the sale of the company to Procter & Gamble for US$57 billion. Press investigators estimate that he stood to gain more than $165 million personally in the purchase. Kilts is currently a partner at Centerview Partners, an investment banking and private equity firm based in New York City. In that role he was involved in the sale of Big Heart Pet Brands,[1] and is now looking to raise a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) for a new acquisition.[2]
He was then elected to the Board of Directors at The New York Times Company in 2005. He is a member of the Cato Institute Board of Directors.[3]
Kilts is a 1970 graduate of Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, and received his Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. In addition, as an undergraduate student at Knox College, Kilts was also a member of the Delta Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity.

Gillette CEO earns both praise, criticism for company turnaround






Published: Sunday, February 13, 2005 











BOSTON (AP) - It has been a fairly swift turnaround at Gillette Co. since James M. Kilts arrived four years ago - he has transformed a languishing consumer products maker into a business that Procter & Gamble Co. is willing to pay $57 billion for.

Kilts, the first outsider recruited to lead the century-old company best known for its shaving products, attacked Gillette's problems from within, demanding greater executive accountability, and also in the marketplace, pushing the company to launch new products such as its M3Power razor to help fend off its rivals.
James Kilts, board chairman,  and CEO and president of Gillette poses at a news conference in New York  Jan. 28, 2005.  Gillette Co. was a century old and struggling when Kilts took over as CEO of the consumer products company best known for its razors.
"He unlocked potential in the company that had really been suppressed under the previous management," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor and author of a book on leadership that profiles Kilts and others.
But while Kilts is being lauded as a corporate hero for a deal that's giving investors an 18 percent premium on Gillette stock, he's also running into criticism for the compensation, estimated as high as $185 million, that he's to get from the deal.
Kilts was a longtime food industry executive with a knack for rebuilding troubled companies before coming to Gillette in 2001. When he arrived at the Boston-based company, he had an agenda that dealt with problems throughout the business - revitalizing the Duracell battery line, revamping grooming products and increasing advertising to support the M3Power, a high-tech, vibrating men's razor that competes with Schick's Quattro razor.
The formula worked, and Gillette's stock has risen about 50 percent under Kilts.
The company has had double-digit percentage earnings gains in 12 of the past 13 quarters, frequently surpassing the 15 percent to 20 percent growth Gillette enjoyed in the early 1990s, before its profits dwindled.
So Kilts and Gillette were in a position of strength when he approached P&G late last year about reviving merger talks that had failed five years earlier. It was an interesting turn - Gillette had turned down a takeover bid from P&G five years earlier.
Kilts, 56, typically declines requests for interviews - including one for this story - and rarely makes public appearances outside of trips to New England Patriots football games at the stadium that bears the Gillette name. Since arriving at Gillette, Kilts has lived in a company-paid city apartment while maintaining a home in Rye, N.Y.
"Jim Kilts is very tall and distinguished looking but he is not a public figure," Kanter said. "He was not looking to become the famous person he is now. He's doing a job, and he's very good at it."
Kilts got his start at food companies including General Foods and Kraft, then spent three years leading Nabisco, where he turned the company's fortunes around before selling it in December 2000 to Phillip Morris.
Procter & Gamble Co. and Gillette Co. have several competing products on the market, a few of which are shown here, Monday, Jan. 31, 2005, in Cincinnati. P&G may have to sell off Gillette's Right Guard deodorant and perhaps sell or license out Gillette's Oral-B line of toothbrushes and teeth-whitening products because of overlaps with P&G's products, in order to obtain regulatory approval of P&G's $57 billion purchase of Gillette, analysts said Monday.
After Gillette CEO Michael C. Hawley was forced out, Kilts was selected as the new chairman and chief executive over then-acting CEO Edward F. DeGraan, who had spent nearly three decades at Gillette.
Kilts found that the company that grew out of King C. Gillette's 1895 invention of the safety razor had lost its edge with a corporate culture that failed to reward innovation and promoted staff mostly from within, Kanter said.
With Gillette's largest shareholder, Warren Buffett, watching closely, Kilts "hired people to lead and innovate. ... He did change people at the top, but very gradually," Kanter said.
Kilts' reputation grew. Last spring he was among the candidates to become Coca-Cola Co.'s chief executive before he took himself out of the running.
The huge payout he's due to receive from the P&G deal is tied the four-year rise in the value of his Gillette stock and options, the premium P&G is paying in the deal and sweeteners such as a $12.6 million one-time "change-in-control" payment and pension benefits.
The actual total depends on P&G's stock performance, but initial estimates of Kilts' gain came in at $153 million. The Wall Street Journal last week reported a new estimate of at least $185 million, accounting for details in Kilts' complex package that the newspaper reviewed with assistance from an executive pay expert.
Company spokesman Eric Kraus declined to comment on Kilts' compensation, but said of his performance, "In four years, he took a chronic underperforming company and made it into one of the best-performing consumer products companies in our sector."
Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin is reviewing the Gillette-P&G deal and has asked Gillette for information about executive payouts and the 6,000 jobs expected to be cut from the combined companies' work force of 140,000.
W. Michael Hoffman, executive director of the Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College in Waltham, said Kilts probably secured a good deal for Gillette shareholders.
"But when you look at it from a commonsense point of view, for a CEO to walk away after a sale with a compensation package this big after being there for just four years, it's got to raise people's eyebrows," Hoffman said. "How else can shareholders look at it?"
Kilts is expected to stay for a year to help oversee the transition and serve as vice chairman of P&G's board. A noncompete clause prevents him from landing a position with P&G rivals.
Harvard's Kanter said Kilts may face a difficult decision: whether to take a job relatively soon outside the industry he knows best, or wait out the three-year noncompete period and stick with his specialty.
"He has never wandered tremendously far from the general set of things he knows how to do well," Kanter said. "He really understands consumer products, whether they're food or packaged goods."

James M. Kilts was a chief executive officer of The Gillette Company. He negotiated the sale of the company to Procter & Gamble for US$57 billion. Press investigators estimate that he stood to gain more than $165 million personally in the purchase. Kilts is currently a partner at Centerview Partners, an investment banking and private equity firm based in New York City.

He was then elected to the Board of Directors at The New York Times Company in 2005. He is a member of the Cato Institute Board of Directors.[3]
Kilts is a 1970 graduate of Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, and received his Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. In addition, as an undergraduate student at Knox College, Kilts was also a member of the Delta Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity.

    Knox College | News - $11-Million Gift Announced          About Knox |  Academic |  Admission |  Alumni |  News - Sports |  Services |  Search     Thursday, April 12, 2001Contact: Karrie Heartlein pr@knox.edu309-341-7715  Knox College Receives $11 Million Gift  Knox College announced today that it has been designated as the recipient for what could result in a contribution of $11 million. Alumnus James M. Kilts and his wife, Sandra, have made the designation, which would be the largest gift ever to the College. Mr. Kilts (photo right), who is currently chairman and chief executive officer of The Gillette Company, graduated from Knox in 1970. He has been a Trustee of the College since 1992."This gift affirms the deeply held belief of Jim and Sandy Kilts that Knox College provides an exceptional educational experience in a very special environment.  We have long-valued Jim's counsel and support of the College. This gift adds another dimension to his support of Knox," said College President Richard Millman. Millman made the announcement at a campus event in Kresge Hall, Ford Center for the Fine Arts (photo below).   More:Audio clip of announcement, 46 sec: MP3 (450K) Photo of Pres. Millman making the announcement (500K) File photo of James Kilts (450K)     The gift will be made by the Kilts' estate to the College's endowment fund from an irrevocable trust, and the eventual contribution depends on market conditions at the time. Commenting on the designation, Mr. Kilts said: "My education at Knox College provided me with the foundation that has helped me grow and learn throughout my life.  Knox College was far more than just an educational experience.  It strengthened my beliefs; it broadened my perspectives; it opened up a world of new relationships and intellectual journeys.  In short, it transformed me, and I hope that my gift will help future generations of Knox students to share the experience." Last December, Kilts also established the Kilts/Nabisco Challenge to promote Knox's alumni giving program. The challenge provided an additional contribution for new or increased gifts from alumni and for contributions that put the Annual Fund above its goal. Funded in part by Nabisco, where Kilts was CEO until recently, the challenge grant has provided more than $76,000 to the College's Annual Fund so far and encouraged gifts from more than 700 donors, including alumni, parents, faculty and staff.  More: About the Kilts/Nabisco Challenge  Kilts was named CEO of The Gillette Company in February of this year. Prior to that he was CEO of Nabisco, Inc. After graduating from Knox with a bachelor's degree in history, Kilts earned an MBA from the University of Chicago. He worked for General Foods Corporation from 1970 until 1985, holding positions in operations, marketing and management. In 1985 he joined Kraft Foods, serving as senior vice president of Kraft International, president and CEO of Kraft Canada, and president of Kraft USA. Following the acquisition of Kraft General foods by The Philip Morris Companies Inc., Kilts was named executive vice president for worldwide food operations.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up.

All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
