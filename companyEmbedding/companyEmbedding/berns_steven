NEW YORK, Aug. 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Shutterstock, Inc. (NYSE:   SSTK), a leading global provider of commercial imagery and music, today announced Steven Berns will succeed Tim Bixby as the company's Chief Financial Officer, which is expected to occur no later than September 30, 2015.  Bixby has notified the company of his intention to resign as Chief Financial Officer to pursue other opportunities and has indicated his willingness to remain involved after September 30, 2015 to ensure an effective transition.  Berns, who served as a member of Shutterstock's Board of Directors until he resigned from the Board earlier this week, will help drive the strategic vision of the company while leading the company's financial and legal functions.
"Tim has been a great financial and operational leader and his hard work and dedication during his tenure were critical in our evolution as a public company.  He has been a true partner to me and the rest of the Shutterstock team and his contributions have helped us expand consistently while positioning us for sustained long-term growth.  We respect his decision to step down and wish him the best of luck," said Jon Oringer, founder and CEO of Shutterstock.
"Our growth has been a collective effort of the entire company and it's been a privilege to work with Jon, the board of directors and the rest of the Shutterstock team.  It is truly a unique company and one that is well-situated to achieve long-term success and continued growth.  I wish Steven much success in a key role at a great company," said Bixby.
Berns has nearly 30 years' experience in global financial management, acquisitions, and business operations, including as Chief Financial Officer at the Tribune Media Company, a television and digital media company, and Revlon, a worldwide cosmetic and beauty products company.   
"Throughout his career, Steven has shown a great ability to build and lead finance teams and to become a strategic partner across a diverse set of companies.  Given his familiarity with our company, I know he will be much more than a strong financial steward - he will be a critical part of our continued growth and success," said Oringer.
"As a member of the Board since 2012, I have had the opportunity to see first-hand the highly profitable growth of Shutterstock.  I am thrilled to be joining Jon and the entire Shutterstock team as the company launches into its next phase of innovation for its customers," said Berns.
Jeff Epstein, who has been a director since April 2012 and currently serves as member of the audit committee and nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors, has been appointed Chairman of the audit committee.  In addition, Paul Hennessy, who has been a director since April 2015 and currently serves as a member of the compensation committee, has been appointed to the audit committee.

Tribune also announced that Chandler Bigelow, who has served as the company's CFO since 2008, has been appointed to the newly-created position of Executive Vice President/Chief Business Strategies and Operations Officer.  In this new role, Bigelow will oversee the company's equity investments and its real estate portfolio, and will help lead the ongoing transformation of Tribune's traditional media businesses.  He, too, will report to Liguori.
"Steven's broad experience, financial acumen, and open management style will enable us to make a seamless transition in the leadership of our finance team—he will be a great addition to the company and a valued partner on our executive team," said Liguori.  "At the same time, I am excited to partner with Chandler in his new role as we continue to evolve our businesses for future success; his institutional knowledge, financial rigor and strategic instincts make Chandler ideal for this role." 
Prior to serving as CFO at Revlon, Berns held a variety of executive finance positions, serving as Chief Financial Officer at Tradeweb, LLC, a leading over-the-counter, electronic trading marketplace, and at MDC Partners, where he was also President and Chief Financial Officer.  From August 1999 to September 2004, Berns was SVP/Treasurer for The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., an organization of advertising agencies and marketing services firms.  
Berns is a certified public accountant.  He graduated from Lehigh University with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and earned an MBA from New York University.   
"I am thrilled to join Peter and the entire Tribune team at this exciting time for the company," said Berns.  "Tribune's combination of assets and capabilities provide a terrific platform for building growth and shareholder value."
Bigelow joined Tribune in 1998 and one year later was named manager/corporate finance.  In 2001 he was appointed assistant treasurer and he became Tribune's treasurer in 2003.
"I'm excited to continue helping Peter with the ongoing transformation of our broadcasting and publishing businesses," said Bigelow.  "Tribune starts with a number of advantages—great content, a powerful distribution network and extremely talented, dedicated employees—and there are a lot of great opportunities ahead for the company."
