Product Pipeline


Our extended-release drug delivery technology platform allows us to develop additional drug candidates where an extended release ODT or extended release oral suspension dosage forms address unmet medical needs.
Our technology is proven to work, with FDA’s approval of two different medications for the treatment of ADHD. Beyond our initial focus on ADHD, we believe patients with central nervous system, or CNS, conditions, such as stroke, Parkinson’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease could benefit from an extended-release ODT or extended-release liquid suspension medication.

Neos Therapeutics, Inc Announces FDA Approval of Cotempla Xr-ODT™ (Methylphenidate) Extended-Release Orally Disintegrating Tablets for the Treatment of ADHD in Patients 6 to 17 Years Old
Jun 20 17
Neos Therapeutics, Inc. announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Cotempla XR-ODT, the first and only methylphenidate extended-release orally disintegrating tablet for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in patients 6 to 17 years old. The approval of Cotempla XR-ODT was supported by a Phase 3 clinical trial in children in a laboratory classroom setting. Treatment with Cotempla XR-ODT showed a statistically significant improvement in ADHD symptom control compared to placebo across the classroom day (placebo-subtracted difference of -11 [95% CI -13.9, -8.2]). Onset of effect was evident at one hour postdose and lasted through 12 hours. No serious adverse events were reported during the trial, and the adverse event profile was consistent with the established safety profile for other extended-release methylphenidate products.i In addition, data from bioequivalence and pharmacokinetic studies in children with ADHD was also submitted.ii Cotempla XR-ODT and Adzenys XR-ODT are Schedule II controlled substances. CNS stimulants (amphetamines and methylphenidate-containing products) have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Physicians should assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence. Cotempla XR-ODT will be commercially available in a portable, child-resistant blister pack in the fall of 2017.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Overshoes Customer Testimonial


Recently I ordered the NEOS Villager over shoe from your company.
I have searched for about 6 years for a boot to go over my shoes for the winter months in Wisconsin and came up with nothing
that worked because of falling arches and tarsal tunnel in my feet.
I love my boots. They fit very nice and are not clumsy or bulky. They slide on great and are very comfortable.
I can finally go out in the bad weather & not wreck my shoes or inserts - and they look like regular boots!
Keep up the good work!!!
One Happy Customer,
Mary from Sussex WI
