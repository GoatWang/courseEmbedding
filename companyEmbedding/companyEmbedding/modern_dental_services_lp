About us





Back to the basics of patient care
Apex was founded on the belief that non-branded, private practice dentistry can not only survive into the next century, but, given the right mix of ingenuity, capital, and partnership, it can thrive. Meet our leadership team below, learn about what we believe and how we do business, then head over to our Affiliation or Careers areas to learn about working with Apex.







The team 









Dr. Ed Lutz

Dr. Lutz brings almost four decades of private practice experience to Apex, having founded White Rock Dental Group in 1977. Dr. Lutz holds an undergraduate degree from the University of Texas in Austin and a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from Baylor College of Dentistry. As an alumnus of the prestigious L.D. Pankey Institute for Advanced Dental Education, Dr. Lutz is committed to high-quality care. Dr. Lutz has also served on the Peer Review Committee of the Dallas County Dental Society.









Dr. Layla Lohmann

Dr. Lohmann brings intense focus on providing high-quality patient care, and has experience operating within multiple group practice organizations. Dr. Lohmann holds an undergraduate degree with Special Distinction from the University of Oklahoma and a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree with Special Distinction from the University of Oklahoma College of Dentistry. She serves as a part-time adjunct professor at Baylor College of Dentistry and is an active member of numerous professional organizations, including the ADA and the Dallas County Dental Society.









David Lohmann

As CEO, David is responsible for the strategic leadership of the company. In addition, he leads the company’s new practice affiliation efforts as Apex continues to grow in both new and existing markets. Prior to founding Apex, David was a private equity investment professional responsible for the acquisition, oversight, and improvement of private companies. David received a Bachelor of Business Administration degree, summa cum laude, from the University of Oklahoma and a Master of Business Administration degree from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.









Matt Hale

As President and COO, Matt is responsible for the oversight and management of all operations and day-to-day functions of Apex. He leads teams comprising the finance and accounting, human resources, procurement, practice integration and information technology functions for the company. Prior to founding Apex, Matt served as co-founder and CEO of BlackBox Aviation Systems, a provider of digital record management services. Matt holds undergraduate degrees in Industrial Engineering, Finance, Mathematics, and Economics with honors from Southern Methodist University and a Master of Business Administration degree from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.








Want to know the whole story?
Apex was born as a solution to two problems: a lack of choice that young dentists faced in today’s dental world and experienced doctors feeling trapped by the decision to either continue working full time or sell their practice and retire.
Read the whole story






We take a partnership approach to business. We believe strongly that business, properly practiced, can be more than just the sustaining engine of life - it can, and indeed should be, a vehicle through which we serve others, and thus a core part of the purpose of our life.






We value






People first
Our first goal is not profit - it is to assist in creating engaged, happy, successful people. Our core competency is our ability inspire people to see their true potential and enable them to reach it.







Integrity
We conduct all business with the highest standard of integrity, honesty, and professionalism. We strive to be the shining example which we want our children to aspire to.







Teamwork
We strive to build a collaborative culture based on trust, open communication, and the sharing of ideas, leadership, and rewards.







Focus & commitment
We recognize that time and energy are our two most precious resources. Thus, we strive for focus in everything we do, eliminating the unnecessary and pushing for simplicity.

Back to the basics of patient care
Whether you're searching for a better path towards retirement, or are just ready to alleviate the burden of dealing with marketing, accounting, HR, taxes and IT so that you can focus on your patients, Apex is the answer. Working with Apex allows you to realize the personal, professional and financial flexibility you've always imagined.

Benefits of working with us
Whether you're searching for a better path towards retirement, or are just ready to alleviate the burden of dealing with marketing, accounting, HR, taxes and IT so that you can focus on your patients, Apex is the answer. Working with Apex allows you to realize the personal, professional and financial flexibility you've always imagined.









A secure path
When you decide to partner with Apex, you know with certainty that you have a secure, but flexible, path to retirement.









Financial freedom
Partnering with Apex allows practice owners to take the equity they have built out of their practice in order to begin planning for the future.









Flexibility
Apex is happy to partner with like-minded dentists, regardless of whether they want to work full or part-time, for two more years or twenty.









Impact
When you join Apex, you have the opportunity for informal mentorship of multiple younger practitioners.









Quality patient transition
When you are ready to reduce your hours in the office, you can personally transition your patients to a colleague you trust, because you have been working alongside that doctor.









Continued quality care
You can rest easy knowing that the patients who have trusted you for decades are in good hands.










The Neighborhood Group PracticeSM Model
The Neighborhood Group Practice (“NGP”) model is key to how Apex serves affiliated doctors and patients. Under the NGP model, Apex partners with multiple GPs in a given neighborhood. Over time, these separate practices can be consolidated into a single, high-quality group location.
View the model







						Sr. Doctor
					


						Associate
					










Logistics
Within each neighborhood, Apex partners with like-minded dentists who are dedicated to high-quality care and recognize the benefits of working in a collaborative, professionally-managed environment. Once a neighborhood reaches a critical mass (generally 2-3 affiliated practices), Apex establishes a group facility to consolidate the practices of its affiliated doctors.









Doctor Benefits
By having multiple doctors under one roof, the NGP model allows Apex to provide doctors with flexible schedules by more efficiently utilizing associates, staff and resources to manage patient demand. Additionally, the scale afforded by the group model enables Apex to provide the highest-quality facilities and equipment.









Patient benefits
Over time, Apex will bring specialists in-house to each NGP. Through the integration of restorative, cosmetic and specialty dentistry all under one roof, dentists are able to offer patients an interdisciplinary treatment approach and a consistently high-quality experience.










Apex provides the business and operational management tools that enable our supported dentists to concentrate on patient care in a well-managed environment.





What we do




People and development


Practice operations


Marketing


Finance & accounting


Facilities & equipment


Collaborative environment





People and development
We believe people make or break an organization. That's why we invest heavily in not only recruiting the best doctors and staff, but also in training and development initiatives to help every team member grow.




Practice operations
A broken pipe or IT snafu should never come between a patient and quality care. We handle all aspects of day-to-day business operations so it doesn't.




Marketing
Like dentistry itself, dental marketing is a fast changing world. We're dedicated to staying ahead of the curve to keep your schedule full.




Finance & accounting
Never worry about collections, bills or managing the books again. Apex handles all financial and accounting tasks.




Facilities & equipment
Our supported dentists practice in large, high-quality group practice facilities equipped with best-in-class equipment and technology. Why practice any other way?




Collaborative environment
We care deeply about the culture of the team we're a part of, and we are committed to developing an environment that improves patient care through teamwork.









We’re looking to work with practice owners who:




						Operate successful practices in attractive, well-populated communities
					




						Share Apex’s long-term focus on patient care and relationships
					




						Want to continue building their legacy, but are ready to be free from the administrative burdens of practice ownership
					




						Seek to realize the value of their practice today and continue providing clinical expertise on a full or part-time basis for at least two years

Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.

General & Cosmetic Dentistry San Jose
  General & Cosmetic Dentistry can give you a smile you’re happy to show off. Modern cosmetic dentistry techniques make it easier than ever for you to have a bright, even smile. Dr. Defaii can give you the smile you want using:

Fillings/Restorations
porcelain veneers
teeth whitening
inlays and onlays
dental crowns
dental bonding

Dental Implants San Jose
 Dental implants are designed to provide a foundation for replacement teeth that look, feel, and function like natural teeth. The person who has lost teeth regains the ability to eat virtually anything and can smile with confidence, knowing that teeth appear natural and that facial contours will be preserved. Dental implants are changing the way people live. With them, people are rediscovering the comfort and confidence to eat, speak, laugh and enjoy life. For more information about dental implants or to schedule a consultation appointment, call our office in San Jose, CA at 408-227-5012.
Teeth Whitening San Jose
 Teeth Whitening can correct brown, yellow, or spotted teeth, on people of all ages, and provides a near permanent solution for a dull smile. For confidence in appearance, bleaching technology allows us to promise improvements in yellowing, aging or stained teeth.
Porcelain Veneers San Jose
 Porcelain veneers are thin shells of ceramic that bond directly to the front surfaces of the teeth. They are an ideal choice for improving your smile and have become increasingly popular due to their simplicity and versatility.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
