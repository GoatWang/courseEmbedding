Jeramiah Nord
Jeramiah was an extremely active individual and led a very fulfilling life. He served his community as a firefighter and EMT. Then, starting in Fall 2012, he began feeling dizzy, so much so that his primary physician intended to send him to an Ear Nose Throat specialist for a possible inner ear problem or Meniere’s disease. Before he even had the opportunity to see the ENT doctor, Jeramiah lost consciousness at work and an ambulance was called. He regained consciousness, said he felt fine and was not brought to the hospital. This however, was the start of a series of life threatening events and a condition called premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) that changed Jeramiah’s life.

If you suffer from cardiac arrhythmia, you want the treatment option that can restore your quality of life and return you to your normal active routine.
Several treatment options are available.
Medication is typically the first line of therapy but can be severely limiting and lose effect over time.
Implanted devices can cause physical pain when delivering therapeutic treatment.
Catheter ablation is a minimally invasive procedure that treats the diseased areas of the heart with radiofrequency (RF) energy to restore regular rhythm. When performed manually, a large dose of potentially damaging radiation (x-ray) is often used. The manual catheter is stiff, difficult to manipulate to the desired spot and may even puncture the heart.
That’s where Stereotaxis’ remote magnetic navigation system comes in. Click here to learn about how it is used for the treatment of arrhythmias and how it is designed with a patient’s safety in mind.

The Stereotaxis Niobe® ES magnetic navigation system is the gold standard in treating ventricular tachycardia (VT).  The two scientific publications below highlight the safety and positive outcome of treating VT using the magnetic navigation system.
{1}
Safety and Clinical Outcome of Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Arrhythmias Using Contact Force Sensing:Consecutive Case Series.
Hendriks AA, Akca F, Dabiri Abkenari L, Khan M, Bhagwandien R, Yap SC, Wijchers S, Szili-Torok T.
J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol. 2015 Jul 20. doi: 10.1111/jce.12762. [Epub ahead of print]
Abstract
Full Text
BACKGROUND
Poor catheter-to-myocardial contact can lead to ineffective ablation lesions and suboptimal outcome. Contact force (CF) sensingcatheters in ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) ablations have not been studied for their long-term efficacy.

PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to compare CF ablation to manual ablation (MAN) and remote magnetic navigation (RMN) ablation for safetyand efficacy in acute and long-term outcome.
METHODS
A total of 239 consecutive patients who underwent VT ablation with the use of MAN, CF, or RMN catheters were included in this single-center cohort study from January 2007 until March 2014. The primary endpoints were procedural success, acute major complications, and VT recurrences at follow-up. The median follow-up period was 25 months.
RESULTS
Acute success was achieved in 182 out of 239 procedures (76%). Acute success in manual ablation, CF ablation and RMN ablation was 71%, 71%, and 86%, respectively (P = 0.03). Major complications occurred in 3.3% and there were less major complications (P = 0.04) in the RMN group. After an initial successful procedure, 66 of 182 patients (36%) had a recurrence during follow-up. This was not significantly different between groups. Using an intention-to-treat analysis, 124 patients (52%) had a recurrence. The recurrence rate was lowest in the RMN group.
CONCLUSION
The use of CF sensing catheters did not improve procedural outcome or safety profile in comparison to non-CF sensing ablation in this observational study of ventricular arrhythmia ablations.

Acute and long term outcomes of catheter ablation using remote magnetic navigation for the treatment of electrical storm in patients with severe ischemic heart failure.
Jin Q, Jacobsen PK, Pehrson S, Chen X.
Int J Cardiol. 2015 Mar 15; 183:11-6
Highlights:


Catheter ablation with magnetic navigation is safe and effective to suppress electrical storm in severe ischemic heart failure patients.


RMN-guided catheter ablation can prevent VT recurrence and significantly reduce ICD shocks.


Abstract
BACKGROUND
Catheter ablation with remote magnetic navigation (RMN) can offer some advantages compared to manual techniques. However, the relevant clinical evidence for how RMN-guided ablation affects electrical storm (ES) due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with severe ischemic heart failure (SIHF) is still limited.
METHODS
Forty consecutive SIHF patients (left ventricular ejection fraction, 21 ± 6.9%) presenting with ES underwent ablation using RMN. All the patients received implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) either before or after ablation. Acute ablation success was defined as noninducibility of any sustained monophasic VT at the end of the procedure. Long-term analysis addressed VT recurrence, ICD therapies and all-cause death. ES was acutely suppressed by ablation in all patients.
RESULTS
Acute ablation success was obtained in 32 of 40 (80%) patients. The procedure time and fluoroscopy time were 105 ± 27 min and 7.5 ± 4.8 min respectively. No major complications occurred during procedures. During a mean follow-up of 17.4 months, 19 patients (47.5%) remained free of VT recurrence. The percentage of patients receiving ICD shocks after ablation was lower than before ablation (30% vs 69%, P<0.01). The mean number of ICD shocks per individual per year was reduced from 4.3 before ablation to 1.9 after ablation (P<0.05). Ten patients died during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS
Acute catheter ablation with RMN is safe and effective to suppress ES in SIHF patients. RMN-guided catheter ablation can prevent VT recurrence and significantly reduce ICD shocks, suggesting that this strategy can be used as an alternative therapy for VT storm in SIHF patients with ICDs.

Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Tachycardias Using Remote Magnetic Navigation: A Consecutive Case–Control Study.
Szili-Torok T, Schwagten B, Akca F, Bauernfeind T, Abkenari LD, Haitsma D, Van Belle Y, Groot ND, Jordaens L. 
J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol (2012) 23, 948-954.
Highlights:


72 patients who underwent MNS guidance for VT ablation vs. 41 patients with manual VT ablation.


Results demonstrated positive MNS benefits in VT ablation in terms of acute success, procedure time, X-ray fluoroscopy time, safety, and 20-month chronic success.


Abstract
BACKGROUND
This study aimed to compare acute and late outcomes of VT ablation using the magnetic navigation system (MNS) to manual techniques (MAN) in patients with (SHD) and without (NSHD) structural heart disease.
METHODS
Ablation data of 113 consecutive patients (43 SHD, 70 NSHD) with ventricular tachycardia treated with catheter ablation at our center were analyzed. Success rate, complications, procedure, fluoroscopy, and ablation times, and recurrence rates were systematically recorded for all patients.
RESULTS
A total of 72 patients were included in the MNS group and 41 patients were included in the MAN group. Patient age, gender, and right ventricular and left ventricular VT were equally distributed. Acute success was achieved in 59 patients in the MNS group (82%) versus 27 (66%) patients in the MAN group (P = 0.046). Overall procedural time (177 ± 79 vs 232 ± 99 minutes, P < 0.01) and mean patient fluoroscopy time (27 ± 19 vs 56 ± 32 minutes, P < 0.001) were all significantly lower using MNS. In NSHD pts, higher acute success was achieved with MNS (83,7% vs 61.9%, P = 0.049), with shorter procedure times (151 ± 57 vs 210 ± 96, P = 0.011), whereas in SHD-VT these were not significantly different. No major complications occurred in the MNS group (0%) versus 1 cardiac tamponade and 1 significantly damaged ICD lead in the MAN group (4.9%, NS). After follow-up (20 ± 11 vs 20 ± 10 months, NS), VT recurred in 14 pts (23.7%) in the MNS group versus 12 pts (44.4%) in the MAN group (P = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS
The use of MNS offers advantages for ablation of NSHD-VT, while it offers similar efficacy for SHD-VT. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. 23, pp. 948-954, September 2012).
