Global strategy as defined in business terms is an organization's strategic guide to globalization. With such a connected world, your business’s revenue does not have to be confined by borders. You can employ a global business strategy to reap the rewards of trading in a worldwide market. A sound global strategy should address these questions: what must be (versus what is) the extent of market presence in the world's major markets? How to build the necessary global presence? What must be AND (versus what is) the optimal locations around the world for the various value chain activities? How to run global presence into a global competitive advantage? The “International” classification of a global business strategy is employed by companies who may sell in foreign markets, but their primary focus is on their home market. These companies may include international strategies in their business model to increase sales, but they know that their main target consumer is local. [1]
Academic research on global strategy came of age during the 1980s, including work by Michael Porter and Christopher Bartlett & Sumantra Ghoshal. Among the forces perceived to bring about the globalization of competition were convergences in economic systems and technological change, especially in information technology, that facilitated and required the coordination of a multinational firm's strategy on a worldwide scale.[2][3]
A global strategy may be appropriate in industries where firms are faced with strong pressures for cost reduction but with weak pressures for local responsiveness. Therefore, it allows these firms to sell a standardized product worldwide. However, fixed costs (capital equipment) are substantial. Nevertheless, these firms are able to take advantage of scale economies and experience curve effects, because it is able to mass-produce a standard product, which can be exported (providing that demand is greater than the costs involved).
Global strategies require firms to tightly coordinate their product and pricing strategies across international markets and locations, and therefore firms that pursue a global strategy are typically highly centralized.[3]
A global strategy involves thinking in an integrated way about all aspects of business-its suppliers, production sites, markets, and competition. It involves assessing every product or service from the perspective of both domestic and international market standards. It means embedding international perspectives in product formulations at the point of design, not as afterthoughts. It means meeting world standards even before seeking world markets and being world class even in local markets. It means deepening the company's understanding of local and cultural differences in order to become truly global. [4]

 Globalization: Apple’s One-Size-Fits-All Approach - Brand Quarterly    Friday, July 28 2017     Facebook    LinkedIn    Twitter               GlobalGlobalization: Apple’s One-Size-Fits-All Approach  Françoise Hovivian Dec 19          Did you know that by the end of October 2014, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were available in 69 countries and territories, with a total of 115 countries planned by the end of the 2014? That’s not the only amazing fact. Did you also know that the iPhone is the same design regardless of region?Apple did not customize their phone in terms of features and looks. So you might think Apple is taking the concept of “global” to the purist level, using a one size fits-all approach, with a standardized design across all regions, the same range of products for all countries, and no visible customization – also called localization – except for the power source, pricing, and carriers’ specifics.There are certain benefits to standardization, and this one in particular: establishing a global brand with a strong identity, worked for Apple. However, what about raising the idea that the standardization of Apple products may in fact precisely answer the requirement for cultural understanding?The secret of any global brand success is cultural understanding The secret of any global brand success is cultural understanding. What if Apple has understood the underlying common-ness of all humans so that no-need for product customization is actually the highest form of cultural understanding? Or, what if Apple has found the path to that sweet-spot, where there is a common ground among differing cultures?The thing is, going global is not just about offering a product to several markets around the world. It’s also about finding the denominator for a particular product that is region-blind. Apple, I believe, found this baseline purist – often called minimalist – approach with expansive usability testing. Steve Jobs said, “The main thing in our design is that we have to make things intuitively obvious”.However, Apple concedes to personalization on several layers. Let’s examine what those are:Apple has stores all around the world. For each of these stores, Apple follows a strict customer service protocol, which is tailored to each region. That creates insane loyalty and attachment, because the local staff uses a personalized approach to communicate with customers.Even the type of building matches the culture. For example, the Paris Apple Store is housed in a Haussmann-type building that is ideally suited to Parisians’ tastes in architecture. Or at least, what they have grown accustomed to. Bob Bridger, vice president of Apple Retail Development explains what makes Apple Stores so popular. “Once a location is picked, it’s all a matter of working towards making sure the store has an inviting appeal that matches its surrounding culture and environment. It’s about ‘getting out into the street’ and feeling what the local feels.”Second of all, Apple chooses the countries where they are going to do business carefully.  In fact for the first time in iPhone history, Apple phones will be on track to be available in more than 115 countries by the end of the year 2014, making this the largest iPhone rollout ever. Talk about localization! Apple may use a one size-fits-all strategy for their products, but that strategy allows them to launch in so many countries because they have minimal customization to subject their phones to. But the area in which they choose personalization is their technical local requirements.The new iPhone 6 supports anywhere between 16 and 20 different LTE (long-term evolution) bands, depending on the model – which is the highest of any phone being currently sold. That means you can use your US-bought iPhone 6 all over Europe and Asia with fast download speeds. That is the epitome of a global experience tailored to the regional standards, isn’t it?Third, the Apple ecommerce web site is also purist and standard across all 125 world regions that the sites it is translated into, and is a mirror of the brand. It has the same look and feel, regardless of the country you are viewing the site in, but the content is highly customized in the local language, trans-created, or reviewed by local copywriters. You find that same high translation quality in all of Apple user guides and documentation, even though Apple’s user-friendly design approach makes the use of guides somewhat obsolete.Did you know that Apple isn’t on social media? In fact, Apple customers constitute Apple’s advertising – Apple isn’t even involved.Customers adapt to Apple, Apple does not adapt to customers How and where do they get their customer pulse? By being silent. They let others do all the talking for them. Maybe that seeming lack of social marketing strategy is, in fact, the strategy. Customers come to Apple. Apple creates the want and solidifies the brand in that way. Customers adapt to Apple, Apple does not adapt to customers. In 1998, Steve Jobs told Business Week, “A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.”Lastly, I will dare to say that Apple is choosing not to adapt its products to the local culture, because it does not need to. Apple is the culture. This is the culture that people want to embrace when they wait in line at Apple Stores when they could just buy the product online. People want to experience being a part of Apple with its culture of hip, fashion, creativity, personality, and design. Apple creates the culture and customers become its embodiment. Apple has many detractors. But in the end, a successful brand is one that elicits powerful emotion and positive sentiment from its customers. How many competitors of Apple wouldn’t want to find the path to their customers’ hearts in a similar way?

Global Strategy

Global Strategy




Global Strategic Management


During the last half of the twentieth century, many barriers to international trade fell and a wave of firms began pursuing global strategies to gain a competitive advantage. However, some industries benefit more from globalization than do others, and some nations have a comparative advantage over other nations in certain industries. To create a successful global strategy, managers first must understand the nature of global industries and the dynamics of global competition.

Sources of Competitive Advantage from a Global Strategy
A well-designed global strategy can help a firm to gain a competitive advantage. This advantage can arise from the following sources:


Efficiency

Economies of scale from access to more customers and markets
Exploit another country's resources - labor, raw materials
Extend the product life cycle - older products can be sold in lesser developed countries
Operational flexibility - shift production as costs, exchange rates, etc. change over time



Strategic

First mover advantage and only provider of a product to a market
Cross subsidization between countries
Transfer price



Risk

Diversify macroeconomic risks (business cycles not perfectly correlated among countries)
Diversify operational risks (labor problems, earthquakes, wars)


Learning

Broaden learning opportunities due to diversity of operating environments


Reputation
Crossover customers between markets - reputation and brand identification


Sumantra Ghoshal of INSEAD proposed a framework comprising three categories of strategic objectives and three sources of advantage that can be used to achieve them. Assembling these into a matrix results in the following framework:



Strategic Objectives
Sources of Competitive Advantage


National Differences
Scale Economies
Scope Economies


Efficiency in Operations
Exploit factor cost differences
Scale in each activity
Sharing investments and costs


 Flexibility
Market or policy-induced changes 
Balancing scale with strategic & operational risks
Portfolio diversification


 Innovation and Learning
Societal differences in management and organization
Experience - cost reduction and innovation
Shared learning across activities



The Nature of Competitive Advantage in Global Industries
A global industry can be defined as:

An industry in which firms must compete in all world markets of that product in order to survive.
An industry in which a firm's competitive advantage depends on economies of scale and economies of scope gained across markets.

Some industries are more suited for globalization than are others. The following drivers determine an industry's globalization potential.

 Cost Drivers

Location of strategic resources
Differences in country costs
Potential for economies of scale (production, R&D, etc.)  Flat experience curves in an industry inhibits globalization. One reason that the facsimile industry had more global potential than the furniture industry is that for fax machines, the production costs drop 30%-40% with each doubling of volume; the curve is much flatter for the furniture industry and many service industries. Industries for which the larger expenses are in R&D, such as the aircraft industry, exhibit more economies of scale than those industries for which the larger expenses are rent and labor, such as the dry cleaning industry. Industries in which costs drop by at least 20% for each doubling of volume tend to be good candidates for globalization.
Transportation costs (value/bulk or value/weight ratio) => Diamonds and semiconductors are more global than ice.


 Customer Drivers

Common customer needs favor globalization. For example, the facsimile industry's customers have more homogeneous needs than those of the furniture industry, whose needs are defined by local tastes, culture, etc.
Global customers: if a firm's customers are other global businesses, globalization may be required to reach these customers in all their markets. Furthermore, global customers often require globally standardized products.
Global channels require a globally coordinated marketing program. Strong established local distribution channels inhibits globalization.
Transferable marketing: whether marketing elements such as brand names and advertising require little local adaptation. World brands with non-dictionary names may be developed in order to benefit from a single global advertising campaign.


 Competitive Drivers

Global competitors: The existence of many global competitors indicates that an industry is ripe for globalization. Global competitors will have a cost advantage over local competitors.
When competitors begin leveraging their global positions through cross-subsidization, an industry is ripe for globalization.


 Government Drivers

Trade policies
Technical standards
Regulations


The furniture industry is an example of an industry that did not lend itself to globalization before the 1960's. Because furniture has a high bulk compared to its value, and because furniture is easily damaged in shipping, transport costs traditionally were high. Government trade barriers also were unfavorable. The Swedish furniture company IKEA pioneered a move towards globalization in the furniture industry. IKEA's furniture was unassembled and therefore could be shipped more economically. IKEA also lowered costs by involving the customer in the value chain; the customer carried the furniture home and assembled it himself.  IKEA also had a frugal culture that gave it cost advantages. IKEA successfully expanded in Europe since customers in different countries were willing to purchase similar designs. However, after successfully expanding to several countries, IKEA ran into difficulties in the U.S. market for several reasons:

Different tastes in furniture and a requirement for more customized furniture.
Difficult to transfer IKEA's frugal culture to the U.S.
The Swedish Krona increased in value, increasing the cost of furniture made in Sweden and sold in the U.S.
Stock-outs due to the one to two month shipping time from Europe
More competition in the U.S. than in Europe


Country Comparative Advantages
Competitive advantage is a firm's ability to transform inputs into goods and services at a maximum profit on a sustained basis, better than competitors. Comparative advantage resides in the factor endowments and created endowments of particular regions. Factor endowments include land, natural resources, labor, and the size of the local population.
In the 1920's, Swedish economists Eli Hecksher and Bertil Ohlin developed the factor-proportions theory, according to which a country enjoys a comparative advantage in those goods that make intensive use of factors that the country has in relative abundance.
Michael E. Porter argued that a nation can create its own endowments to gain a comparative advantage. Created endowments include skilled labor, the technology and knowledge base, government support, and culture. Porter's Diamond of National Advantage is a framework that illustrates the determinants of national advantage. This diamond represents the national playing field that countries establish for their industries.


Types of International Strategy: Multi-domestic vs. Global
Multi-domestic Strategy

Product customized for each market
Decentralized control - local decision making
Effective when large differences exist between countries
Advantages: product differentiation, local responsiveness, minimized political risk,  minimized exchange rate risk

Global Strategy

Product is the same in all countries.
Centralized control - little decision-making authority on the local level
Effective when differences between countries are small
Advantages: cost, coordinated activities, faster product development


A fully multi-local value chain will have every function from R&D to distribution and service performed entirely at the local level in each country. At the other extreme, a fully global value chain will source each activity in a different country.
Philips is a good example of a company that followed a multidomestic strategy. This strategy resulted in:

Innovation from local R&D
Entrepreneurial spirit
Products tailored to individual countries
High quality due to backward integration

The multi-domestic strategy also presented Philips with many challenges:

High costs due to tailored products and duplication across countries
The innovation from the local R&D groups resulted in products that were R&D driven instead of market driven.
Decentralized control meant that national buy-in was required before introducing a product -  time to market was slow.


Matsushita is a good example of a company that followed a global strategy. This strategy resulted in:

Strong global distribution network
Company-wide mission statement that was followed closely
Financial control
More applied R&D
Ability to get to market quickly and force standards since individual country buy-in was not necessary.

The global strategy  presented Matsushita with the following challenges:

Problem of strong yen
Too much dependency on one product - the VCR
Loss of non-Asian employees because of glass ceilings

A third strategy, which was appropriate to Whirlpool is one of mass customization, discussed below.

Global Cost Structure Analysis
In 1986, Whirlpool Corporation was considering expanding into Europe by acquiring Philips' Major Domestic Appliance Division. From the framework of customers, costs, competitors, and government, there were several pros and cons to this proposed strategy.
Pros

Internal components of the appliances could be the same, offering economies of scale.
The cost to customize the outer structure of the appliances was relatively low.
The appliance industry was mature with low growth. The acquisition would offer an avenue to continue growing.

Cons

Fragmented distribution network in Europe.
Different consumer needs and preferences. For example, in Europe refrigerators tend to be smaller than in the U.S., have only one outside door, and have standard sizes so they can be built into the kitchen cabinet. In Japan, refrigerators tend to have several doors in order to keep different compartments at different temperatures and to isolate odors. Also, because houses are smaller in Japan, consumers desire quieter appliances.
Whirlpool already was the dominant player in a fragmented industry.


Since Philip's had a relatively small market share in the European appliance market, one must analyze the cost structure to determine if the acquisition would offer Whirlpool a competitive advantage. With the acquisition, Whirlpool would be able to cut costs on raw materials, depreciation and maintenance, R&D, and general and administrative costs. These costs represented 53% of Whirlpool's cost structure. Compared to most other industries, this percentage of costs that could benefit from economies of scale is quite large. It would be reasonable to expect a 10% reduction in these costs, an amount that would decrease overall cost by 5.3%, doubling profits. Such potential justifies the risk of increasing the complexity of the organization.
Because of the different preferences of consumers in different markets, a purely global strategy with standard products was not appropriate. Whirlpool would have to adapt its products to local markets, but maintain some global integration in order to realize cost benefits. This strategy is known as "mass customization."
Whirlpool acquired Philips' Major Domestic Appliance Division, 47% in 1989 and the remainder in 1991. Initially, margins doubled as predicted. However, local competitors responded by better tailoring their products and cutting costs; Whirlpool's profits then began to decline. Whirlpool applied the same strategy to Asia, but GE was outperforming Whirlpool there by tailoring its products as part of its multi-domestic strategy.

Globalizing Service Businesses
Service industries tend to have a flat experience curve and lower economies of scale. However, some economy of scale may be gained through knowledge sharing, which enables the cost of developing the knowledge over a larger base. Also, in some industries such as professional services, capacity utilization can better be managed as the scope of operations increases.  On the customer side, because a service firm's customers may themselves be operating internationally, global expansion may be a necessity. Knowledge gained in foreign markets can used to better service customers. Finally, being global also enhances a firm's reputation, which is critical in service businesses.
High quality service products often depend on the service firm's culture, and maintaining a consistent culture when expanding globally is a challenge.
A good example of a service firm that experienced global expansion challenges is the management consulting firm Bain & Company, Inc.  In consulting, a firm's most important strategic asset is its reputation, so a consistent firm culture is very important. Bain faced the following challenges, which depend on the firm's strategy and which affect the ability to maintain a consistent culture:

Coordinating across offices and sharing knowledge
Whether to hire locals or international staff
How to compensate


Modes of Foreign Market Entry
An important part of a global strategy is the method that the firm will use to enter the foreign market. There are four possible modes of foreign market entry:

Exporting
Licensing (includes franchising)
Joint Venture
Foreign Direct Investment

These options vary in their degree of speed, control, and risk, as well as the required level of investment and market knowledge. The entry mode selection can have a significant impact on the firm's foreign market success.

Issues in Emerging Economies
In emerging economies, capital markets are relatively inefficient. There is a lack of information, the cost of capital is high, and venture capital is virtually nonexistent. Because of the scarcity of high-quality educational institutions, the labor markets lack well trained people and companies often must fill the void. Because of lacking communications infrastructure, building a brand name is difficult but good brands are highly valued because of lower product quality of the alternatives. Relationships with government officials often are necessary to succeed, and contracts may not be well enforced by the legal system.
When a large government monopoly (e.g. a state-owned oil company) is privatized, there often is political pressure in the country against allowing the firm to be acquired by a foreign entity. Whereas a very large U.S. oil company may prefer acquisitions, because of the anti-foreign sentiment joint ventures often are more appropriate for outside companies interested in newly privatized emerging economy firms.

Knowledge Management in Global Firms
There is much value in transferring knowledge and best practices between parts of a global firm. However, many barriers prevent knowledge from being transferred:

Barriers attributable to the knowledge source
lack of motivation
lack of credibility

Barriers attributable to the knowledge itself - ambiguity and complexity
Barriers attributable to the knowledge recipient
lack of motivation (not invented here syndrome)
lack of absorptive capacity - need prerequisite knowledge to advance to next level

Barriers attributable to the recipient's existing process - process rigidity
Barriers attributable to the recipient's external environment and constraints

Furthermore, even when the transfer is successful, there often is a temporary drop in performance before the improvements are seen. During this period, there is danger of losing faith in the new way of doing things.
To facilitate knowledge transfer a firm can:

Implement processes to systematically identify valuable knowledge and best practices.
Create incentives to motivate both the knowledge source and recipient.
Develop absorptive capacity in the recipient - cumulative knowledge
Develop strong technical and social networks between parts of the firm that can share knowledge.


Country Management
Country managers must have the following knowledge:

Knowledge of strategic management
Firm-specific knowledge
Country-specific knowledge
Knowledge of the global environment


Country organizations can assume the role of implementor, contributor, strategic leader, or black hole, depending on the combination of importance of the local market and local resources.




Strategic Importanceof Local Market
Level of Local Resources & Capabilities


Low
High


Low
Implementor
Contributor


High
Black Hole
Strategic Leader




The least favorable of these roles is the black hole, which is a subsidiary in a strategically important market that has few capabilities. A firm can find itself in this situation because of company traditions, ignorance of local conditions, unfavorable entry conditions, misreading the market, excessive reliance on expatriates, and poor external relations. To get out of a black hole a firm can form alliances, focus its investments, implement a local R&D organization, or when all else fails, exit the country.
Country managers assume different roles (The New Country Managers, John A. Quelch, Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School).

International Structure: Country manager is a trader who implements policy.
Multinational Structure: Country manager plays the role of a functional manager with profit and loss responsibilities.
Transnational Structure: Country manager acts as a cabinet member (team player) since management control systems are standardized and decision-making power is shifted to the region manager. The country manager develops the lead market in his country and transfers the knowledge gained to other similar markets.
Global Structure: Country manager acts as an ambassador and administrator. In a global firm there usually are business directors who oversee marketing and sales. The role of the country manager becomes one of a statesman. This person usually is a local with good government contacts.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
