PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. THERE IS RISK OF LOSS. YOU CAN LOSE MONEY IN A MANAGED FUTURES PROGRAM.
*For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds’ monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.
Morningstar Rating is for the I share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics.

There is a substantial risk of loss in managed futures, and there can be no guarantee that any managed futures program or the Equinox Frontier Funds will meet their intended objective; accordingly, an investment in the Equinox Frontier Funds may not be suitable for everyone.

The Funds also rely on each of the CTAs chosen in meeting the investment objectives. An investment in the Funds involve a high degree of risk due to substantial price volatility in domestic and foreign markets for financial instruments, currencies, energy, metals, and commodities and the uncertainty as to the ability of the CTAs to profit in the markets traded.
Futures, forward, and options trading are speculative, volatile, and highly leveraged; select markets and instruments may be subject to liquidity restrictions from time to time.
An investor could lose a substantial portion, or even all, of his or her investment.
An investor’s annual tax liability may exceed cash distributions.
There is no secondary markets for the units and the transfer of units is restricted. If you redeem all or portion of your class 1 units before the end of 12 months following your purchase, you will be charged a redemption fee of up to 2% of the purchase prices of the units being redeemed.
The Funds face the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts.
The Equinox Frontier Funds are not mutual funds and are not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds. This and other important information about the Funds are in the relevant Prospectuses which can be obtained by calling 1.877.837.0600 The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

View Performance




The investment philosophy of H2O is based on the conviction that value diversification is the most stable and robustsource of alpha over time. All-out diversification not only across assets, but also by investment horizon and manager expertise, gives us the ability to make better decisions and to produce more consistent risk adjusted performance. To generate alpha, H2O AM follows a top-down qualitative investment process and monitors the risk associated to calibrate the highly diversified strategies. No single position in itself has any meaning outside this overall risk/return context. A view is fed by a set of factors from seven fund managers and established as a risk-on, risk-off or diversifying strategy at a given horizon. The qualitative views are then translated into quantitative forecasts taking into account past volatilities and correlations and using Black & Litterman methodology as the key instrument enabling the conversion of views into positions. H2O AM fund managers take directional, relative value and specific/thematic positions in fixed income, currency and equity markets (no credit, no commodity exposure). The exposures are first decided in respect of each asset class: G4 govies, USD and equity markets. Relative value strategies are then constructed independently from the directional positions: they are "exposure-neutral". Finally, specific or thematic calls may be implemented separately. All the above strategies are invested using preferably derivatives. The Funds Under Management corresponds to the assets of the strategy.

The Multi-Strategy Program (MSP) is an approximate 50/50 combination of the Spread Trading Program (STP) and the Long-Short Commodity Program (LSCP). STP seeks non-correlated alpha through the spread and relative value trading of exchange-listed futures and options that are primarily commodity contracts. Quantitative research and significant discretion are used in trade selection and execution. The LSCP is a short to medium-term systematic program with a discretionary overlay that trades outright positions on 13 exchange-listed commodity futures contracts. The program uses multiple trend models on both outright and calendar spread data and analyzes historical spread levels to generate daily trade signals. The MSP is designed to generate returns that have a low to negative correlation to most CTA and commodity programs.

Portfolio holdings are as of the date stated, are subject to change, and should not be considered investment advice. The portfolio holdings do not include investments of the Equinox Frontier Funds (the “Trust”) cash management pool and the related allocation to the Quest Fixed Income Tracker-based Hedge Program (“QFIT”). QFIT is designed to produce investment returns that have a positive correlation to medium-term interest rates in the United States.  Equinox Fund Management, LLC is allocating to QFIT in order to hedge its cash management investments in U.S. Treasuries.  Such allocation is intended to mitigate duration risk and preserve capital in the Trust’s cash management pool, rather than generate capital appreciation as with the Trust’s other investments in CTA trading programs. The Trust’s total allocation to QFIT was $135 million, as of 3/31/2016.  Such allocation is shared pro-rata by each Fund of the Trust.

There is a substantial risk of loss in managed futures, and there can be no guarantee that any managed futures program or the Equinox Frontier Funds will meet their intended objective; accordingly, an investment in the Equinox Frontier Funds may not be suitable for everyone. The Funds are highly speculative and their success depends upon the ability of Equinox Fund Management, LLC to allocate assets to multiple strategies and commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”). The Funds also rely on each of the CTAs chosen in meeting the investment objectives. An investment in the Funds involve a high degree of risk due to substantial price volatility in domestic and foreign markets for financial instruments, currencies, energy, metals, and commodities and the uncertainty as to the ability of the CTAs to profit in the markets traded.
Futures, forward, and options trading are speculative, volatile, and highly leveraged; select markets and instruments may be subject to liquidity restrictions from time to time.
An investor could lose a substantial portion, or even all, of his or her investment.
An investor’s annual tax liability may exceed cash distributions.
There is no secondary markets for the units and the transfer of units is restricted. If you redeem all or portion of your class 1 units before the end of 12 months following your purchase, you will be charged a redemption fee of up to 2% of the purchase prices of the units being redeemed.
The Funds face the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the OTC contracts.
The Equinox Frontier Funds are not mutual funds and are not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds. This and other important information about the Funds are in the relevant Prospectuses which can be obtained by calling 1.877.837.0600 The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.

Equinox Investment Philosophy and Process
At Equinox Funds, we believe that alternative and traditional investment portfolios built around rigorous diversification and dynamic risk management can add long-term value to an investment strategy. With this philosophy in mind, the Equinox portfolio management team employs the following six-step investment process:




 SCREEN
After determining a Fund or Program’s goals and objectives, the Portfolio Team screens the manager universe for suitable candidates.


 ANALYZE
During this stage, the Portfolio Team seeks to rigorously evaluate historical performance and portfolio attributes as they relate to performance, volatility and strategy discipline.


 SELECT
The next step involves performing exhaustive due diligence on organization, personnel, investment process and operations.


 CONSTRUCT
At this stage of the process the anticipated portfolio is stressed using simulation tools for optimal return, risk, correlation and drawdown metrics.


 MANAGE
Once the initial candidates are identified, the Portfolio Team continually rebuilds the universe of managers and retests the portfolio dynamics.


 REBALANCE
Continuous monitoring of existing managers’ trading and performance seeks to detect style drift or other potential issues and rebalancing occurs as necessary.


Throughout the process, our goal is to provide investors with high-quality alternative investment portfolios that — when added to an asset allocation strategy — can potentially reduce risk and enhance returns over time.

There are substantial risks and potential conflicts of interest associated with managed futures programs. The success of an investment in such a program is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (“CTA”) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in futures trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. Managed futures accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request. You may have market exposure even after the CTA has a request for closure or liquidation.
