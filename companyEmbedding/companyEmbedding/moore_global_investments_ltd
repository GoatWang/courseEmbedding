Moore Capital Management

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Moore Capital Management LLC is an American hedge fund sponsor-owned by its employees. It was founded in 1989 by American billionaire Louis Moore Bacon.[1] In 2011, MCM's largest funds were the $7.4 billion Moore Global Investment Fund, and the $4.6 billion Moore Macro Managers Fund.[2]

Description[edit]
MCM was founded and headquartered in New York, New York. MCM has 429 employees worldwide with satellite offices in New York, London, Zurich, Hong Kong and Washington, D.C.. MCM maintains six offshore funds and domestic equivalents of its largest funds. As of the end 2010, its fund's values were valued at: Moore Global Investments and Remington combined; $8.2 billion, Moore Macro Managers; $4.3 billion; Moore Emerging Markets; $1.5 billion. The remaining three funds each in possession of between $81 million and $324 million.[3]
MCM is characterized as a global macro investor, utilizing macroeconomic themes, cash, futures and derivatives in its portfolios. Bacon, its founder, participates in most of the global markets, basing his moves on his evaluation of the future trends of inflation, economic growth, central bank policy and national politics. He then determines what themes and investments to play based on data from his strategists and researchers.[3]
History[edit]
Moore Capital Management MCM was founded by Bacon in 1989, who launched Moore Global Investments in 1990 using the $25,000 he inherited from his mother and named the company using his middle name.[3]
MCM's first investor was Antoine Bernheim, president of Dome Capital Management, who in 1990 accounted for $1.5 million of MCM's initial $1.8 million in assets and redeemed his investment in 2009.[3]
MCM launched the Moore Macro Managers Fund in 1993 and is led by 14 manager teams. From 1993 until 2009, the Macro Managers fund held the name, Moore Global Fixed Income Fund. Until 2002, Bacon himself was very much involved in the management of the fund but later it became a macro fund and the name was revised accordingly. Between 2002 through 2005, its assets under management grew to $4 billion from $1.8 billion.[3] The fund has not had any down years and has compounded at 15 percent annually through 2010.[3] The firm might cap the fund soon, when it reaches $4.5 billion to $5 billion.[3]
In 2008, MCM let nervous investors redeem $5 billion in shares despite decent performance.[3]
In 2009 MCM launched two new funds; Moore Emerging Equity Long/Short Fund and Moore Emerging Fixed Income and Currency Fund. The company also offered incentives for new investors in other funds.[3]
In 2010, British regulators entered MCM's London offices and arrested trader Julian Rifat, for allegedly participating in illegal insider trading in concert with other traders. Rifat was put on leave during the investigation.[3][4][5]
In April of that year, MCM paid $25 million to settle the charges brought against it by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC) which accused MCM of manipulating settlement prices for Nymex platinum and palladium futures contracts. Charges were also filed by the CFTC, against MCM for failure to “diligently supervise” MCM's commodity interest transactions. The case was settled without much reaction from MCM's investors. According to MCM, the individual responsible for the CFTC infraction left the company in 2008 and members of current management had not been accused of any wrongdoing.[3]
In September 2010, the firm had $4,118 million in US equity assets under management.[6]

Before reading this update, make sure you check out the Hedge Fund 13F filings preface.This week, turning the focus to global macro funds, we'll be checking in on Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management. Do note that global macro funds are typically not necessarily equity focused funds. While they do indeed have equity exposure, the majority of their holdings are in other markets. So, we mainly track them to check in on their sector exposure to see what types of global macro themes they may be investing in. This is a switch from some of the more value oriented funds we've been covering, like the 'Tiger Cub' funds including Stephen Mandel's Lone Pine Capital, Lee Ainslie's Maverick Capital, John Griffin's Blue Ridge Capital, and Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global. Global macro funds seek to find investments in whatever market they can gain an edge, whether it be equities, bonds, currencies, debt, commodities, and more. But, they are only required to disclose equity holdings.Louis Bacon comes from the group of "offspring" of the legendary Commodities Corporation. Moore emerged as a successful offspring along with fellow great macro traders Bruce Kovner (Caxton Associates) and Paul Tudor Jones (Tudor Investment Corp). Moore, named after Bacon's middle name, is a $10 billion global macro set of hedge funds. Louis Bacon is a famed trader and risk manager. And, interestingly enough, Bacon helped get his firm off the ground when Paul Tudor Jones stopped accepting capital from investors and instead turned them to Bacon's firm. Returning 31% annually since inception in 1990, Bacon can be very proud of his flagship fund, Moore Global Investments. But it doesn't stop there. His returns have shown little correlation to the stock market and low volatility. He is the definition of a risk manager. For 2008, their Global Investments fund finished -4.3%, their Global Fixed Income fund finished +1.3%, and their Emerging Markets Fund finished -17.6%, as noted in our comprehensive list of hedge fund performance numbers.Bacon credits his risk management skills to the futures markets, where he learned to be sensitive to market action. And, he learned such skills at an early age. While getting his MBA at Columbia, he used his student loan money to trade. And he lost it all. Clearly, he learned a lesson he would never forget. Such a lesson stuck with him as he worked various jobs in the financial industry before eventually starting his own firm. And, in his first year managing Moore Capital Management, he returned 86%. Bacon strives to identify long running macro trends. While he has a longer-term macroeconomic view, he won't let that stop him from making money by trading around the position in the mean time. If you want to hear some insightful thoughts from Louis Bacon himself, head over to our post on Hedge Fund manager interviews.Many successful members of Moore have gone on to start their own funds.  For instance, we track Bret Barakett's Tremblant Capital, who learned his trade at Moore.  Also, its worth pointing out that Stanley Shopkorn, formerly of Moore Capital, has started his own fund.  Additionally, we recently learned that Christopher Pia, another Moore alum will be starting his own fund.  But enough about those who have gone on to do their own thing.  Let's check out what Moore was up to.The following were their long equity, note, and options holdings as of December 31st, 2008 as filed with the SEC. We have not detailed the changes to every single position in this update, but we have covered all the major moves.

Moore was out adding massively for a few select names, increasing their position in many cases by > 300%. There seems to be a theme of a lot of economic recovery and 'early cycle' plays as if to position the portfolio to benefit from an increase in global activity. Assets from the collective long US equity, options, and note holdings were $1.3 billion last quarter and were $821 million this quarter. This is just one of many funds in our hedge fund portfolio tracking series in which we're tracking 35+ prominent funds. We've already covered Paulson & Co (John Paulson), Carl Icahn, Warren Buffett, Stephen Mandel's Lone Pine Capital, George Soros, Bill Ackman's Pershing Square, Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global, Timothy Barakett's Atticus Capital, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, Seth Klarman's Baupost Group, Peter Thiel's Clarium Capital, Bret Barakett's Tremblant Capital, David Stemerman's Conatus Capital, James Pallotta's Raptor Capital Management, Lee Ainslie's Maverick Capital, John Griffin's Blue Ridge Capital, Bruce Kovner's Caxton Associates, and Paul Tudor Jones' Tudor Investment Corp.
