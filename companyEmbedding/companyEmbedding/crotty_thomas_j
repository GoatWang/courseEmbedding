Tom Crotty • Senior Advisor







 Boston  • Joined Battery in 1989

After a dozen years as Managing General Partner overseeing all investment and operational aspects of Battery, Tom moved into a senior advisor role within the partnership. He will act principally as an advisor on overall management and strategy of the firm, as well as stepping into portfolio board situations on an as needed basis. During his time as an investor, Tom focused on the communications and software industries, leading investments in dozens of early stage companies.
Tom has been actively involved in promoting and lobbying on behalf of the Venture Capital industry, having served on the Board and Executive Committee of the National Venture Capital Association.  He served on the Small Company IPO Task Force, which examined and recommended to the US Treasury and the SEC changes to existing securities regulations with the goal of increasing access to the public securities markets for small business. A number of the task force’s recommendations were incorporated into the 2012 Jobs Act legislation passed by Congress.
Tom  began his venture capital career in 1986 when he joined Abacus Ventures. He has been in the technology industry since 1980, starting at IBM in its mainframe business.
