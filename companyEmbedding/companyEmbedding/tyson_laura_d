Opportunity for All and Social Innovation: Obama’s Policy AgendaBy Laura D'Andrea Tyson and Jonathan Greenblatt 




Laura D’Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and headed the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council under President Bill Clinton. Jonathan Greenblatt is a special assistant to President Obama and director of the Office of Social Innovation and Civic Participation at the White House.
Updated, 3:07 p.m. | As Thomas Piketty reminds us in his new book, “Capital in the 21st Century,” we are living in an era of rising inequality of income and wealth and of eroding equality of opportunity. In the United States, income and wealth inequality have reached levels not seen since the 1920s. And both demographic trends and job-displacing technological change are aggravating the social and economic maladies rooted in widening inequality.
Today's EconomistPerspectives from expert contributors.President Obama has set forth an ambitious agenda to expand opportunity for all Americans, including health care reform, investment in education, an expansion of the earned-income tax credit and an increase in the minimum wage. However, as a result of budgetary constraints, federal  government financing for nonmilitary discretionary programs — a category that includes most federal support for kindergarten through 12th grade and early childhood education, workforce development and training, and programs that benefit low-income, vulnerable populations — is on course to be lower in real terms than before the Great Recession and fall to a historic low as a share of gross domestic product.
As the government seeks to manage these severe fiscal pressures, improving the cost-effectiveness of government programs is also essential. That requires more evidence-based research on program performance and the reallocation of funds from less-effective programs to more effective ones. The Obama administration is doing both. At the same time, it is also using the leverage of federal government resources to strengthen incentives for the private sector to develop and expand new programs. And it is developing ways to support the nonprofits that increasingly are asked to deliver essential human services even as their resources fail to keep pace with growing demand.  Read more…

The Significance of the Minimum Wage for Women and FamiliesBy Laura D'Andrea Tyson 



Laura D’Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and headed the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council under President Clinton. 
I want to focus on the impact of the minimum wage on women.
Today's EconomistPerspectives from expert contributors.Let’s start with a few statistics. The typical worker earning the minimum wage is not a teenager and is not male. She is an adult woman. Adult women are the single biggest demographic group among minimum wage workers, far outnumbering teenagers of both genders and men of all ages.
Less than half of all workers are women, but they account for 75 percent of workers in the 10 lowest-paid occupations and about 60 percent of minimum wage workers. And most women earning the minimum wage are not teenagers, or wives who can rely on a spouse’s income.
About three-quarters of female minimum wage workers are above the age of 20, and about three-quarters of these women are on their own. Many, of course, are working and taking care of children.

The Challenges of Running Responsible Supply ChainsBy Laura D'Andrea Tyson 

PhotoRescuers carry a survivor pulled from the rubble of a building that collapsed near Dhaka, Bangladesh, in May 2013, killing more than 1,000 people. The disaster led to several international agreements intended to protect workers and make factories safer.Credit Rahul Talukder/Associated Press


Laura D’Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and headed the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council under President Clinton. 
Horrific factory tragedies often prompt powerful public calls for reform, and the Rana Plaza fire that killed more than 1,100 garment workers in Bangladesh almost a year ago is no exception.
Today's EconomistPerspectives from expert contributors.Bangladesh is the poster child for the global apparel industry. It is the world’s second-largest exporter of clothing after China. Its factories employ four million workers, supplying retail giants like Benetton, Walmart, J.C. Penney and H&M. About 90 percent of these workers are women, and they earn wages that are among the lowest in the developing world. Yet for them, a job in the garment industry is often the only job available and a possible step out of grinding poverty. Apparel wages in many countries, including Bangladesh, are often higher than wages in alternative employment.
At a dreadful human cost, the Rana Plaza tragedy has led to some beneficial changes. To protect their brands and reputations, American and European corporations have scrambled to reduce the risks of similar calamities. Several big European companies have signed an Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, which includes binding commitments and financial obligations to make factories safer and submit them to independent inspectors. Major retailers in the United States have signed a similar but less-ambitious agreement known as the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.
Both groups have cooperated to establish a fire safety and structural integrity standard for the factories with which they do business. American companies have committed to completing inspections at more than 700 factories to assess their compliance with the new standard by the middle of this year. This will be a formidable task. There is a shortage of trained inspectors in Bangladesh, and at the end of January only about 30 percent of the required inspections were done.

Tempered Optimism for the EconomyBy Laura D'Andrea Tyson 


Laura D’Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and headed the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council under President Clinton. 
The last few years have begun with rosy expectations for an acceleration of growth in the United States economy, and this year is no different. This time, however, the rosy expectations are more likely to be realized. After several years of lackluster growth around 2 percent, forecasters are predicting that the economy will enjoy its strongest growth since the 2008 recession, with growth in the 3 percent range. There are plenty of reasons for optimism.  But there are also plenty of reasons that optimism should be tempered with caution and with concern about the prospects for sustainable and equitable growth.
Today's EconomistPerspectives from expert contributors.The headwinds impeding the recovery — from impaired household balance sheets, a depressed housing market and government budget cuts — are dissipating.  As a result of painful deleveraging, household debt has fallen to the levels of the early 1990s, and household debt payments as a share of after-tax income are as low as they have been since the early 1980s, when the the data series began.
Equity and home values have risen, restoring real household net worth to its prerecession peak. Residential investment continues to strengthen, although it is still below its prerecession rate as a share of gross domestic product; house prices are rising; and the number of underwater mortgages, mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures has declined significantly.
The fiscal position of state and local governments is improving, and they are adding rather than cutting jobs. Employment by the federal government continues to decline, but federal fiscal austerity is easing. As a result of the recent budget deal, the federal budget is on course to subtract only about 0.5 percent from G.D.P. in 2014, compared with a whopping 1.75 percent in 2013. Congressional fiscal follies, with destabilizing showdowns over the debt limit and government shutdowns, appear to be on hold at least for the 2014 midterm election year.
As these headwinds dissipate, monetary policy is likely to remain highly accommodative. At its last meeting, the Federal Reserve reiterated its intention to hold the federal funds rate near zero well past the time that the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 percent and to trim its asset purchases by only a modest amount. Policy continuity is expected when Janet Yellen becomes the Fed chief this month, as she has been a vocal co-architect of the Fed’s accommodative monetary stance.
The combination of stronger household balance sheets, a rebounding housing market, less fiscal restraint and continued monetary accommodation bodes well for the economy’s growth in 2014.  So does the fact that job creation is gaining momentum. Improving job prospects have strengthened consumer confidence, which should fuel stronger consumption growth.  Read more…

Raising the Minimum Wage: Old Shibboleths, New EvidenceBy Laura D'Andrea Tyson 


Laura D’Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. 
The last several decades have been especially hard on American workers in jobs that pay the minimum wage. Adjusted for inflation, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour today is 23 percent lower than it was in 1968. If it had kept up with inflation and with the growth of average labor productivity, it would be $25 an hour. 
Today's EconomistPerspectives from expert contributors.Congressional Democrats have proposed legislation to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour and index it to inflation, and President Obama signaled support in a recent speech highlighting the economic and political dangers of growing income inequality. Predictably, opponents of an increase in the minimum wage are once again invoking the hackneyed warning that it will lead to higher unemployment, especially among low-skilled, low-wage workers who are the intended beneficiaries. 
I heard the same refrain in 1996 when I served as chairwoman of President Bill Clinton’s National Economic Council, and he worked with congressional Democrats to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour at a time when it had fallen in real terms to a 40-year low. To hear Republican opponents and lobbyists for retailers and fast-food companies, we were about to inflict a cold-hearted fate on young people and minority workers. The same chorus is voicing the same dire predictions today.
As it happened, the United States experienced a spectacular boom in employment and prosperity from 1996 to 2000.  Indeed, these years proved to be a rare and all-too-brief period when incomes improved at every wage level. Contrary to the warnings of the naysayers, a higher minimum wage did not impede robust employment growth; it did contribute to healthy income gains for low-wage workers.

Game-Changing Investments for the U.S.By Laura D'Andrea Tyson and Susan Lund 



Laura D’Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton. Susan Lund is a partner at McKinsey & Company and the McKinsey Global Institute based in Washington.
While Washington remains mired in brinksmanship over the debt ceiling and the budget, a potentially larger problem is building that may constrain growth for decades to come. In late 2012, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report revising potential gross domestic product downward because of weak investment in the underlying productive capacity of the economy, a slowdown in productivity growth and demographic shifts. 
Today's EconomistPerspectives from expert contributors.Today G.D.P. in the United States remains nearly $2 trillion below the prerecession trend and is expanding at an anemic annual rate of about 2 percent, both because of weak aggregate demand and because of the slowdown in the economy’s potential growth rate. A resurgence in investment is essential to address both causes of the disappointing recovery and to create jobs.
Annual net private nonresidential fixed investment — a measure of the productive investment and real expansion in physical structures, equipment and software — fell to less than $100 billion (in 2005 dollars) in 2009 and 2010 from a peak of $435 billion in 2007. And while it has recovered since then, it remains 40 percent below its prerecession peak. 
When measured as a share of G.D.P., this trend is even more worrisome. Net productive investment averaged roughly 4 percent of G.D.P. in the United States in the postwar period until 2000. The share plummeted after the 2001 recession and again after the 2008-9 recession, falling to a historic low of just 0.63 percent of G.D.P. in 2009.  Read more…

The Quality of Jobs: The New Normal and the Old NormalBy Laura D'Andrea Tyson 


Laura D’Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. 
Since the Great Recession of 2008-9, the labor market has recovered at an agonizingly slow pace. Despite 42 consecutive months of gains in private-sector employment, the unemployment rate is still at 7.3 percent; in December 2007 it was only 4.6 percent. The current unemployment rate is higher now than in 2007 across all age, education, occupation, gender and ethnic groups.   
Today's EconomistPerspectives from expert contributors.That’s despite the fact that about four million workers have left the labor force, driving the labor force participation rate to a historic low, at least a percentage point below its long-run (downward) trend, according to the Council of Economic Advisers.  
Both hiring and quit rates remain significantly below their pre-recession peaks. Although the share of the long-term unemployed has fallen from its peak of 45 percent in 2011 to 38 percent today, it is still far above its 2001-7 average. And about eight million people are working part-time for “economic reasons,” a euphemism for those who would like a full-time position but cannot find one.
The weakness of the labor market is manifest not only in the number of jobs created and the number of unemployed but also in the quality of jobs. Here the news is also bleak.  Read more…

Japan’s Women to the RescueBy Laura D'Andrea Tyson 


Laura D’Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. 
Among economists (most of whom are male), there is a tendency to treat diversity and gender equality as “soft” issues – worthy social goals perhaps, but secondary to the real business of economic growth, job creation and productivity.
But these soft issues have jumped to the top of the long-term growth agenda in Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is working to shake the nation out of its 20-year deflationary slump.
Today's EconomistPerspectives from expert contributors.So far the world’s attention has focused on Mr. Abe’s bold macroeconomic policies to lift demand and growth in the short run.  These policies have been strikingly successful, confirming the validity of Keynesian remedies for an economy suffering from insufficient demand when interest rates are stuck at their zero lower bound. As a result of higher deficit spending and a vast quantitative easing program by the Bank of Japan, the Japanese economy is growing at 4 percent, the highest rate among advanced economies, and the stock market has soared by 80 percent over the last six months.
Now, after his recent impressive electoral victory, Prime Minister Abe has signaled his intention to move forward with the “third arrow” of his policy quiver — significant structural reforms to increase Japan’s long-term growth potential.  His list reads like a neoclassical economist’s list of “usual suspects,” including deregulation, industrial restructuring, corporate tax reform and trade liberalization — all worthy objectives.  But in a departure from tradition, he is also championing reforms to expand economic opportunities for women.

The Myriad Benefits of a Carbon TaxBy Laura D'Andrea Tyson 


Laura D’Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. 
Few goals in Washington have more bipartisan support, at least in theory, than cleaning up the tax code. Republicans and Democrats say they want a system that is simpler, fairer and more efficient. Put simply, they want a system with fewer special tax breaks and lower rates.
Today's EconomistPerspectives from expert contributors.Yet one of the best ideas for advancing all of those goals – and also heading off catastrophic climate change — isn’t even on the table. I refer to a carbon tax, which would impose a price on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
Most climate experts concur that dangerous climate change is occurring at a more rapid rate than expected. They also agree that the deterioration in the earth’s climate is primarily a result of carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption by humans. If you dispute the overwhelming scientific consensus about man-made climate change and the role of fossil fuel emissions, you should probably stop reading now. Evidence is unlikely to affect your opinions.
But if you accept this consensus, you should know that economists across the political spectrum agree that a carbon tax is the most effective way to discourage carbon consumption and lower the risks of catastrophic climate changes.
I am convinced by the environmental case for a carbon tax. But I want to make a broader argument: a carbon tax could be an engine for tax simplification, deficit reduction, less government regulation and even increased competitiveness.  Read more…

Getting More Bang for the Buck in Higher EducationBy Laura D'Andrea Tyson 


Laura D’Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton. 
Republicans and Democrats are hurtling toward another bipartisan standoff, this one over rival plans on the interest rates to be charged on subsidized federal loans to help students and their families pay for postsecondary education. Unless Congress can agree on a plan, the interest rate on new loans will double on July 1 to 6.8 percent from 3.4 percent.  
Today's EconomistPerspectives from expert contributors.While the interest rate on student loans is important, there are much bigger problems in the financing of higher education: soaring tuition costs, the exploding volume of total student debt and shockingly low college completion rates. Americans are spending unprecedented amounts, both privately and publicly, on higher education. What are the returns? Are there ways to get more bang for the buck on this substantial investment in the nation’s future work force?
Students are already borrowing about $113 billion a year, more than twice as much as a decade ago, and student debt now tops $1 trillion. The federal government accounts for nearly 90 percent of all student loans and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that students will take out  $1.4 trillion in new federal loans over the next decade.  
For young college graduates the unemployment rate is 8.8 percent, and the underemployment rate, which includes those who have given up looking for a job or who are working part time because they cannot find a full-time job, is about 18.3 percent. In addition, many college graduates have been forced to settle for low-paying jobs that do not require a college degree. 
Not surprisingly, the default rate on student loans is increasing: more than 13 percent of students whose loans came due in 2009 were in default as of September 2012, meaning that they had missed payments on their loans for more than 60 days.

Trade Deficits Won't Ruin Us
By LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON
Popular measures of the economy's performance almost certainly understate just how well the economy has done. But one popular and politically charged economic indicator is getting worse: the nation's trade imbalance.

National Economic Council Head Is Named
By DOUGLAS JEHL,
After weighing the decision for more than two months, President Clinton today elevated Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacant post as coordinator of the Administration's economic policy. In her new job as the new head of the National Economic Council, Dr. Tyson will succeed Robert E. Rubin, who held the job until he was named Treasury Secretary in December. She will move to the head of the table in Cabinet-level discussions on economic policy, with power tantamount to that of the national security adviser, from her current job, one that is usually filled by an academic economist.

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
