        Great looking area rug!
This is a great looking NFL Dallas Cowboys area rug that we gave to our handicapped son for his Dallas Room! It really looks great and has a great graphic. The quality of the product is very good! And he loves it!

Reviews Summary for Yaesu FT-817ND








            Reviews: 185
            

            
                Average rating: 4.8/5
            
            
            

            
                MSRP: $589.00
            
            
            



            
                
		Description: The worlds first self-contained, battery-powered, Multi-mode Portable Transceiver covering the HF, VHF, and UHF bands! Despite its incredibly small size (5.3" x 1.5" x 6.5"), the FT-817 delivers big performance! Its next-generagion PA puts out five watts on all HF bands, plus the 50 MHz, 144 MHz, and 430 MHz bands, on all popular operating modes: USB/LSB/CW/AM/FM/Packet/PSK-31/RTTY. Now the 817 legacy is even better with the introduction of the FT-817ND, which includes coverage of the U.S. 60-meter (5 MHz) band, and it also includes  a 1400 mAh NiMH Battery pack (FNB-85) and NC-72B Charger!

                Blank Display Unusable&nbsp
                

                Time owned: more than 12 months
                



                    
	            This FT-817ND a little over 2 years old, very sparingly and carefully used, does not work now, as its got a blank display.. As there is no service centre for this in india I am forced to scrap it.. shows poor build quality..
Yaesu and Icom and Alinco are not what they used to be.. deteriorating quality, unimaginative products and utterly devoid of any new technology and products .. sad..

                I'm Taking it With Me!&nbsp
                

                Time owned: more than 12 months
                



                    
	            The Yaesu FT-817 is no "D", "PRO", nor "K", yet, this deaf as a post, broad as a barn, 5 watt flea is one of Amateur Radio's great rigs.

The configurations and combinations are endless...base, mobile, portable, pedestrian/hand-held, external power, internal batteries, antennas, antennas, ANTENNAS, SO-239, BNC, HF, VHF/UHF and more.  In the shack, in the mobile, in the field, in the hand, there ain't nothin', AIN'T NOTHIN' that can do it ALL from anywhere and everywhere quite like the FT-817.

I've made DX contacts with my FT-817ND from impromptu shacks with a wire, while seaside in 4X with a "screw-stick", while walking the dog with HF BNC whips, countless Sporadic-E, Tropo and satellite contacts with a variety of antennas and many, MANY more.  A different shack each day.  The world is my shack.

The FT-817 is great in the mobile too.  At 5 watts, it only draws 2 amps.  Just connect it to the lighter/12v and a mag mount antenna.  Wedge the rig between the seats...EASY!  VHF/UHF FM and SSB, HF DX, SO-239, BNC, each connector selectable by band...Too easy!  I get good reports from around town and around the world.

Its back is its bottom, its front is its top.  Wow!  The agile FT-817 is an acrobat that stands on end.  The FT-817's modest size and nimble form enable it to work from ANY position.

Clutched in the left hand, the FT-817 is ergonomically smart to the right handed with its BNC out of the way to the left, its display, VFO, AF/RF Gain, "Select" and other HT sized controls well positioned and it's mic connected to the right side.  Clarifier and IF Shift are a touch away.

With its BNC at the "top" and internal batteries, the FT-817 is VERY effective when used hand-held.  With a collection of HF/VHF/UHF BNC whips, whether contacts exceed 1000miles/watt HF SSB, 100miles/watt VHF SSB or 10miles/watt VHF/UHF FM, I'm often asked, "Did you say hand-held?".

With no experience, I can't comment on digital or CW, but there are innumerable successes just as diverse as voice...10,000miles/watt.

Every contact is memorable because every contact is an adventure..and a thrill.  And with each contact, a story ("There I was,..").  One is always at their Radio Amateur best to get the most out of the FT-817's 5 watts.  One will find themselves looking at the '817 after, yet, another great contact in, yet, another configuration from, yet, another QTH, saying, "WOW!..This rig is unFBelivable!".

The FT-817 is even an ambassador for Amateur Radio.  When working portable, be prepared to get "those looks" and to demonstrate what Amateur Radio is to the curious.

Do you want to tighten it up?  Get a filter. Do you want to mod this versatile rig?  There's a cottage industry supporting the FT-817.

Great but aging, the FT-817's receiver, filtering, speech, efficiency, power, battery and other features need to be updated.  But NOT the "anywhere, anyway" gestalt of the rig that makes the FT-817 so amazing, so versatile, so influential, so profound and so much FUN.

How can you NOT like this rig?  How can you not find a use for it?  How can you not find a place in the shack, in the mobile, in the field, in the hand for the FT-817?  Every ham should have this rig! 

The FT-817 provides an extraordinary Ham Radio experience..anywhere and everywhere.

"Hand-held, QSL.".

I'm taking it with me!

                Antenna switching issue&nbsp
                

                Time owned: more than 12 months
                



                    
	            I own the FT-817 ND since June 2013, when I bought it from WIMO in Germany. No doubt it is a nice and handy transceiver, but I use it only occasionally for driving transverters to other bands (4 m, 23 cm and 3 cm). 

In June 2014 I encountered a problem while driving a 4 m XVTR: The RF connection through the antenna switching relay RL3016 (Omron G6Y-1) was broken. After some research I found that this relay is operated outside its specifications when the rear antenna socket is used. The relay coil is permanently energized in this case, and the heat could lead to generation of a coating of the contacts, which apparently has happened.

There are three solutions to the problem:
(1) do not use the rear antenna contact
(2) replace the relay with a type that withstands permanent magnetization of the coil
(3) bridge the relay RF contacts such that both front and rear antenna sockets are active

I did not want to damage the PCB so I choose not the replace the relay but rather bridge the contacts (solution 3).

Before I did this I approached the supplier WIMO, since the RIG was still covered by warranty. They did never bother to reply, even not after chasing them up, so I decided to just modify the RIG. Still I think it is a design issue, and YAESU should install a different type of relay.

                Picnic in a basket! &nbsp
                

                Time owned: 0 to 3 months
                



                    
	            I confess that I got away from QRP with an Icom 703 long ago . . . and now miss it. But there are two things that I enjoy in leisure time - a good picnic basket loaded with goodies, and a QSO challenge.  With the 817nd I get both!

Let's see . . . enzfed antenna - check; portable tuner - check; external power supply - check . . .

                Fantastic radio.  Excellent.&nbsp
                

                Time owned: 3 to 6 months
                



                    
	            There is some weird satisfaction that comes along with only using 5 watts to work so many different areas of the world.  I am extremely pleased with this transceiver.  I own the original 817 and did the out of band modification strictly to use it on 60 meters.  It has worked well for me on all bands.  The battery life is excellent.  I bought mine used off Ebay with a travel case and wall charger.  I have used it with a G5RV antenna portable, Hustler resonators mobile, and also on VHF/UHF.  I really enjoy it, and love the fact you can throw it in a back pack and take it anywhere.  Five stars, highly recommend.

                It does it all&nbsp
                

                Time owned: more than 12 months
                



                    
	            If I could only keep one radio .. this would be it!.

 Very affordable compared to others on the market and with a 14+ year old well proven design , its still in production. That tells us how right Yaesu got it from the start.

Slap a decent antenna on it and you will be amazed what 5W can do. I regularly get nice comments on my strong clear audio. My radio has worked the world on 5W SSB and Stateside on 500mw..
 Some people compare it to a "KX3", but that costs over double the price so hardly comparable! .. For portable work this is hard to beat..
 My only gripe I have against the little FT817 is battery life.. But Battery technology has moved on a long way and the problem is easily resolved by fitting a 3S 2500ma LIPO battery intended to fit Futaba RC plane controllers.

Would I buy it again... You bet!!!

                update from 09/2014&nbsp
                

                Time owned: 6 to 12 months
                



                    
	            shortly after i bought it i took the gear out for a trial run. first contact was atlanta- 2k miles away. i THOUGHT i was putting out 5w, the icon indicating such. the other day i was reading, for the 6th time,the manual. i realised it nowhere mentions what wattage to expect with each icon, just max, high, middle and low. so i put it on a qrp swr/watt meter with a dry dummy load and got a surprise (i started to say 'shock', but it might send the wrong idea!). using the internal battery pack or external battery all you get is 2.5w out, and it steps down to 1.25, 1 and.5w at the bottom. if you want 5w you need 13.8vdc. then it steps down to 2.5, 1, and .5w.
where to get 13.8vdc? car cigarette lighter with the engine running, probably a generator, or a power supply. power supplies vary. i can dial the desired voltage on one i own, and the other is a fixed '12v power supply' that meters at 13.8.
don't be discouraged with fewer contacts in the field- appreciate the ones you DO make!
it really is a nice machine with few limitations. work within them and you can be happy!

                Very nice and rigid QRP radio.&nbsp
                

                Time owned: more than 12 months
                



                    
	            I've owned this little gem for over a year. It's used primarily as a backpack radio. It's build quality is exceptional. It has a nice quiet receiver. I added an optional 300Hz mechanical filter from W4RT and could not believe the difference this filter makes. The filter significantly improved CW RX performance. I use the radio about half the time for CW. SSB sounds nice too on the internal speaker.
Having VHF and UHF is a big plus as I don't need to carry a separate radio for those bands.
My other portable rig is an Elecraft KX3. The Yaesu FT-817 has a lot quieter receiver, especially when trying to copy weak signals. FT-817 has a much better internal speaker as well. I just wish my FT817 had a TX audio compressor and DSP. I added an optional DYC-8x7 external speech compressor from Funk Amateur. It adds an extra S-unit on the receive side.
I'm very happy with the radio and would recommend it to anyone.

                everything I wanted in a portable&nbsp
                

                Time owned: 0 to 3 months
                



                    
	            I picked up this radio about a month ago. I have really enjoyed the challenge of making long distance SSB contacts. After reading about this radio I was convinced that SSB QRP at 5 watts would be an impossibility...NOT SO! Just yesterday I had a 1560 mile QSO from oklahoma to whidbey island washington. The op was kind enough to record it and send it back to me so I could hear my audio and I was amazed. I am forever hooked on qrp ssb.

This little radio gets a lot of negative comments on the receiver...but I can understand where sacrifices have to be made to keep the radio small and portable. I think the receiver is more than adequate, and while I do not have any optional filters installed, I find if I add some lows using the IF shift function it tends to deal with most noise I encounter and enhances the intelligibility of the station I am receiving. 

Yeah, the stock battery pack sucks, no way around that. I just use a 7ah SLA battery and it is doing the job. I cannot wait to get this radio portable when the weather clears. True this is a heavily menu-laden radio, but after about 15 minutes of fiddling with it, it becomes second nature and no manual is needed.

To all the detractors that thing negative of this radio, I think you are being unfair or have unrealistic expectations of it's performance at this price point. I can tell you that I will never sell or trade this radio and it has earned a permanent place in my shack. If it died tomorrow I would definitely get another.

	            FT-817ND, Bought new from HRO,owned since 2009, works well, pleasure to operate, goto rig for trips.
     This is 3rd rig of this series, bought first two as used with no transmit, but since had repaired at Yaesu factory.
     Neat rig for general operating, even used it in Field Day and November SS(cw/ssb). I was pleased to work KH6 and KL7 stns using 5 watts and end fed antenna on 20 mtrs. W4RT cw filter is awesome!
     This a semi-backpacing rig, due to power required and size of power source needed(ie:heavy batteries:)).
     Great all around portable rig that does it all!

Preschool toys that promote pretend play allow children to use their imaginations and creativity while developing fine motor skills. It also encourages the development of social skills and cognitive thinking. Children who engage in pretend play learn how to communicate more effectively and have the opportunity to solve problems and overcome challenges in a safe, secure environment, which boosts self-confidence.
How Can You Make Pretend Play Time More Productive?
Using realistic pretend play toys, integrating math problems, and encouraging preschoolers to invite children their own age into the pretend play scenario are all ways to make play time more beneficial. Parents and caregivers can also ask children questions and create challenges that prompt the child to use their creativity and critical thinking skills. It is also OK to simply let children interact with pretend play toys on their own to foster independence.
What Are Some Popular Pretend Play Activities?
Kid-size grocery stores, kitchens, and doctor setups, as well as Play-Doh kits and tea sets, are all great for pretend play. They allow children to develop a wide range of skills. Dolls, figurines, puppets, and fake food offer preschoolers the opportunity to have fun while using their imaginations and building communication skills. Dress-up sets, musical instruments, and science kits are other popular pretend play toys.Side Refine PanelShop by CategoryToys & HobbiesPreschool Toys & Pretend PlayBrio Preschool ToysBrio Compatible Preschool ToysPretend Play DinosaursPretend Play Dish & Tea SetsPretend Play Doctor & Nurse KitsPretend Play Dress-Up & CostumesFisher-Price Preschool ToysPretend Play KitchensLittle Tikes Preschool ToysLittlest Pet Shop ToysPlay-Doh & Modeling ClayPlaymobil Preschool ToysPlayskool Preschool ToysPretend Play PuppetsPreschool PuzzlesStep 2 Preschool Toys & Pretend PlayPretend Play Tool SetsWooden & Handcrafted Pretend Play ToysOther Preschool & Pretend Play ToysSales & EventsShop All Toys DealsShop All EventsSelling on eBaySell DirectConsign Items

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsDefinitely worth itByPaige Turneron September 18, 2015Verified PurchaseThis extender adds much more play space to the fort than we had thought it would. It makes the fort 7 inches longer which doesn't sound like much but makes a big difference when kids are moving the figures around inside it. Without it the interior space would be a little snug, but the extension opens up the inside to allow more room for the play figures. The fort is very nice and this extender makes it even better.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsbut if you have the fort and would like to make it largerByMEon March 15, 2015Verified Purchasejust came in a clear plastic bag ,but if you have the fort and would like to make it larger....Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseSee all verified purchase reviews (newest first)Write a customer review

New Listing on desirable West side location This well cared for home in Paradise has 2 nice sized bedrooms plus a very large bonus room with knotty pine paneling. Newer carpets in bedrooms hardwood floors in living room. There is a nice woodstove on a brick hearth in the living. The kitchen is very light and bright with corner windows and even the old style built in ironing board. The laundry room is inside off the kitchen. There is a fairly new propane central heating unit in the secret basement root cellar area accessed from the laundry room. Upon entering to the property you're greeted by a circular driveway there is a one car garage with an extended carport and even a heated hobby room or workshop area attached to the garage. As you step up into the huge rear yard you will find loads of tall trees and lush vegetation and even a fruit tree or two. The property does go slightly beyond the rear fence. The rear yard is fenced and nicely private. This home has the feeling of a quaint farmhouse with the feeling of being in the woods in your own little part of Paradise. Call today for your personal preview. CB1744

                    At nearly a mile in length, Big River Crossing is the longest public pedestrian bridge across the Mississippi River. 

Big River Crossing is also the country¿s longest active rail/bicycle/pedestrian bridge. It serves as the connection point of Main Street to Main Street, a 10-mile multi-modal corridor that also features the Delta Regional River Park and Big River Trail, creating ties to attractions between Memphis, TN and West Memphis, AR. 

No matter how you travel it, Big River Crossing provides opportunities for recreation and fitness with a whole new point of view.

                    I am a native Memphian, and I love Memphis because there are so many great things to say about the River City that I really don't know where to start; from the Mississippi River, the Pyramid, Elvis Presley, Beale Street, Orpheum Theatre (Broadway plays and musicals), Overton Park with the Memphis Zoo, one of the top zoo's in the nation, Pink Palace Museum, Children's Museum, Levitt Shell (free outdoor concerts), Brooks Art Gallery, the medical center including St. Jude, Le Bonheur and a Level 1 Trauma Center, Amtrak to New Orleans and Chicago, fabulous restaurants and the Green Line to Shelby Farms, the largest urban park in the United States.  Because I'm a native Memphian I have extensive knowledge and a wealth of information on neighborhoods, parks, communities, schools (public and private), restaurants, shopping, etc.  Please send me an email or text requesting information on whatever would interest you about Memphis, and I will reply back quickly.

                    Did you know that Paradise has been having exceptional concerts?  Last night was another gem.  The event put on by Plugged in & Turned on in Paradise have been putting together some fantastic shows for our enjoyment . Last night performing at the Paradise Performing Arts was the  Ray Charles Project featuring Tony Lindsay (Santana) and Chris Cain (Nominated Blue Guitarist of the Year) with special guests Danny Hall (The Doobie Brothers) and Carlos Reyes.

Last nights concert was filmed for a new Live Music TV show coming soon.  Paradise and its neighbor Chico along with the surrounding cities and towns can be proud of this new home grown show.

                    Paradise to me is like leaving Chico and arriving a mini version of Tahoe. If you love the pine trees, the cooler summer air, great community and a smaller town with lots of personality. Come visit Paradise, we hope its all its name portrays it to be.

                    Paradise, CA is a small town in the Sierra Nevada Foothills with spectacular views of the canyons and deer on your doorstep. The community is known for its festivals and support of its neighbors.  The outdoorsman would fit right in here with hunting, fishing, cycling, kayaking, boating, and hiking trails within minutes of your home.  Theater on the Ridge and the Paradise Performing Arts Center offer a little culture from a cozy venue. Events like Johnny Appleseed Day and Days of Living History at the Gold Nugget Museum can take you back in time like only a small town can. The Duck Pond and Bille Park are wonderful places to picnic and pull out your camera for some gorgeous photos in a peaceful setting.
