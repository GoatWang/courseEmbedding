Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC 
Notes to Schedule of Investments (unaudited)  June 30, 2012   
Portfolio Valuation 
The net asset value (NAV) of the Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC (the Master
Fund) is determined by, or at the direction of, Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P. (the Adviser or Grosvenor), in accordance with the valuation principles set forth below, or as may be determined from time to time,
pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors (the Board). Pursuant to the valuation procedures, the Board has delegated to the Adviser the general responsibility for valuation of the Master Funds underlying
investments (the Portfolio Funds) subject to the oversight by the Board.  The Master Fund Board
has approved procedures pursuant to which the Master Fund will value its investments in Portfolio Funds at fair value, generally at an amount equal to the NAV of the Master Funds investment in the Portfolio Funds as determined by Portfolio
Funds general partner or investment manager. If no such information is available, or if such information is deemed to not be reflective of fair value by the Adviser, an estimated fair value is determined in good faith by the Adviser pursuant
to the Master Funds valuation procedures. Generally, the NAVs of the investments in the Portfolio Funds are determined whereby the Master Fund records the investment and subsequent subscriptions at its acquisition cost, which represents its
fair value at the time of subscription. The investment is adjusted to reflect the Master Funds share of net investment income or loss and unrealized and realized gain or loss that reflects the changes in the fair value of the investment for
the period.  The Portfolio Funds record their investments at fair value in accordance with GAAP or
International Financial Reporting Standards. The Portfolio Funds generally hold positions in readily marketable securities and derivatives that are valued at quoted market values and/or less liquid non-marketable securities and derivatives that are
valued at estimated fair value. Accordingly, valuations do not necessarily represent the amounts that might be realized from the sale or other dispositions of investments, nor do they reflect other expenses or fees that might be incurred upon
disposition. The mix and concentration of more readily marketable securities and less liquid non-marketable securities varies across the Portfolio Funds based on various factors, including the nature of their investment strategy and market forces.
 Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations of the investments in the Portfolio Funds, their estimated
values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the Portfolio Funds existed, and the differences could be material. Net change in accumulated unrealized appreciation on investments in the Statement of
Operations is net of fees and performance-based compensation payable to the investment managers of the Portfolio Funds.  Some of the Portfolio Funds may invest all or a portion of their assets in illiquid securities and may hold a portion or all of these investments independently from the main portfolio. These separate
baskets of illiquid securities (side pockets) may be subject to additional restrictions of liquidity that are stricter than the liquidity restrictions applicable to general interests in the Portfolio Fund. If the Master Fund withdraws
its interest from such a Portfolio Fund, it may be required to maintain its holding in the side pocket investments for an extended period of time and retain this remaining interest in the Portfolio Fund. In instances, where such a Portfolio Fund
closes its operations, the Master Fund may receive an in-kind distribution of a side pockets holdings in liquidation of its 
 


Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC 
Notes to Schedule of Investments (unaudited)(continued)  June 30, 2012   

entire interest in the Portfolio Fund. The value of side pockets may fluctuate significantly. As of June 30, 2012, the Master Funds investments in side pockets and special liquidating
vehicles represented 3.17% of the Master Funds net assets. Additionally, the governing documents of the Portfolio Funds generally provide that the Portfolio Funds may suspend, limit or delay the right of their investors, such as the Master
Fund, to withdraw capital. The primary restrictions applicable to individual Portfolio Funds as of June 30, 2012 are described in detail on the Master Funds Schedule of Investments. 
The Master Fund uses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair
value. The objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price).
Accordingly, the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:   


 

 
 Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities that the Master Fund has the ability to
access at the measurement date;   


 

 
 Level 2  Quoted prices which are not considered to be active, or inputs that are observable (either directly or indirectly) for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability; and   


 

 
 Level 3  Prices, inputs or modeling techniques which are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little
or no market activity).  The preparation of the Schedule of Investments in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Schedule of Investments and accompanying notes. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the Master Funds Schedule of
Investments are reasonable and prudent; however, the actual results could differ from these estimates. The Master Fund applies the authoritative guidance under GAAP for estimating the fair value of investments in the Portfolio Funds that have
calculated their NAVs in accordance with the specialized accounting guidance for investment companies. Accordingly, the Master Fund estimates the fair value of an investment in a Portfolio Fund using the NAV of the investment (or its equivalent)
without further adjustment unless the Adviser determines that the NAV is deemed to be not reflective of the fair value.  Investments may be classified as Level 2 when market information (e.g. observable NAVs) is available, yet the investment is not traded in an active market and/or the investment is subject to transfer
restrictions, or the valuation is adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability. Market information, including observable NAVs, subscription and redemption activity at the underlying Portfolio Fund, and the length of time until the
investment will become redeemable, is considered when determining the proper categorization of the investments fair value measurement within the fair valuation hierarchy. Portfolio Fund investment lots that have observable market inputs (e.g.
published NAVs) and that the Master Fund has the ability to redeem from within twelve months of the balance sheet date are classified in the fair value hierarchy as Level 2. 
 


Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC 
Notes to Schedule of Investments (unaudited) (continued)  June 30, 2012   
The Master Funds investments in the Portfolio Funds that have
unobservable inputs and/or from which the Master Fund does not have the ability to redeem within twelve months are classified in the fair value hierarchy as Level 3. When observable prices are not available for these securities, the Master Fund uses
the market approach, as defined in the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements, to evaluate the fair value of such Level 3 instruments. Although the Master Fund does not have the ability to redeem from the Portfolio Funds classified in
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy within twelve months of the measurement date, these Portfolio Funds may transact with other investors at the NAV of the investment (or its equivalent). In certain circumstances, the Adviser may make adjustments to
the reported NAV of a Portfolio Fund when it believes that the reported NAV is not representative of fair value. Specifically, for certain Portfolio Funds in liquidation, the reported NAV is adjusted based on the Advisers estimate of the net
realizable value of the Portfolio Fund in liquidation. As of June 30, 2012, approximately $2.8 million, or 13.95%, of investments in Portfolio Funds classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy were fair valued using such approach.
 The following table sets forth information about the level within the fair value hierarchy at which the
Portfolio Fund investments are measured at June 30, 2012:

 Transfers include investments in Portfolio Funds that were previously categorized as Level 2 investments, with a fair value of $132,403, which have
been re-classified as Level 3 for the period ended June 30, 2012. Such transfers were primarily the result of changes in redemption terms and the Master Funds inability to redeem from these investments within twelve months of the balance

 The Master Fund follows authoritative guidance that permits a reporting entity to measure
fair value of an investment that does not have a readily determinable fair value, based on the NAV for the investment. In using the NAV, certain attributes of the investment that may impact the fair value of the investment are not considered in
measuring fair value. Attributes of those investments include the investment strategies of the investees and may also include, but are not limited to, restrictions on

the investors ability to redeem its investments at the measurement date and any unfunded commitments. The Master Fund is permitted to invest in alternative investments that do not have a
readily determinable fair value, and as such, has determined that the NAV, as calculated by the reporting entity, generally represents the fair value of the investments. A listing of the investments held by the Master Fund and their attributes as of
June 30, 2012, that may qualify for these valuations are shown in the table below.

 The information summarized in the table above represents the general terms of the specific asset class. Individual Portfolio Funds may have terms

**
 Reflects fair value of investments in each respective investment category. 
The Master Funds investments reflect their estimated fair value, which for marketable securities would generally be
the last sales price on the primary exchange for such security, and for the Portfolio Funds, would generally be the NAV as provided by the Portfolio Fund or its administrator. For each of the classes below, the fair value of the Portfolio Funds has
been estimated based upon the NAV of the Portfolio Funds, subject to adjustments by the Adviser if deemed necessary.  (a) Distressed Securities This class includes the Portfolio Funds that invest in debt and equity securities of companies in financial difficulty, reorganization or bankruptcy,
nonperforming and subperforming bank loans, and emerging market debt. As of June 30, 2012, the Master Fund had no unfunded capital commitments to the Portfolio Funds within this strategy. 
(b) Event Driven This class includes the Portfolio Funds that take significant positions in
companies with special situations, including distressed stocks, mergers and takeovers. As of June 30, 2012, the Master Fund had no unfunded capital commitments to the Portfolio Funds within this strategy. 
 


Grosvenor Registered Multi-Strategy Master Fund, LLC 
Notes to Schedule of Investments (unaudited) (continued)  June 30, 2012   
(c) Long and/or Short Equities This class includes
the Portfolio Funds that make long and short investments in equity securities that are deemed by the Investment Managers to be under or overvalued. The Investment Managers typically do not attempt to neutralize the amount of long and short
positions. As of June 30, 2012, the Master Fund had no unfunded capital commitments to the Portfolio Funds within this strategy.  (d) Multi-Arbitrage This class includes the Portfolio Funds that seek to exploit price differences of identical or similar financial instruments, on different markets or in different
forms by simultaneously purchasing and selling an asset in order to profit from the difference. As of June 30, 2012, the Master Fund had no unfunded capital commitments to the Portfolio Funds within this strategy. 
Income Taxes  The U.S. federal income tax basis of the Master Funds investments in the Portfolio Funds for U.S. federal income tax purposes is based on amounts reported to the Master Fund by the Portfolio Funds
on a Schedule K-1. As of June 30, 2012, the Master Fund had not yet received information to determine the current tax basis of the Portfolio Funds as of June 30, 2012. Based on the amounts reported to the Master Fund on Schedule K-1 as of
December 31, 2011, and after adjustment for purchases and sales between December 31, 2011 and June 30, 2012, the estimated tax basis of the Portfolio Funds at June 30, 2012 for U.S. federal income tax purposes is $441,696,293,
and net unrealized appreciation for U.S. federal income tax purposes is $76,974,503 (gross unrealized appreciation $222,937,027; gross unrealized depreciation $145,962,524). 
 


ITEM 2  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 


(a)
 The Registrants principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, have concluded

filing date of the report that includes the disclosure required by this paragraph, based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 30a-3(b) under the 1940 Act (17 CFR 270.30a-3(b)) and Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or 240.15d-15(b)).   


(b)
 There were no changes in the registrants internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940
Act (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the registrants last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrants internal control over financial reporting.
 ITEM 3  EXHIBITS  Certifications pursuant to Rule 30a-2(a) under the 1940 Act and Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are attached hereto.
