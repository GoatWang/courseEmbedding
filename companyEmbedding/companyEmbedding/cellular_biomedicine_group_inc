Alan List, MD
Chair of Scientific Advisory Board
Dr. Alan List is currently the President and Chief Executive Officer of Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute in Tampa, FL. Dr. List is internationally recognized for his many contributions in the development of novel, more effective treatment strategies for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). His pioneering work led to the development of lenalidomide (Revlimid®) from the laboratory to clinical trials, which went on to receive fast-track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and approval for the treatment of patients with MDS and multiple myeloma. This work transformed the natural history of MDS from a premalignant condition that progressed to malignancy requiring aggressive treatment to a condition managed in the outpatient setting with oral agents.
Previously Dr. List served as Executive Vice President and Physician-in-Chief, the Vice Deputy Physician-in-Chief, and the Chief of the Malignant Hematology Division at Moffitt, where he holds the Morsani Endowed Chair. Before joining Moffitt in 2003, Dr. List was a Professor of Medicine at the University of Arizona, Tucson, where he also served concurrently as the Director of the Leukemia and Blood and Marrow Transplant Program and Director of the Division of Translational/Clinical Research Program.
After earning a medical degree in 1980 from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Dr. List completed an internship and residency in internal medicine at the Good Samaritan Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona.

(NASDAQ:CBMG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Is Cellular Biomedicine Group A Buy?Mar.21.17 | About: Cellular Biomedicine (CBMG) Mary Jane Fountain Long/short equity, special situations, contrarian, Deep ValueSummaryCellular Biomedicine Group Inc. is an early stage biotech with no debt.2017 project targets include expansion of in-house manufacturing facilities in China to support up to 2 x 10,000 treatments per annum.China has four times the population of the US, while this US-China company has access to both markets on FDA and China product approval.CBMG's pipeline is still partly early stage and costly, while manufacturing expansion accommodates future costs.Cellular Biomedicine Group (NASDAQ:CBMG) has investment potential for a number of reasons. Its primary market, China, has at least four times the population of the United States, and has an aging population, and CBMG is interested in the US market too. Its last 10-K states that 'stem cell products for injection into painful joints' will fuel an overall increase in the use of US stem cell-based treatments, with an increase to $5.7 billion in 2020. A sizeable market. Key growth areas for stem cell treatments are spinal fusion, sports medicine, and osteoarthritis of the joints. Source CBMG 2016 10-K:    According to International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases, 2011, 53% of KOA patients will degenerate to the point of disability. Conventional treatment usually involves invasive surgery with painful recovery and physical therapy. As drug-based methods of management are ineffective, the same journal estimates that some 1.5 million patients with this disability will degenerate to the point of requiring artificial joint replacement surgery every year. However, only 40,000 patients will actually be able to undergo replacement surgery, leaving the majority of patients to suffer from a life-long disability due to lack of effective treatment. Osteoarthritis is one of the ten most disabling diseases in developed countries. Worldwide estimates are that 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women aged over 60 years have symptomatic osteoarthritis. It is estimated that the global OA therapeutics market was worth $4.4 billion in 2010 and is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 3.8% to reach $5.9 billion by 2018. 
 CBMG management is well seasoned, with US University educated expertise, and experience from AstraZeneca, AbbVie, and MedImmune. Its product pipeline is diversified across stem cells and immuno-oncology, with relatively low cost product testing, vested in Chinese hospitals, but to Chinese and US FDA standards. It has in-house cellular manufacturing facilities in China being expanded in 2017. Quality management systems are ISO 9001 approved. 62 patents are filed internationally. Just 14,251,246 outstanding shares, $44 million in cash (February 2017) and currently no debt. So what's not to like? Well, in terms of potential stock dilution, an overseas structure with contracted subsidiaries, product pipeline, and stock trending, there are risks. History of High Stock Volatility and Prices CBMG stock has a history of a much lower float and high share price valuations due to trading volatility. That has attracted momentum traders in the past, but the amount of issued shares has tripled. Even so, the outstanding stock less insider ownership is still relatively small. The stock has been holding a long-term price low for some months now, but below long-term moving averages. Assuming the imminent low holds, it could bode well for a 'long' position. Overseas Operations CBMG is a US-orientated business but with operations in China. There are risks in investing in overseas businesses. Nasdaq, for instance, de-listed a block of companies operating in China because (having sent investigators to compare local filings with those in the US), there was found to be a material difference. Since then, standards for auditing all US businesses have improved, and that includes the situation for overseas operations. I described this issue in more detail in another stock article. Sentiment and Litigation Many China-oriented businesses have suffered from poor sentiment over recent years. For those with 'Chinese Fraud' concerns, Cellular Biomedicine Group Inc. has successfully defended a 'fraudulent' claim lawsuit. Although it's currently 'on appeal', the company advises it's frivolous and includes persons it has no connection with. It has also recently received a recent and substantial $2.2 million grant from a Californian University, which adds to its credibility.
 Company Structure CBMG Shanghai holds 100% interest in its subsidiaries in China, but the ownership of CBMG Shanghai is controlled by asset agreements. These contracts were replaced last November according to the 10-K filed recently, which now offers some transparency, including a statement that: CBMG Shanghai grants to the WFOE (CBMG Wuxi) an irrevocable and exclusive option to purchase, at its sole discretion, any or all of CBMG Shanghai assets at the lowest purchase price permissible under PRC laws. The term of the agreement is 10 years, provided, however, the agreement may be extended at the option of the WFOE. Since this agreement permits the WFOE to determine the service fee at its sole discretion, the agreement in effect provides the WFOE with rights to all earnings of the VIE. 

So, the contract covers the assets owned by CBMG Shanghai and ensures exclusive service provision to them over the 10-year agreement, while allowing outright acquisition of assets by WFOE (a CBMG wholly owned company), held by CBMG Shanghai at the cheapest price possible in China. 

 It's possible that CBMG Shanghai 'could' sell its shell to another organization; the contract is on the assets held rather than the company shell itself. However, the loan agreement terms include 'Power of Attorney' over the directors in Shanghai, whose shares are held as security within a pledge by both directors to surrender them on any default in a formal 'Equity Interest Pledge Agreement'. Further detail is supplied in the 10-K, but the risk summary is as follows:
 

 There are several stock holding/businesses available for sale, which are mentioned in its filings, either linked to the US or China corporations: Arem Pacific Corporation (OTCPK:ARPC), Alpha Lujo, Inc. (OTCPK:ALEV) and Wonder International Education & Investment Group Corporation (OTC:WIEI). No other information is available, and they are not mentioned in the organization structure, so maybe they're just not active operations. Product Pipeline CBMG's pipeline covers immunotherapy, and stem cell research, with an application for severe autoimmune disease. This means investment risk is spread over two different branches of biotechnology. Its CAR-T and T Central Memory Cell (Tcm) based immuno-oncology are very early stage, with two candidates in Phase 1 and others at the pre-clinical stage. My interest and focus is really on its stem cell therapy. Hundreds of American athletes are already using stem cell therapy for sports injuries and cartilage regeneration, but CBMG's product offers superior cell growth. Also, it seems to have limited 'known' competition in China. Source 2016 10-K: ..Competitors, to our knowledge, the only ones based in and operating in Greater China are Beike, Lorem Vascular, which has partnered with Cytori to commercialize Cytori Cell Therapy for the cardiovascular, renal and diabetes markets in China and Hong Kong, and OLife Bio, a MediPost joint venture with JingYuan Bio in Taian, Shandong Province, who plans to initiate clinical trial in China in 2016. According to CBMG's recent 10-K filing, its process is distinguishable from sole Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) therapy (a large study with positive results), by multiple additional biomarkers such as CD29+, CD73+, CD90+, CD49d+, HLA-I+, HLA-DR-, Actin-, CD14-, CD34-, and CD45-.
 The 10-K also outlines its strategy: We intend to apply U.S. Standard Operating Procedures ("SOPs") and protocols while complying with Chinese regulations, while owning, developing and executing our own clinical trial protocols. We plan to establish domestic and international joint ventures or partnerships to set up cell laboratories and/or research facilities, acquire technology or in-license technology from outside of China, and build affiliations with hospitals, to develop a commercialization path for our therapies, once approved. We intend to use our first-mover advantage in China, against a backdrop of enhanced regulation by the central government, to differentiate ourselves from the competition and establish a leading position in the China cell therapeutic market. We also intend to out-license our technologies to interested parties and are exploring the feasibility of a U.S. allogeneic KOA clinical study with the FDA. Stem Cells in Medicine Some background on stem cell research. Stems cells are able to develop into any number of different specialist tissue cells. The FDA have approved at least five hematopoietic stem-cell products in the U.S., for the treatment of blood and immunological diseases (Wiki), and here's an example of a surgeon offering a bone marrow sourced stem cell therapy. Stemgenex has just launched a rheumatoid arthritis stem cell study, but there are other positive results:  Lead author Dr. Thomas Vangsness of the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine's report on arthritis. Researchers at Duke University Health System who produced an early report on mice with fractures. While hundreds of athletes are already making use of stem cell treatments to heal torn cartilage.  CBMG research is on stem cells derived from adipose (fatty) tissue, which have different characteristics, as described here; (numerous other studies are referenced on the same link): Adipose tissue hosts multipotent stem cells that can easily be purified by digestion and adhesion to plastic surfaces, and share numerous properties with bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Five percent of the nucleated fraction in adipose tissue represents stem cells, which is far more than found in adult human bone marrow. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) have been shown to exhibit immune suppressive properties and release anti-inflammatory molecules like IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, transforming growth factor (TGF)β and prostaglandin E2.
 The second angle of stem cell therapy also reduces potential risk on the part of the investor (as opposed to entire exposure to early stage immunotherapy results). CBMG's 'ReJoin'® Phase 2b, has completed and met primary and secondary end-points for safety, and provided both symptom relief and cartilage regeneration. Two other studies are preclinical and Phase 1. Phase 2 results indicate: The total WOMAC scores (consisting of pain, stiffness and function scores of joints) as a primary endpoint, show statistical treatment significance at week 48 compared to the baseline. The total knee cartilage volume change measured by a semi-automated segmentation method (ITK-SNAP) by two different blinded researchers show significant gain of cartilage in the ReJoin® group but a loss of cartilage in ARTZ@group, reaching statistical difference between the two groups 48 weeks after therapy. Funding Manufacturing Expansion There are manufacturing positives. The issue in 2017 is the intended expansion and paying for it alongside the pipeline burn rate; the dollar exchange rate to the yuan fluctuates too. International Standards This is a company incorporated in the US but operating in China, so conducting studies at far lower cost than the US (to CFDA standards) and to US FDA standards too, which means that the results could still be used in a US application, while cost and so potential for stock dilution is much reduced. For example, a company target for Q4 2017 is its: Allojoin® IND submission for knee osteoarthritis to U.S. FDA. The company operates GMP manufacturing facilities consisting of 12 independent cell production lines in three facilities in Shanghai, Beijing, and Wuxi China. Facilities are designed and managed according to both China and U.S. GMP standards, which meet international standards, and are certified by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) authorized accreditation agencies. Financing the Pipeline The company has created revenue in past quarters which, it states, is entirely from consulting services.
 Cash burn is an issue, however, as the pipeline has expanded over recent years, and despite its consulting business creating 'some revenue', quarterly operational expenses expanded significantly in Q3. It will be years though, before 'Rejoin®' could be creating income. The annual operating loss was $(28,415,334) in 2016 compared with $(20,848,970) in 2015. However, comparing Q3 results alone, costs about doubled, although that included one large chunk of investment impairment. $40m in cash could last 1-2 years, and some clarification from management would be useful, as the stated financial impairment could be a 'one off'. 

 With a Phase 3 'Rejoin®' study cost outstanding, and manufacturing expansion expected. The company has no debt, but could be relying on shareholders and institutions to fund development in preference to taking that on in the future. 10-K excerpt: Based on current estimates, we expect our biopharmaceutical business to generate revenues primarily through the development of therapies for the treatment of KOA within the next three to four years. Also, an issue is 'when' to buy. Stock Charts Short term, the daily chart is reversing up from oversold conditions. Longer term on the weekly chart, however, the issues become more apparent as the stock has been continually failing a strike at higher prices, despite what appears to have been an earlier technical breakout. In terms of wave continuum, weakness is apparent from:  Continuous trading below the 200ma, which has now turned down below the 50ma in a bearish cross. Trading below the pivot, which is bearish. Continuously failing below the 50ma.  What could have been a double bottom failed to materialize, with trading striking an inter 'week' low below that of January 2016. Trading has, however, reversed up on both the daily and weekly bullish candlesticks, although on the weekly chart less pronounced than that of early 2016. (Since the daily low was created inter-day and recovered, it doesn't represent a technical breakdown). S1 is still a potential lower support level, though based on the high of 2016 creating a continuation of wave C, should trading break down again.
 

 

 CBMG doesn't as yet have a product past Phase 3, but is unusual in that the company (benefiting from a recent Californian University cash award) has no current debt and an opportunity in a very large overseas as well as domestic market with diverse pipeline candidates. This stock is probably suffering from anti-Chinese investment sentiment (the lawsuit history) along with concerns about the business structure (as the Shanghai agreement has literally become transparent for only about a week), in addition to rising operating expenses. Short term, the stock appears to be bouncing, but needs to hold the support outlined in green on the daily chart. So far, the black ADX line over the MACD is flattening out, which is a positive sign. Although the fast stochastic is on a low, bouncing sideways on this level happened in December-January and resulted in lower prices. (While even a bounce over the 50ma resulted in lower prices). The risk area is at the moving averages as the RSI becomes 'overbought' again. Traders or investors considering an entry on the lows should hold a close stop. CBMG really needs a consistent break over the 200ma on the daily chart for a confirmed bull leg.

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY





	 




	The following summary highlights selected information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus. This summary does not contain all of the information you should consider before investing in the securities. Before making an investment decision, you should read the entire prospectus and any supplement hereto carefully, including the risk
	factors section as well as the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements incorporated herein by reference.




	 




	In this prospectus and any amendment or supplement hereto, unless otherwise indicated, the terms “Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc.,” “CBMG,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer and relate to Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.




	 




	Our Company




	 




	Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc. is a biomedicine company, principally engaged in the development of new treatments for cancerous and degenerative diseases utilizing proprietary cell-based technologies.  Our technology includes two major cell platforms: (i) Immune Cell therapy for treatment of a broad range of cancers using T Central Memory Cell ("Tcm"), T Cells
	Receptor ("TCR") clonality analysis, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell (“CAR-T”) and anti-PD-1 technologies, and (ii) human adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (“haMPC”) for treatment of joint and autoimmune diseases, with primary research and manufacturing facilities in China, while meeting dual standards.




	 




	From February 6, 2013 to June 23, 2014, we operated the Company in two separate reportable segments: (i) Biomedicine Cell Therapy (“Biomedicine”); and (ii) Financial Consulting (“Consulting”).  The Consulting segment was conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary EastBridge Investment Corp. (“Eastbridge Sub”).  On
	June 23, 2014, the Company announced the discontinuation of the Consulting segment as it no longer fits into management’s long-term strategy and vision.  The Company will focus resources on becoming a pure-play biotechnology company bringing therapies to improve the health of patients in China.




	 




	On September 26, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Beijing Agreen Biotechnology Co. Ltd. ("AG") and the U.S. patent held by Cellular Immunity Tech Ltd. (a company controlled by the founder).




	 




	AG is a biotech company with operations in China, engaged in the development of treatments for cancerous diseases utilizing proprietary cell technologies, which include without limitation, preparation of subset T Cell and clonality assay platform technology for treatment of a broad range of cancers by AG’s primary hospital partner, Jilin Hospital.




	 




	On February 9, 2015, the Company announced its acquisition of Chinese PLA General Hospital's ("PLAGH", Beijing, also known as "301 Hospital") CAR-T therapy, its recombinant expression vector CD19, CD20, CD30 and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor's (EGFR or HER1) Immuno-Oncology patents applications, and Phase I clinical data of the aforementioned therapies and manufacturing
	knowledge.  The 301 Hospital team has conducted several preliminary clinical studies of various CAR-T constructs targeting CD19-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, CD20-positive lymphoma, CD30-positive Hodgkin's lymphoma and EGFR-HER1-positive advanced lung cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and renal cell carcinoma.  Pursuant to the terms of a technology transfer agreement, PLAGH agreed to transfer to the Company all of its right, title and interest in and to certain technologies
	currently owned by PLAGH (including, without limitation, four technologies and their pending patent applications) that relate to genetic engineering of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells and its applications (collectively, the “Technology”).  In addition, PLAGH is responsible for obtaining governmental approval for the clinical trial related to the Technology, and the Company is responsible for the costs and expenses in connection therewith. The parties may collaborate to develop
	follow-on research and improvements on the Technology (collectively, the “Improvements”).  With respect to any Improvement achieved through the collaboration of the Company and PLAGH, the two parties will jointly own any intellectual property arising from such Improvement.  With respect to any Improvement achieved solely and independently by PLAGH, the Company has a right of first refusal to acquire any intellectual property arising from such Improvement.




	 




	When combined with CBMG's state-of-the art infrastructure and clinical platform, we anticipate that the aforementioned acquired technologies will enable improvement of cancer immune cell therapies and strategic combination therapies which will boost the Company's Immuno-Oncology presence, and pave the way for future partnerships. We plan to initiate certain cancer clinical
	trials utilizing such technologies upon receiving acceptance of the clinical trial designs with the principal investigator and obtaining the requisite approvals.




	 




	On June 26, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of

	Blackbird BioFinance, LLC (“Blackbird”)

	’s University of South Florida

	(“USF”)

	’s license on the next generation cancer immunotherapy vaccine CD40LGVAX, its related technologies and technical
	knowledge.  

	Of the total consideration to be delivered to Blackbird for the purchased assets, $2,500,000 was delivered in cash and 28,120 shares of Company common stock (the "Closing Shares"), representing $1,050,000 of the purchase consideration, was issued and delivered to Blackbird. Another 18,747 shares (the “Holdback Shares”), representing $700,000 of the purchase consideration (subject to adjustments and satisfaction of certain conditions in
	line with similar transactions), were to be issued and delivered to Blackbird on November 4, 2015.   Based on the terms of the license, we believe the Company will pay potentially more than $25 million in future milestones and royalty payments.





	 




	Despite the advances of targeted therapies and recent breakthroughs with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD1 or PDL1 monoclonal antibody treatments, there are still significant unmet medical needs in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (“NSCLC”), and the disease remains largely incurable. We believe the CD40LGVAX vaccine, in combination with an anti-PD1 monoclonal
	antibody, may provide synergistic and improved clinical benefits in both PDL1 positive and negative patients. We previously anticipated a phase I/II clinical trial for the CD40LGVAX vaccine combined with PD-1 antibody to commence in the second half of 2015.  We currently evaluating both U.S. and non-U.S. options for furthering clinical trials for the CD40LGVAX vaccine following Moffitt Cancer Center’s notification to us that it will not be continuing its sponsorship of the U.S. CD40LGVAX Trial.
	In the third quarter of 2015 we reviewed and modified the design of CD40LGVAX trial by expanding the number of patient recruitment, changing from single site to multi-sites trial and adding stratification to the trial.  We are converting the CD40LGVAX Investigator Sponsor Research (“ISR”) to a CBMG IND trial. We are converting the CD40LGVAX Investigator Sponsor Research (“ISR”) to a CBMG IND trial.

	Biomedicine Business




	 




	Our biomedicine business was founded in 2009 as a newly formed specialty biomedicine company by a team of seasoned Chinese-American executives, scientists and doctors. In 2010 we established a GMP facility in Wuxi, and in 2012 we established a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) GMP standard protocol-compliant manufacturing facility in Shanghai. Our focus
	has been to monetize the rapidly growing health care market in China by marketing and commercializing stem cell and immune cell therapeutics, related tools and products from our patent-protected homegrown cell technology developed by our research and development team, as well as by utilizing exclusively in-licensed and other acquired intellectual properties.




	 




	Our current treatment focal points are cancer and other degenerative diseases such as KOA, Asthma, COPD and CD.




	 





	Cancer.

	In the cancer field, our in-licensed TC-DC therapy utilizes dendritic cells that have been taught the unique "signature" of the patient's’ cancer, in order to trigger an effective immune response against cancer stem cells, the root cause of cancer metastasis and recurrence. Our Tumor Cell Target Dendritic Cell (“TC-DC”)
	product candidate has successfully completed a U.S. FDA Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of Metastatic Melanoma at the Hoag Medical Center in California. We have a process to develop human embryo-derived motor neuronal precursor cells and human embryo-derived neuronal precursor cells with high purity levels, validated by synapse formation, and have shown functional innervation with human muscle cells.  Under applicable international reciprocity procedures we are utilizing data generated in
	a U.S. Phase II clinical trial in an analogous China-based Phase I/II Clinical Trial for the treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (“HCC”), a major type of Liver Cancer. Management believes we will be able to leverage skin cancer data produced in ongoing trials in the U.S., and apply it toward advancing our product candidate for the treatment of liver cancer and other cancer-related indications.  As of December 31, 2013, we have completed the HCC Phase I trial.

	 

	With
	the advent of more advanced technologies in our portfolio, at present we do not plan on continuing the HCC trial. We are evaluating hospitals’ post Tcm treatment data to ascertain whether clinical studies for certain cancer disease indications may be warranted.   We plan to continue to evaluate and prioritize our cancer clinical trial indications for commercialization using safe and effective therapy or combination therapies. We announced results from our Phase I trial for certain of CAR-T cancer
	immunotherapy programs on March 25, May 21, and late September, 2015. The Phase I trial data for the CD19, CD20 and CD30 and EGFR HER 1 constructs showed a positive response rate under controllable toxicities.




	 




	On October 26, 2015, the Company announced results from the PLAGH Phase IIa clinical trial evaluating the safety, feasibility and anti-tumor activity of its acquired (CAR-T) immunotherapy CBM-CD20.1 targeting CD20 for the treatment of patients with advanced B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).  Overall objective response rate (ORR) is 80.0% (8/10) with durable responses
	observed.  A total of ten patients were treated with CBM-CD20.1 (seven patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and three patients with other types of NHL). The Phase IIa results showed that CBM-CD20.1 immunotherapy was safe, well tolerated, and efficacious in the treatment of patients with advanced NHL. The data was selected for an oral presentation entitled “Treatment of CD20-directed Chimeric Antigen Receptor-modified T cells in Patients with advanced B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma:
	An Early Phase IIa Trial Report” at the 2015 4th International Conference on Translational Medicine in Baltimore.




	 





	KOA.  

	In 2013, we completed a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for our “KOA therapy named ReJoin™. The trial tested the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injections of autologous haMPCs in order to reduce inflammation and repair damaged joint cartilage. The 6-month follow-up clinical data showed ReJoin™ therapy
	to be both safe and effective.




	 




	In Q2 2014 we completed patient enrollment for the Phase IIb clinical trial of ReJoin™  for KOA. The multi-center study has enrolled 53 patients to participate in a randomized, single blind trial. We published 48-week follow-up data of Phase I/IIa on December 5, 2014.  The 48-week data indicated that patients have reported a decrease in pain and
	a significant improvement in mobility and flexibility, while the clinical data shows our ReJoin™ regenerative medicine treatment to be safe.  We announced interim Phase IIb clinical trial results of KOA therapy named ReJoin

	™ 

	on March 25, 2015, which confirmed that the primary and secondary endpoints of ReJoin™

	 

	therapy groups have all improved significantly compared to their
	baseline. We released positive 48 week follow-up data in January 2016.




	 





	Cartilage Damage

	.  In January 2015 we initiated patient recruitment to support a study of ReJoin™  haMPC therapy for CD resulting from osteoarthritis (“OA”) or sports injury. The study is based on the same science that has shown tremendous progress in the treatment of KOA. Both arthroscopy and the use
	of magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) will be deployed to further demonstrate the regenerative efficacy of ReJoin™ on CD.




	 




	 

	Asthma.  

	In Q1 of 2014 we began a pre-clinical study on haMPC therapy for asthma. The pre-clinical study, conducted by Shanghai First People’s Hospital, a leading teaching hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University, will evaluate the safety and efficacy of haMPCs to treat severe asthma.




	 





	COPD.

	COPD refers to a group of diseases that block airflow to the lungs and make it difficult to breathe. The two most common conditions that make up COPD are chronic bronchitis and emphysema, which gradually destroys the smallest air passages (bronchioles) in the lungs. Currently the common treatments for COPD, such as use of steroids,
	inhalers and bronchodilator drugs, aim to control the symptoms and minimize further damage, but do not reverse the tissue damage. The major risk factors for COPD in China are tobacco smoking, biomass fuel use and genetic susceptibility.




	 




	Our pre-clinical COPD study is being conducted by Shanghai First People's Hospital, a leading teaching hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiaotong University. Professor Zhou Xin, director of the hospital's respiratory department and chairperson of Respiratory Diseases Division of Shanghai Medical Association, will lead the study as Principal Investigator.

	The  unique lines of adult adipose-derived stem cells and the immune cell therapies enable us to create multiple cell formulations in treating specific medical conditions and diseases, as well as applying single cell types in a specific treatment protocol. Management believes that our adult adipose-derived line will become commercially viable and market-ready within
	three to four years. In addition, we plan to assess and initiate cancer clinical trials leading to commercialization using safe and most effective therapy or combination therapies. Our facilities are certified to meet the international standards NSF/ANSI 49, ISO-14644 (or equivalent), ANSI/NCSL Z-540-1 and 10CFR21, as well as CFDA standards CNAS L0221. In addition to standard protocols, we use proprietary processes and procedures for manufacturing our cell lines, comprised of:




	 








	●






	 






	Banking processes that ensure cell preservation and viability;








	 






	 






	 








	●






	 






	DNA identification for stem cell ownership; and








	 






	 






	 








	●






	 






	Bio-safety testing at independently certified laboratories.








	 





	In July 2015, the Company

	has received two new certifications from the CFDA for its proprietary cell and tissue preservation media kits respectively, in accordance with the CFDA’s new regulations announced on June 1, 2015. These certified kits enable long-term preservation and long distance shipment of cells and tissue,
	without freezing them down, from and to the point of care for ready applications by physicians. The latest certifications further strengthen our Vertically Integrated Cell Manufacturing System (“VICMS”) to centralize the processing and supplying of autologous cell therapies, and reinforce our potential to be a world-class biotechnology company, serving large unmet medical needs.




	 




	Our Strategy




	 




	The majority of our biomedicine business is in the development stage. We intend to concentrate our business on cell therapies and in the near-term, carrying our KOA stem cell therapy and cancer immune cell therapies to commercialization.




	 




	With the recent addition of our cancer immune cell therapy resources, we plan to evaluate and prioritize our cancer clinical trial indications for commercialization using safe and most effective therapy or combination therapies. The Company believes that, when integrated with CBMG's state-of-the-art infrastructure and clinical platform, the aforementioned
	acquired AG, 301 Hospital and USF technologies will improve our cancer immune cell therapies clinical pathway and pave the way for collaboration with renowned institutions. We plan to initiate certain cancer clinical trials upon receiving acceptance of the clinical trial designs with the principal investigator and obtaining the requisite approvals.




	 




	In the next 12 months, we aim to accomplish the following:




	 








	●






	 






	Confirm the safety and tolerability profile of CBM-EGFR.1 in cholangiocarcinoma and NSCLC;

	We are developing our business in cell therapeutics and capitalizing on the increasing importance and promise that adult stem cells have in regenerative medicine. Our most advanced candidate involves adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells to treat KOA.




	 




	Presently we have two autologous cell therapy candidates undergoing clinical trials in China, for the treatment of KOA and CD. If and when these therapies gain regulatory approval in the PRC, we will be able to market and offer them for clinical use. Although our biomedicine business was very recently organized, our technologies have been in development for decades, and our
	focus is on the latest translational stages of product development, principally from the pre-clinical trial stage to regulatory approval and commercialization of new therapies.




	 




	Our strategy is to develop safe and effective cellular medicine therapies for indications that represent a large unmet need in China, based on technologies developed both in-house and obtained through acquisition, licensing and collaboration arrangements with other companies. Our near term objective is to pursue successful clinical trials in China for our KOA application,
	followed by our CD and Asthma therapies.  We intend to utilize our comprehensive cell platform to support multiple cell lines to pursue multiple therapies, both allogeneic and autologous. We intend to apply U.S. Standard Operating Procedures ("SOPs") and protocols while complying with Chinese regulations, while owning, developing and executing our own clinical trial protocols. We plan to establish domestic and international joint ventures or partnerships to set up cell laboratories and/or research facilities,
	acquire technology or in-license technology from outside of China, and build affiliations with hospitals, to develop a commercialization path for our therapies, once approved. We intend to use our first-mover advantage in China, against a backdrop of enhanced regulation by the central government, to differentiate ourselves from the competition and establish a leading position in the China cell therapeutic market.  We also intend to out-license our technologies to interested parties and explore the feasibility
	of a U.S. allogeneic KOA clinical study with the FDA.




	 




	CBMG initially plans to use its centralized manufacturing facility located in Shanghai to service multiple hospitals within 200 km of the facility.  We aim to complete clinical trials for our KOA and CD therapy candidates as soon as practicable. Our goal is to first obtain regulatory permission for commercial use of the therapies for the respective hospitals in
	which the trials are being conducted. CBMG plans to scale up its customer base by qualifying multiple additional hospitals for the post-trial use of therapies, once approved, by following regulatory guidelines. 




	 




	With the AG acquisition we intend to monetize AG’s U.S. and Chinese intellectual property for immune cell therapy preparation methodologies and patient immunity assessment by engaging with prominent hospitals to conduct pre-clinical and clinical studies in specific cancer indications. The T Cell clonality analysis technology patent, together with AG’s other know-how
	for immunity analysis, will enable the Company to establish an immunoassay platform that is crucial for immunity evaluation of patients with immune disorders as well as cancerous diseases that are undergoing therapy.




	 




	We believe that few competitors in China are as well-equipped as we are in the clinical trial development, diversified U.S. FDA protocol compliant manufacturing facilities, regulatory compliance and policy making participation, as well as a long-term presence in the U.S. with U.S.-based management and investor base.




	 




	We intend to continue our business development efforts by adding other proven domestic and international biotechnology partners to monetize the China health care market.




	 




	In order to expedite fulfillment of patient treatment CBMG has been actively developing technologies and products with a strong intellectual properties protection, including haMPC, derived from fat tissue, for the treatment of KOA, CD, Asthma, COPD and other indications. CBMG’s acquisition of AG provides an enlarged opportunity to expand the application of its cancer
	therapy-enabling technologies and to initiate clinical trials with leading cancer hospitals.  With the AG acquisition, we will continue to seek to empower hospitals' immune cell cancer therapy development programs that help patients improve their quality of life and improve their survival rate.




	 




	CBMG's proprietary and patent-protected production processes and clinical protocols enable us to produce raw material, manufacture cells, and conduct cell banking and distribution. Applying our proprietary intellectual property, we will be able to customize specialize formulations to address complex diseases and debilitating conditions.




	 




	CBMG has been developing disease-specific clinical treatment protocols. These protocols are designed for each of these proprietary cell lines to address patient-specific medical conditions. These protocols include medical assessment to qualify each patient for treatment, evaluation of each patient before and after a specific therapy, cell transplantation methodologies including
	dosage, frequency and the use of adjunct therapies, potential adverse effects and their proper management.




	 




	The protocols of haMPC therapy for KOA and CD have been approved by the hospitals’ Institutional Review Board for clinical trials. Once the trials are completed, the clinical data will be analyzed by a qualified third party statistician and reports will be filed by the hospitals to regulatory agencies for approval for use in treating patients.




	 




	CBMG has three cGMP facilities in Beijing, Shanghai and Wuxi, China that meet international standards and have been certified by the CFDA. In any precision setting, it is vital that all controlled-environment equipment meet certain design standards. To achieve this goal, our Shanghai cleanroom facility underwent an ISO-14644 cleanroom certification. Additionally, our facilities
	have been certified to meet the ISO-9001 Quality Management standard by SGS Group, and accredited by the American National Bureau of Accreditation (“ANBA”). These cGMP facilities make CBMG one of the few companies in China with facilities that have been certified by US- and European-based, FDA authorized ISO accreditation institutions.




	 




	In total, our cGMP facilities have over 23,000 sq. ft. of cleanroom space with the capacity for nine independent cell production lines.




	 






	 




	- 6 -










	 






	 




	Most importantly, CBMG has a manufacturing and technology team with more than 30 years of relevant experience in China, EU, and the United States. All of these factors make CBMG a high quality cell products manufacturer in China.

	Legal Proceedings




	 




	On April 21, 2015, a putative class action complaint was filed against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California captioned

	Bonnano v. Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc.,

	3:15-cv-01795-WHO (N.D. Ca.).  The complaint also named Wei Cao, the Company’s then-Chief Executive Officer, and Tony
	Liu, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, as defendants.  The complaint alleged that during the class period, June 18, 2014, through April 7, 2015, the Company made material misrepresentations in its periodic reports filed with the SEC.  The complaint alleged a cause of action under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”) against all defendants and under Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act against the individual defendants. The complaint did not state the
	amount of the damages sought.




	 




	On June 3, 2015, defendants were served.  On June 29, 2015, the Court ordered, as stipulated by the parties, that defendants are not required to respond to the initial complaint in this action until such time as a lead plaintiff and lead counsel have been appointed and a consolidated complaint has been filed.  The deadline for filing motions for the appointment
	of lead plaintiff and selection of lead counsel was June 22, 2015.  On that date, one motion was filed by the Rosen Law Firm on behalf of putative plaintiff Michelle Jackson.  On August 3, 2015, having received no opposition, the Court appointed Jackson as lead plaintiff and the Rosen Law Firm as class counsel.  As stipulated among the parties, Jackson filed an amended class action complaint on September 17, 2015.




	 




	The amended complaint names ten additional individuals and entities as defendants (“additional defendants”), none of whom were affiliated with the Company, and asserted an additional claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder that the Company purportedly engaged in a scheme with the additional defendants to promote its securities.  The
	amended complaint did not assert any claims against Mr. Liu.




	 




	On January 19, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss, which was argued on April 20, 2016.  On May 20, 2016, the Court granted the motion to dismiss with leave to amend.  Plaintiffs may amend the complaint within 20 days of the order. The Company anticipates that it will move to dismiss the amended complaint if one is filed.




	 






	 




	- 7 -










	 






	 




	The Company believes that the claims do not have merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.   At this early stage of the proceedings it is not possible to evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or to estimate the range of potential loss.




	 




	Other than as disclosed above, we are not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.






	 






	Additional Information




	 




	Since inception and through December 31, 2015, we have recorded accumulated losses totaling approximately $57.3 million. Our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities, including clinical trial activities for our product candidates and general and administrative expenses. Ultimately, if we secure additional approvals
	from the MOH, CFDA and other regulatory bodies throughout the world for our product candidates, our goal will be to augment our current sources of revenue and, as applicable, deferred revenue (principally licensing fees), with sales of such products or royalties from such sales, on which we may pay royalties or other fees to our licensors and/or third-party collaborators as applicable. 




	 




	We have based our estimates of development costs, market size estimates, peak annual sales projections and similar matters described or incorporated by reference in this prospectus on our market research, third party reports and publicly available information which we consider reliable. However, readers are advised that the projected dates for filing and approval of our drug
	applications with the MOH, CFDA or other regulatory authorities, our estimates of development costs, our projected sales and similar metrics regarding our KOA

	 

	and CD

	 

	therapies or any other product candidates discussed elsewhere (or incorporated by reference) in this prospectus are merely estimates and subject to many factors, many of which may be beyond our control, which will likely cause us to revise such estimates. Readers
	are also advised that our projected sales figures do not take into account the royalties and other payments we will need to make to our licensors and strategic partners. Our estimates are based upon our management’s reasonable judgments given the information available and their previous experiences, although such estimates may not prove to be accurate.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION




	 




	The Selling Stockholders and any of their pledges, assignees, donees selling shares received from such Selling Stockholders as a gift, and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares of common stock on any stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions.  These sales may be at
	fixed or negotiated prices.  The Selling Stockholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares:




	 








	●






	 






	ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;








	●






	 






	block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;








	●






	 






	purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;








	●






	 






	an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;








	●






	 






	privately negotiated transactions;








	●






	 






	broker-dealers may agree with the selling stockholders to sell a specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;








	●






	 






	a combination of any such methods of sale; and








	●






	 






	any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.








	 




	The Selling Stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus.  Broker-dealers engaged by the Selling Stockholders may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate in sales.  Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer
	acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated.  The Selling Stockholders do not expect these commissions and discounts to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved.




	 




	The Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales and therefore they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act.  In such event, any commissions received by such brokers-dealers
	or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act.  To our knowledge and based upon information we received from the Selling Stockholders: (i) the Selling Stockholders do not have any agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the shares of common stock and (ii) the Selling Stockholders have not received any of the securities registered hereby as underwriting
	compensation.  We are also not aware of any underwriting plan or agreement, underwriters’ or dealers’ compensation, or passive market making or stabilizing transactions involving the purchase or distribution of these securities.




	 




	We are required to pay all fees and expenses incident to the registration of the shares.  We have agreed to indemnify the Selling Stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.  To the extent required, we will amend or supplement this prospectus to disclose material arrangements regarding
	the plan of distribution.  To comply with the securities laws of certain jurisdictions, registered or licensed brokers or dealers may need to offer or sell the shares offered by this prospectus.  The applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act may limit any person engaged in a distribution of the shares of common stock covered by this prospectus in its ability to engage in market activities with respect to such shares.  The Selling Stockholders, for example, will be subject
	to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under it, which provisions may limit the timing of purchases and sales of any shares of common stock by the Selling Stockholders.
