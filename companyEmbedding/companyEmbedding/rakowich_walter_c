Biography
 




“Walter C. Rakowich took an S&P 500 global real estate corporation that was on the brink of bankruptcy and restored it to profitability by practicing heart-led leadership.”                                 — Tommy Spaulding, New York Times Bestselling Author of It’s Not Just Who You Know








Walt Rakowich is a leadership speaker and recently retired executive of Prologis, a global real estate company that was near collapse when he took over as CEO in 2008. During the economic downturn, the Prologis stock had dropped from over $70 per share to approximately $2 per share in 10 months, making it the third-worst performing company in the S&P 500. After Walt joined as CEO, he quickly implemented a change in culture through transparency, orchestrating a dramatic turnaround, and restoring its position in the industry.
In addition to speaking to audiences on a range of leadership topics, Walt also serves on a number of corporate and philanthropic boards.
Before starting his business career, Walt attended the Pennsylvania State University where he received his BS in accounting. He then went on to earn his MBA from Harvard Business School. In his free time, Walt enjoys traveling, mentoring youth and participating in a wide range of community service initiatives. He and his wife Sue have two children and reside in Colorado.

Mr. Rakowich, 52, is the chief executive of ProLogis, a real estate investment trust that operates warehouses and distribution centers around the world. Most of its domestic facilities are concentrated in six hubs; one is the New Jersey region, which includes about 970 ProLogis buildings, and roughly 50 million square feet of space. 
Q. It’s been a year since your appointment as C.E.O. What are your biggest accomplishments? A. I’d say there are three things:First, we wanted to deleverage the company. Second, we wanted to de-risk the operations, and we’ve made substantial strides in leasing up our development pipeline. It was 41 percent leased going into the year and is now 62 percent. And third, we wanted to right-size the overhead of the company, so we cut the G. & A. — general and administrative expenses — by about 33 percent. Our focus was to stabilize the company financially, and I think we’ve accomplished a lot.Q. One of the biggest issues facing ProLogis was its high debt load. Where does it stand today? A. Our debt picture at the end of last year was about $11 billion, and we’ve reduced that to $7.7 billion in a year. So over $3 billion, or almost 30 percent, of our debt has been taken out of the picture.Q. How did you manage that? A. We sold about $4 billion of assets, used the proceeds to pay down debt; we did an equity offering that generated $1.5 billion; and then we were able to buy back some bonds cheaply.

Q. Is there any more work to do in that regard? A. Over time, we’ll see asset values increase, so you naturally deleverage when asset values rise. Asset values last year went down 35 percent, and moving forward we think values have bottomed. We’ve also taken care of most of our debt maturities through 2012.

Q. Let’s shift to the New Jersey distribution hub. Has New Jersey fared better than other states? A. No. Actually, in the last three years it’s been worse in general. There were customers that were moving out of New Jersey and distributing more broadly from Pennsylvania, and I think that hurt occupancies. But today I think it’s about the same as we see throughout the United States.

Q. Where are occupancy levels? A. That region is probably in the neighborhood of about 90 to 91 percent occupied. Our overall portfolio is about 92.5 percent leased, but that includes Europe, Asia and the like. It’s down 1 to 1.5 percent from a year ago.Q. Where does New Jersey rank in terms of traffic?A. The Port of Los Angeles-Long Beach is actually the busiest, because of its proximity to China.

New York-New Jersey would be the second busiest. We serve companies like Home Depot, BMW, LG Electronics, Williams-Sonoma, Subaru, FedEx, Coke, Bed Bath & Beyond, Canon.Q. Any expansion plans? A. We are not developing any buildings in this market anywhere in the U.S. Where we may see some opportunity in the next year to 18 months is on the acquisition front, because property values have fallen. But eventually the new development market will be back, and when it is, we’ll be building at Exit 8A in New Jersey, down by Princeton, where we have a lot of land.Q. Are you developing anywhere in the world? A. In 2009, we did somewhere in the neighborhood of $400 million of new development — almost all outside the United States. We’re building several buildings in Europe now, and we’re building two buildings in Japan.Q. ProLogis has had an interest in sustainable development. Tell me about some green features. A. The buildings that we build save on water usage and have skylights that allow for more natural lighting.We’re also putting solar panels on our roofs. We own throughout the world about 9,000 football fields of space — that’s 475 million square feet — and that’s a lot of roof area. We’re trying to turn that roof area into an asset that is not only good for shareholders — i.e., generates rent — but also is good for the environment. Solar generates energy that we then sell into the grid, and the utility will lease the roof space from us.Q. You’ve been in Denver for a while now. Have you picked up skiing? A. It’s hard to live in Denver and not try to acquire skiing as part of the things you do. I’d say I’m an advanced intermediate, which means I could do enough to be really dangerous.

 Walt Rakowich 
 










Former CEO of Prologis
 

Walt Rakowich led one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Wall Street history. When he was appointed CEO of Prologis, an S&P global real estate company with operations in 22 countries, bankruptcy loomed and the global financial crisis was in full swing.
Prologis’ market cap had fallen from $20 billion to less than a billion, a 97% drop that made Prologis the third worst performing stock in the S&P. Walt increased cash flow, raised new equity, paid off $10 billion of debt and completed the largest real estate merger ever.
He won the support of investors and employees with his genuine honesty, transparency, and heart led leadership.
He will show you that humility does not mean being weak, and honesty is not only about being truthful but also about being transparent. Walt believes that a leader should be humble, honest, and human.
