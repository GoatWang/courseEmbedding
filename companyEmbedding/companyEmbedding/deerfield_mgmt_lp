Mitral valve disease in the United States: retrospective analysis of hospitalizations and surgical procedures using the National Inpatient Sample (World Congress on Heart Disease abstract)





Mark Stuntz
World Congress on Heart Disease




access article here





                    a b s t r a c t
                







Introduction
Valvular heart disease (VHDs), of which the mitral valve is frequently implicated, are collectively responsible for more than 20,000 annual deaths in the United States and the economic burden on the public health system due to VHDs is estimated in the billions of dollars.

Objective
The aim of this study was to assess the number of mitral valve disease hospitalizations and surgical procedures in the United States during the period 2010-2013. 

Materials and Methods
Patient data were extracted from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The NIS is the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient healthcare database in the United States, containing a 20% stratified systematic random sample of discharges from all US community hospitals. The most recent 4 years of available data, 2010-2013, were used for this analysis. Patients diagnosed with mitral valve disease were identified using the appropriate International Classification of Diseases 9th revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes. ICD-9 procedure codes were used to identify surgeries to repair or replace the mitral valve, including transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR), open repair, tissue graft, and synthetic replacement. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-squared test, while continuous variables were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or independent samples t-test.

Results
There were 174,2587 discharge records in 2013 with a diagnosis of mitral valve disease. Using HCUP’s sampling weights, this extrapolates to 871,290 hospitalizations in the United States. This is a slight decrease from 2010, when there were 883,933 estimated hospitalizations. The mean age of patients hospitalized for mitral valve disease increased from 71.15 (95% CI: 71.08-71.23) years in 2010 to 71.68 (95% CI: 71.61-71.76) years in 2013 (p<0.0001). 61.7% of mitral valve hospitalizations were females in 2010 compared with 59.2% in 2013 (p<0.0001). Mitral valve surgical procedures increased from 35,111 procedures in 2010 to 38,030 procedures in 2013. Concurrently, the proportion of mitral valve disease patients that underwent a surgical procedure to repair or replace the mitral valve increased from 3.5% in 2010 to 3.9% in 2013 (p<0.0001). Among elderly patients ≥80 years of age, mitral valve disease represented an increasing proportion of all hospitalizations, increasing from 6.0% in 2010 to 6.6% in 2013. Patients with a primary diagnosis of mitral valve disease who underwent a mitral valve surgical procedure were younger on average than those with a primary diagnosis of mitral valve disease who did not undergo a surgical procedure: 64.50 (95% CI: 64.31-64.69) years vs. 70.73 (95% CI: 70.51-70.95) years (p<0.0001).

Conclusions
This study reveals that mitral valve disease is a considerable public health problem in the United States, particularly among older adults. During 2010-2013, an increasing proportion of hospitalized patients with mitral valve disease underwent surgical procedures to repair or replace the valve. Overall, the volume of mitral valve surgical procedures increased approximately 8.3% from 2010 to 2013.

Deerfield and EuropaBio Publish a Report on Regulatory and HTA Scientific Advice for Small and Medium Enterprises - March  2015





NEW YORK & BRUSSELS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- EuropaBio, the European Association for Bioindustries, and the Deerfield Institute have partnered to carry out a survey on the current state of regulatory and health technology assessment (HTA) advice with a special focus on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The findings suggest early regulatory scientific and HTA advice may help SMEs to better prepare and manage their clinical programs toward facilitating both regulatory approval and positive HTA recommendations,and therefore contribute to their increased competitiveness.
Main findings 
“Despite agreement amongst all stakeholders that early interactions between regulatory, HTA authorities and SMEs would be positive, ensuring that these interactions actually take place is not straightforward. Given that many SMEs focus on the early stage of development and can be quite limited in terms of personnel and resources, the process of seeking such advice can be perceived as lengthy,formal, and cumbersome”, said Miriam Gargesi, Director for Healthcare Biotechnology at EuropaBio. However, the findings also show that both the authorities and the SMEs acknowledged the need to become more flexible, and to diversify and increase the number of interactions between them.
“Early dialogue activities have the potential to reduce drug development uncertainties related to regulatory and HTA assessments. While existing HTA scientific advice programs have made a good start and EuropaBio member companies have reported positive experiences so far, there are a number of other needs to be met,particularly in the areas of information, training and coordination”, said Paolo Morgese, Director of European Research for the Deerfield Institute and Chair of EuropaBio’s HTA Topic Group.
Background 
Phase III clinical trials are the last and vital development step before submitting healthcare biotech products for approval. While the costs for these trials are rising, the success rate is still 50% at phase III, according to the UK's Centre for Medicines Research. Success at phase III clinical trials is not the end of the story, as drugs will still have to go through regulatory and HTA evaluation processes before being accessible to European patients. Reviews from the European Medicines Agency, and to a larger extent from HTA authorities,have proven to be a significant challenge for biotech SMEs, often resulting in very limited access to new biotech drugs.
Against this context and the resulting significant financial burden incurred during phase III clinical trials, companies, regulatory and HTA authorities are starting to work together at earlier stages of drug development in order to make drug development more efficient. This could eventually help companies better understand what data the authorities need earlier in the process, thus leading to better designed clinical trials and fewer drugs failing at the approval stage, or not being reimbursed.
The full report is available on the websites of Deerfield (http://goo.gl/hR1aUM) and Europabio (http://goo.gl/VkdpZZ) 
About EuropaBio 
EuropaBio is the European Association of Bio Industries. EuropaBio members are involved in research, development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biotech products and processes in human and animal healthcare, diagnostics, bioinformatics, chemicals, crop protection, agriculture, food and environmental products and services. EuropaBio also counts a number of National Biotech Associations in its membership, who in turn represent more than 1800 biotech SMEs.

Adeptus Health And Deerfield Collaborate On Comprehensive Financial Restructuring Plan
Apr 19 17
Deerfield Management Company, L.P. and Adeptus Health Inc. (NYSE:ADPT) have collaborated on the terms of a comprehensive financial restructuring plan. Adeptus Health has collaborated with Deerfield Management Company and certain of its other creditors on the terms of a comprehensive financial restructuring plan that is expected to significantly reduce the outstanding debt under the Adeptus Health's existing credit facility and better position Adeptus for long-term success. As expected, to implement the restructuring, Adeptus Health filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, to pursue a plan of reorganization While Adeptus Health's wholly-owned subsidiaries are included in the court-supervised restructuring process, the joint venture entities to which Adeptus Health is a party are not part of the court-supervised process. Through the restructuring, it is expected that ownership of the Company will transition to Deerfield. Adeptus Health has also received a commitment from Deerfield Management Company for $45 million in debtor-in-possession financing. Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP is acting as reorganization counsel and FTI Consulting is acting as financial advisor to Adeptus Health.
