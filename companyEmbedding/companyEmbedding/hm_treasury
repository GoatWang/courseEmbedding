Her Majesty's Treasury (HM Treasury), sometimes referred to as the Exchequer, or more informally the Treasury, is the British government department responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Treasury maintains the Online System for Central Accounting and Reporting (OSCAR), the replacement for the Combined Online Information System (COINS), which itemises departmental spending under thousands of category headings,[4] and from which the Whole of Government Accounts (WGA) annual financial statements are produced.
The leading pronoun in the department's name varies depending upon the gender of the reigning monarch.

History[edit]
The beginnings of the Treasury of England have been traced by some to an individual known as Henry the Treasurer, a servant to King William the Conqueror.[5][6][7] This claim is based on an entry in the Domesday Book showing the individual Henry "the treasurer" as a landowner in Winchester, where the royal treasure was stored.[8]
The Treasury of the United Kingdom thus traces its origins to the Treasury of the Kingdom of England, which had come into existence by 1126, in the reign of Henry I. The Treasury emerged from the Royal Household. It was where the king kept his treasures. The head of the Treasury was called the Lord Treasurer.
Starting in Tudor times, the Lord Treasurer became one of the chief officers of state, and competed with the Lord Chancellor for the principal place. In 1667, Charles II of England was responsible for appointing George Downing, the builder of Downing Street, to radically reform the Treasury and the collection of taxes.




Government Offices, Great George Street


The Treasury was first put in commission (placed under the control of several people instead of only one) in May or June 1660.[9] The first commissioners were the Duke of Albermarle, Lord Ashley, (Sir) W. Coventry, (Sir) J. Duncomb, and (Sir) T. Clifford.[10][11] After 1714, the Treasury was always in commission. The commissioners were referred to as the Lords of the Treasury and were given a number based on their seniority. Eventually the First Lord of the Treasury came to be seen as the natural head of government, and from Robert Walpole on, the holder of the office began to be known, unofficially, as the Prime Minister. Until 1827, the First Lord of the Treasury, when a commoner, also held the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer, while if the First Lord was a peer, the Second Lord usually served as Chancellor. Since 1827, however, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has always been Second Lord of the Treasury.
During the time when the Treasury was under commission, the junior Lords were each paid £1600 a year.[12]
Ministers[edit]
As of June 2017, the Treasury Ministers were as follows:


Minister
Title
Portfolio


The Rt Hon. Theresa May MP
First Lord of the Treasury
Prime Minister, formal head of the Treasury


The Rt Hon. Philip Hammond MP



Chancellor of the Exchequer

Paymaster General &
Financial Secretary to the Treasury



To be confirmed


Andrew Jones MP
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury
To be confirmed


Stephen Barclay MP
Economic Secretary to the Treasury
To be confirmed


Whips[edit]
Some of the government whips are also associated in name with the Treasury: the Chief Whip is nominally Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and traditionally had an office in 12 Downing Street. Some of the other whips are nominally Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury, though they are all members of the House of Commons. Whip is a party, rather than a government, position; the appointments to the Treasury are sinecure positions which allow the whips to be paid ministerial salaries. This has led to the Government front bench in the Commons being known as the Treasury Bench. However, since the whips no longer have any effective ministerial roles in the Treasury, they are usually not listed as Treasury ministers.
Lord Young of Cookham, who serves currently as a government whip in the House of Lords, has been named as Treasury spokesman.[13][14]

As of July 2016 the Second Permanent Secretary is Charles Roxburgh.[15] Between 2007 and 2010, the post of Head of the Government Economic Service (GES) was held jointly by the Managing Director of Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policy in HM Treasury, Dave Ramsden, and Vicky Pryce, Chief Economist in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Ramsden is now sole Head of the GES. The previous Head of the GES was Sir Nick Stern. Management support for GES members is provided by the Economists in Government team, which is located in HM Treasury's building.
Banknote issue[edit]
Banknotes in the UK are normally issued by the Bank of England and a number of commercial banks (see Banknotes of the pound sterling). At the start of the First World War, the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914 was passed, giving the Treasury temporary powers to issue banknotes in two denominations, one at £1 and another at 10 shillings, in the UK. Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible for gold through the Bank of England. They replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable purchases of raw materials for armaments production. These notes featured an image of King George V (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND — Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount — Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo. V c.14). Notes issued after the partition of Ireland from 1922 had the wording changed to read "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".
The promise (never adhered to) was that they would be removed from circulation after the war had ended. In fact, the notes were issued until 1928, when the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 returned note-issuing powers to the banks.[16]

History of the Treasury Main Building[edit]
Main article: Government Offices Great George Street
The Treasury Main Building at 1 Horse Guards Road, often referred to as the Government Offices, Great George Street (GOGGS), was designed by John Brydon following a competition.[17] Construction took place in two phases. The West end was completed in 1908 and the East end was completed in 1917.[17] It was originally built as offices for Board of Education, the Local Government Board, and the Ministry of Works Office; HM Treasury moved into the building in 1940.[17] A major refurbishment of the building was completed under a PFI contract by Bovis Lend Lease in 2004.[18]

Ramsden is now sole Head of the GES. The previous Head of the GES was Sir Nick Stern. Management support for GES members is provided by the Economists in Government team, which is located in HM Treasury's building.
Banknote issue[edit]
Banknotes in the UK are normally issued by the Bank of England and a number of commercial banks (see Banknotes of the pound sterling). At the start of the First World War, the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914 was passed, giving the Treasury temporary powers to issue banknotes in two denominations, one at £1 and another at 10 shillings, in the UK. Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible for gold through the Bank of England. They replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable purchases of raw materials for armaments production. These notes featured an image of King George V (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND — Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount — Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo. V c.14). Notes issued after the partition of Ireland from 1922 had the wording changed to read "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".
The promise (never adhered to) was that they would be removed from circulation after the war had ended. In fact, the notes were issued until 1928, when the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 returned note-issuing powers to the banks.[16]

History of the Treasury Main Building[edit]
Main article: Government Offices Great George Street
The Treasury Main Building at 1 Horse Guards Road, often referred to as the Government Offices, Great George Street (GOGGS), was designed by John Brydon following a competition.[17] Construction took place in two phases. The West end was completed in 1908 and the East end was completed in 1917.[17] It was originally built as offices for Board of Education, the Local Government Board, and the Ministry of Works Office; HM Treasury moved into the building in 1940.[17] A major refurbishment of the building was completed under a PFI contract by Bovis Lend Lease in 2004.[18]

Her Majesty's Treasury (HM Treasury), sometimes referred to as the Exchequer, or more informally the Treasury, is the British government department responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Treasury maintains the Online System for Central Accounting and Reporting (OSCAR), the replacement for the Combined Online Information System (COINS), which itemises departmental spending under thousands of category headings,[4] and from which the Whole of Government Accounts (WGA) annual financial statements are produced.
The leading pronoun in the department's name varies depending upon the gender of the reigning monarch.

History[edit]
The beginnings of the Treasury of England have been traced by some to an individual known as Henry the Treasurer, a servant to King William the Conqueror.[5][6][7] This claim is based on an entry in the Domesday Book showing the individual Henry "the treasurer" as a landowner in Winchester, where the royal treasure was stored.[8]
The Treasury of the United Kingdom thus traces its origins to the Treasury of the Kingdom of England, which had come into existence by 1126, in the reign of Henry I. The Treasury emerged from the Royal Household. It was where the king kept his treasures. The head of the Treasury was called the Lord Treasurer.
Starting in Tudor times, the Lord Treasurer became one of the chief officers of state, and competed with the Lord Chancellor for the principal place. In 1667, Charles II of England was responsible for appointing George Downing, the builder of Downing Street, to radically reform the Treasury and the collection of taxes.




Government Offices, Great George Street


The Treasury was first put in commission (placed under the control of several people instead of only one) in May or June 1660.[9] The first commissioners were the Duke of Albermarle, Lord Ashley, (Sir) W. Coventry, (Sir) J. Duncomb, and (Sir) T. Clifford.[10][11] After 1714, the Treasury was always in commission. The commissioners were referred to as the Lords of the Treasury and were given a number based on their seniority. Eventually the First Lord of the Treasury came to be seen as the natural head of government, and from Robert Walpole on, the holder of the office began to be known, unofficially, as the Prime Minister. Until 1827, the First Lord of the Treasury, when a commoner, also held the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer, while if the First Lord was a peer, the Second Lord usually served as Chancellor. Since 1827, however, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has always been Second Lord of the Treasury.
During the time when the Treasury was under commission, the junior Lords were each paid £1600 a year.[12]
Ministers[edit]
As of June 2017, the Treasury Ministers were as follows:


Minister

Financial Secretary to the Treasury



To be confirmed

Whips[edit]
Some of the government whips are also associated in name with the Treasury: the Chief Whip is nominally Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and traditionally had an office in 12 Downing Street. Some of the other whips are nominally Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury, though they are all members of the House of Commons. Whip is a party, rather than a government, position; the appointments to the Treasury are sinecure positions which allow the whips to be paid ministerial salaries. This has led to the Government front bench in the Commons being known as the Treasury Bench. However, since the whips no longer have any effective ministerial roles in the Treasury, they are usually not listed as Treasury ministers.
Lord Young of Cookham, who serves currently as a government whip in the House of Lords, has been named as Treasury spokesman.[13][14]

Ramsden is now sole Head of the GES. The previous Head of the GES was Sir Nick Stern. Management support for GES members is provided by the Economists in Government team, which is located in HM Treasury's building.
Banknote issue[edit]
Banknotes in the UK are normally issued by the Bank of England and a number of commercial banks (see Banknotes of the pound sterling). At the start of the First World War, the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914 was passed, giving the Treasury temporary powers to issue banknotes in two denominations, one at £1 and another at 10 shillings, in the UK. Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible for gold through the Bank of England. They replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable purchases of raw materials for armaments production. These notes featured an image of King George V (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND — Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount — Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo. V c.14). Notes issued after the partition of Ireland from 1922 had the wording changed to read "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".
The promise (never adhered to) was that they would be removed from circulation after the war had ended. In fact, the notes were issued until 1928, when the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 returned note-issuing powers to the banks.[16]

Her Majesty's Treasury (HM Treasury), sometimes referred to as the Exchequer, or more informally the Treasury, is the British government department responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Treasury maintains the Online System for Central Accounting and Reporting (OSCAR), the replacement for the Combined Online Information System (COINS), which itemises departmental spending under thousands of category headings,[4] and from which the Whole of Government Accounts (WGA) annual financial statements are produced.
The leading pronoun in the department's name varies depending upon the gender of the reigning monarch.

History[edit]
The beginnings of the Treasury of England have been traced by some to an individual known as Henry the Treasurer, a servant to King William the Conqueror.[5][6][7] This claim is based on an entry in the Domesday Book showing the individual Henry "the treasurer" as a landowner in Winchester, where the royal treasure was stored.[8]
The Treasury of the United Kingdom thus traces its origins to the Treasury of the Kingdom of England, which had come into existence by 1126, in the reign of Henry I. The Treasury emerged from the Royal Household. It was where the king kept his treasures. The head of the Treasury was called the Lord Treasurer.
Starting in Tudor times, the Lord Treasurer became one of the chief officers of state, and competed with the Lord Chancellor for the principal place. In 1667, Charles II of England was responsible for appointing George Downing, the builder of Downing Street, to radically reform the Treasury and the collection of taxes.




Government Offices, Great George Street


The Treasury was first put in commission (placed under the control of several people instead of only one) in May or June 1660.[9] The first commissioners were the Duke of Albermarle, Lord Ashley, (Sir) W. Coventry, (Sir) J. Duncomb, and (Sir) T. Clifford.[10][11] After 1714, the Treasury was always in commission. The commissioners were referred to as the Lords of the Treasury and were given a number based on their seniority. Eventually the First Lord of the Treasury came to be seen as the natural head of government, and from Robert Walpole on, the holder of the office began to be known, unofficially, as the Prime Minister. Until 1827, the First Lord of the Treasury, when a commoner, also held the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer, while if the First Lord was a peer, the Second Lord usually served as Chancellor. Since 1827, however, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has always been Second Lord of the Treasury.
During the time when the Treasury was under commission, the junior Lords were each paid £1600 a year.[12]
Ministers[edit]
As of June 2017, the Treasury Ministers were as follows:


Minister

Portfolio


The Rt Hon. Theresa May MP
First Lord of the Treasury
Prime Minister, formal head of the Treasury


The Rt Hon. Philip Hammond MP



Chancellor of the Exchequer

Paymaster General &
Financial Secretary to the Treasury



To be confirmed


Andrew Jones MP

Stephen Barclay MP
Economic Secretary to the Treasury

Whips[edit]
Some of the government whips are also associated in name with the Treasury: the Chief Whip is nominally Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and traditionally had an office in 12 Downing Street. Some of the other whips are nominally Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury, though they are all members of the House of Commons. Whip is a party, rather than a government, position; the appointments to the Treasury are sinecure positions which allow the whips to be paid ministerial salaries. This has led to the Government front bench in the Commons being known as the Treasury Bench. However, since the whips no longer have any effective ministerial roles in the Treasury, they are usually not listed as Treasury ministers.
Lord Young of Cookham, who serves currently as a government whip in the House of Lords, has been named as Treasury spokesman.[13][14]

John Bradbury (1913–1919)
Robert Chalmers (1916–1919)
Warren Fisher (1919–1939)

As of July 2016 the Second Permanent Secretary is Charles Roxburgh.[15] Between 2007 and 2010, the post of Head of the Government Economic Service (GES) was held jointly by the Managing Director of Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policy in HM Treasury, Dave Ramsden, and Vicky Pryce, Chief Economist in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Ramsden is now sole Head of the GES. The previous Head of the GES was Sir Nick Stern. Management support for GES members is provided by the Economists in Government team, which is located in HM Treasury's building.
Banknote issue[edit]
Banknotes in the UK are normally issued by the Bank of England and a number of commercial banks (see Banknotes of the pound sterling). At the start of the First World War, the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914 was passed, giving the Treasury temporary powers to issue banknotes in two denominations, one at £1 and another at 10 shillings, in the UK. Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible for gold through the Bank of England. They replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable purchases of raw materials for armaments production. These notes featured an image of King George V (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND — Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount — Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo. V c.14). Notes issued after the partition of Ireland from 1922 had the wording changed to read "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".
The promise (never adhered to) was that they would be removed from circulation after the war had ended. In fact, the notes were issued until 1928, when the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 returned note-issuing powers to the banks.[16]

History of the Treasury Main Building[edit]
Main article: Government Offices Great George Street
The Treasury Main Building at 1 Horse Guards Road, often referred to as the Government Offices, Great George Street (GOGGS), was designed by John Brydon following a competition.[17] Construction took place in two phases. The West end was completed in 1908 and the East end was completed in 1917.[17] It was originally built as offices for Board of Education, the Local Government Board, and the Ministry of Works Office; HM Treasury moved into the building in 1940.[17] A major refurbishment of the building was completed under a PFI contract by Bovis Lend Lease in 2004.[18]

Her Majesty's Treasury (HM Treasury), sometimes referred to as the Exchequer, or more informally the Treasury, is the British government department responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Treasury maintains the Online System for Central Accounting and Reporting (OSCAR), the replacement for the Combined Online Information System (COINS), which itemises departmental spending under thousands of category headings,[4] and from which the Whole of Government Accounts (WGA) annual financial statements are produced.
The leading pronoun in the department's name varies depending upon the gender of the reigning monarch.

History[edit]
The beginnings of the Treasury of England have been traced by some to an individual known as Henry the Treasurer, a servant to King William the Conqueror.[5][6][7] This claim is based on an entry in the Domesday Book showing the individual Henry "the treasurer" as a landowner in Winchester, where the royal treasure was stored.[8]
The Treasury of the United Kingdom thus traces its origins to the Treasury of the Kingdom of England, which had come into existence by 1126, in the reign of Henry I. The Treasury emerged from the Royal Household. It was where the king kept his treasures. The head of the Treasury was called the Lord Treasurer.
Starting in Tudor times, the Lord Treasurer became one of the chief officers of state, and competed with the Lord Chancellor for the principal place. In 1667, Charles II of England was responsible for appointing George Downing, the builder of Downing Street, to radically reform the Treasury and the collection of taxes.




Government Offices, Great George Street


The Treasury was first put in commission (placed under the control of several people instead of only one) in May or June 1660.[9] The first commissioners were the Duke of Albermarle, Lord Ashley, (Sir) W. Coventry, (Sir) J. Duncomb, and (Sir) T. Clifford.[10][11] After 1714, the Treasury was always in commission. The commissioners were referred to as the Lords of the Treasury and were given a number based on their seniority. Eventually the First Lord of the Treasury came to be seen as the natural head of government, and from Robert Walpole on, the holder of the office began to be known, unofficially, as the Prime Minister. Until 1827, the First Lord of the Treasury, when a commoner, also held the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer, while if the First Lord was a peer, the Second Lord usually served as Chancellor. Since 1827, however, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has always been Second Lord of the Treasury.
During the time when the Treasury was under commission, the junior Lords were each paid £1600 a year.[12]
Ministers[edit]
As of June 2017, the Treasury Ministers were as follows:


Minister

The Rt Hon. Theresa May MP
First Lord of the Treasury
Prime Minister, formal head of the Treasury


The Rt Hon. Philip Hammond MP



Chancellor of the Exchequer

Paymaster General &
Financial Secretary to the Treasury



To be confirmed


Andrew Jones MP
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury
To be confirmed


Stephen Barclay MP
Economic Secretary to the Treasury
To be confirmed


Whips[edit]
Some of the government whips are also associated in name with the Treasury: the Chief Whip is nominally Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and traditionally had an office in 12 Downing Street. Some of the other whips are nominally Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury, though they are all members of the House of Commons. Whip is a party, rather than a government, position; the appointments to the Treasury are sinecure positions which allow the whips to be paid ministerial salaries. This has led to the Government front bench in the Commons being known as the Treasury Bench. However, since the whips no longer have any effective ministerial roles in the Treasury, they are usually not listed as Treasury ministers.
Lord Young of Cookham, who serves currently as a government whip in the House of Lords, has been named as Treasury spokesman.[13][14]

As of July 2016 the Second Permanent Secretary is Charles Roxburgh.[15] Between 2007 and 2010, the post of Head of the Government Economic Service (GES) was held jointly by the Managing Director of Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policy in HM Treasury, Dave Ramsden, and Vicky Pryce, Chief Economist in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Ramsden is now sole Head of the GES. The previous Head of the GES was Sir Nick Stern. Management support for GES members is provided by the Economists in Government team, which is located in HM Treasury's building.
Banknote issue[edit]
Banknotes in the UK are normally issued by the Bank of England and a number of commercial banks (see Banknotes of the pound sterling). At the start of the First World War, the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914 was passed, giving the Treasury temporary powers to issue banknotes in two denominations, one at £1 and another at 10 shillings, in the UK. Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible for gold through the Bank of England. They replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable purchases of raw materials for armaments production. These notes featured an image of King George V (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND — Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount — Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo. V c.14). Notes issued after the partition of Ireland from 1922 had the wording changed to read "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".
The promise (never adhered to) was that they would be removed from circulation after the war had ended. In fact, the notes were issued until 1928, when the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 returned note-issuing powers to the banks.[16]

History of the Treasury Main Building[edit]
Main article: Government Offices Great George Street
The Treasury Main Building at 1 Horse Guards Road, often referred to as the Government Offices, Great George Street (GOGGS), was designed by John Brydon following a competition.[17] Construction took place in two phases. The West end was completed in 1908 and the East end was completed in 1917.[17] It was originally built as offices for Board of Education, the Local Government Board, and the Ministry of Works Office; HM Treasury moved into the building in 1940.[17] A major refurbishment of the building was completed under a PFI contract by Bovis Lend Lease in 2004.[18]

Equality and diversity






    We are committed to fairness and, in particular, the promotion of equality of opportunity for all. Taking equality considerations into account in our work is an important and integral part of our approach as both an employer and a policy-maker.
  







Equality in policy-making
When working on policy, our officials look at the impact a policy option might have on those from protected groups, including positive opportunities for promoting greater fairness for them. They also consider if there are options for avoiding or otherwise mitigating against any negative impact on that group. Ministers are advised of the impact a decision has on protected groups, and this is taken into account when a policy decision is made.
Although the Treasury sets departmental budgets, it is up to each individual department to decide how they spend that budget. In deciding how the budget is to be spent, departments must consider the impact on protected groups. There are some policy areas, such as welfare, where the Treasury has a greater policy making responsibility.
Case study: Spending Round 2013 and Autumn Statement 2014
We considered the impact policy measures have on protected groups, throughout the policy development and decision making process, both in the Spending Round of 2013 and in the Autumn Statement of 2014. Advice to ministers on individual measures for these fiscal events included a summary of impacts, including the impact on protected groups. Equalities analysis was included in advice submitted to the Chancellor before he made final decisions.
Building on our work on equalities during Spending Review 2010, the Spending Round 2013 process also involved working with other government departments to assess the equality impacts of their work. In addition, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury hosted an external ‘equalities experts round table’ early in the Spending Round process in order to inform the government’s thinking. An Equalities Annex was published alongside the main document.
Tax Information and Impact Notes (TIINs) were produced for tax measures announced in the Autumn Statement of 2014. TIINS provide information on the policy objective, the impact on the Exchequer, the economy and individuals, businesses and civil society organisations, as well as the impact on protected groups. All TIINs published in the autumn were personally signed off by the Financial Secretary, confirming that it was a reasonable view of the impact of the measures, given the available evidence.
In December 2014 HMRC published a document that brought together the TIINs of tax measures for which draft legislation was published.
Equality as an employer
We promote equality of opportunity in employment to ensure our workforce is representative of the community it serves and that we attract and retain talented employees. We publish regular information on the diversity of our work force.
Information on the diversity of the Treasury’s employees is also published in the Treasury’s Annual Report and Accounts.
Public sector equality duty (PSED) objectives – 2016-20
Most public sector organisations are required by the Equality Act to publish equalities objectives every four years. For the 2016-20 period, We have set seven workforce related equalities objectives and two that relate to our policy work. All nine are shown below:
Equality as an employer
Progressing talent from under-represented groups

identify and address progression barriers for staff with disabilities and implement a talent management initiative to ensure staff with disabilities progress (by Autumn 2017)
continue and extend the work already underway to ensure BAME staff at graduate entry level (Range D) and the feeder grades to the senior civil service (Range E and E2) are supported to progress (by Autumn 2017)
review options and take action to improve diversity at all levels of the senior civil service (by 2020)

Building an inclusive culture

embed the work on unconscious bias with continued mandatory training for all line managers both in the senior civil service (SCS) and below. Below the SCS reinforce unconscious bias in wider management training for all new line managers in the feeder grades to the SCS (ongoing to 2020)
support and promote flexible working and work life balance, including pilots on innovative recruitment approaches to flexible working, reviewing findings and implementing proposals (by November 2016)
continue to champion the work of the Treasury’s Mental Wellbeing Network – raise awareness and improve understanding around mental health, helping to remove any stigma associated with it through workshops and events (ongoing to 2020)

Improving social mobility

in the context of graduate recruitment, collect, monitor and analyse appropriate socio-economic background data so to establish an evidence base, to develop interventions and new initiatives designed to improve access for applicants from lower socio-economic groups (ongoing to 2020)

Equality in policy work
The objectives focusing on policy assessments and advice within HMT are:


promoting awareness: continue to deliver and update the rolling programme that updates and informs Treasury officials on their responsibilities under the public sector equality duty (PSED) (ongoing to March 2020)


internal mechanisms: refresh the equalities governance, tools and guidance within Treasury to ensure that equalities continues to be properly considered in policy work and decision making (ongoing to March 2020)

Complaints procedure






    We take all complaints we receive very seriously.
  







Complaints procedure
If you are dissatisfied with the service you receive from us, you can contact HM Treasury.
What is a complaint?
The Treasury defines a complaint as an expression of dissatisfaction with the services provided by the Treasury. This is not the same as general correspondence from members of Parliament, the public expressing disagreement with a policy, or requests under the Freedom of Information Act.
How to make a complaint
You can complain in writing to:


The Complaints Manager
Correspondence and Information Rights 
1 Horse Guards Road 
London 
SW1A 2HQ 


You can also email public.enquiries@hmtreasury.gsi.gov.uk
When you contact us please give us full details and include information, if you have it, about the part of the department you felt did not give you an appropriate service. Please use the list below to ensure you have given us all relevant details:

A clear description of your complaint
What you would like us to do
information on whether it is an original complaint or a follow-up to a reply you were not satisfied with
your full postal address and/or e-mail address (if you have one)

How we treat your complaints
When we receive a complaint, we immediately refer it to an appropriate staff member who will then carry out an investigation.
We will reply in writing within 20 working days from when we receive your complaint. If it is not possible for us to fully respond to you within this time, we will let you know and tell you what we are doing to deal with your complaint, when you can expect the full reply.
We will always acknowledge where things could have been done better and tell you what we will do to avoid the same thing happening again. Equally, if we don’t agree with your complaint, we will let you know why.
Still not satisfied?
If you have gone through our complaints procedure and you are still not satisfied, then you can ask for the case to be referred to the permanent secretary to the Treasury, the head of the department.
What to do if you’re not satisfied
If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your formal complaint you can ask your local MP to refer it to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.
You have to go through your MP – you can’t approach the ombudsman directly. The ombudsman investigates complaints where government departments or other public bodies have not acted properly or fairly, or have provided a poor service. Government departments have to co-operate with the ombudsman by law.
Appealing against a decision by the Ombudsman
If you are unhappy with the Ombudsman’s decision you can feedback directly to the Ombudsman.
Making contact with other Departments and HM Treasury’s agencies and public bodies
Each of our agencies has its own procedures. Please click on the appropriate link below for further details.

In July 2010, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury outlined the government’s intention for a new range of simple financial products.
These would help people take responsibility for their finances and to make better choices.
Speech by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury: “Promoting a responsible approach to personal finance – the government’s vision”
HM Treasury consultation
‘Simple Financial Products: a consultation’ was published on 14 December 2010 and closed 25 March 2011. The consultation set out the government’s initial suggestions for how a new range of simple products could be developed.
The government received 75 responses to the consultation from a wide range of organisations and individuals, including industry, trade bodies, academics and consumer groups. A summary of consultation responses was published in October 2011.

Independent Sergeant Review of simple financial products
The government announced in October 2011 the creation of an independent simple financial products steering group chaired by Carol Sergeant to take the work forward.
Press notice: New steering group launched to develop ‘simple’ financial products (20/10/11)
The group was tasked with devising a suite of simple financial products to help consumers navigate the financial services market. The aim is to help increase the number of new participants in financial markets by providing straightforward, easy to understand products that are clearly identifiable as meeting “simple product” standards. Responses to the government consultation on simple products suggested that the group should initially focus on simple deposit savings and protection insurance products.
On 8 February 2012, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Carol Sergeant set out their vision for the simple products project in a speech at Deloitte. The Steering Group’s terms of reference were also published.
The Steering Group was made up of the Association of British Insurers, the British Bankers’ Association, the Building Societies’ Association, Money Advice Service, Consumer Focus and Which. The Financial Services Authority and HM Treasury hadobserver status on the group. A Secretariat was provided by the Association of British Insurers.

Interim report
On 2 August 2012 the independent simple financial products steering group published its interim report and consultation. This report sets out the rationale for simple products, analyses the target market, proposes a set of products to be taken forward for development, and suggests a structure for the governance of the ‘simple products’ standard. The summary of responses to the consultation was published on 30 January 2013.
Press notice: Steering group publishes recommendations for ‘simple’ financial products (01/08/12)
Responses were received from a range of industry, trade body and individual stakeholders and are published above in alphabetical order, except where confidentiality was requested.
Final report
A final report was published on Wednesday 13 March 2013. The report recommends the introduction of a set of simple products standards and a small suite of simple savings and protection insurance products accredited by the British Standards Institution (BSI). The report is the result of the collaboration between all the members of the Steering Group, plus a wide variety of financial providers and consumer representatives. Key next steps will be taken forward by trade associations, working with the BSI and many other organisations which have been involved in the initiative. HM Treasury is committed to reviewing the progress on simple financial products in March 2014.
Press notice: Simple financial products a step closer (13/03/13)
Review of progress
March 2014
The government reviewed the progress made by industry on the initiative in March 2014, one year on from the publication of the final report. We asked the trade associations for a formal update on the progress they have made in this time. The government  welcomes the trade bodies’ progress to date and the commitment to establish an accreditation framework by the end of the year, which is an important milestone in bringing simple products to market. The government remains keen to see simple products on the market as soon as possible.
July 2014
Industry provided further updates on the initiative in July 2014, in which it confirmed the launch of the first simple product and set out its vision for continuing to deliver against the Sergeant Review recommendations with two accreditation frameworks. The government welcomes the industry’s commitment to ensure that the accreditation frameworks are – and remain – properly aligned, and its determination to work together to ensure that the initiative is firmly focused on securing a good outcome for consumers. The government has asked to be updated on the progress of this work in the autumn.

Her Majesty's Treasury (HM Treasury), sometimes referred to as the Exchequer, or more informally the Treasury, is the British government department responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Treasury maintains the Online System for Central Accounting and Reporting (OSCAR), the replacement for the Combined Online Information System (COINS), which itemises departmental spending under thousands of category headings,[4] and from which the Whole of Government Accounts (WGA) annual financial statements are produced.
The leading pronoun in the department's name varies depending upon the gender of the reigning monarch.

History[edit]
The beginnings of the Treasury of England have been traced by some to an individual known as Henry the Treasurer, a servant to King William the Conqueror.[5][6][7] This claim is based on an entry in the Domesday Book showing the individual Henry "the treasurer" as a landowner in Winchester, where the royal treasure was stored.[8]
The Treasury of the United Kingdom thus traces its origins to the Treasury of the Kingdom of England, which had come into existence by 1126, in the reign of Henry I. The Treasury emerged from the Royal Household. It was where the king kept his treasures. The head of the Treasury was called the Lord Treasurer.
Starting in Tudor times, the Lord Treasurer became one of the chief officers of state, and competed with the Lord Chancellor for the principal place. In 1667, Charles II of England was responsible for appointing George Downing, the builder of Downing Street, to radically reform the Treasury and the collection of taxes.




Government Offices, Great George Street


The Treasury was first put in commission (placed under the control of several people instead of only one) in May or June 1660.[9] The first commissioners were the Duke of Albermarle, Lord Ashley, (Sir) W. Coventry, (Sir) J. Duncomb, and (Sir) T. Clifford.[10][11] After 1714, the Treasury was always in commission. The commissioners were referred to as the Lords of the Treasury and were given a number based on their seniority. Eventually the First Lord of the Treasury came to be seen as the natural head of government, and from Robert Walpole on, the holder of the office began to be known, unofficially, as the Prime Minister. Until 1827, the First Lord of the Treasury, when a commoner, also held the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer, while if the First Lord was a peer, the Second Lord usually served as Chancellor. Since 1827, however, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has always been Second Lord of the Treasury.
During the time when the Treasury was under commission, the junior Lords were each paid £1600 a year.[12]

As of June 2017, the Treasury Ministers were as follows:

Whips[edit]
Some of the government whips are also associated in name with the Treasury: the Chief Whip is nominally Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and traditionally had an office in 12 Downing Street. Some of the other whips are nominally Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury, though they are all members of the House of Commons. Whip is a party, rather than a government, position; the appointments to the Treasury are sinecure positions which allow the whips to be paid ministerial salaries. This has led to the Government front bench in the Commons being known as the Treasury Bench. However, since the whips no longer have any effective ministerial roles in the Treasury, they are usually not listed as Treasury ministers.
Lord Young of Cookham, who serves currently as a government whip in the House of Lords, has been named as Treasury spokesman.[13][14]

Ramsden is now sole Head of the GES. The previous Head of the GES was Sir Nick Stern. Management support for GES members is provided by the Economists in Government team, which is located in HM Treasury's building.
Banknote issue[edit]
Banknotes in the UK are normally issued by the Bank of England and a number of commercial banks (see Banknotes of the pound sterling). At the start of the First World War, the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914 was passed, giving the Treasury temporary powers to issue banknotes in two denominations, one at £1 and another at 10 shillings, in the UK. Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible for gold through the Bank of England. They replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable purchases of raw materials for armaments production. These notes featured an image of King George V (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND — Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount — Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo. V c.14). Notes issued after the partition of Ireland from 1922 had the wording changed to read "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".
The promise (never adhered to) was that they would be removed from circulation after the war had ended. In fact, the notes were issued until 1928, when the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 returned note-issuing powers to the banks.[16]

History of the Treasury Main Building[edit]
Main article: Government Offices Great George Street
The Treasury Main Building at 1 Horse Guards Road, often referred to as the Government Offices, Great George Street (GOGGS), was designed by John Brydon following a competition.[17] Construction took place in two phases. The West end was completed in 1908 and the East end was completed in 1917.[17] It was originally built as offices for Board of Education, the Local Government Board, and the Ministry of Works Office; HM Treasury moved into the building in 1940.[17] A major refurbishment of the building was completed under a PFI contract by Bovis Lend Lease in 2004.[18]

Her Majesty's Treasury (HM Treasury), sometimes referred to as the Exchequer, or more informally the Treasury, is the British government department responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Treasury maintains the Online System for Central Accounting and Reporting (OSCAR), the replacement for the Combined Online Information System (COINS), which itemises departmental spending under thousands of category headings,[4] and from which the Whole of Government Accounts (WGA) annual financial statements are produced.
The leading pronoun in the department's name varies depending upon the gender of the reigning monarch.

History[edit]
The beginnings of the Treasury of England have been traced by some to an individual known as Henry the Treasurer, a servant to King William the Conqueror.[5][6][7] This claim is based on an entry in the Domesday Book showing the individual Henry "the treasurer" as a landowner in Winchester, where the royal treasure was stored.[8]
The Treasury of the United Kingdom thus traces its origins to the Treasury of the Kingdom of England, which had come into existence by 1126, in the reign of Henry I. The Treasury emerged from the Royal Household. It was where the king kept his treasures. The head of the Treasury was called the Lord Treasurer.
Starting in Tudor times, the Lord Treasurer became one of the chief officers of state, and competed with the Lord Chancellor for the principal place. In 1667, Charles II of England was responsible for appointing George Downing, the builder of Downing Street, to radically reform the Treasury and the collection of taxes.




Government Offices, Great George Street


The Treasury was first put in commission (placed under the control of several people instead of only one) in May or June 1660.[9] The first commissioners were the Duke of Albermarle, Lord Ashley, (Sir) W. Coventry, (Sir) J. Duncomb, and (Sir) T. Clifford.[10][11] After 1714, the Treasury was always in commission. The commissioners were referred to as the Lords of the Treasury and were given a number based on their seniority. Eventually the First Lord of the Treasury came to be seen as the natural head of government, and from Robert Walpole on, the holder of the office began to be known, unofficially, as the Prime Minister. Until 1827, the First Lord of the Treasury, when a commoner, also held the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer, while if the First Lord was a peer, the Second Lord usually served as Chancellor. Since 1827, however, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has always been Second Lord of the Treasury.
During the time when the Treasury was under commission, the junior Lords were each paid £1600 a year.[12]
Ministers[edit]
As of June 2017, the Treasury Ministers were as follows:


Minister

Portfolio


The Rt Hon. Theresa May MP
First Lord of the Treasury
Prime Minister, formal head of the Treasury


The Rt Hon. Philip Hammond MP



Chancellor of the Exchequer

Paymaster General &
Financial Secretary to the Treasury



To be confirmed


Andrew Jones MP

Stephen Barclay MP
Economic Secretary to the Treasury
To be confirmed


Whips[edit]
Some of the government whips are also associated in name with the Treasury: the Chief Whip is nominally Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and traditionally had an office in 12 Downing Street. Some of the other whips are nominally Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury, though they are all members of the House of Commons. Whip is a party, rather than a government, position; the appointments to the Treasury are sinecure positions which allow the whips to be paid ministerial salaries. This has led to the Government front bench in the Commons being known as the Treasury Bench. However, since the whips no longer have any effective ministerial roles in the Treasury, they are usually not listed as Treasury ministers.
Lord Young of Cookham, who serves currently as a government whip in the House of Lords, has been named as Treasury spokesman.[13][14]

As of July 2016 the Second Permanent Secretary is Charles Roxburgh.[15] Between 2007 and 2010, the post of Head of the Government Economic Service (GES) was held jointly by the Managing Director of Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policy in HM Treasury, Dave Ramsden, and Vicky Pryce, Chief Economist in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Ramsden is now sole Head of the GES. The previous Head of the GES was Sir Nick Stern. Management support for GES members is provided by the Economists in Government team, which is located in HM Treasury's building.
Banknote issue[edit]
Banknotes in the UK are normally issued by the Bank of England and a number of commercial banks (see Banknotes of the pound sterling). At the start of the First World War, the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914 was passed, giving the Treasury temporary powers to issue banknotes in two denominations, one at £1 and another at 10 shillings, in the UK. Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible for gold through the Bank of England. They replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable purchases of raw materials for armaments production. These notes featured an image of King George V (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND — Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount — Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo. V c.14). Notes issued after the partition of Ireland from 1922 had the wording changed to read "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".
The promise (never adhered to) was that they would be removed from circulation after the war had ended. In fact, the notes were issued until 1928, when the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 returned note-issuing powers to the banks.[16]

History of the Treasury Main Building[edit]
Main article: Government Offices Great George Street
The Treasury Main Building at 1 Horse Guards Road, often referred to as the Government Offices, Great George Street (GOGGS), was designed by John Brydon following a competition.[17] Construction took place in two phases. The West end was completed in 1908 and the East end was completed in 1917.[17] It was originally built as offices for Board of Education, the Local Government Board, and the Ministry of Works Office; HM Treasury moved into the building in 1940.[17] A major refurbishment of the building was completed under a PFI contract by Bovis Lend Lease in 2004.[18]

HM Treasury







Publication scheme






    Each government department has a publication scheme, which makes information available about how it works and spends its budget.
  







Types of information we publish
Under section 19 of the Freedom of Information Act all government departments such as the Treasury have to adopt a Publication Scheme approved by the Information Commissioner.
It means that we should make information available about:

who we are and what we do
what we spend and how we spend it
what our priorities are and how we are doing
how we make decisions

How to get information
We usually publish information that we are required to provide on this website. If you can’t find the information you need on this site, then you can make a Freedom of Information (FOI) request.
Our annual report is also a main source for information about HM Treasury, and budget and pre-budget publications cover important economic analysis.

Her Majesty's Treasury (HM Treasury), sometimes referred to as the Exchequer, or more informally the Treasury, is the British government department responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Treasury maintains the Online System for Central Accounting and Reporting (OSCAR), the replacement for the Combined Online Information System (COINS), which itemises departmental spending under thousands of category headings,[4] and from which the Whole of Government Accounts (WGA) annual financial statements are produced.
The leading pronoun in the department's name varies depending upon the gender of the reigning monarch.

History[edit]
The beginnings of the Treasury of England have been traced by some to an individual known as Henry the Treasurer, a servant to King William the Conqueror.[5][6][7] This claim is based on an entry in the Domesday Book showing the individual Henry "the treasurer" as a landowner in Winchester, where the royal treasure was stored.[8]
The Treasury of the United Kingdom thus traces its origins to the Treasury of the Kingdom of England, which had come into existence by 1126, in the reign of Henry I. The Treasury emerged from the Royal Household. It was where the king kept his treasures. The head of the Treasury was called the Lord Treasurer.
Starting in Tudor times, the Lord Treasurer became one of the chief officers of state, and competed with the Lord Chancellor for the principal place. In 1667, Charles II of England was responsible for appointing George Downing, the builder of Downing Street, to radically reform the Treasury and the collection of taxes.




Government Offices, Great George Street


The Treasury was first put in commission (placed under the control of several people instead of only one) in May or June 1660.[9] The first commissioners were the Duke of Albermarle, Lord Ashley, (Sir) W. Coventry, (Sir) J. Duncomb, and (Sir) T. Clifford.[10][11] After 1714, the Treasury was always in commission. The commissioners were referred to as the Lords of the Treasury and were given a number based on their seniority. Eventually the First Lord of the Treasury came to be seen as the natural head of government, and from Robert Walpole on, the holder of the office began to be known, unofficially, as the Prime Minister. Until 1827, the First Lord of the Treasury, when a commoner, also held the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer, while if the First Lord was a peer, the Second Lord usually served as Chancellor. Since 1827, however, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has always been Second Lord of the Treasury.
During the time when the Treasury was under commission, the junior Lords were each paid £1600 a year.[12]
Ministers[edit]
As of June 2017, the Treasury Ministers were as follows:


Minister
Title
Portfolio


The Rt Hon. Theresa May MP
First Lord of the Treasury
Prime Minister, formal head of the Treasury


The Rt Hon. Philip Hammond MP



Chancellor of the Exchequer

Mel Stride MP



Paymaster General &
Financial Secretary to the Treasury



To be confirmed


Andrew Jones MP
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury
To be confirmed


Stephen Barclay MP
Economic Secretary to the Treasury
To be confirmed


Whips[edit]
Some of the government whips are also associated in name with the Treasury: the Chief Whip is nominally Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and traditionally had an office in 12 Downing Street. Some of the other whips are nominally Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury, though they are all members of the House of Commons. Whip is a party, rather than a government, position; the appointments to the Treasury are sinecure positions which allow the whips to be paid ministerial salaries. This has led to the Government front bench in the Commons being known as the Treasury Bench. However, since the whips no longer have any effective ministerial roles in the Treasury, they are usually not listed as Treasury ministers.
Lord Young of Cookham, who serves currently as a government whip in the House of Lords, has been named as Treasury spokesman.[13][14]

John Bradbury (1913–1919)
Robert Chalmers (1916–1919)
Warren Fisher (1919–1939)

Nicholas Macpherson (2005-2016)
Tom Scholar (2016-current)

As of July 2016 the Second Permanent Secretary is Charles Roxburgh.[15] Between 2007 and 2010, the post of Head of the Government Economic Service (GES) was held jointly by the Managing Director of Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policy in HM Treasury, Dave Ramsden, and Vicky Pryce, Chief Economist in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Ramsden is now sole Head of the GES. The previous Head of the GES was Sir Nick Stern. Management support for GES members is provided by the Economists in Government team, which is located in HM Treasury's building.
Banknote issue[edit]
Banknotes in the UK are normally issued by the Bank of England and a number of commercial banks (see Banknotes of the pound sterling). At the start of the First World War, the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914 was passed, giving the Treasury temporary powers to issue banknotes in two denominations, one at £1 and another at 10 shillings, in the UK. Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible for gold through the Bank of England. They replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable purchases of raw materials for armaments production. These notes featured an image of King George V (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND — Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount — Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo. V c.14). Notes issued after the partition of Ireland from 1922 had the wording changed to read "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".
The promise (never adhered to) was that they would be removed from circulation after the war had ended. In fact, the notes were issued until 1928, when the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 returned note-issuing powers to the banks.[16]

History of the Treasury Main Building[edit]
Main article: Government Offices Great George Street
The Treasury Main Building at 1 Horse Guards Road, often referred to as the Government Offices, Great George Street (GOGGS), was designed by John Brydon following a competition.[17] Construction took place in two phases. The West end was completed in 1908 and the East end was completed in 1917.[17] It was originally built as offices for Board of Education, the Local Government Board, and the Ministry of Works Office; HM Treasury moved into the building in 1940.[17] A major refurbishment of the building was completed under a PFI contract by Bovis Lend Lease in 2004.[18]

Our energy use






    We have an important role to play to make sure that the UK makes the transition to low carbon growth in an efficient way.
  




This government has committed to being the greenest government ever. As the UK’s economics and finance ministry, the Treasury will be at the heart of meeting that ambition.
We have an important role to play to make sure that the UK makes the transition to low carbon growth in an efficient way. Our work through the Treasury Environment Network supports policy action across government to make sure that this happens effectively.
In 2010 alone we reduced our carbon footprint across the Treasury estate by 14.2 per cent, surpassing the 10 per cent reduction target for Whitehall departments, and helping support an across-government reduction of 13.8 per cent.
Building on this good work, we also need to consider the impact we each have on the environment through our actions in the workplace. The 
HM Treasury climate change plan
  (PDF, 1.09MB, 45 pages)

 sets out the range of ways we are reducing our impact on the environment, in terms of our building and how we use it.
It’s an important element of how we plan to meet our targets but it is by no means the end. We will continue to challenge our departmental performance.

HM Treasury and the FCA consult on the implementation of the Insurance Distribution Directive 




25 Jul 2017











The Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) will repeal the Insurance Mediation Directive (IMD) and must be transposed by 23 February 2018. With less than a year to go until the implementation deadline, the government and the FCA have issued consultation papers on the transposition of the IDD into UK domestic law.
In this article, Juanita Morrison and Emma Radmore look at the proposed changes to UK law and regulation.
Treasury consultation
How will the IDD be implemented in the UK?
The IMD came into force on 14 January 2005 and was transposed into UK law by virtue of the FSA's (as it then was) rules and amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) and the FSMA (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (RAO). The government envisages that the transposition of the IDD will take effect in a similar way.
The IDD applies to persons who conduct insurance distribution activities, including (re)insurers who sell directly to customers, (re)insurance intermediaries and ancillary intermediaries. This means the IDD will cover the sale of insurance products directly by an insurer, whereas the IMD applied only to intermediaries. In the UK, the government does not anticipate that this will have a significant impact as it chose to apply the IMD to insurers as well as insurance intermediaries, so UK law has been super-equivalent to the IMD in this respect. Additionally, the IDD includes in its definition of 'insurance distribution' the activities of insurance companies and price comparison websites, but these activities are already subject to regulation in the UK.
As with the IMD, the IDD is a minimum harmonising directive. This means the directive sets the minimum standards required and Member States are then free to add further requirements for their respective territory. In the consultation papers the government and FCA seek views on the minimum standards and the additional requirements proposed to implement the IDD.
What about Brexit?
HM Treasury's consultation paper remarks that during the period of Brexit negotiations and while the UK remains a full member of the EU, the government will continue to apply EU legislation. The government intends to transpose and implement the IDD to schedule, and by 23 February 2018.
Scope: The connected contracts exclusion
For products sold as part of a package or add-ons by firms whose main business is other than the distribution of insurance products, Article 72B of the RAO currently provides an exclusion known as the "connected contracts" exclusion. Where a "provider" (that is, a person who supplies non-motor goods or travel-related services in the course of a business which does not otherwise consist of regulated activities) carries out insurance mediation activities in relation to a contract which is complementary to the provider's service and meets all of a number of set criteria, then the provider does not require authorisation under FSMA to carry out these activities. Common examples are retailers who sell insurance cover on white goods that they supply. Because of the limitations of the exclusion (in particular that it does not apply if the contract covers liability risks), it is safe to rely on it only in narrow circumstances.
The government's preference is to exclude life insurance and liability risk products from the connected contracts exclusion as it did when the IMD was implemented. The basis for the continued regulation of such products is that the government considers these products to be complex and could lead to significant consumer detriment if mis-sold.
Scope: Widening of the introducer exemption?
One way in which the IDD provides greater flexibility for firms is in respect of providing information. The mere provision of data and information on potential policyholders to insurers and insurance intermediaries (and vice-versa) is removed from the IDD's definition of regulated insurance distribution activities (provided the firm does not take further steps to assist in the conclusion of the contract). The government does not consider that the de-regulation of such firms whose activities are limited in this way would cause detriment to consumers. However, the government is not inclined to legislate for a broader exemption for introducers. It believes that some firms acting as introducers do more than providing information and broadening the exemption could result in more firms becoming involved in the conclusion of the contract without regulation. So its proposal is to exclude from the scope of regulation only this limited information provision, but to maintain all wider introducer activities within scope.
Passporting
When an EEA firm operates in the UK on a freedom of services basis it is the responsibility of the EEA firm's home state regulator to ensure the firm is compliant with the IDD. Alternatively, if an EEA firm operates on a freedom of establishment basis the IDD permits the responsibility for compliance to be split between the home state regulator and the PRA or the FCA as appropriate. In both instances the IDD permits the host state to intervene and the government proposes amendments to FSMA to enable the PRA or (more likely) FCA as the appropriate host state regulator to intervene in the event of a breach in specified circumstances.
FCA can act as home state regulator
Article 7 of the IDD permits the appropriate UK regulator to enter into an agreement with that firm's home state regulator to act as if it were the home state regulator where the insurance distributor's primary place of business is in the UK. The government is seeking to effect this by way of amendments to FSMA and for the appropriate regulator to publish any article 7 agreement it enters into. However, given the novelty of the provision it is unclear how often it will be used.
FCA consultation
What are the FCA's proposals?
The FCA has published two consultations on IDD implementation. The FCA's first consultation covered the application of IDD, including the change in terminology from 'insurance mediation' to 'insurance distribution' in the FCA Handbook, the professional and organisational requirements, complaints handling and out-of-court redress, changes to the insurance conduct of business (ICOBS) rules and the regulatory regime for an ancillary insurance intermediary (AII).
Where minimum requirements of IDD go beyond the FCA's current rules, the FCA will include such requirements in its new rules. However, the FCA is not proposing to change the existing UK provisions which go beyond the IDD's minimum requirements.
Ancillary insurance intermediaries (AIIs)
The IDD introduces AIIs as a new category of firm. To satisfy the definition of an AII a firm must meet the following conditions:
its principal professional activity is other than insurance distribution
it only distributes insurance products that are complementary to another good or service
it does not offer life assurance or liability risks unless the cover compliments the good or service that the intermediary provides as its primary professional activity.
The IDD does not require the direct regulation of AIIs whose insurance distribution activities are limited to products which meet particular criteria.
The UK’s connected contracts exclusion is narrower than the IDD, as it includes motor warranties and connected travel within regulation. As discussed above, the Treasury has consulted on whether any changes are required to the connected contracts exclusion in light of the IDD.
The FCA is proposing to create three categories of AII:
"in-scope AIIs": these are firms who are within IDD scope and other firms who are within the UK regulatory perimeter, but may be outside the IDD
"connected travel insurance (CTI) providers": these are firms whose primary business is to make travel arrangements for customers, but who distribute insurance that is complementary to those services
"out-of-scope AIIs": these are firms, such as white goods and furniture retailers who fall outside the UK regulatory perimeter because of the connected contracts exclusion as currently drafted.
Where insurers and intermediaries use out-of-scope AIIs, for AIIs who are outside of the UK's regulatory perimeter, the FCA proposes to place an obligation on the authorised firm under ICOBS to ensure that customers are provided with information on its identity, address and complaints procedure. So in-scope AIIs and CTI providers will in principle be subject to all FCA requirements (except that the CTI providers need not comply with the conflicts and transparency disclosures), whereas out-of-scope AIIs need only comply with the overarching principles, pre-contract disclosure and complaints and redress requirements.
Staff knowledge and competence requirements
FCA's proposal for insurers' and intermediaries' staff knowledge and competence requirements includes the following:
Minimum 15 hours of continuing professional development for those directly involved in insurance distribution, including product or sales managers but not employees in roles such as HR, facilities management or IT. The FCA proposes to issue guidance on the format and content of CPD. It notes firms subject to its TC sourcebook will already be subject to higher CPD requirements. It will not require employees to hold any particular qualification unless TC already requires them to do so
Firms must maintain records of employee competence. Under the IDD the minimum-record keeping requirements only apply to insurance and reinsurance undertakings, but the FCA proposes to extend the requirement to include intermediaries and AIIs. The FCA does not anticipate that this will result in significant additional costs and expects it will result in consumer protection benefits
The requirements will apply to insurers and reinsurers as well as to intermediaries, so the FCA will go beyond the IDD in this respect, as it does for firms subject to TC. However, the knowledge and competence requirements will apply only to those employees involved in insurance distribution, and can be modulated to apply in a proportionate manner to, for example, call centre operatives.
PII cover
The FCA currently requires intermediaries to hold higher minimum aggregate PII cover than the IDD minimum and also sets conditions on excess levels and specific terms within the cover. It proposes to amend all requirements to require the IDD minimum, but to keep its existing super-equivalent requirements.
Use of intermediaries
The IDD requires (re)insurers and intermediaries to use only authorised or exempt intermediaries for insurance distribution services. Insofar as current rules do not expressly reflect this, they will need to do so.
Changes to ICOBS
The FCA will apply the IDD's overarching principles to all intermediaries carrying out insurance distribution activities regardless of whether or not they have direct customer contact. The FCA will give effect to these by:
amending the current ICOBS rules on communications and financial promotions to require that all marketing communications be clearly identifiable as such;
a new rule requiring insurance distributors to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers; and
a new rule in SYSC to prohibit remuneration and performance management practices that would conflict with the customer’s best interests rule.
ICOBS 4 - to incorporate the IDD requirements in respect of pre-contacts disclosure
Conflicts of interest and transparency
The FCA proposes to amend ICOBS 4 to align with the following IDD requirements:
intermediaries must disclose if they have 10% or more voting rights or capital in an insurer, or vice versa. (Currently the requirement is “more than 10%”);
intermediaries must disclose if they give advice based on “a fair and personal” analysis of the market; and
where an intermediary is contractually bound to place business with a specific insurer or insurers it must provide the names of these insurers. (Currently this information need only be supplied on request by the customer).
Disclosure of firms' remuneration arrangements
The FCA proposes to amend ICOBS 4 to incorporate the following IDD requirements in respect of remuneration disclosure:
intermediaries must disclose the nature and basis of remuneration received in relation to the insurance contract being proposed (eg bonuses for hitting a sales target where the specific contract sold will count directly towards that target)
insurers must likewise disclose the nature of remuneration paid to their employee and the amount of fee where remuneration is in the form of a fee paid by a customer.
The FCA intends to provide guidance in ICOBs on the meaning of 'nature' and 'basis' with the former relating to the type of remuneration and the latter relating to the source of remuneration. The consultation paper provides illustrative examples of statements that would not be compliant. The FCA's proposal concerns the effecting of the remuneration disclosure requirements under IDD. It does not propose to amend requirements relating to commission disclosure by intermediaries or impact any other obligations relevant to remuneration arising from general law.
The FCA is also proposing to amend the definition of 'durable medium, 'fee' and 'remuneration' in line with the IDD.
Means of communication to customers
The FCA proposes to incorporate the following IDD requirements into ICOBS 4:
information may be provided on paper, a durable medium other than paper or a website (where it is not a durable medium and satisfies certain conditions). Where information is provided through a medium other than paper, the option to have the information on paper must be available and free of charge
no provision for the information to be provided orally at the request of the customer
telephone sales should comply with existing EU law in relation to distance marketing
all the information required must be provided in a clear, accurate and comprehensible manner; in an official language of the Member State, and free of charge.
In terms of fees, FCA will amend its definition within the Glossary to align with the IDD definition.
ICOBS 5 standards for advised and non-advised sale
Firms will need to (i) identify the customer's demands and needs, and match them to the available products, and (ii) state the customer's demands and needs to assist them in making an informed decision.
However, the FCA recognises the need for a clear distinction between advised and non- advised sales. It does not expect firms involved in non-advised retail sales to carry out a detailed investigation of the customer's circumstances, but the firm should identify the customer's demands and needs. The FCA offers illustrative examples in the consultation paper. For advised sales the FCA proposes a new requirement for firms which provide a personal recommendation to provide a personalised explanation as to why the proposed products best meet the customer's insurance demands and needs.
Amendments to ICOBS 6A – Sales practices
As discussed above, the IDD introduces new requirements where an insurance policy is sold in connection with, or alongside, other goods or services as part of a package or the same agreement. Where the insurance is ancillary to the main non-insurance product the customer must be able to buy the primary product without the insurance. In the FCA's view, 'ancillary' has a broad meaning and includes all instances where insurance is sold to complement other goods or services.
Where insurance is not the primary product, the IDD requires the insurance distributor to inform the customer whether it is possible to buy the different components separately and, if so, shall provide an adequate description of the different components of the agreement or package as well as separate evidence of the costs and charges of each component.
Complaints handling and out-of court redress
Article 14 of the IDD requires insurance and reinsurance distributors to have a process in place for customers and other eligible parties to register complaints and receive replies. This requirement applies to all types of insurance transaction, whether it involves a retail customer or a commercial customer, including reinsurance transactions. Article 15 requires each Member State to have in place effective Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) systems. The FCA will rely on the requirements of the DISP sourcebook to implement these requirements and does not propose to extend the scope of jurisdiction of the FOS wider than the current definition of eligible complaints to consider complaints from wider commercial customers, although it is considering more generally whether to extend FOS eligibility to larger SMEs than are currently covered. Additionally it will extend necessary requirements to all distributors when carrying out distribution activities.
The FCA proposes to introduce a requirement for EEA branches of UK (re)insurers and intermediaries to comply with an ADR entity in the EEA state in which they are established to resolve consumer disputes.
Changes to the FCA Handbook
The consultation paper annexes a draft instrument with proposed changes to:
The Glossary – in which there are many new definitions and several significant changes to existing definitions
SYSC – creating and applying a new Chapter 19F.2 (IDD remuneration incentives) and 23 (rules and guidance on knowledge and competence in relation to insurance distribution activities)
TC – a new chapter 4.2 and table
MIPRU – to implement the requirements on good repute, PII requirements and use of intermediaries (and IPRU(INV) also in respect of relevant firms)
ICOBS – changes to most chapters – particularly those discussed above, including the introduction of a new ICOBS 4.1A.1 on means of communication to customers and additions to 4.3 on remuneration disclosure, together with the significant amendments to ICOBS 5 discussed above and a new chapter 6A.3 on cross-selling; and
DISP - in relation to requirements to treat complainants fairly.
Timetable and next steps
The Treasury's first consultation closed on 22 May 2017. It plans to draft legislation implementing IDD later this year following a consideration of responses to the consultation.
The FCA published its second consultation paper on 24 July 2017. It covers the FCA's approach to product oversight and governance, changes to CASS 5, the new Insurance Product Information Document and the conduct of business requirements for life business including insurance-based investment products.
The FCA asks for responses to its second consultation by 20 October 2017 and it aims to publish rules in a Policy Statement in December 2017.
