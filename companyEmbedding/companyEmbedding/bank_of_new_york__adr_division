Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

HomeArticlesJohn SpenceBank of New York Has ADR Index ETFs in the Works













Many institutional and retail investors like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for cheap exposure to foreign markets. Bank of NY wants to drive costs down even lower, and has filed an exemptive application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch ETFs based on its ADR indexes.
American Depository Receipts (ADRs) are certificates traded in the U.S. that represent an interest in shares of a foreign company. Bank of NY currently maintains over 100 ADR indexes tracking countries, sectors, regions, and industry groups. It also manages the second-largest and most highly traded ETF, the Nasdaq-100 Tracking Stock (QQQ).
Although he was unable to discuss specific details because Bank of NY is still waiting for SEC comment on an application filed in May, Joe Keenan was able to answer general questions. Mr. Keenan is vice president of ETF products at Bank of NY.
Keenan said the Bank wants to leverage its ADR indexes because they could be used for international ETFs with lower expenses than what is currently available. The Bank believes it's cheaper to use the U.S. market, rather than buying shares listed on foreign markets.
"Bank of NY expects the expense ratios to be at least 50% less than comparable funds," said Tim Keaney, managing director of the Bank's ADR division, in a July 8 Fund Action newsletter article.
According to Keenan, Bank of NY would be most likely to roll out ETFs based on emerging or developed markets, followed by possibly a global large-cap fund. He said the Bank has an aggressive launch date of sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. At this point, it's unclear on which exchange the ETFs would trade.
Although the Bank has many different flavors of ADR indexes, Keenan said that not all are fund friendly because they don't meet diversification standards and underlying liquidity tests.
More European sector iShares
Barclays Global Investors (BGI) today launched four new pan-European ETFs on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). They are tied to the following Bloomberg European indexes: cyclicals, industrials, resources, and staples.
The new funds compliment four existing iShares trading on LSE tied to financials, pharmaceuticals, technology, and telecoms. All eight have expense ratios of 0.50%.
"Investors are developing a deeper understanding of sector investing in Europe, as diversification out of domestic markets grows," said John Demaine, director of iShares at BGI.
Certainly, traditional home bias is loosening as economic and regulatory barriers fall throughout Europe. A single euro currency is also removing the risk of country fluctuation, making investing in sectors across countries and regions a realistic option.
For U.S.-based fund managers, the race is on to develop European products. According to Gavin Quill of Boston-based Financial Research Corporation, U.S. companies have realized the need to enter new geographic markets as the domestic fund industry is beginning to slow, and demographic projections suggest it may slow even more. Although it started from much lower numbers, Quill notes that mutual fund asset growth in the European Union (EU) has outpaced the U.S. Over the past five years, the EU has experienced 23% growth per year, compared to 18% in the U.S.

each transfer of that Receipt and (y) all American Depositary Shares delivered as provided in this Deposit Agreement and all registrations
of transfer of American Depositary Shares, shall be registered. A Receipt bearing the facsimile signature of a person that was
at any time a proper officer of the Depositary shall, subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, bind the Depositary, even
if that person was not a proper officer of the Depositary on the date of issuance of that Receipt.
The Receipts and statements
confirming registration of American Depositary Shares may have incorporated in or attached to them such legends or recitals or
modifications not inconsistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement as may be required by the Depositary or required to
comply with any applicable law or regulations thereunder or with the rules and regulations of any securities exchange upon which
American Depositary Shares may be listed or to conform with any usage with respect thereto, or to indicate any special limitations
or restrictions to which any particular Receipts and American Depositary Shares are subject by reason of the date of issuance of
the underlying Deposited Securities or otherwise.
American Depositary
Shares evidenced by a Receipt, when the Receipt is properly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer, shall be
transferable as certificated registered securities under the laws of the State of New York. American Depositary Shares not evidenced
by Receipts shall be transferable as uncertificated registered securities under the laws of the State of New York. The Depositary,
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, may treat the Owner of American Depositary Shares as the absolute owner thereof for
the purpose of determining the person entitled to distribution of dividends or other distributions or to any notice provided for
in this Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes, and neither the Depositary nor the Company shall have any obligation or be
subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to any Holder of American Depositary Shares (but only to the Owner of those
American Depositary Shares).
SECTION 2.2.           
Deposit of Shares.
Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, Shares or evidence of rights to receive Shares may be deposited under this Deposit Agreement
by delivery thereof to any Custodian, accompanied by any appropriate instruments or instructions for transfer, or endorsement,
in form satisfactory to the Custodian.
As conditions of accepting
Shares for deposit, the Depositary may require (i) any certification required by the Depositary or the Custodian in accordance
with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement, (ii) a written order directing the Depositary to deliver to, or upon the written
order of, the person or persons stated in that order American Depositary Shares representing those deposited Shares, (iii) evidence
satisfactory to the Depositary that those Shares have been re-registered in the books of the Company or the Foreign Registrar in
the name of the Depositary, a Custodian or a nominee of the Depositary or a Custodian, (iv) evidence satisfactory to the Depositary
that any necessary approval has been granted by any governmental body in each applicable jurisdiction and (v) an agreement or assignment,
or other instrument satisfactory to the Depositary, that provides for the prompt transfer to the Custodian of any dividend, or
right to subscribe for additional Shares or to receive other property, that any person in whose name those Shares are or have been
recorded may thereafter receive upon or in respect of those Shares, or, in lieu thereof, such agreement of indemnity or other agreement
as shall be satisfactory to the Depositary.
At the request and
risk and expense of a person proposing to deposit Shares, and for the account of that person, the Depositary may receive certificates
for Shares to be deposited, together with the other instruments specified in this Section, for the purpose of forwarding those
Share certificates to the Custodian for deposit under this Deposit Agreement.
The Depositary shall
instruct each Custodian that, upon each delivery to a Custodian of a certificate or certificates for Shares to be deposited under
this Deposit Agreement, together with the other documents specified in this Section, that Custodian shall, as soon as transfer
and recordation can be accomplished, present that certificate or those certificates to the Company or the Foreign Registrar, if
applicable, for transfer and recordation of the Shares being deposited in the name of the Depositary or its nominee or that Custodian
or its nominee.
Deposited Securities
shall be held by the Depositary or by a Custodian for the account and to the order of the Depositary or at such other place or
places as the Depositary shall determine.
SECTION 2.3.           
Delivery of American Depositary Shares.
The Depositary shall
instruct each Custodian that, upon receipt by that Custodian of any deposit pursuant to Section 2.2, together with the other documents
or evidence required under that Section, that Custodian shall notify the Depositary of that deposit and the person or persons to
whom or upon whose written order American Depositary Shares are deliverable in respect thereof. Upon receiving a notice of a deposit
from a Custodian, or upon the receipt of Shares or evidence of the right to receive Shares by the Depositary, the Depositary, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, shall deliver, to or upon the order of the person or persons entitled thereto,
the number of American Depositary Shares issuable in respect of that deposit, but only upon payment to the Depositary of the fees
and expenses of the Depositary for the delivery of those American Depositary Shares as provided in Section 5.9, and of all taxes
and governmental charges and fees payable in connection with that deposit and the transfer of the deposited Shares. However,
the Depositary shall deliver only whole numbers of American Depositary Shares.
SECTION 2.4.           
Registration of Transfer of American Depositary Shares; Combination and Split-up of Receipts; Interchange of Certificated
and Uncertificated American Depositary Shares.
The Depositary, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, shall register a transfer of American Depositary Shares on its transfer
books upon (i) in the case of certificated American Depositary Shares, surrender of the Receipt evidencing those American Depositary
Shares, by the Owner or by a duly authorized attorney, properly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer or (ii)
in the case of uncertificated American Depositary Shares, receipt from the Owner of a proper instruction (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, instructions through DRS and Profile as provided in Section 2.10), and, in either case, duly stamped as may be required
by the laws of the State of New York and of the United States of America. Upon registration of a transfer, the Depositary shall
deliver the transferred American Depositary Shares to or upon the order of the person entitled thereto.
The Depositary, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, shall upon surrender of a Receipt or Receipts for the purpose of effecting
a split-up or combination of such Receipt or Receipts, execute and deliver a new Receipt or Receipts for any authorized number
of American Depositary Shares requested, evidencing the same aggregate number of American Depositary Shares as the Receipt or Receipts
surrendered.
The Depositary, upon
surrender of certificated American Depositary Shares for the purpose of exchanging for uncertificated American Depositary Shares,
shall cancel the Receipt evidencing those certificated American Depositary Shares and send the Owner a statement confirming that
the Owner is the owner of the same number of uncertificated American Depositary Shares. The Depositary, upon receipt of a proper
instruction (including, for the avoidance of doubt, instructions through DRS and Profile as provided in Section 2.10) from the
Owner of uncertificated American Depositary Shares for the purpose of exchanging for certificated American Depositary Shares, shall
cancel those uncertificated American Depositary Shares and register and deliver to the Owner a Receipt evidencing the same number
of certificated American Depositary Shares.
The Depositary may
appoint one or more co-transfer agents for the purpose of effecting registration of transfers of American Depositary Shares and
combinations and split-ups of Receipts at designated transfer offices on behalf of the Depositary. In carrying out its functions,
a co-transfer agent may require evidence of authority and compliance with applicable laws and other requirements by Owners or persons
entitled to American Depositary Shares and will be entitled to protection and indemnity to the same extent as the Depositary.
SECTION 2.5.           
Surrender of American Depositary Shares and Withdrawal of Deposited Securities.
Upon surrender at
the Depositary’s Office of American Depositary Shares for the purpose of withdrawal of the Deposited Securities represented
thereby and payment of the fee of the Depositary for the surrender of American Depositary Shares as provided in Section 5.9 and
payment of all taxes and governmental charges payable in connection with that surrender and withdrawal of the Deposited Securities,
and subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, the Owner of those American Depositary Shares shall be entitled
to delivery (to the extent delivery can then be lawfully and practicably made), to or as instructed by that Owner, of the amount
of Deposited Securities at the time represented by those American Depositary Shares, but not any money or other property
as to which a record date for distribution to Owners has passed (since money or other property of that kind will be delivered or
paid on the scheduled payment date to the Owner as of that record date). That delivery shall be made, as provided in this Section,
without unreasonable delay.
As a condition of
accepting a surrender of American Depositary Shares for the purpose of withdrawal of Deposited Securities, the Depositary may require
(i) that each surrendered Receipt be properly endorsed in blank or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer in blank and (ii)
that the surrendering Owner execute and deliver to the Depositary a written order directing the Depositary to cause the Deposited
Securities being withdrawn to be delivered to or upon the written order of a person or persons designated in that order.
Thereupon, the Depositary
shall direct the Custodian to deliver, subject to Sections 2.6, 3.1 and 3.2, the other terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement
and local market rules and practices, to the surrendering Owner or to or upon the written order of the person or persons designated
in the order delivered to the Depositary as above provided, the amount of Deposited Securities represented by the surrendered American
Depositary Shares, and the Depositary may charge the surrendering Owner a fee and its expenses for giving that direction.
At the request, risk
and expense of an Owner surrendering American Depositary Shares for withdrawal of Deposited Securities, and for the account of
that Owner, the Depositary shall direct the Custodian to forward any cash or other property comprising, and forward a certificate
or certificates, if applicable, and other proper documents of title, if any, for, the Deposited Securities represented by the surrendered
American Depositary Shares to the Depositary for delivery at the Depositary’s Office or to another address specified in the
order received from the surrendering Owner.
SECTION 2.6.           
Limitations on Delivery, Transfer and Surrender of American Depositary Shares.
As a condition precedent
to the delivery, registration of transfer or surrender of any American Depositary Shares or split-up or combination of any Receipt
or withdrawal of any Deposited Securities, the Depositary, Custodian or Registrar may require payment from the depositor of Shares
or the presenter of the Receipt or instruction for registration of transfer or surrender of American Depositary Shares not evidenced
by a Receipt of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any tax or other governmental charge and any stock transfer or registration
fee with respect thereto (including any such tax or charge and fee with respect to Shares being deposited or withdrawn) and payment
of any applicable fees as provided in this Deposit Agreement, may require the production of proof satisfactory to it as to the
identity and genuineness of any signature and may also require compliance with any regulations the Depositary may establish consistent
with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement, including, without limitation, this Section 2.6.
The delivery of American
Depositary Shares against deposit of Shares generally or against deposit of particular Shares may be suspended, or the registration
of transfer of American Depositary Shares in particular instances may be refused, or the registration of transfer of outstanding
American Depositary Shares generally may be suspended, during any period when the transfer books of the Depositary are closed,
or if any such action is deemed necessary or advisable by the Depositary or the Company at any time or from time to time because
of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body or commission, or under any provision of this Deposit Agreement,
or for any other reason. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Deposit Agreement, the surrender of outstanding American
Depositary Shares and withdrawal of Deposited Securities may not be suspended, subject only to (i) temporary delays caused by closing
the transfer books of the Depositary or the Company or the Foreign Registrar, if applicable, or the deposit of Shares in connection
with voting at a shareholders’ meeting, or the payment of dividends, (ii) the payment of fees, taxes and similar charges,
and (iii) compliance with any U.S. or foreign laws or governmental regulations relating to the American Depositary Shares or to
the withdrawal of the Deposited Securities.
The Depositary shall
not knowingly accept for deposit under this Deposit Agreement any Shares that, at the time of deposit, are Restricted Securities.
SECTION 2.7.           
Lost Receipts, etc.
If a Receipt is mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen, the Depositary shall deliver to the Owner the American Depositary Shares evidenced by that Receipt in
uncertificated form or, if requested by the Owner, execute and deliver a new Receipt of like tenor in exchange and substitution
for such mutilated Receipt, upon surrender and cancellation of that mutilated Receipt, or in lieu of and in substitution for that
destroyed, lost or stolen Receipt. However, before the Depositary will deliver American Depositary Shares in uncertificated
form or execute and deliver a new Receipt, in substitution for a destroyed, lost or stolen Receipt, the Owner must (a) file with
the Depositary (i) a request for that replacement before the Depositary has notice that the Receipt has been acquired by a bona
fide purchaser and (ii) a sufficient indemnity bond and (b) satisfy any other reasonable requirements imposed by the Depositary.
SECTION 2.8.           
Cancellation and Destruction of Surrendered Receipts.
The Depositary shall
cancel all Receipts surrendered to it and is authorized to destroy Receipts so cancelled.
SECTION 2.9.           
Pre-Release of American Depositary Shares.
Notwithstanding Section
2.3, the Depositary may deliver American Depositary Shares prior to the receipt of Shares pursuant to Section 2.2 (a “Pre-Release”).
The Depositary may, pursuant to Section 2.5, deliver Shares upon the surrender of American Depositary Shares that have been Pre-Released,
whether or not that surrender is prior to the termination of that Pre-Release or the Depositary knows that those American Depositary
Shares have been Pre-Released. The Depositary may receive American Depositary Shares in lieu of Shares in satisfaction of a Pre-Release.
Each Pre-Release must be (a) preceded or accompanied by a written representation from the person to whom American Depositary Shares
or Shares are to be delivered, that such person, or its customer, owns the Shares or American Depositary Shares to be remitted,
as the case may be, (b) at all times fully collateralized with cash or such other collateral as the Depositary deems appropriate,
(c) terminable by the Depositary on not more than five (5) business days’ notice, and (d) subject to all indemnities and
credit regulations that the Depositary deems appropriate. The number of American Depositary Shares outstanding at any time as a
result of Pre-Release will not normally exceed thirty percent (30%) of all American Depositary Shares outstanding; provided,
however, that the Depositary reserves the right to change or disregard that limit from time to time as it deems appropriate.
The Depositary may
retain for its own account any compensation received by it in connection with Pre-Release.
SECTION 2.10.       
DTC Direct Registration System and Profile Modification System.
(a)	Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 2.4, the parties acknowledge that DTC’s Direct Registration System (“DRS”) and
Profile Modification System (“Profile”) apply to the American Depositary Shares upon acceptance thereof to DRS
by DTC. DRS is the system administered by DTC that facilitates interchange between registered holding of uncertificated securities
and holding of security entitlements in those securities through DTC and a DTC participant. Profile is a required feature of DRS
that allows a DTC participant, claiming to act on behalf of an Owner of American Depositary Shares, to direct the Depositary to
register a transfer of those American Depositary Shares to DTC or its nominee and to deliver those American Depositary Shares to
the DTC account of that DTC participant without receipt by the Depositary of prior authorization from the Owner to register that
transfer.
(b)	In connection
with DRS/Profile, the parties acknowledge that the Depositary will not determine whether the DTC participant that is claiming to
be acting on behalf of an Owner in requesting a registration of transfer and delivery as described in paragraph (a) above has the
actual authority to act on behalf of that Owner (notwithstanding any requirements under the Uniform Commercial Code). For the avoidance
of doubt, the provisions of Sections 5.3 and 5.8 apply to the matters arising from the use of the DRS/Profile. The parties agree
that the Depositary’s reliance on and compliance with instructions received by the Depositary through the DRS/Profile system
and otherwise in accordance with this Deposit Agreement shall not constitute negligence or bad faith on the part of the Depositary.

ARTICLE 3.CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF OWNERS AND HOLDERS OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES
SECTION 3.1.           
Filing Proofs, Certificates and Other Information.
Any person presenting
Shares for deposit or any Owner or Holder may be required from time to time to file with the Depositary or the Custodian such proof
of citizenship or residence, exchange control approval, or such information relating to the registration on the books of the Company
or the Foreign Registrar, if applicable, to execute such certificates and to make such representations and warranties, as the Depositary
may deem necessary or proper. The Depositary may withhold the delivery or registration of transfer of American Depositary Shares,
the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or of the proceeds thereof or the delivery of any Deposited Securities until
that proof or other information is filed or those certificates are executed or those representations and warranties are made. The
Depositary shall provide the Company, upon the Company's reasonable written request and at its expense as promptly as practicable,
with copies of any information or other material which it receives pursuant to this Section 3.1, to the extent that disclosure
is permitted under applicable law. Each Owner and Holder agrees to provide any information requested by the Company or the Depositary
pursuant to this Section 3.1.
SECTION 3.2.           
Liability of Owner for Taxes.
If any tax or other
governmental charge shall become payable by the Custodian or the Depositary with respect to or in connection with any American
Depositary Shares or any Deposited Securities represented by any American Depositary Shares or in connection with a transaction
to which Section 4.8 applies, that tax or other governmental charge shall be payable by the Owner of those American Depositary
Shares to the Depositary. The Depositary may refuse to register any transfer of those American Depositary Shares or any withdrawal
of Deposited Securities represented by those American Depositary Shares until that payment is made, and may withhold any dividends
or other distributions or the proceeds thereof, or may sell for the account of the Owner any part or all of the Deposited Securities
represented by those American Depositary Shares and apply those dividends or other distributions or the net proceeds of any sale
of that kind in payment of that tax or other governmental charge but, even after a sale of that kind, the Owner of those
American Depositary Shares shall remain liable for any deficiency. The Depositary shall distribute any net proceeds of a sale made
under this Section that are not used to pay taxes or governmental charges to the Owners entitled to them in accordance with Section
4.1. If the number of Shares represented by each American Depositary Share decreases as a result of a sale of Deposited Securities
under this Section, the Depositary may call for surrender of the American Depositary Shares to be exchanged on a mandatory basis
for a lesser number of American Depositary Shares and may sell American Depositary Shares to the extent necessary to avoid distributing
fractions of American Depositary Shares in that exchange and distribute the net proceeds of that sale to the Owners entitled to
them.
SECTION 3.3.           
Warranties on Deposit of Shares.
Every person depositing
Shares under this Deposit Agreement shall be deemed thereby to represent and warrant that those Shares and each certificate therefor,
if applicable, are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights
of the holders of outstanding securities of the Company and that the person making that deposit is duly authorized so to do. Every
depositing person shall also be deemed to represent that the Shares, at the time of deposit, are not Restricted Securities. All
representations and warranties deemed made under this Section shall survive the deposit of Shares and delivery of American Depositary
Shares.
SECTION 3.4.           
Disclosure of Interests.
In order to comply
with applicable laws and regulations or the articles of association or similar document of the Company, the Company may from time
to time request each Owner and Holder to provide to the Depositary information relating to: (a) the capacity in which
it holds American Depositary Shares, (b) the identity of any Holders or other persons or entities then or previously
interested in those American Depositary Shares and the nature of those interests and (c) any other matter where disclosure
of such matter is required for that compliance.   Each Owner and Holder agrees to provide all information known to it
in response to a request made pursuant to this Section.  Each Holder consents to the disclosure by the Owner or any other
Holder through which it holds American Depositary Shares, directly or indirectly, of all information responsive to a request made
pursuant to this Section relating to that Holder that is known to that Owner or other Holder.  The Depositary agrees
to use reasonable efforts, at the Company's expense, to comply with written instructions received from the Company requesting
that the Depositary forward any request authorized under this Section to the Owners and to forward to the Company any responses
it receives in response to that request.
ARTICLE 4.                 
THE DEPOSITED SECURITIES
SECTION 4.1.           
Cash Distributions.
Whenever the Depositary
receives any cash dividend or other cash distribution on Deposited Securities, the Depositary shall, subject to the provisions
of Section 4.5, convert that dividend or other distribution into Dollars and distribute the amount thus received (net of the fees
and expenses of the Depositary as provided in Section 5.9) to the Owners entitled thereto, in proportion to the number of
American Depositary Shares representing those Deposited Securities held by them respectively; provided, however,
that if the Custodian or the Depositary shall be required to withhold and does withhold from that cash dividend or other cash distribution
an amount on account of taxes or other governmental charges, the amount distributed to the Owners of the American Depositary Shares
representing those Deposited Securities shall be reduced accordingly. However, the Depositary will not pay any Owner a fraction
of one cent, but will round each Owner’s entitlement to the nearest whole cent.
The Company or its
agent will remit to the appropriate governmental agency in each applicable jurisdiction all amounts withheld and owing to such
agency. The Depositary will forward to the Company or its agent such information from its records as the Company may reasonably
request to enable the Company or its agent to file necessary reports with governmental agencies. Each Owner and Holder agrees to
indemnify the Company, the Depositary, the Custodian and their respective directors, employees, agents and affiliates for, and
hold each of them harmless against, any claim by any governmental authority with respect to taxes, additions to tax, penalties
or interest arising out of any refund of taxes, reduced withholding at source or other tax benefit received by it.
If a cash distribution
would represent a return of all or substantially all the value of the Deposited Securities underlying American Depositary Shares,
the Depositary may require surrender of those American Depositary Shares and may require payment of or deduct the fee for surrender
of American Depositary Shares (whether or not it is also requiring surrender of American Depositary Shares) as a condition of making
that cash distribution. A distribution of that kind shall be a Termination Option Event.
SECTION 4.2.           
Distributions Other Than Cash, Shares or Rights.
Subject to the provisions
of Sections 4.11 and 5.9, whenever the Depositary receives any distribution other than a distribution described in Section 4.1,
4.3 or 4.4 on Deposited Securities (but not in exchange for or in conversion or in lieu of Deposited Securities), the Depositary
shall cause the securities or property received by it to be distributed to the Owners entitled thereto, after deduction or upon
payment of any fees and expenses of the Depositary and any taxes or other governmental charges, in proportion to the number of
American Depositary Shares representing such Deposited Securities held by them respectively, in any manner that the Depositary
deems equitable and practicable for accomplishing that distribution (which may be a distribution of depositary shares representing
the securities received); provided, however, that if in the opinion of the Depositary such distribution cannot be
made proportionately among the Owners entitled thereto, or if for any other reason (including, but not limited to, any requirement
that the Company or the Depositary withhold an amount on account of taxes or other governmental charges or that securities received
must be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 in order to be distributed to Owners or Holders) the Depositary deems such
distribution not to be lawful and feasible, the Depositary may adopt such other method as it may deem equitable and practicable
for the purpose of effecting such distribution, including, but not limited to, the public or private sale of the securities or
property thus received, or any part thereof, and distribution of the net proceeds of any such sale (net of the fees and expenses
of the Depositary as provided in Section 5.9) to the Owners entitled thereto, all in the manner and subject to the conditions set
forth in Section 4.1. The Depositary may withhold any distribution of securities under this Section 4.2 if it has not received
satisfactory assurances from the Company that the distribution does not require registration under the Securities Act of 1933.
The Depositary may sell, by public or private sale, an amount of securities or other property it would otherwise distribute under
this Section 4.2 that is sufficient to pay its fees and expenses in respect of that distribution.
If a distribution
under this Section 4.2 would represent a return of all or substantially all the value of the Deposited Securities underlying American
Depositary Shares, the Depositary may require surrender of those American Depositary Shares and may require payment of or deduct
the fee for surrender of American Depositary Shares (whether or not it is also requiring surrender of American Depositary Shares)
as a condition of making that distribution. A distribution of that kind shall be a Termination Option Event.
SECTION 4.3.           
Distributions in Shares.
Whenever the Depositary
receives any distribution on Deposited Securities consisting of a dividend in, or free distribution of, Shares, the Depositary
may deliver to the Owners entitled thereto, in proportion to the number of American Depositary Shares representing those Deposited
Securities held by them respectively, an aggregate number of American Depositary Shares representing the amount of Shares received
as that dividend or free distribution, subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement with respect to the deposit
of Shares and issuance of American Depositary Shares, including withholding of any tax or governmental charge as provided in Section
4.11 and payment of the fees and expenses of the Depositary as provided in Section 5.9 (and the Depositary may sell, by public
or private sale, an amount of the Shares received (or American Depositary Shares representing those Shares) sufficient to pay its
fees and expenses in respect of that distribution). In lieu of delivering fractional American Depositary Shares, the Depositary
may sell the amount of Shares represented by the aggregate of those fractions (or American Depositary Shares representing those
Shares) and distribute the net proceeds, all in the manner and subject to the conditions described in Section 4.1. If and to the
extent that additional American Depositary Shares are not delivered and Shares or American Depositary Shares are not sold, each
American Depositary Share shall thenceforth also represent the additional Shares distributed on the Deposited Securities represented
thereby.
If the Company declares
a distribution in which holders of Deposited Securities have a right to elect whether to receive cash, Shares or other securities
or a combination of those things, or a right to elect to have a distribution sold on their behalf, the Depositary may, after consultation
with the Company, make that right of election available for exercise by Owners in any manner the Depositary considers to be lawful
and practical. As a condition of making a distribution election right available to Owners, the Depositary may require satisfactory
assurances from the Company that doing so does not require registration of any securities under the Securities Act of 1933.
SECTION 4.4.           
Rights.
(a)	If rights are
granted to the Depositary in respect of deposited Shares to purchase additional Shares or other securities, the Company and the
Depositary shall endeavor to consult as to the actions, if any, the Depositary should take in connection with that grant of rights.
The Depositary may, to the extent deemed by it to be lawful and practical (i) if requested in writing by the Company, grant to
all or certain Owners rights to instruct the Depositary to purchase the securities to which the rights relate and deliver those
securities or American Depositary Shares representing those securities to Owners, (ii) if requested in writing by the Company,
deliver the rights to or to the order of certain Owners, or (iii) sell the rights to the extent practicable and distribute the
net proceeds of that sale to Owners entitled to those proceeds. To the extent rights are not exercised, delivered or disposed of
under (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Depositary shall permit the rights to lapse unexercised.
(b)	If the Depositary
will act under (a)(i) above, the Company and the Depositary will enter into a separate agreement setting forth the conditions and
procedures applicable to the particular offering. Upon instruction from an applicable Owner in the form the Depositary specified
and upon payment by that Owner to the Depositary of an amount equal to the purchase price of the securities to be received upon
the exercise of the rights, the Depositary shall, on behalf of that Owner, exercise the rights and purchase the securities. The
purchased securities shall be delivered to, or as instructed by, the Depositary. The Depositary shall (i) deposit the purchased
Shares under this Deposit Agreement and deliver American Depositary Shares representing those Shares to that Owner or (ii) deliver
or cause the purchased Shares or other securities to be delivered to or to the order of that Owner. The Depositary will not act
under (a)(i) above unless the offer and sale of the securities to which the rights relate are registered under the Securities Act
of 1933 or the Depositary has received an opinion of United States counsel that is satisfactory to it to the effect that those
securities may be sold and delivered to the applicable Owners without registration under the Securities Act of 1933.
(c)	If the Depositary
will act under (a)(ii) above, the Company and the Depositary will enter into a separate agreement setting forth the conditions
and procedures applicable to the particular offering. Upon (i) the request of an applicable Owner to deliver the rights allocable
to the American Depositary Shares of that Owner to an account specified by that Owner to which the rights can be delivered and
(ii) receipt of such documents as the Company and the Depositary agreed to require to comply with applicable law, the Depositary
will deliver those rights as requested by that Owner.
(d)	If the Depositary
will act under (a)(iii) above, the Depositary will use reasonable efforts to sell the rights in proportion to the number of American
Depositary Shares held by the applicable Owners and pay the net proceeds to the Owners otherwise entitled to the rights that were
sold, upon an averaged or other practical basis without regard to any distinctions among such Owners because of exchange restrictions
or the date of delivery of any American Depositary Shares or otherwise.
(e)	Payment or
deduction of the fees of the Depositary as provided in Section 5.9 and payment or deduction of the expenses of the Depositary and
any applicable taxes or other governmental charges shall be conditions of any delivery of securities or payment of cash proceeds
under this Section 4.4.
(f)	The Depositary
shall not be responsible for any failure to determine that it may be lawful or feasible to make rights available to or exercise
rights on behalf of Owners in general or any Owner in particular, or to sell rights.
SECTION 4.5.           
Conversion of Foreign Currency.
Whenever the Depositary
or the Custodian receives foreign currency, by way of dividends or other distributions or the net proceeds from the sale of securities,
property or rights, and if at the time of the receipt thereof the foreign currency so received can in the judgment of the Depositary
be converted on a reasonable basis into Dollars and the resulting Dollars transferred to the United States, the Depositary shall
convert or cause to be converted by sale or in any other manner that it may determine that foreign currency into Dollars, and those
Dollars shall be distributed to the Owners entitled thereto. A cash distribution may be made upon an averaged or other practicable
basis without regard to any distinctions among Owners based on exchange restrictions, the date of delivery of any American Depositary
Shares or otherwise and shall be net of any expenses of conversion into Dollars incurred by the Depositary as provided in Section 5.9.
If a conversion of
foreign currency or the repatriation or distribution of Dollars can be effected only with the approval or license of any government
or agency thereof, the Depositary may, but will not be required to, file an application for that approval or license.
If the Depositary
determines that in its judgment any foreign currency received by the Depositary or the Custodian is not convertible on a reasonable
basis into Dollars transferable to the United States, or if any approval or license of any government or agency thereof that is
required for such conversion is not filed or sought by the Depositary, or if any required approval or license is not obtained within
a reasonable period as determined by the Depositary, the Depositary may distribute the foreign currency received by the Depositary
to, or in its discretion may hold such foreign currency uninvested and without liability for interest thereon for the respective
accounts of, the Owners entitled to receive the same.
If any conversion
of foreign currency, in whole or in part, cannot be effected for distribution to some of the Owners entitled thereto, the Depositary
may in its discretion make that conversion and distribution in Dollars to the extent practicable and permissible to the Owners
entitled thereto and may distribute the balance of the foreign currency received by the Depositary to, or hold that balance uninvested
and without liability for interest thereon for the account of, the Owners entitled thereto.
The Depositary may
convert currency itself or through any of its affiliates and, in those cases, acts as principal for its own account and not as
agent, advisor, broker or fiduciary on behalf of any other person and earns revenue, including, without limitation, transaction
spreads, that it will retain for its own account.  The revenue is based on, among other things, the difference between the
exchange rate assigned to the currency conversion made under this Deposit Agreement and the rate that the Depositary or its affiliate
receives when buying or selling foreign currency for its own account.  The Depositary makes no representation that the exchange
rate used or obtained in any currency conversion under this Deposit Agreement will be the most favorable rate that could be obtained
at the time or that the method by which that rate will be determined will be the most favorable to Owners, subject to the Depositary’s
obligations under Section 5.3. The methodology used to determine exchange rates used in currency conversions is available upon
request.
SECTION 4.6.           
Fixing of Record Date.
Whenever a cash dividend,
cash distribution or any other distribution is made on Deposited Securities or rights to purchase Shares or other securities are
issued with respect to Deposited Securities (which rights will be delivered to or exercised or sold on behalf of Owners in accordance
with Section 4.4) or the Depositary receives notice that a distribution or issuance of that kind will be made, or whenever the
Depositary receives notice that a meeting of holders of Shares will be held in respect of which the Company has requested the Depositary
to send a notice under Section 4.7, or whenever the Depositary will assess a fee or charge against the Owners, or whenever the
Depositary causes a change in the number of Shares that are represented by each American Depositary Share, or whenever the Depositary
otherwise finds it necessary or convenient, the Depositary shall fix a record date, which shall be the same as, or as near as practicable
to, any corresponding record date set by the Company with respect to Shares, (a) for the determination of the Owners (i) who shall
be entitled to receive the benefit of that dividend or other distribution or those rights, (ii) who shall be entitled to give instructions
for the exercise of voting rights at that meeting or (iii) who shall be responsible for that fee or charge or (iv) for any other
purpose for which the record date was set, or (b) on or after which each American Depositary Share will represent the changed number
of Shares. Subject to the provisions of Sections 4.1 through 4.5 and to the other terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement,
the Owners on a record date fixed by the Depositary shall be entitled to receive the amount distributable by the Depositary with
respect to that dividend or other distribution or those rights or the net proceeds of sale thereof in proportion to the number
of American Depositary Shares held by them respectively, to give voting instructions or to act in respect of the other matter for
which that record date was fixed, or be responsible for that fee or charge, as the case may be.
SECTION 4.7.           
Voting of Deposited Shares.
(a)	Upon receipt
of notice of any meeting of holders of Shares at which holders of Shares will be entitled to vote, if requested in writing by the
Company, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, Disseminate to the Owners a notice, the form of which shall
be in the sole discretion of the Depositary, that shall contain (i) the information contained in the notice of meeting received
by the Depositary, (ii) a statement that the Owners as of the close of business on a specified record date will be entitled,
subject to any applicable provision of South African law and of the articles of association or similar documents of the Company,
to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Shares represented by their respective
American Depositary Shares (iii) a statement as to the manner in which those instructions may be given and (iv) the last date
on which the Depositary will accept instructions (the “Instruction Cutoff Date”).
(b)	Upon the written
request of an Owner of American Depositary Shares, as of the date of the request or, if a record date was specified by the Depositary,
as of that record date, received on or before any Instruction Cutoff Date established by the Depositary, the Depositary
may, and if the Depositary sent a notice under the preceding paragraph shall, endeavor, in so far as practicable, to vote or cause
to be voted the amount of deposited Shares represented by those American Depositary Shares in accordance with the instructions
set forth in that request. The Depositary shall not vote or attempt to exercise the right to vote that attaches to the deposited
Shares other than in accordance with instructions given by Owners and received by the Depositary.
(c)	There can be
no assurance that Owners generally or any Owner in particular will receive the notice described in paragraph (a) above in
time to enable Owners to give instructions to the Depositary prior to the Instruction Cutoff Date.
(d)	In order to
give Owners a reasonable opportunity to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of voting rights relating to Shares, if the
Company will request the Depositary to Disseminate a notice under paragraph (a) above, the Company shall give the Depositary
notice of the meeting, details concerning the matters to be voted upon and copies of materials to be made available to holders
of Shares in connection with the meeting not less than 45 days prior to the meeting date.
SECTION 4.8.           
Tender and Exchange Offers; Redemption, Replacement or Cancellation of Deposited Securities.
(a)	The Depositary
shall not tender any Deposited Securities in response to any voluntary cash tender offer, exchange offer or similar offer made
to holders of Deposited Securities (a “Voluntary Offer”), except when instructed in writing to do so by an Owner
surrendering American Depositary Shares and subject to any conditions or procedures the Depositary may require.
(b)	If the Depositary
receives a written notice that Deposited Securities have been redeemed for cash or otherwise purchased for cash in a transaction
that is mandatory and binding on the Depositary as a holder of those Deposited Securities (a “Redemption”),
the Depositary, at the expense of the Company, shall (i) if required, surrender Deposited Securities that have been redeemed to
the issuer of those securities or its agent on the redemption date, (ii) Disseminate a notice to Owners (A) notifying them of that
Redemption, (B) calling for surrender of a corresponding number of American Depositary Shares and (C) notifying them that the called
American Depositary Shares have been converted into a right only to receive the money received by the Depositary upon that Redemption
and those net proceeds shall be the Deposited Securities to which Owners of those converted American Depositary Shares shall be
entitled upon surrenders of those American Depositary Shares in accordance with Section 2.5 or 6.2 and (iii) distribute the money
received upon that Redemption to the Owners entitled to it upon surrender by them of called American Depositary Shares in accordance
with Section 2.5 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, Owners shall not be entitled to receive that money under Section 4.1). If the
Redemption affects less than all the Deposited Securities, the Depositary shall call for surrender a corresponding portion of the
outstanding American Depositary Shares and only those American Depositary Shares will automatically be converted into a right to
receive the net proceeds of the Redemption. The Depositary shall allocate the American Depositary Shares converted under the preceding
sentence among the Owners pro-rata to their respective holdings of American Depositary Shares immediately prior to the Redemption,
except that the allocations may be adjusted so that no fraction of a converted American Depositary Share is allocated to
any Owner. A Redemption of all or substantially all of the Deposited Securities shall be a Termination Option Event.
(c)	If the Depositary
is notified of or there occurs any change in nominal value or any subdivision, combination or any other reclassification of the
Deposited Securities or any recapitalization, reorganization, sale of assets substantially as an entirety, merger or consolidation
affecting the issuer of the Deposited Securities or to which it is a party that is mandatory and binding on the Depositary as a
holder of Deposited Securities, and as a result, securities or other property have been or will be delivered in exchange, conversion,
replacement or in lieu of, Deposited Securities (a “Replacement”), the Depositary shall, if required, surrender
the old Deposited Securities affected by that Replacement of Shares and hold, as new Deposited Securities under this Deposit Agreement,
the new securities or other property delivered to it in that Replacement. However, the Depositary may elect to sell those
new Deposited Securities if in the opinion of the Depositary it is not lawful or not practical for it to hold those new Deposited
Securities under this Deposit Agreement because those new Deposited Securities may not be distributed to Owners without registration
under the Securities Act of 1933 or for any other reason, at public or private sale, at such places and on such terms as it deems
proper and proceed as if those new Deposited Securities had been Redeemed under paragraph (b) above. A Replacement shall be a Termination
Option Event.
(d)	In the case
of a Replacement where the new Deposited Securities will continue to be held under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary may call
for the surrender of outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing the new Deposited Securities
and the number of those new Deposited Securities represented by each American Depositary Share. If the number of Shares represented
by each American Depositary Share decreases as a result of a Replacement, the Depositary may call for surrender of the American
Depositary Shares to be exchanged on a mandatory basis for a lesser number of American Depositary Shares and may sell American
Depositary Shares to the extent necessary to avoid distributing fractions of American Depositary Shares in that exchange and distribute
the net proceeds of that sale to the Owners entitled to them.
(e)	If there are
no Deposited Securities with respect to American Depositary Shares, including if the Deposited Securities are cancelled, or the
Deposited Securities with respect to American Depositary Shares have become apparently worthless, the Depositary may call for surrender
of those American Depositary Shares or may cancel those American Depositary Shares, upon notice to Owners, and a Termination
Option Event occurs.
SECTION 4.9.           
Reports.
The Depositary shall
make available for inspection by Owners at its Office any reports and communications, including any proxy solicitation material,
received from the Company which are both (a) received by the Depositary as the holder of the Deposited Securities and (b) made
generally available to the holders of those Deposited Securities by the Company. The Company shall furnish reports and communications,
including any proxy soliciting material to which this Section applies, to the Depositary in English, to the extent those materials
are required to be translated into English pursuant to any regulations of the Commission.
SECTION 4.10.       
Lists of Owners.
Upon written request
by the Company, the Depositary shall, at the expense of the Company, furnish to it a list, as of a recent date, of the names, addresses
and American Depositary Share holdings of all Owners.
SECTION 4.11.       
Withholding.
If the Depositary
determines that any distribution received or to be made by the Depositary (including Shares and rights to subscribe therefor) is
subject to any tax or other governmental charge that the Depositary is obligated to withhold, the Depositary may sell, by public
or private sale, all or a portion of the distributed property (including Shares and rights to subscribe therefor) in the amounts
and manner the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay those taxes or charges, and the Depositary shall distribute the
net proceeds of that sale, after deduction of those taxes or charges, to the Owners entitled thereto in proportion to the number
of American Depositary Shares held by them respectively.
ARTICLE 5.                 
THE DEPOSITARY, THE CUSTODIANS AND THE COMPANY
SECTION 5.1.           
Maintenance of Office and Transfer Books by the Depositary.
Until termination
of this Deposit Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Depositary shall maintain facilities for the execution and delivery,
registration, registration of transfers and surrender of American Depositary Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit
Agreement.
The Depositary shall
keep books for the registration of American Depositary Shares, which shall be open for inspection by the Owners at the Depositary’s
Office during regular business hours, provided that such inspection is not for the purpose of communicating with Owners
in the interest of a business or object other than the business of the Company or a matter related to this Deposit Agreement or
the American Depositary Shares.
The Depositary may
close the transfer books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its
duties under this Deposit Agreement.
If any American Depositary
Shares are listed on one or more stock exchanges, the Depositary shall act as Registrar or appoint a Registrar or one or more co-registrars
for registry of those American Depositary Shares in accordance with any requirements of that exchange or those exchanges.
The Company shall
have the right, at all reasonable times, to inspect transfer and registration records of the Depositary, the Registrar and any
co-transfer agents or co-registrars and to require such parties to supply copies of such portions of their records as the Company
may reasonably request.
SECTION 5.2.           
Prevention or Delay in Performance by the Depositary or the Company.
Neither the Depositary
nor the Company nor any of their respective directors, employees, agents or affiliates shall incur any liability to any Owner or
Holder:
(i) if by reason of
(A) any provision of any present or future law or regulation or other act of the government of the United States, any State of
the United States or any other state or jurisdiction, or of any governmental or regulatory authority or stock exchange; (B) (in
the case of the Depositary only) any provision, present or future, of the articles of association or similar document of the Company,
or by reason of any provision of any securities issued or distributed by the Company, or any offering or distribution thereof;
or (C) any event or circumstance, whether natural or caused by a person or persons, that is beyond the ability of the Depositary

floods, severe storms, fires, explosions, war, terrorism, civil unrest, labor disputes or criminal acts; interruptions or malfunctions
of utility services, Internet or other communications lines or systems; unauthorized access to or attacks on computer systems or
websites; or other failures or malfunctions of computer hardware or software or other systems or equipment), the Depositary or
the Company is, directly or indirectly, prevented from, forbidden to or delayed in, or could be subject to any civil or criminal
penalty on account of doing or performing and therefore does not do or perform, any act or thing that, by the terms of this Deposit
Agreement or the Deposited Securities, it is provided shall be done or performed;
(ii) by reason of
any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement (including any determination by
the Depositary to take, or not take, any action that this Deposit Agreement provides the Depositary may take);
(iii) for the inability
of any Owner or Holder to benefit from any distribution, offering, right or other benefit that is made available to holders of
Deposited Securities but is not, under the terms of this Deposit Agreement, made available to Owners or Holders; or
(iv) for any special,
consequential or punitive damages for any breach of the terms of this Deposit Agreement.
Where, by the terms
of a distribution to which Section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 applies, or an offering to which Section 4.4 applies, or for any other
reason, that distribution or offering may not be made available to Owners, and the Depositary may not dispose of that distribution
or offering on behalf of Owners and make the net proceeds available to Owners, then the Depositary shall not make that distribution
or offering available to Owners, and shall allow any rights, if applicable, to lapse.
SECTION 5.3.           
Obligations of the Depositary and the Company.
The Company assumes
no obligation nor shall it be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to any Owner or Holder, except that the Company
agrees to perform its obligations specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement without negligence or bad faith.

Neither the Depositary
nor the Company shall be liable for any action or non-action by it in reliance upon the advice of or information from legal counsel,

to give such advice or information.
The Depositary shall
not be liable for any acts or omissions made by a successor depositary whether in connection with a previous act or omission of
the Depositary or in connection with any matter arising wholly after the removal or resignation of the Depositary, provided that
in connection with the issue out of which such potential liability arises the Depositary performed its obligations without negligence
or bad faith while it acted as Depositary.
The Depositary shall
not be liable for the acts or omissions of any securities depository, clearing agency or settlement system in connection with or
arising out of book-entry settlement of American Depositary Shares or Deposited Securities or otherwise.
In the absence of
bad faith on its part, the Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote any of the
Deposited Securities, or for the manner in which any such vote is cast or the effect of any such vote.
The Depositary shall
have no duty to make any determination or provide any information as to the tax status of the Company or any liability for any
tax consequences that may be incurred by Owners or Holders as a result of owning or holding American Depositary Shares.
No disclaimer of liability

SECTION 5.4.           
Resignation and Removal of the Depositary.
The Depositary may
at any time resign as Depositary hereunder by written notice of its election so to do delivered to the Company, to become effective
upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of that appointment as provided in this Section. The effect of
resignation if a successor depositary is not appointed is provided for in Section 6.2.
The Depositary may
at any time be removed by the Company by 120 days’ prior written notice of that removal, to become effective upon the later
of (i) the 120th day after delivery of the notice to the Depositary and (ii) the appointment of a successor depositary and its
acceptance of its appointment as provided in this Section.
If the Depositary
resigns or is removed, the Company shall use its best efforts to appoint a successor depositary, which shall be a bank or trust
company having an office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York. Every successor depositary shall execute and deliver
to the Company an instrument in writing accepting its appointment under this Deposit Agreement. If the Depositary receives notice
from the Company that a successor depositary has been appointed following its resignation or removal, the Depositary, upon payment
of all sums due it from the Company, shall deliver to its successor a register listing all the Owners and their respective holdings
of outstanding American Depositary Shares and shall deliver the Deposited Securities to or to the order of its successor. When
the Depositary has taken the actions specified in the preceding sentence (i) the successor shall become the Depositary and shall
have all the rights and shall assume all the duties of the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement and (ii) the predecessor depositary
shall cease to be the Depositary and shall be discharged and released from all obligations under this Deposit Agreement, except
for its duties under Section 5.8 with respect to the time before that discharge. A successor Depositary shall notify the Owners
of its appointment as soon as practical after assuming the duties of Depositary.
Any corporation or
other entity into or with which the Depositary may be merged or consolidated shall be the successor of the Depositary without the
execution or filing of any document or any further act.
SECTION 5.5.           
The Custodians.
The Custodian shall
be subject at all times and in all respects to the directions of the Depositary and shall be responsible solely to it. The Depositary
in its discretion may at any time appoint a substitute or additional custodian or custodians, each of which shall thereafter be
one of the Custodians under this Deposit Agreement. If the Depositary receives notice that a Custodian is resigning and, upon the
effectiveness of that resignation there would be no Custodian acting under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall, as promptly
as practicable after receiving that notice, appoint a substitute custodian or custodians, each of which shall thereafter be a Custodian
under this Deposit Agreement. The Depositary shall require any Custodian that resigns or is removed to deliver all Deposited Securities
held by it to another Custodian.
SECTION 5.6.           
Notices and Reports.
On or before the first
date on which the Company gives notice, by publication or otherwise, of any meeting of holders of Shares, or of any adjourned meeting
of those holders, or of the taking of any action in respect of any cash or other distributions or the granting of any rights, the
Company agrees to transmit to the Depositary and the Custodian a copy of the notice thereof in English but otherwise in the form
given or to be given to holders of Shares.
The Company will arrange
for the translation into English, if not already in English, to the extent required pursuant to any regulations of the Commission,
and the prompt transmittal by the Company to the Depositary and the Custodian of all notices and any other reports and communications
which are made generally available by the Company to holders of its Shares. If requested in writing by the Company, the Depositary
will Disseminate, at the Company’s expense, those notices, reports and communications to all Owners or otherwise make them
available to Owners in a manner that the Company specifies as substantially equivalent to the manner in which those communications
are made available to holders of Shares and compliant with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the American Depositary
Shares are listed. The Company will timely provide the Depositary with the quantity of such notices, reports, and communications,
as requested by the Depositary from time to time, in order for the Depositary to effect that Dissemination.
The Company represents
that as of the date of this Deposit Agreement, the statements in Article 11 of the Receipt with respect to the exemption from registration
under Rule 12g3-2(b) under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are true and correct and that the Company otherwise
qualifies for the exemption provided by that Rule. The Company agrees to promptly notify the Depositary upon becoming aware of
any change in the truth of any of those statements or if it is otherwise no longer qualified for that exemption.
SECTION 5.7.           
Distribution of Additional Shares, Rights, etc.
If the Company or
any affiliate of the Company determines to make any issuance or distribution of (1) additional Shares, (2) rights to
subscribe for Shares, (3) securities convertible into Shares, or (4) rights to subscribe for such securities (each a
“Distribution”), the Company shall notify the Depositary in writing in English as promptly as practicable and
in any event before the Distribution starts and, if requested in writing by the Depositary, the Company shall promptly furnish
to the Depositary either (i) evidence satisfactory to the Depositary that the Distribution is registered under the Securities Act
of 1933 or (ii) a written opinion from U.S. counsel for the Company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Depositary, stating
that the Distribution does not require, or, if made in the United States, would not require, registration under the Securities
Act of 1933.
The Company agrees
with the Depositary that neither the Company nor any company controlled by, controlling or under common control with the Company
will at any time deposit any Shares that, at the time of deposit, are Restricted Securities.
SECTION 5.8.           
Indemnification.
The Company agrees
to indemnify the Depositary, its directors, employees, agents and affiliates and each Custodian against, and hold each of them
harmless from, any liability or expense (including, but not limited to any fees and expenses incurred in seeking, enforcing or
collecting such indemnity and the fees and expenses of counsel) which may arise out of or in connection with (a) any registration
with the Commission of American Depositary Shares or Deposited Securities or the offer or sale thereof in the United States or
(b) acts performed or omitted, pursuant to the provisions of or in connection with this Deposit Agreement and the American Depositary
Shares, as the same may be amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, (i) by either the Depositary or a Custodian or
their respective directors, employees, agents and affiliates, except for any liability or expense arising out of the negligence
or bad faith of either of them, or (ii) by the Company or any of its directors, employees, agents and affiliates.
The Depositary agrees
to indemnify the Company, its directors, employees, agents and affiliates and hold them harmless from any liability or expense
which may arise out of acts performed or omitted by the Depositary or any Custodian or their respective directors, employees, agents
and affiliates due to their negligence or bad faith.
SECTION 5.9.           
Charges of Depositary.
The following charges
shall be incurred by any party depositing or withdrawing Shares or by any party surrendering American Depositary Shares or to whom
American Depositary Shares are issued (including, without limitation, issuance pursuant to a stock dividend or stock split declared
by the Company or an exchange of stock regarding the American Depositary Shares or Deposited Securities or a delivery of American
Depositary Shares pursuant to Section 4.3), or by Owners, as applicable: (1) taxes and other governmental charges, (2) such registration
fees as may from time to time be in effect for the registration of transfers of Shares generally on the Share register of the Company

distribution made pursuant to this Deposit Agreement, including, but not limited to Sections 4.1 through 4.4 and Section 4.8, (7)
a fee for the distribution of securities pursuant to Section 4.2 or of rights pursuant to Section 4.4 (where the Depositary will
not exercise or sell those rights on behalf of Owners), such fee being in an amount equal to the fee for the execution and delivery
of American Depositary Shares referred to above which would have been charged as a result of the deposit of such securities under
this Deposit Agreement (for purposes of this item 7 treating all such securities as if they were Shares) but which securities are
instead distributed by the Depositary to Owners, (8) in addition to any fee charged under item 6 above, a fee of $.05 or less per
American Depositary Share (or portion thereof) per annum for depositary services, which will be payable as provided in item 9 below,

agents of the Depositary's or Custodian’s agents, in connection with the servicing of Shares or other Deposited Securities

shall be payable at the sole discretion of the Depositary by billing those Owners for those charges or by deducting those charges
from one or more cash dividends or other cash distributions).
The Depositary may
collect any of its fees by deduction from any cash distribution payable, or by selling a portion of any securities to be distributed,
to Owners that are obligated to pay those fees.
In performing its
duties under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary may use brokers, dealers, foreign currency dealers or other service providers
that are owned by or affiliated with the Depositary and that may earn or share fees, spreads or commissions.
The Depositary, subject
to Section 2.9, may own and deal in any class of securities of the Company and its affiliates and in American Depositary Shares.
SECTION 5.10.

Exclusivity.
Without prejudice
to the Company’s rights under Section 5.4, the Company agrees not to appoint any other depositary for issuance of depositary
shares, depositary receipts or any similar securities or instruments so long as The Bank of New York Mellon is acting as Depositary
under this Deposit Agreement.
ARTICLE 6.                 
AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
SECTION 6.1.           
Amendment.
The form of the Receipts
and any provisions of this Deposit Agreement may at any time and from time to time be amended by agreement between the Company
and the Depositary without the consent of Owners or Holders in any respect that they may deem necessary or desirable. Any amendment
that would impose or increase any fees or charges (other than taxes and other governmental charges, registration fees, cable, telex
or facsimile transmission costs, delivery costs or other such expenses), or that would otherwise prejudice any substantial existing
right of Owners, shall, however, not become effective as to outstanding American Depositary Shares until the expiration of 30 days
after notice of that amendment has been Disseminated to the Owners of outstanding American Depositary Shares. Every Owner and Holder,
at the time any amendment so becomes effective, shall be deemed, by continuing to hold American Depositary Shares or any interest
therein, to consent and agree to that amendment and to be bound by this Deposit Agreement as amended thereby. Upon the effectiveness
of an amendment to the form of Receipt, including a change in the number of Shares represented by each American Depositary Share,
the Depositary may call for surrender of Receipts to be replaced with new Receipts in the amended form or call for surrender of
American Depositary Shares to effect that change of ratio. In no event shall any amendment impair the right of the Owner to surrender
American Depositary Shares and receive delivery of the Deposited Securities represented thereby, except in order to comply with
mandatory provisions of applicable law.
SECTION 6.2.           
Termination.
(a)	The Company
may initiate termination of this Deposit Agreement by notice to the Depositary. The Depositary may initiate termination of this
Deposit Agreement if (i) at any time 60 days shall have expired after the Depositary delivered to the Company a written resignation
notice and a successor depositary has not been appointed and accepted its appointment as provided in Section 5.4, (ii) an Insolvency
Event or Delisting Event occurs with respect to the Company or (iii) a Termination Option Event has occurred or will occur. If
termination of this Deposit Agreement is initiated, the Depositary shall Disseminate a notice of termination to the Owners of all
American Depositary Shares then outstanding setting a date for termination (the “Termination Date”), which shall
be at least 90 days after the date of that notice, and this Deposit Agreement shall terminate on that Termination Date.
(b)	After the Termination
Date, the Company shall be discharged from all obligations under this Deposit Agreement except for its obligations to the Depositary
under Sections 5.8 and 5.9.
(c)	At any time
after the Termination Date, the Depositary may sell the Deposited Securities then held under this Deposit Agreement and may thereafter
hold uninvested the net proceeds of any such sale, together with any other cash then held by it hereunder, unsegregated and without
liability for interest, for the pro rata benefit of the Owners of American Depositary Shares that remain outstanding, and those
Owners will be general creditors of the Depositary with respect to those net proceeds and that other cash. After making that sale,
the Depositary shall be discharged from all obligations under this Deposit Agreement, except (i) to account for the net
proceeds and other cash (after deducting, in each case, the fee of the Depositary for the surrender of American Depositary Shares,
any expenses for the account of the Owner of such American Depositary Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Deposit Agreement and any applicable taxes or governmental charges) and (ii) for its obligations under Section 5.8 and (iii) to
act as provided in paragraph (d) below.
(d)	After the Termination
Date, the Depositary shall continue to receive dividends and other distributions pertaining to Deposited Securities (that have
not been sold), may sell rights and other property as provided in this Deposit Agreement and shall deliver Deposited Securities
(or sale proceeds) upon surrender of American Depositary Shares (after payment or upon deduction, in each case, of the fee of the
Depositary for the surrender of American Depositary Shares, any expenses for the account of the Owner of those American Depositary
Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement and any applicable taxes or governmental charges).
After the Termination Date, the Depositary shall not accept deposits of Shares or deliver American Depositary Shares. However,

set forth in the deposit agreement dated as of ______________, 2017 (herein called the “Deposit Agreement”)
among the Company, the Depositary, and all Owners and Holders from time to time of American Depositary Shares issued thereunder,
each of whom by accepting American Depositary Shares agrees to become a party thereto and become bound by all the terms and conditions
thereof. The Deposit Agreement sets forth the rights of Owners and Holders and the rights and duties of the Depositary in respect
of the Shares deposited thereunder and any and all other securities, property and cash from time to time received in respect of
those Shares and held thereunder (those Shares, securities, property, and cash are herein called “Deposited Securities”).
Copies of the Deposit Agreement are on file at the Depositary's Office in New York City and at the office of the Custodian.
The statements made

2.                 
SURRENDER OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES AND WITHDRAWAL OF SHARES.
Upon surrender at
the Depositary’s Office of American Depositary Shares for the purpose of withdrawal of the Deposited Securities represented
thereby and payment of the fee of the Depositary for the surrender of American Depositary Shares as provided in Section 5.9 of
the Deposit Agreement and payment of all taxes and governmental charges payable in connection with that surrender and withdrawal
of the Deposited Securities, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Agreement, the Owner of those American Depositary
Shares shall be entitled to delivery (to the extent delivery can then be lawfully and practicably made), to or as instructed by
that Owner, of the amount of Deposited Securities at the time represented by those American Depositary Shares, but not any
money or other property as to which a record date for distribution to Owners has passed (since money or other property of that
kind will be delivered or paid on the scheduled payment date to the Owner as of that record date). The Depositary shall direct
the Custodian with respect to delivery of Deposited Securities and may charge the surrendering Owner a fee and its expenses for
doing so. That delivery will be made, at the office of the Custodian, except that, at the request, risk and expense of the
surrendering Owner, and for the account of that Owner, the Depositary shall direct the Custodian to forward any cash or other property
comprising, and forward a certificate or certificates, if applicable, and other proper documents of title, if any, for, the Deposited
Securities represented by the surrendered American Depositary Shares to the Depositary for delivery at the Depositary’s Office
or to another address specified in the order received from the surrendering Owner.
3.                 
REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES; COMBINATION AND SPLIT-UP OF RECEIPTS; INTERCHANGE OF CERTIFICATED
AND UNCERTIFICATED AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES.
The Depositary,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Agreement, shall register a transfer of American Depositary Shares on its transfer
books upon (i) in the case of certificated American Depositary Shares, surrender of the Receipt evidencing those American Depositary
Shares, by the Owner or by a duly authorized attorney, properly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer or (ii)
in the case of uncertificated American Depositary Shares, receipt from the Owner of a proper instruction (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, instructions through DRS and Profile as provided in Section 2.10 of that Agreement), and, in either case, duly stamped
as may be required by the laws of the State of New York and of the United States of America. Upon registration of a transfer, the
Depositary shall deliver the transferred American Depositary Shares to or upon the order of the person entitled thereto.
The Depositary,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Agreement, shall upon surrender of a Receipt or Receipts for the purpose of
effecting a split-up or combination of such Receipt or Receipts, execute and deliver a new Receipt or Receipts for any authorized
number of American Depositary Shares requested, evidencing the same aggregate number of American Depositary Shares as the Receipt
or Receipts surrendered.
The Depositary,
upon surrender of certificated American Depositary Shares for the purpose of exchanging for uncertificated American Depositary
Shares, shall cancel the Receipt evidencing those certificated American Depositary Shares and send the Owner a statement confirming
that the Owner is the owner of the same number of uncertificated American Depositary Shares. The Depositary, upon receipt of a
proper instruction (including, for the avoidance of doubt, instructions through DRS and Profile as provided in Section 2.10 of
the Deposit Agreement) from the Owner of uncertificated American Depositary Shares for the purpose of exchanging for certificated
American Depositary Shares, shall cancel those uncertificated American Depositary Shares and register and deliver to the Owner
a Receipt evidencing the same number of certificated American Depositary Shares.
As a condition precedent
to the delivery, registration of transfer, or surrender of any American Depositary Shares or split-up or combination of any Receipt
or withdrawal of any Deposited Securities, the Depositary, the Custodian, or Registrar may require payment from the depositor of
the Shares or the presenter of the Receipt or instruction for registration of transfer or surrender of American Depositary Shares
not evidenced by a Receipt of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any tax or other governmental charge and any stock transfer
or registration fee with respect thereto (including any such tax or charge and fee with respect to Shares being deposited or withdrawn)
and payment of any applicable fees as provided in the Deposit Agreement, may require the production of proof satisfactory to it
as to the identity and genuineness of any signature and may also require compliance with any regulations the Depositary may establish
consistent with the provisions of the Deposit Agreement.
The delivery of
American Depositary Shares against deposit of Shares generally or against deposit of particular Shares may be suspended, or the
registration of transfer of American Depositary Shares in particular instances may be refused, or the registration of transfer
of outstanding American Depositary Shares generally may be suspended, during any period when the transfer books of the Depositary
are closed, or if any such action is deemed necessary or advisable by the Depositary or the Company at any time or from time to
time because of any requirement of law or of any government or governmental body or commission, or under any provision of the Deposit
Agreement, or for any other reason. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Deposit Agreement or this Receipt, the surrender
of outstanding American Depositary Shares and withdrawal of Deposited Securities may not be suspended subject only to (i) temporary
delays caused by closing the transfer books of the Depositary or the Company or the Foreign Registrar, if applicable, or the deposit
of Shares in connection with voting at a shareholders’ meeting, or the payment of dividends, (ii) the payment of fees, taxes
and similar charges, and (iii) compliance with any U.S. or foreign laws or governmental regulations relating to the American Depositary
Shares or to the withdrawal of the Deposited Securities. The Depositary shall not knowingly accept for deposit under the Deposit
Agreement any Shares that, at the time of deposit, are Restricted Securities.
4.                 
LIABILITY OF OWNER FOR TAXES.
If any tax or other
governmental charge shall become payable by the Custodian or the Depositary with respect to or in connection with any American
Depositary Shares or any Deposited Securities represented by any American Depositary Shares or in connection with a transaction
to which Section 4.8 of the Deposit Agreement applies, that tax or other governmental charge shall be payable by the Owner to the
Depositary. The Depositary may refuse to register any transfer of those American Depositary Shares or any withdrawal of Deposited
Securities represented by those American Depositary Shares until that payment is made, and may withhold any dividends or other
distributions or the proceeds thereof, or may sell for the account of the Owner any part or all of the Deposited Securities represented
by those American Depositary Shares, and may apply those dividends or other distributions or the net proceeds of any sale of that
kind in payment of that tax or other governmental charge but, even after a sale of that kind, the Owner shall remain liable for
any deficiency. The Depositary shall distribute any net proceeds of a sale made under Section 3.2 of the Deposit Agreement that
are not used to pay taxes or governmental charges to the Owners entitled to them in accordance with Section 4.1 of the Deposit
Agreement. If the number of Shares represented by each American Depositary Share decreases as a result of a sale of Deposited Securities
under Section 3.2 of the Deposit Agreement, the Depositary may call for surrender of the American Depositary Shares to be exchanged
on a mandatory basis for a lesser number of American Depositary Shares and may sell American Depositary Shares to the extent necessary
to avoid distributing fractions of American Depositary Shares in that exchange and distribute the net proceeds of that sale to
the Owners entitled to them.
5.                 
WARRANTIES ON DEPOSIT OF SHARES.
Every person depositing
Shares under the Deposit Agreement shall be deemed thereby to represent and warrant, that those Shares and each certificate therefor,
if applicable, are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights
of the holders of outstanding securities of the Company and that the person making that deposit is duly authorized so to do. Every
depositing person shall also be deemed to represent that the Shares, at the time of deposit, are not Restricted Securities. All
representations and warranties deemed made under Section 3.3 of the Deposit Agreement shall survive the deposit of Shares and delivery
of American Depositary Shares.
6.                 
FILING PROOFS, CERTIFICATES, AND OTHER INFORMATION.
Any person presenting
Shares for deposit or any Owner or Holder may be required from time to time to file with the Depositary or the Custodian such proof
of citizenship or residence, exchange control approval, or such information relating to the registration on the books of the Company
or the Foreign Registrar, if applicable, to execute such certificates and to make such representations and warranties, as the Depositary
may deem necessary or proper. The Depositary may withhold the delivery or registration of transfer of any American Depositary Shares,
the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or of the proceeds thereof or the delivery of any Deposited Securities until
that proof or other information is filed or those certificates are executed or those representations and warranties are made. The
Depositary shall provide the Company, upon the Company's reasonable written request and at its expense as promptly as practicable,
with copies of any information or other material which it receives pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Deposit Agreement, to the extent
that disclosure is permitted under applicable law. Each Owner and Holder agrees to provide any information requested by the Company
or the Depositary pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Deposit Agreement. As conditions of accepting Shares for deposit, the Depositary
may require (i) any certification required by the Depositary or the Custodian in accordance with the provisions of the Deposit
Agreement, (ii) a written order directing the Depositary to deliver to, or upon the written order of, the person or persons stated
in that order, the number of American Depositary Shares representing those Deposited Shares (iii) evidence satisfactory to the
Depositary that those Shares have been re-registered in the books of the Company or the Foreign Registrar in the name of the Depositary,
a Custodian or a nominee of the Depositary or a Custodian, (iv) evidence satisfactory to the Depositary that any necessary approval
has been granted by any governmental body in each applicable jurisdiction and (v) an agreement or assignment, or other instrument
satisfactory to the Depositary, that provides for the prompt transfer to the Custodian of any dividend, or right to subscribe for
additional Shares or to receive other property, that any person in whose name those Shares are or have been recorded may thereafter
receive upon or in respect of those Shares, or, in lieu thereof, such agreement of indemnity or other agreement as shall be satisfactory
to the Depositary.
7.                 
CHARGES OF DEPOSITARY.
The following charges
shall be incurred by any party depositing or withdrawing Shares or by any party surrendering American Depositary Shares or to whom

Depositary Shares pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Deposit Agreement), or by Owners, as applicable: (1) taxes and other governmental

those Owners for those charges or by deducting those charges from one or more cash dividends or other cash distributions).

and maintenance of the American Depositary Shares program, waive fees and expenses for services provided by the Depositary or share

that may earn or share fees, spreads or commissions.
8.                 
PRE-RELEASE OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES.
Notwithstanding
Section 2.3 of the Deposit Agreement, the Depositary may deliver American Depositary Shares prior to the receipt of Shares pursuant
to Section 2.2 of the Deposit Agreement (a "Pre-Release"). The Depositary may, pursuant to Section 2.5 of the Deposit
Agreement, deliver Shares upon the surrender of American Depositary Shares that have been Pre-Released, whether or not that surrender
is prior to the termination of that Pre-Release or the Depositary knows that those American Depositary Shares have been Pre-Released.
The Depositary may receive American Depositary Shares in lieu of Shares in satisfaction of a Pre-Release. Each Pre-Release must
be (a) preceded or accompanied by a written representation from the person to whom American Depositary Shares or Shares are to
be delivered, that such person, or its customer, owns the Shares or American Depositary Shares to be remitted, as the case may
be, (b) at all times fully collateralized with cash or such other collateral as the Depositary deems appropriate, (c) terminable
by the Depositary on not more than five (5) business days’ notice, and (d) subject to all indemnities and credit regulations

will not normally exceed thirty percent (30%) of all American Depositary Shares outstanding; provided, however, that
the Depositary reserves the right to change or disregard that limit from time to time as it deems appropriate.
The Depositary may
retain for its own account any compensation received by it in connection with Pre-Release.
9.                 
TITLE TO AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES.
It is a condition
of the American Depositary Shares, and every successive Owner and Holder of American Depositary Shares, by accepting or holding
the same consents and agrees that American Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt, when the Receipt is properly endorsed or accompanied
by proper instruments of transfer, shall be transferable as certificated registered securities under the laws of the State of New
York, and that American Depositary Shares not evidenced by Receipts shall be transferable as uncertificated registered securities
under the laws of the State of New York. The Depositary, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, may treat the Owner of American
Depositary Shares as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distribution of dividends
or other distributions or to any notice provided for in the Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes, and neither the Depositary
nor the Company shall have any obligation or be subject to any liability under the Deposit Agreement to any Holder of American
Depositary Shares, but only to the Owner.
10.             
VALIDITY OF RECEIPT.
This Receipt shall
not be entitled to any benefits under the Deposit Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless this Receipt shall
have been (i) executed by the Depositary by the manual signature of a duly authorized officer of the Depositary or (ii) executed
by the facsimile signature of a duly authorized officer of the Depositary and countersigned by the manual signature of a duly authorized
signatory of the Depositary or the Registrar or a co-registrar.
11.             
REPORTS; INSPECTION OF TRANSFER BOOKS.
The Company publishes
information in English required to maintain the exemption from registration under Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 on its Internet web site or through an electronic information delivery system generally available to the public in
its primary trading market. The Company's Internet web site address is www.bidcorpgroup.com.
The Depositary will
make available for inspection by Owners at its Office any reports, notices and other communications, including any proxy soliciting
material, received from the Company which are both (a) received by the Depositary as the holder of the Deposited Securities
and (b) made generally available to the holders of those Deposited Securities by the Company. The Company shall furnish reports
and communications, including any proxy soliciting material to which Section 4.9 of the Deposit Agreement applies, to the Depositary
in English, to the extent such materials are required to be translated into English pursuant to any regulations of the Commission.
The Depositary will
keep books for the registration of American Depositary Shares and transfers of American Depositary Shares, which shall be open
for inspection by the Owners at the Depositary’s Office during regular business hours, provided that such inspection
shall not be for the purpose of communicating with Owners in the interest of a business or object other than the business of the
Company or a matter related to the Deposit Agreement or the American Depositary Shares.
12.             
DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.
Whenever the Depositary
receives any cash dividend or other cash distribution on Deposited Securities, the Depositary will, if at the time of receipt thereof
any amounts received in a foreign currency can in the judgment of the Depositary be converted on a reasonable basis into Dollars
transferable to the United States, and subject to the Deposit Agreement, convert that dividend or other cash distribution into
Dollars and distribute the amount thus received (net of the fees and expenses of the Depositary as provided in Article 7 hereof
and Section 5.9 of the Deposit Agreement) to the Owners entitled thereto; provided, however, that if the Custodian
or the Depositary is required to withhold and does withhold from that cash dividend or other cash distribution an amount on account
of taxes or other governmental charges, the amount distributed to the Owners of the American Depositary Shares representing those
Deposited Securities shall be reduced accordingly. If a cash distribution would represent a return of all or substantially all
the value of the Deposited Securities underlying American Depositary Shares, the Depositary may require surrender of those American
Depositary Shares and may require payment of or deduct the fee for surrender of American Depositary Shares (whether or not it is
also requiring surrender of American Depositary Shares) as a condition of making that cash distribution. A distribution of that
kind shall be a Termination Option Event.
Subject to the provisions
of Section 4.11 and 5.9 of the Deposit Agreement, whenever the Depositary receives any distribution other than a distribution
described in Section 4.1, 4.3 or 4.4 of the Deposit Agreement on Deposited Securities (but not in exchange for or in conversion
or in lieu of Deposited Securities), the Depositary will cause the securities or property received by it to be distributed to the
Owners entitled thereto, after deduction or upon payment of any fees and expenses of the Depositary and any taxes or other governmental
charges, in any manner that the Depositary deems equitable and practicable for accomplishing that distribution (which may be a
distribution of depositary shares representing the securities received); provided, however, that if in the opinion
of the Depositary such distribution cannot be made proportionately among the Owners of Receipts entitled thereto, or if for any
other reason the Depositary deems such distribution not to be lawful and feasible, the Depositary may adopt such other method as
it may deem equitable and practicable for the purpose of effecting such distribution, including, but not limited to, the public
or private sale of the securities or property thus received, or any part thereof, and distribution of the net proceeds of any such
sale (net of the fees and expenses of the Depositary as provided in Article 7 hereof and Section 5.9 of the Deposit Agreement)
to the Owners entitled thereto all in the manner and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.1 of the Deposit Agreement.
The Depositary may withhold any distribution of securities under Section 4.2 of the Deposit Agreement if it has not received satisfactory
assurances from the Company that the distribution does not require registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The Depositary
may sell, by public or private sale, an amount of securities or other property it would otherwise distribute under this Article
that is sufficient to pay its fees and expenses in respect of that distribution. If a distribution under Section 4.2 of the Deposit
Agreement would represent a return of all of substantially all the value of the Deposited Securities underlying American Depositary
Shares, the Depositary may require surrender of those American Depositary Shares and may require payment of or deduct the fee for
surrender of American Depositary Shares (whether or not it is also requiring surrender of American Depositary Shares) as a condition
of making that distribution. A distribution of that kind shall be a Termination Option Event.
Whenever the Depositary
receives any distribution consisting of a dividend in, or free distribution of, Shares, the Depositary may deliver to the Owners
entitled thereto, an aggregate number of American Depositary Shares representing the amount of Shares received as that dividend
or free distribution, subject to the terms and conditions of the Deposit Agreement with respect to the deposit of Shares and issuance
of American Depositary Shares, including the withholding of any tax or other governmental charge as provided in Section 4.11 of
the Deposit Agreement and the payment of the fees and expenses of the Depositary as provided in Article 7 hereof and Section 5.9
of the Deposit Agreement (and the Depositary may sell, by public or private sale, an amount of Shares received (or American Depositary
Shares representing those Shares) sufficient to pay its fees and expenses in respect of that distribution). In lieu of delivering
fractional American Depositary Shares, the Depositary may sell the amount of Shares represented by the aggregate of those fractions
(or American Depositary Shares representing those Shares) and distribute the net proceeds, all in the manner and subject to the
conditions described in Section 4.1of the Deposit Agreement. If and to the extent that additional American Depositary Shares are
not delivered and Shares or American Depositary Shares are not sold, each American Depositary Share shall thenceforth also represent
the additional Shares distributed on the Deposited Securities represented thereby.
If the Company declares
a distribution in which holders of Deposited Securities have a right to elect whether to receive cash, Shares or other securities
or a combination of those things, or a right to elect to have a distribution sold on their behalf, the Depositary may, after consultation
with the Company, make that right of election available for exercise by Owners any manner the Depositary considers to be lawful
and practical. As a condition of making a distribution election right available to Owners, the Depositary may require satisfactory
assurances from the Company that doing so does not require registration of any securities under the Securities Act of 1933.
If the Depositary
determines that any distribution received or to be made by the Depositary (including Shares and rights to subscribe therefor) is
subject to any tax or other governmental charge that the Depositary is obligated to withhold, the Depositary may sell, by public
or private sale, all or a portion of the distributed property (including Shares and rights to subscribe therefor) in the amounts
and manner the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay any those taxes or charges, and the Depositary shall distribute
the net proceeds of that sale, after deduction of those taxes or charges, to the Owners entitled thereto in proportion to the number
of American Depositary Shares held by them respectively.
Each Owner and Holder
agrees to indemnify the Company, the Depositary, the Custodian and their respective directors, employees, agents and affiliates
for, and hold each of them harmless against, any claim by any governmental authority with respect to taxes, additions to tax, penalties
or interest arising out of any refund of taxes, reduced withholding at source or other tax benefit received by it.
13.             
RIGHTS.
(a)	If rights
are granted to the Depositary in respect of deposited Shares to purchase additional Shares or other securities, the Company and
the Depositary shall endeavor to consult as to the actions, if any, the Depositary should take in connection with that grant of
rights. The Depositary may, to the extent deemed by it to be lawful and practical (i) if requested in writing by the Company, grant
to all or certain Owners rights to instruct the Depositary to purchase the securities to which the rights relate and deliver those
securities or American Depositary Shares representing those securities to Owners, (ii) if requested in writing by the Company,
deliver the rights to or to the order of certain Owners, or (iii) sell the rights to the extent practicable and distribute the
net proceeds of that sale to Owners entitled to those proceeds. To the extent rights are not exercised, delivered or disposed of
under (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Depositary shall permit the rights to lapse unexercised.
(b)	If the Depositary
will act under (a)(i) above, the Company and the Depositary will enter into a separate agreement setting forth the conditions and
procedures applicable to the particular offering. Upon instruction from an applicable Owner in the form the Depositary specified
and upon payment by that Owner to the Depositary of an amount equal to the purchase price of the securities to be received upon
the exercise of the rights, the Depositary shall, on behalf of that Owner, exercise the rights and purchase the securities. The
purchased securities shall be delivered to, or as instructed by, the Depositary. The Depositary shall (i) deposit the purchased
Shares under the Deposit Agreement and deliver American Depositary Shares representing those Shares to that Owner or (ii) deliver
or cause the purchased Shares or other securities to be delivered to or to the order of that Owner. The Depositary will not act
under (a)(i) above unless the offer and sale of the securities to which the rights relate are registered under the Securities Act
of 1933 or the Depositary has received an opinion of United States counsel that is satisfactory to it to the effect that those
securities may be sold and delivered to the applicable Owners without registration under the Securities Act of 1933.
(c)	If the Depositary
will act under (a)(ii) above, the Company and the Depositary will enter into a separate agreement setting forth the conditions
and procedures applicable to the particular offering. Upon (i) the request of an applicable Owner to deliver the rights allocable
to the American Depositary Shares of that Owner to an account specified by that Owner to which the rights can be delivered and
(ii) receipt of such documents as the Company and the Depositary agreed to require to comply with applicable law, the Depositary
will deliver those rights as requested by that Owner.
(d)	If the Depositary
will act under (a)(iii) above, the Depositary will use reasonable efforts to sell the rights in proportion to the number of American
Depositary Shares held by the applicable Owners and pay the net proceeds to the Owners otherwise entitled to the rights that were
sold, upon an averaged or other practical basis without regard to any distinctions among such Owners because of exchange restrictions
or the date of delivery of any American Depositary Shares or otherwise.
(e)	Payment or
deduction of the fees of the Depositary as provided in Section 5.9 of the Deposit Agreement and payment or deduction of the expenses
of the Depositary and any applicable taxes or other governmental charges shall be conditions of any delivery of securities or payment
of cash proceeds under Section 4.4 of that Agreement.
(f)	The Depositary
shall not be responsible for any failure to determine that it may be lawful or feasible to make rights available to or exercise
rights on behalf of Owners in general or any Owner in particular , or to sell rights.
14.             
CONVERSION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY.
Whenever the Depositary
or the Custodian receives foreign currency, by way of dividends or other distributions or the net proceeds from the sale of securities,
property or rights, and if at the time of the receipt thereof the foreign currency so received can in the judgment of the Depositary
be converted on a reasonable basis into Dollars and the resulting Dollars transferred to the United States, the Depositary shall
convert or cause to be converted by sale or in any other manner that it may determine that foreign currency into Dollars, and those
Dollars shall be distributed to the Owners entitled thereto. A cash distribution may be made upon an averaged or other practicable
basis without regard to any distinctions among Owners based on exchange restrictions, the date of delivery of any American Depositary
Shares or otherwise and shall be net of any expenses of conversion into Dollars incurred by the Depositary as provided in Section 5.9
of the Deposit Agreement.
If a conversion
of foreign currency or the repatriation or distribution of Dollars can be effected only with the approval or license of any government
or agency thereof, the Depositary may, but will not be required to, file an application for that approval or license.
If the Depositary
determines that in its judgment any foreign currency received by the Depositary or the Custodian is not convertible on a reasonable
basis into Dollars transferable to the United States, or if any approval or license of any government or agency thereof that is
required for such conversion is not filed or sought by the Depositary, or if any required approval or license is not obtained within
a reasonable period as determined by the Depositary, the Depositary may distribute the foreign currency received by the Depositary
to, or in its discretion may hold such foreign currency uninvested and without liability for interest thereon for the respective
accounts of, the Owners entitled to receive the same.
If any conversion
of foreign currency, in whole or in part, cannot be effected for distribution to some of the Owners entitled thereto, the Depositary
may in its discretion make that conversion and distribution in Dollars to the extent practicable and permissible to the Owners
entitled thereto and may distribute the balance of the foreign currency received by the Depositary to, or hold that balance uninvested
and without liability for interest thereon for the account of, the Owners entitled thereto.
The Depositary may
convert currency itself or through any of its affiliates and, in those cases, acts as principal for its own account and not as
agent, advisor, broker or fiduciary on behalf of any other person and earns revenue, including, without limitation, transaction
spreads, that it will retain for its own account.  The revenue is based on, among other things, the difference between the
exchange rate assigned to the currency conversion made under this Deposit Agreement and the rate that the Depositary or its affiliate
receives when buying or selling foreign currency for its own account.  The Depositary makes no representation that the exchange
rate used or obtained in any currency conversion under the Deposit Agreement will be the most favorable rate that could be obtained
at the time or that the method by which that rate will be determined will be the most favorable to Owners, subject to the Depositary’s
obligations under Section 5.3 of the Deposit Agreement. The methodology used to determine exchange rates used in currency conversions
is available upon request.
15.             
RECORD DATES.
Whenever a cash
dividend, cash distribution or any other distribution is made on Deposited Securities or rights to purchase Shares or other securities
are issued with respect to Deposited Securities (which rights will be delivered to or exercised or sold on behalf of Owners in
accordance with Section 4.4 of the Deposit Agreement) or the Depositary receives notice that a distribution or issuance of that
kind will be made, or whenever the Depositary receives notice that a meeting of holders of Shares will be held in respect of which
the Company has requested the Depositary to send a notice under Section 4.7 of the Deposit Agreement, or whenever the Depositary
will assess a fee or charge against the Owners, or whenever the Depositary causes a change in the number of Shares that are represented
by each American Depositary Share, or whenever the Depositary otherwise finds it necessary or convenient, the Depositary shall
fix a record date, which shall be the same as, or as near as practicable to, any corresponding record date set by the Company with
respect to Shares, (a) for the determination of the Owners (i) who shall be entitled to receive the benefit of that dividend or
other distribution or those rights, (ii) who shall be entitled to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at that meeting,
(iii) who shall be responsible for that fee or charge or (iv) for any other purpose for which the record date was set, or (b) on
or after which each American Depositary Share will represent the changed number of Shares. Subject to the provisions of Sections
4.1 through 4.5 of the Deposit Agreement and to the other terms and conditions of the Deposit Agreement, the Owners on a record
date fixed by the Depositary shall be entitled to receive the amount distributable by the Depositary with respect to that dividend
or other distribution or those rights or the net proceeds of sale thereof in proportion to the number of American Depositary Shares
held by them respectively, to give voting instructions or to act in respect of the other matter for which that record date was
fixed, or be responsible for that fee or charge, as the case may be.
16.             
VOTING OF DEPOSITED SHARES.
(a)	Upon receipt
of notice of any meeting of holders of Shares at which holders of Shares will be entitled to vote, if requested in writing by the
Company, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, Disseminate to the Owners a notice, the form of which shall
be in the sole discretion of the Depositary, that shall contain (i) the information contained in the notice of meeting received
by the Depositary, (ii) a statement that the Owners as of the close of business on a specified record date will be entitled,
subject to any applicable provision of South African law and of the articles of association or similar documents of the Company,
to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Shares represented by their respective
American Depositary Shares (iii) a statement as to the manner in which those instructions may be given and (iv) the last date
on which the Depositary will accept instructions (the “Instruction Cutoff Date”).
(b)	Upon the
written request of an Owner of American Depositary Shares, as of the date of the request or, if a record date was specified by
the Depositary, as of that record date, received on or before any Instruction Cutoff Date established by the Depositary,
the Depositary may, and if the Depositary sent a notice under the preceding paragraph shall, endeavor, in so far as practicable,
to vote or cause to be voted the amount of deposited Shares represented by those American Depositary Shares in accordance with
the instructions set forth in that request. The Depositary shall not vote or attempt to exercise the right to vote that attaches
to the deposited Shares other than in accordance with instructions given by Owners and received by the Depositary.
(c)	There can
be no assurance that Owners generally or any Owner in particular will receive the notice described in paragraph (a) above
in time to enable Owners to give instructions to the Depositary prior to the Instruction Cutoff Date.
(d)	In order
to give Owners a reasonable opportunity to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of voting rights relating to Shares, if the
Company will request the Depositary to Disseminate a notice under paragraph (a) above, the Company shall give the Depositary
notice of the meeting, details concerning the matters to be voted upon and copies of materials to be made available to holders
of Shares in connection with the meeting not less than 45 days prior to the meeting date.
17.             
TENDER AND EXCHANGE OFFERS; REDEMPTION, REPLACEMENT OR CANCELLATION OF DEPOSITED SECURITIES.
(a)	The Depositary
shall not tender any Deposited Securities in response to any voluntary cash tender offer, exchange offer or similar offer made
to holders of Deposited Securities (a “Voluntary Offer”), except when instructed in writing to do so by an Owner
surrendering American Depositary Shares and subject to any conditions or procedures the Depositary may require.
(b)	If the Depositary
receives a written notice that Deposited Securities have been redeemed for cash or otherwise purchased for cash in a transaction
that is mandatory and binding on the Depositary as a holder of those Deposited Securities (a “Redemption”),
the Depositary, at the expense of the Company, shall (i) if required, surrender Deposited Securities that have been redeemed to
the issuer of those securities or its agent on the redemption date, (ii) Disseminate a notice to Owners (A) notifying them of that
Redemption, (B) calling for surrender of a corresponding number of American Depositary Shares and (C) notifying them that the called
American Depositary Shares have been converted into a right only to receive the money received by the Depositary upon that Redemption
and those net proceeds shall be the Deposited Securities to which Owners of those converted American Depositary Shares shall be
entitled upon surrenders of those American Depositary Shares in accordance with Section 2.5 or 6.2 of the Deposit Agreement and
(iii) distribute the money received upon that Redemption to the Owners entitled to it upon surrender by them of called American
Depositary Shares in accordance with Section 2.5 of that Agreement (and, for the avoidance of doubt, Owners shall not be entitled
to receive that money under Section 4.1 of that Agreement). If the Redemption affects less than all the Deposited Securities, the
Depositary shall call for surrender a corresponding portion of the outstanding American Depositary Shares and only those American
Depositary Shares will automatically be converted into a right to receive the net proceeds of the Redemption. The Depositary shall
allocate the American Depositary Shares converted under the preceding sentence among the Owners pro-rata to their respective holdings
of American Depositary Shares immediately prior to the Redemption, except that the allocations may be adjusted so that no
fraction of a converted American Depositary Share is allocated to any Owner. A Redemption of all or substantially all of the Deposited
Securities shall be a Termination Option Event.
(c)	If the Depositary
is notified of or there occurs any change in nominal value or any subdivision, combination or any other reclassification of the
Deposited Securities or any recapitalization, reorganization, sale of assets substantially as an entirety, merger or consolidation
affecting the issuer of the Deposited Securities or to which it is a party that is mandatory and binding on the Depositary as a
holder of Deposited Securities and, as a result, securities or other property have been or will be delivered in exchange, conversion,
replacement or in lieu of, Deposited Securities (a “Replacement”), the Depositary shall, if required, surrender
the old Deposited Securities affected by that Replacement of Shares and hold, as new Deposited Securities under the Deposit Agreement,
the new securities or other property delivered to it in that Replacement. However, the Depositary may elect to sell those
new Deposited Securities if in the opinion of the Depositary it is not lawful or not practical for it to hold those new Deposited
Securities under the Deposit Agreement because those new Deposited Securities may not be distributed to Owners without registration
under the Securities Act of 1933 or for any other reason, at public or private sale, at such places and on such terms as it deems
proper and proceed as if those new Deposited Securities had been Redeemed under paragraph (b) above. A Replacement shall be a Termination
Option Event.
(d)	In the case
of a Replacement where the new Deposited Securities will continue to be held under the Deposit Agreement, the Depositary may call
for the surrender of outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing the new Deposited Securities
and the number of those new Deposited Securities represented by each American Depositary Share. If the number of Shares represented
by each American Depositary Share decreases as a result of a Replacement, the Depositary may call for surrender of the American
Depositary Shares to be exchanged on a mandatory basis for a lesser number of American Depositary and may sell American Depositary
Shares to the extent necessary to avoid distributing fractions of American Depositary Shares in that exchange and distribute the
net proceeds of that sale to the Owners entitled to them.
(e)	If there
are no Deposited Securities with respect to American Depositary Shares, including if the Deposited Securities are cancelled, or
the Deposited Securities with respect to American Depositary Shares become apparently worthless, the Depositary may call for surrender
of those American Depositary Shares or may cancel those American Depositary Shares, upon notice to Owners, and a Termination
Option Event occurs.
18.             
LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND DEPOSITARY.
Neither the Depositary
nor the Company nor any of their respective directors, employees, agents or affiliates shall incur any liability to any Owner or
Holder:
(i) if by reason
of (A) any provision of any present or future law or regulation or other act of the government of the United States, any State
of the United States or any other state or jurisdiction, or of any governmental or regulatory authority or stock exchange; (B)
(in the case of the Depositary only) any provision, present or future, of the articles of association or similar document of the
Company, or by reason of any provision of any securities issued or distributed by the Company, or any offering or distribution
thereof; or (C) any event or circumstance, whether natural or caused by a person or persons, that is beyond the ability of the
Depositary or the Company, as the case may be, to prevent or counteract by reasonable care or effort (including, but not limited
to earthquakes, floods, severe storms, fires, explosions, war, terrorism, civil unrest, labor disputes or criminal acts; interruptions
or malfunctions of utility services, Internet or other communications lines or systems; unauthorized access to or attacks on computer
systems or websites; or other failures or malfunctions of computer hardware or software or other systems or equipment), the Depositary
or the Company is, directly or indirectly, prevented from, forbidden to or delayed in, or could be subject to any civil or criminal
penalty on account of doing or performing and therefore does not do or perform, any act or thing that, by the terms of the Deposit
Agreement or the Deposited Securities, it is provided shall be done or performed;
(ii) by reason of
any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in the Deposit Agreement (including any determination by the
Depositary to take, or not take, any action that the Deposit Agreement provides the Depositary may take);
(iii) for the inability
of any Owner or Holder to benefit from any distribution, offering, right or other benefit that is made available to holders of
Deposited Securities but is not, under the terms of the Deposit Agreement, made available to Owners or Holders; or
(iv) for any special,
consequential or punitive damages for any breach of the terms of the Deposit Agreement.
Where, by the terms
of a distribution to which Section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 of the Deposit Agreement applies, or an offering to which Section 4.4 of that
Agreement applies, or for any other reason, that distribution or offering may not be made available to Owners, and the Depositary
may not dispose of that distribution or offering on behalf of Owners and make the net proceeds available to Owners, then the Depositary
shall not make that distribution or offering available to Owners, and shall allow any rights, if applicable, to lapse.
Neither the Company
nor the Depositary assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under the Deposit Agreement to Owners or Holders,
except that they agree to perform their obligations specifically set forth in the Deposit Agreement without negligence or bad faith.
The Depositary shall not be subject to any liability with respect to the validity or worth of the Deposited Securities. Neither
the Depositary nor the Company shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit, or other proceeding
in respect of any Deposited Securities or in respect of the American Depositary Shares, on behalf of any Owner or Holder or other
person. Neither the Depositary nor the Company shall be liable for any action or non-action by it in reliance upon the advice of
or information from legal counsel, accountants, any person presenting Shares for deposit, any Owner or Holder, or any other person
believed by it in good faith to be competent to give such advice or information. Each of the Depositary and the Company may rely,
and shall be protected in relying upon, any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and
to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Depositary shall not be liable for any acts or omissions made
by a successor depositary whether in connection with a previous act or omission of the Depositary or in connection with a matter
arising wholly after the removal or resignation of the Depositary, provided that in connection with the issue out of which such
potential liability arises, the Depositary performed its obligations without negligence or bad faith while it acted as Depositary.
The Depositary shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of any securities depository, clearing agency or settlement system
in connection with or arising out of book-entry settlement of American Depositary Shares or Deposited Securities or otherwise.
In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instructions
to vote any of the Deposited Securities or for the manner in which any such vote is cast or the effect of any such vote. The Depositary
shall have no duty to make any determination or provide any information as to the tax status of the Company or any liability for
any tax consequences that may be incurred by Owners or Holders as a result of owning or holding American Depositary Shares. No
disclaimer of liability under the Securities Act of 1933 is intended by any provision of the Deposit Agreement.
19.             
RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL OF THE DEPOSITARY; APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR CUSTODIAN.
The Depositary may
at any time resign as Depositary under the Deposit Agreement by written notice of its election so to do delivered to the Company,
to become effective upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as provided in the Deposit
Agreement. The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Company by 120 days’ prior written notice of that removal, to
become effective upon the later of (i) the 120th day after delivery of the notice to the Depositary and (ii) the appointment of
a successor depositary and its acceptance of its appointment as provided in the Deposit Agreement. The Depositary in its discretion
may at any time appoint a substitute or additional custodian or custodians.
20.             
AMENDMENT.
The form of the
Receipts and any provisions of the Deposit Agreement may at any time and from time to time be amended by agreement between the
Company and the Depositary without the consent of Owners or Holders in any respect which they may deem necessary or desirable.
Any amendment that would impose or increase any fees or charges (other than taxes and other governmental charges, registration
fees, cable, telex or facsimile transmission costs, delivery costs or other such expenses), or that would otherwise prejudice any
substantial existing right of Owners, shall, however, not become effective as to outstanding American Depositary Shares until the
expiration of 30 days after notice of that amendment has been Disseminated to the Owners of outstanding American Depositary Shares.
Every Owner and Holder, at the time any amendment so becomes effective, shall be deemed, by continuing to hold American Depositary
Shares or any interest therein, to consent and agree to that amendment and to be bound by the Deposit Agreement as amended thereby.
Upon the effectiveness of an amendment to the form of Receipt, including a change in the number of Shares represented by each American
Depositary Share, the Depositary may call for surrender of Receipts to be replaced with new Receipts in the amended form or call
for surrender of American Depositary Shares to effect that change of ratio. In no event shall any amendment impair the right of
the Owner to surrender American Depositary Shares and receive delivery of the Deposited Securities represented thereby, except
in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law.
21.             
TERMINATION OF DEPOSIT AGREEMENT.
(a)	The Company
may initiate termination of the Deposit Agreement by notice to the Depositary. The Depositary may initiate termination of the Deposit
Agreement if (i) at any time 60 days shall have expired after the Depositary delivered to the Company a written resignation notice
and a successor depositary has not been appointed and accepted its appointment as provided in Section 5.4 of that Agreement, (ii)
an Insolvency Event or Delisting Event occurs with respect to the Company or (iii) a Termination Option Event has occurred or will
occur. If termination of this Deposit Agreement is initiated, the Depositary shall Disseminate a notice of termination to the Owners
of all American Depositary Shares then outstanding setting a date for termination (the “Termination Date”),
which shall be at least 90 days after the date of that notice, and the Deposit Agreement shall terminate on that Termination Date.
(b)	After the
Termination Date, the Company shall be discharged from all obligations under the Deposit Agreement except for its obligations to
the Depositary under Sections 5.8 and 5.9 of that Agreement.
(c)	At any time
after the Termination Date, the Depositary may sell the Deposited Securities then held under the Deposit Agreement and may thereafter
hold uninvested the net proceeds of any such sale, together with any other cash then held by it hereunder, unsegregated and without
liability for interest, for the pro rata benefit of the Owners of American Depositary Shares that remain outstanding, and those
Owners will be general creditors of the Depositary with respect to those net proceeds and that other cash. After making that sale,
the Depositary shall be discharged from all obligations under the Deposit Agreement, except (i) to account for the net proceeds
and other cash (after deducting, in each case, the fee of the Depositary for the surrender of American Depositary Shares, any expenses
for the account of the Owner of such American Depositary Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Deposit Agreement
and any applicable taxes or governmental charges) and (ii) for its obligations under Section 5.8 of that Agreement and (iii) to
act as provided in paragraph (d) below.
(d)	After the
Termination Date, the Depositary shall continue to receive dividends and other distributions pertaining to Deposited Securities
(that have not been sold), may sell rights and other property as provided in the Deposit Agreement and shall deliver Deposited
Securities (or sale proceeds) upon surrender of American Depositary Shares (after payment or upon deduction, in each case, of the
fee of the Depositary for the surrender of American Depositary Shares, any expenses for the account of the Owner of those American
Depositary Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Deposit Agreement and any applicable taxes or governmental
charges). However, after the Termination Date, (i) the Depositary may refuse to accept surrenders of American Depositary
Shares for the purpose of withdrawal of Deposited Securities (that have not been sold) if in its judgment the requested withdrawal
would interfere with its efforts to sell the Deposited Securities, (ii) the Depositary will not be required to deliver cash proceeds
of the sale of Deposited Securities until all Deposited Securities have been sold and (iii) the Depositary may discontinue the
registration of transfers of American Depositary Shares and suspend the distribution of dividends and other distributions on Deposited
Securities to the Owners and need not give any further notices or perform any further acts under the Deposit Agreement except as
provided in Section 6.2 of that Agreement.
22.             
DTC DIRECT REGISTRATION SYSTEM AND PROFILE MODIFICATION SYSTEM.
(a)	Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 2.4 of the Deposit Agreement, the parties acknowledge that DTC’s Direct Registration System (“DRS”)
and Profile Modification System (“Profile”) apply to the American Depositary Shares upon acceptance thereof
to DRS by DTC. DRS is the system administered by DTC that facilitates interchange between registered holding of uncertificated
securities and holding of security entitlements in those securities through DTC and a DTC participant. Profile is a required feature
of DRS that allows a DTC participant, claiming to act on behalf of an Owner of American Depositary Shares, to direct the Depositary
to register a transfer of those American Depositary Shares to DTC or its nominee and to deliver those American Depositary Shares
to the DTC account of that DTC participant without receipt by the Depositary of prior authorization from the Owner to register
that transfer.
(b)	In connection
with DRS/Profile, the parties acknowledge that the Depositary will not determine whether the DTC participant that is claiming to
be acting on behalf of an Owner in requesting registration of transfer and delivery described in paragraph (a) above has the actual
authority to act on behalf of that Owner (notwithstanding any requirements under the Uniform Commercial Code). For the avoidance
of doubt, the provisions of Sections 5.3 and 5.8 of the Deposit Agreement apply to the matters arising from the use of the DRS/Profile.
The parties agree that the Depositary’s reliance on and compliance with instructions received by the Depositary through the
DRS/Profile system and otherwise in accordance with the Deposit Agreement, shall not constitute negligence or bad faith on the
part of the Depositary.
23.             
APPOINTMENT OF AGENT FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; JURY TRIAL WAIVER; WAIVER OF IMMUNITIES.
In the Deposit Agreement,
the Company has (i) waived personal service of process upon it and consented that any service of process in any suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to the Shares or Deposited Securities, the American Depositary Shares, the Receipts or the Deposit Agreement
may be made by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, directed to the Company at its address last specified for
notices hereunder, and service so made shall be deemed completed ten (10) days after the same shall have been so mailed, (ii) consented
and submitted to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court in the State of New York in which any such suit or proceeding may
be instituted, and (iii) agreed that service of process in the manner specified in the Deposit Agreement shall be deemed in every
respect effective service of process upon the Company in any such suit or proceeding.
EACH PARTY TO THE
DEPOSIT AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, EACH OWNER AND HOLDER) THEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST THE COMPANY AND/OR
THE DEPOSITARY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SHARES OR OTHER DEPOSITED SECURITIES, THE AMERICAN DEPOSITARY
SHARES OR THE RECEIPTS, THE DEPOSIT AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN, OR THE BREACH HEREOF OR THEREOF,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY QUESTION REGARDING EXISTENCE, VALIDITY OR TERMINATION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY
OTHER THEORY).
To the extent that
the Company or any of its properties, assets or revenues may have or hereafter become entitled to, or have attributed to it, any
right of immunity, on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise, from any legal action, suit or proceeding, from the giving of any
relief in any respect thereof, from setoff or counterclaim, from the jurisdiction of any court, from service of process, from attachment
upon or prior to judgment, from attachment in aid of execution or judgment, or other legal process or proceeding for the giving
of any relief or for the enforcement of any judgment, in any jurisdiction in which proceedings may at any time be commenced, with
respect to its obligations, liabilities or any other matter under or arising out of or in connection with the Shares or Deposited
Securities, the American Depositary Shares, the Receipts or the Deposit Agreement, the Company, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to plead or claim, any such immunity and consents to such
relief and enforcement.
24.             
DISCLOSURE OF INTERESTS.
In order to comply
with applicable laws and regulations or the articles of association or similar document of the Company, the Company may from time
to time request each Owner and Holder to provide to the Depositary information relating to: (a) the capacity in which
it holds American Depositary Shares, (b) the identity of any Holders or other persons or entities then or previously
interested in those American Depositary Shares and the nature of those interests and (c) any other matter where disclosure
of such matter is required for that compliance.   Each Owner and Holder agrees to provide all information known to it
in response to a request made pursuant to this Section.  Each Holder consents to the disclosure by the Owner or other
Holder through which it holds American Depositary Shares, directly or indirectly, of all information responsive to a request made
pursuant to this Section relating to that Holder that is known to that Owner or other Holder.  The Depositary agrees

Re:
American Depositary Shares representing ordinary shares of Bid Corporation Limited

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We refer to the registration
statement to be filed on Form F-6 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Registration Statement") by the legal entity
created by the agreement (the "Deposit Agreement") for issuance of American Depositary Shares ("ADSs"), which
may be evidenced by American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs"), representing ordinary shares of Bid Corporation Limited, for
which you propose to act as Depositary.
 
We are of the opinion
that the ADSs covered by the Registration Statement, when issued in accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, will, when
sold, be legally issued and will entitle the holders thereof to the rights specified in the Deposit Agreement and the ADRs.
This opinion may
be used by you as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.
Very truly yours,
/s/ EMMET, MARVIN & MARTIN,
LLP

Sundance Energy Australia Limited Announces ADR Conversion Program






GlobeNewswire



Nov 14, 2016 7:00 AM EST













 




























































 DENVER, Nov. 14, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sundance Energy Australia Limited (ASX:SEA) (NASDAQ:SNDE) ("Sundance" or the "Company"), is a U.S. onshore oil and gas exploration and production company focused in the Eagle Ford and Greater Anadarko Basin. As previously announced, Sundance Energy Australia Limited ("Sundance") maintains a sponsored American Depositary Receipt ("ADR") program with The Bank of New York Mellon ("BNYM").  An ADR is an issued receipt that represents ordinary shares of a company based outside the United States that are held in custody in respect of the ADR program.  The ADRs of Sundance are traded on the NASDAQ market under the symbol "SNDE."  Each ADR represents ownership of 100 (one-hundred) Sundance ordinary shares.  Existing shareholders may consider owning Sundance through ADRs.  Specifically:  Sundance's ADRs trade on a U.S. securities exchange just like other U.S. publicly traded securities.  ADRs are traded and quoted in U.S. dollars and are cleared and transferred in the same manner as U.S. stocks.  After conversion, ADR holders can either set up a direct registration account to become a registered shareholder or hold ADRs through brokers via The Depository Trust Company and become a beneficial shareholder.  Sundance is pleased to announce that no issuance fee for the conversion of ordinary shares into ADRs will be charged by BNYM from November 15, 2016 through December 15, 2016.  For further information regarding the ADRs, including other applicable fees and terms and conditions of the ADRs, please see Sundance's registration statements on Form 8-A12B and Form F-6, each filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available at www.sec .gov .  Should you be interested in converting your ordinary shares into ADRs, please contact:  The Bank of New York Mellon ADR Division 101 Barclay Street, 22 West New York, N.Y.   10286 Violet Pagan Tel: (212) 815-2276 Fax: (212) 571-3050 E-mail: violet.pagan@bnymellon.com  or ADR Desk (212) 815-4245 This communication is for general information purposes only.  Conversion of your shareholding is wholly voluntary. Neither Sundance nor the depositary is providing any advice, recommendation or endorsement with respect to the conversion of shareholdings into ADRs.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities.  The depositary makes certain payments to, and shares revenue with, Sundance from the fees collected from ADR holders as disclosed in Sundance's registration statements on Form 8-A12B and Form F-6 available at  www.sec.gov .  ADRs are not insured by the FDIC or any other government agency, are not deposits or other obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, the depositary and are subject to investment risks. Should you decide not to participate in the ADR program, no action will be required on your part.

This American Depositary Receipt (this Receipt ) is one of a continuing issue of American Depositary Receipts (collectively, the Receipts ), all evidencing rights of like tenor with respect to the Deposited Securities, and all issued or to be issued upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, which shall govern the continuing arrangement by the Depositary with respect to initial deposits as well as the rights of holders and Owners of Receipts subsequent to such deposits. The issuer of the Receipts is deemed to be the legal entity resulting from the agreement herein provided for. The issuance of Receipts against deposits generally may be suspended, or the issuance of Receipts against the deposit of particular Shares may be withheld, if such action is deemed necessary or advisable by the Depositary at any time and from time to time because of any requirements of any government or governmental body or commission or for any other reason. The Depositary assumes no liability with respect to the validity or worth of the Deposited Securities. 2. TRANSFER OF RECEIPTS. Until the surrender of this Receipt in accordance with the terms hereof, the Depositary will maintain an office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, for the registration of Receipts and transfers of Receipts where the Owners of the Receipts may, during regular business hours, inspect the transfer books maintained by the Depositary that list the Owners of the Receipts. The transfer of this Receipt is registrable on the books of the Depositary at its Corporate Trust Office by the holder hereof in person or by duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of this Receipt properly endorsed for transfer or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer and funds sufficient to pay any applicable transfer taxes, and the fees and expenses of the Depositary and upon compliance with such regulations, if any, as the Depositary may establish for such purpose.

The Depositary may close the transfer books at any time or from time to time when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder. 3. PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP OR RESIDENCE. The Depositary may require any holder or Owner of Receipts, or any person presenting securities for deposit against the issuance of Receipts, from time to time, to file such proof of citizenship or residence and to furnish such other information, by affidavit or otherwise, and to execute such certificates and other instruments as may be necessary or proper to comply with any laws or regulations relating to the issuance or transfer of Receipts, the receipt or distribution of dividends or other property, or the taxation thereof or of receipts or deposited securities, and the Depositary may withhold the issuance or registration of transfer of any Receipt or payment of such dividends or delivery of such property from any holder, Owner or other person, as the case may be, who shall fail to file such proofs, certificates or other instruments. 4. TRANSFERABILITY; RECORD-OWNERSHIP. It is a condition of this Receipt and every successive holder and Owner of this Receipt by accepting or holding the same consents and agrees, that title to this Receipt, when properly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer, is transferable by delivery with the same effect as in the case of a negotiable instrument; provided, however, that prior to the due presentation of this Receipt for registration of transfer as above provided, and subject to the provisions of Article 9 below, the Depositary, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, may treat the person in whose name this Receipt is registered on the books of the Depositary as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distribution of dividends and for any other purpose. 5. TAX LIABILITY. The Depositary shall not be liable for any taxes or governmental or other assessments or charges that may become payable in respect of the Deposited Securities, but a ratable part of any and all of the same, whether such tax, assessment or charge becomes payable by reason of any present or future law, statute, charter provision, by-law, regulation or otherwise, shall be payable by the Owner hereof to the Depositary at any time on request. Upon the failure of the holder or Owner of this Receipt to pay any such amount, the Depositary may sell for account of such Owner an amount of the Deposited Securities equal to all or any part of the amount represented by this Receipt, and may apply the proceeds in payment of such obligations, the Owner hereof remaining liable for any deficiency. 6. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Every person presenting Shares for deposit shall be deemed thereby to represent and warrant that such Shares and each certificate, if any, therefor are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, that such Shares were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights of the holders of any securities and that the person making such deposit is duly authorized so to do. Every such person shall also be deemed to represent that the deposit of such securities and the sale of American Depositary Shares representing such Shares by that person in the United States are not restricted under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act of 1933 ). Such representations and warranties shall survive the deposit of such securities and issuance of Receipts. This Receipt is issued subject, and all rights of the holder or Owner hereof are expressly subject, to the terms and conditions set forth on both sides of this Receipt, all of which form a part of the agreement evidenced in this Receipt and to all of which the holder or Owner hereof by accepting this Receipt consents. 7. REPORTS OF ISSUER OF DEPOSITED SECURITIES; VOTING RIGHTS. As of the date of the establishment of the program for issuance of Receipts by the Depositary, the Depositary believed, based on limited investigation, that the issuer of the Deposited Securities either (i) furnished the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission ) with certain public reports and documents required by foreign law or otherwise or (ii) published information in English on its Internet website at  or another electronic information delivery system generally available to the public in its primary trading market, in either case in compliance with Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as in effect and applicable to that issuer at that time. However, the Depositary does not assume any duty to determine if the issuer of the Deposited Securities is complying with the current requirements of Rule 12g3-2 (b) or to take any action if that issuer is not complying with those requirements. The Depositary shall be under no obligation to give notice to the holder or Owner of this Receipt of any meeting of shareholders or of any report of or communication from the issuer of the Deposited Securities, or of any other matter concerning the affairs of such issuer, except as herein expressly provided. The Depositary undertakes to make available for inspection by holders and Owners of the Receipts at its Corporate Trust Office, any reports and communication received from the issuer of the Deposited Securities that are both (i) received by the Depositary as the holder of the Deposited Securities and (ii) made generally available to the holders of the Deposited Securities by the issuer thereof. Such reports and communications will be available in8 the language in which they were received by the Depositary from the issuer of the Deposited Securities, except to the extent, if any, that the Depositary in its sole discretion elects to both (i) translate into English any of such reports or communications that were not in English when received by the Depositary and (ii) make such translations, if any, available for inspection by holders and Owners of the Receipts. The Depositary has no obligation of any kind to translate any of such reports or communications or to make such translation, if any, available for such inspection. The Depositary may, in its discretion, exercise, in any manner, or not exercise, any and all voting rights that may exist in respect of the Deposited Securities. The Depositary may, but assumes no obligation to, notify Owners of an upcoming meeting of holders of Deposited Securities or solicit instructions from Owners as to the exercise of any voting rights with respect to the Deposited Securities. Upon the written request of the Owner of this Receipt and payment to it of any expense involved, the Depositary may, in its sole discretion, but assumes no obligation to, exercise any voting rights with respect to the amount of the Deposited Securities represented by the American Depositary Shares evidenced by this Receipt in accordance with that request. 8. DISTRIBUTIONS. Until the surrender of this Receipt, the Depositary (a) shall distribute or otherwise make available to the Owner hereof, at a time and in such manner as it shall determine, any distributions of cash, Shares or other securities or property (other than subscription or other rights) and (b) may distribute or otherwise make available to the Owner hereof, at a time and in such manner as it shall determine, any distributions of subscription or other rights, in each case received with respect to the amount of Deposited Securities represented hereby, after deduction, or upon payment of the fees and expenses of the Depositary described in Article 13 below, and the withholding of any taxes in respect thereof; provided, however, that the Depositary shall not make any distribution for which it has not received satisfactory assurances, which may be an opinion of United States counsel, that the distribution is registered under, or is exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of, the Securities Act of 1933 or any other applicable law. If the Depositary is not obligated, under the preceding sentence, to distribute or make available a distribution under the preceding sentence, the Depositary may sell such Shares, other securities, subscription or other rights, securities or other property, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of a sale of that kind to the Owners entitled to them, after deduction or upon payment of the fees and expenses of the Depositary described in Article 13 below and the withholding of any taxes in respect thereof. In lieu of distributing fractional American Depositary Shares for distributed Shares or other fractional securities, the Depositary may, in its discretion, sell the amount of securities or property equal to the aggregate of those fractions. In the case of subscription or other rights, the Depositary may, in its discretion, issue warrants for such subscription or other rights and/or seek instructions from the Owner of this Receipt as to the disposition to be made of such subscription or other rights. If the Depositary does not distribute or make available to Owners or sell distributed subscription or other rights, the Depositary shall allow those rights to lapse. Sales of subscription or other rights, securities or other property by the Depositary shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Depositary may deem advisable. If the Depositary shall find in its opinion that any cash distribution is not convertible in its entirety or with respect to the Owners of a portion of the Receipts, on a reasonable basis into U.S. Dollars available to it in the City of New York, or if any required approval or license of any government or agency for such conversion is denied or is not obtainable within a reasonable period, the Depositary may in its discretion make such conversion and distribution in U.S. Dollars to the extent possible, at such time and rates of conversion as the Depositary shall deem appropriate, to the Owners entitled thereto and shall with respect to any such currency not converted or convertible either (i) distribute such foreign currency to the holders entitled thereto or (ii) hold such currency for the respective accounts of such Owners uninvested and without liability for interest thereon, in which case the Depositary may distribute appropriate warrants or other instruments evidencing rights to receive such foreign currency. 9. RECORD DATES ESTABLISHED BY DEPOSITARY. Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable or any distribution other than cash shall be made, or whenever rights shall be offered, with respect to Deposited Securities, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of any meeting of Owners of Deposited Securities, or whenever it is necessary or desirable to determine the Owners of Receipts, the Depositary will fix a record date for the determination of the Owners generally or the Owners of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution or rights, or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or responsible for any other purpose for which the record date was set. 10. CHANGES AFFECTING DEPOSITED SECURITIES. Upon (i) any change in nominal value or any subdivision, combination or any other reclassification of the Deposited Securities, or (ii) any recapitalization, reorganization, sale of assets substantially as an entirety, merger or consolidation affecting the issuer of the Deposited Securities or to which it is a party, or (iii) the redemption by the issuer of the Deposited Securities at any time of any or all of such Deposited Securities (provided the same are subject to redemption), then and in any such case the Depositary shall have the right to exchange or surrender such Deposited Securities and accept and hold hereunder in lieu thereof other shares, securities, cash or property to be issued or delivered in lieu of or in exchange for, or distributed or paid with respect to, such Deposited Securities. Upon any such exchange or surrender, the Depositary shall have the right, in its discretion, to call9 for surrender of this Receipt in exchange (upon payment of fees and expenses of the Depositary) for one or more new Receipts of the same form and tenor as this Receipt, but describing the substituted Deposited Securities. In any such case the Depositary shall have the right to fix a date after which this Receipt shall only entitle the Owner to receive such new Receipt or Receipts. The Depositary shall mail notice of any redemption of Deposited Securities to the Owners of Receipts, provided that in the case of any redemption of less than all of the Deposited Securities, the Depositary shall select in such manner as it shall determine an equivalent number of American Depositary Shares to be redeemed and shall mail notice of redemption only to the Owners of Receipts evidencing those American Depositary Shares. The sole right of the Owners of Receipts evidencing American Depositary Shares designated for redemption after the mailing of such notice of redemption shall be to receive the cash, rights and other property applicable to the same, upon surrender to the Depositary (and upon payment of its fees and expenses) of the Receipts evidencing such American Depositary Shares. 11. LIABILITY OF DEPOSITARY. The Depositary shall not incur any liability to any holder or Owner of this Receipt (i) if by reason of any provisions of any present or future law of the United States of America, any state thereof, or of any other country, or of any governmental or regulatory authority, or by reason of any provision, present or future, of the charter or articles of association or similar governing document of the issuer or of the Deposited Securities, the Depositary shall be prevented, delayed or forbidden from or subjected to any civil or criminal penalty or extraordinary expenses on account of doing or performing any act or thing which by the terms hereof it is provided shall be done or performed, (ii) by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as specified in clause (i) above, in the performance of any act or thing which by the terms of this Receipt it is provided shall or may be done or performed, (iii) by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for herein, (iv) for the inability of any Owner or holder to benefit from any distribution, offering, right or other benefit which is made available to holders of Deposited Securities but is not made available to Owners or holders, (v) for any special, consequential or punitive damages for any breach of the terms of this Receipt or (vi) arising out of any act of God, terrorism or war or any other circumstances beyond its control. The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any requests to vote any Deposited Securities or for the manner or effect of any vote that is cast either with or without the request of any Owner, or for not exercising any right to vote any Deposited Securities. The Depositary does not assume any obligation and shall not be subject to any liability to holders or Owners hereunder other than agreeing to act without negligence or bad faith in the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein. The Depositary shall be under no obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend, any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of any of the Deposited Securities or in respect of the Receipts on behalf of Owners or holders or any other persons. The Depositary shall not be liable for any action or non-action by it in reliance upon the advice of or information from legal counsel, accountants or any other persons believed by it in good faith to be competent to give such advice or information. The Depositary, subject to Article 14 hereof, may itself become the owner of and deal in securities of any class of the issuer of the Deposited Securities and in Receipts of this issue. 12. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT AND SURRENDER OF THIS RECEIPT. The Depositary may at any time terminate the agreement evidenced by this Receipt and all other Receipts by mailing notice of such termination to the Owners of all Receipts then outstanding at their addresses appearing upon the books of the Depositary, at least thirty days prior to the date fixed in such notice for termination. On and after such date of termination the Owner hereof, upon surrender of this Receipt at the Corporate Trust Office of the Depositary, will be entitled to delivery of the amount of the Deposited Securities represented hereby upon the same terms and conditions, and upon payment of a fee at the rates provided herein with respect to the surrender of this Receipt for Deposited Securities and on payment of applicable taxes and charges. The Depositary may convert any dividends received by it in cash after the termination date into U.S. Dollars as herein provided, and after deducting therefrom the fees of the Depositary and referred to herein and any taxes and governmental charges and shall thereafter hold the balance of said dividends for the pro rata benefit of the Owners of the respective Receipts. As to any Receipts not so surrendered within thirty days after such date of termination the Depositary shall thereafter have no obligation with respect to the collection or disbursement of any subsequent dividends or any subscriptions or other rights accruing on the Deposited Securities. After the expiration of three months from such date of termination the Depositary may sell any remaining Deposited Securities in such manner as it may determine, and may thereafter hold uninvested the net proceeds of any such sale or sales together with any dividends received prior to such sale or the U.S. Dollars received on conversion thereof, unsegregated and without liability for any interest thereon, for the pro rata benefit of the Owners of the Receipts that have not theretofore been surrendered for cancellation, such Owners thereupon becoming general creditors of the Depositary with respect to such net proceeds. After making such sale, or if no such sale can be made after the expiration of one year from such date of termination, the Depositary shall be discharged from all obligations whatsoever to the holders and Owners of the Receipts except to make distribution of the net proceeds of sale and of such dividends (after deducting all fees, charges and expenses of the Depositary) or of the Deposited Securities, in case no sale can be made, upon surrender of the Receipts.10 13. CERTAIN FEES AND CHARGES OF THE DEPOSITARY. The Depositary may charge any party depositing or withdrawing Shares, any party transferring or surrendering Receipts, any party to whom Receipts are issued (including issuance pursuant to a stock dividend or stock split or an exchange of stock or distribution pursuant to Articles 8 or 10) or Owners, as applicable, (i) fees for the delivery or surrender of Receipts and deposit or withdrawal of Shares, (ii) fees for distributing cash, Shares or other property received in respect of Deposited Securities, (iii) taxes and other governmental charges, (iv) registration or custodial fees or charges relating to the Shares, (v) cable, telex and facsimile transmission expenses, (vi) foreign currency conversion expenses and fees, (vii) depositary servicing fees and (viii) any other fees or charges incurred by the Depositary or its agents in connection with the Receipt program. The Depositary s fees and charges may differ from those of other depositaries. The Depositary reserves the right to modify, reduce or increase its fees upon thirty (30) days' notice to the Owner hereof. The Depositary will provide, without charge, a copy of its latest schedule of fees and charges to any party requesting it. The Depositary may charge fees for receiving deposits and issuing Receipts, for delivering Deposited Securities against surrendered Receipts, for transfer of Receipts, for splits or combinations of Receipts, for distribution of each cash or other distribution on Deposited Securities, for sales or exercise of rights, or for other services performed hereunder. The Depositary reserves the right to modify, reduce or increase its fees upon thirty (30) days' notice to the Owner hereof. The Depositary will provide, without charge, a copy of its latest fee schedule to any party requesting it. 14. PRE-RELEASE OF RECEIPTS. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Receipt, the Depositary may execute and deliver Receipts prior to the receipt of Shares ( Pre-Release ). The Depositary may deliver Shares upon the receipt and cancellation of Receipts which have been Pre-Released, whether or not such cancellation is prior to the termination of such Pre-Release or the Depositary knows that such Receipt has been Pre-Released. The Depositary may receive Receipts in lieu of Shares in satisfaction of a Pre-Release. Each Pre- Release will be (a) preceded or accompanied by a written representation from the person to whom Receipts or Shares are to be delivered that such person, or its customer, owns the Shares or Receipts to be remitted, as the case may be, (b) at all times fully collateralized with cash or such other collateral as the Depositary deems appropriate, (c) terminable by the Depositary on not more than five (5) business days notice, and (d) subject to such further indemnities and credit regulations as the Depositary deems appropriate. The number of American Depositary Shares which are outstanding at any time as a result of Pre-Releases will not normally exceed thirty percent (30%) of the Shares deposited with the Depositary; provided, however, that the Depositary reserves the right to change or disregard such limit from time to time as it deems appropriate. The Depositary may retain for its own account any compensation received by it in connection with the foregoing. 15. COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. SECURITIES LAWS. Notwithstanding any terms of this Receipt to the contrary, the Depositary will not exercise any rights it has under this Receipt to prevent the withdrawal or delivery of Deposited Securities in a manner which would violate the United States securities laws including, but not limited to, Section 1A(1) of the General Instructions to the Form F-6 Registration Statement, as amended from time to time, under the Securities Act of GOVERNING LAW; VENUE OF ACTIONS; JURY TRIAL WAIVER. This Receipt shall be interpreted and all rights hereunder and provisions hereof shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York. All actions and proceedings brought by any Owner or holder of this Receipt against the Depositary arising out of or relating to the Shares or other Deposited Securities, the American Depositary Shares or the Receipts, or any transaction contemplated herein, shall be litigated only in courts located within the State of New York. EACH OWNER AND HOLDER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST THE DEPOSITARY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SHARES OR OTHER DEPOSITED SECURITIES, THE AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES OR THE RECEIPTS, OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREIN, OR THE BREACH HEREOF, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY QUESTION REGARDING EXISTENCE, VALIDITY OR TERMINATION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). 17. AMENDMENT OF RECEIPTS. The form of the Receipts and the agreement created thereby may at any time and from time to time be amended by the Depositary in any respect which it may deem necessary or desirable. Any amendment which shall prejudice any substantial existing right of Owners shall not become effective as to outstanding Receipts until the expiration of thirty (30) days after notice11 of such amendment shall have been given to the Owners of outstanding Receipts; provided, however, that such thirty (30) days' notice shall in no event be required with respect to any amendment which shall impose or increase any taxes or other governmental charges, registration fees, cable, telex or facsimile transmission costs, delivery costs or other such expenses. Every Owner and holder of a Receipt at the time any amendment so becomes effective shall be deemed, by continuing to hold such Receipt, to consent and agree to such amendment and to be bound by the agreement created by Receipt as amended thereby. In no event shall any amendment impair the right of the Owner of any Receipt to surrender such Receipt and receive therefor the amount of Deposited Securities represented by the American Depositary Shares evidenced thereby, except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law.12 Writer s Direct Dial EXHIBIT 4 EMMET, MARVIN & MARTIN, LLP COUNSELLORS AT LAW 120 Broadway New York, New York (212) (212) Fax: (212) Fax: (212) MADISON AVENUE MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY (973) FAX: (973) WASHINGTON BOULEVARD STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT (203) FAX: (203) The Bank of New York Mellon as Depositary 101 Barclay Street New York, New York, February 16, 2010 Re: Unsponsored American Depositary Receipts for H Shares of Common Stock, of China Minsheng Banking Corp., Ltd.
