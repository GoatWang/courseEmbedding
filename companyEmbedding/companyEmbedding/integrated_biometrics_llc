Integrated Biometrics is pleased to participate in the 3rd Annual ID4Africa: Pathways to Digital Identity April 26-28, 2017 in Windhoek, Namibia. Visit us at Booth B16! For more information on this event, visit www.id4africa.com/2017-2/
Integrated Biometrics is proud to have been able to support ID4Africa 2016 in Kigali, Rwanda through sponsorship and exhibition of our industry-leading mobile fingerprint scanners. This year’s version of the annual event attracted a record number of delegates from government identity authorities, technology producers, and development agencies looking to leverage biometric technologies to advance social and economic growth. The combined Exposition and Forum format created numerous opportunities for interaction among identity authorities, development agencies, and solution providers.
Many Integrated Biometrics products were sought-after by ID4Africa attendees, including the FAP 30 Columbo Single-Finger Scanner; Watson Mini FAP 45 Two-Finger Roll Scanner; and the Kojak FAP 60 10-Print Roll Scanner.
Click the orange links below for information and resources about how Integrated Biometrics is working in Africa to help bring biometrics to the people.
Digital ID systems in Africa – An opinion piece by Integrated Biometrics VP David Gerulski titled, “Africa benefits from biometrics as an identifier” was featured in the industry publication Biometric Update. In the piece, Gerulski examines progress made since the push for biometrics in Africa accelerated after the United Nations (UN) adopted its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Integrated Biometrics fingerprint scanners perfect for African marketplace – Surging economic and population growth across Africa is driving increased demand for mobile biometrics for identity management enrollment and verification by government agencies, international organizations, law enforcement and commercial entities. Integrated Biometrics products such as the Watson Mini, Kojak, and Columbo are building a path to the future.

Q&A: Dr. Joseph Atick – The history of biometrics in Africa is unique, as is its future. As Integrated Biometrics prepares to actively participate in this month’s ID4Africa conference, we caught up with one of the event’s founders, Dr. Joseph Atick, Executive Chairman, ID4Africa & Identity Counsel. Dr. Atick is an identity and biometrics pioneer, and trusted adviser and counsel to governments and international development agencies, helping the world adopt identity technology responsibly and for the common good.

Spotlight: Idversol Integrated Solutions – Integrated Biometrics fast, lightweight, and reliable light emitting sensor (LES) film-based fingerprint scanners are gaining momentum in the African marketplace thanks in large part to our exclusive distributor Idversol Integrated Solutions. Based in Johannesburg, South Africa, Idversol understands the unique needs of the African marketplace and is able to quickly and effectively service new and existing customers.

Mobile Biometrics Use Cases – Governments, social institutions, law enforcement, military, and commercial entities across the world are discovering that Integrated Biometrics’ products are more ideal for mobile environments than silicon or traditional optical sensors. The different ways our enrollment and verification solutions for electronic devices are being used are different and impressive.

Q&A: Jim Seaborn – Jim Seaborn is Integrated Biometrics Vice President of Business Development and is the company’s main contact for the African marketplace. As one might expect, Jim has been busy of late as nations all across the continent are pursuing mobile biometrics solutions to help their citizens build a better tomorrow. Jim is happy to share some of the unique aspects of enrolling and verifying millions of people all across Africa.

SPARTANBURG, S.C. – Integrated Biometrics, the industry leader and innovator in rugged, lightweight biometric fingerprint sensors, stated this week that the company has received more than 2000 orders for its Five-0 FAP50[1] scanner during its first month of availability. In a market where new product success means hundreds of devices, this exceptional level of single-month demand demonstrates enthusiastic market validation for a rugged, mobile FBI Certified 10-finger scanner small enough to fit in a shirt pocket.
“Mobile enrollment and verification provide the must-have capabilities for law enforcement, border control, and commercial identity services,” said Stephen Thies, Chief Executive Officer of Integrated Biometrics. “Our Five-0 is engineered to be the most mobile, reliable, and easy to use 10-finger product available.”

AUTISM APP FOR FIRST RESPONDERS

As a compact, energy-efficient design, Five–0 operates as a standalone or embedded sensor that runs for hours using power from a smartphone while delivering FBI certified images. This powerful, portable solution also provides superior dry finger performance and operates in conditions that limit other technologies, including dirt, heat, cold, and direct sunlight.
Five-0 delivers best in class convenience and accuracy for governments and commercial enterprises. Its unique FAP50 format enables mobile field enrollment and verification in an easy to use and affordable package. The product is ideally suited for integrators around the world who develop biometric solutions to enable identification at the point of contact while reducing the need for fixed location installations.
Initial customers include leading international identity management providers in the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, and Canada, as well as multiple United States Federal agencies and commercial organizations. Integrated Biometrics has expanded its Five-0 production capacity to meet demand.
“We combined our vision and technological leadership with a deep commitment to listening to the market when we produced Five-0,” continued Thies. “We are grateful to our customers for confirming the value in our approach.”
ABOUT INTEGRATED BIOMETRICS
Integrated Biometrics, LLC designs and manufactures FBI-certified fingerprint sensors for identity solutions serving government agencies and commercial markets worldwide. Our technology utilizes a durable, patented, light emitting sensor (LES) film which outperforms traditional prism-based devices in size, power consumption, and usability. These innovative sensors enable organizations to enroll and verify individuals within large populations for use in national ID programs, elections, social services, homeland security, law enforcement, military operations and countless commercial applications. Integrated Biometrics offers the only Appendix F FBI-certified sensors that meet the mobility requirements demanded by end users.
