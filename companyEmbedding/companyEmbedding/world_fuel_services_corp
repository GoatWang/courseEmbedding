World Fuel Services Corporation is a Fortune 100 company that is based in Miami, Florida. It provides marketing and financing of aviation, marine and ground transportation fuel products and related services to commercial and corporate aircraft, petroleum distributors and ships at more than 3,500 locations around the world.
History[edit]
In 1985, Paul Stebbins and Michael Kasbar founded Trans-Tec Services, Inc., a marine fuel brokerage company. It was headquartered in New York City. Over the next 10 years they grew the company and built a global network of offices. In 1995, Stebbins and Kasbar sold Trans-Tec to International Recovery Corporation.
International Recovery Corporation was founded in Miami in 1984 and went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:INT) in 1986. The company changed its name to World Fuel Services Corporation after acquiring Trans-Tec. Stebbins and Kasbar served as members of the board of directors and managed the marine business, prior to taking on the corporate positions they hold today.[2] Since 2008, the company has made a series of acquisitions in its principal field, and related fields such as the ground fuel market and energy management.[3][4]
In 2013, the company was named as a co-defendant in various lawsuits as owner of Bakken formation light crude oil aboard a Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway train which derailed in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec on July 6, 2013, killing an estimated forty-seven people and destroying much of the community's downtown.[5]

      Excluding the impact of one-time acquisition related expenses and 
      amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $4 million 
      and $9 million respectively, the transactions are expected to be $0.22 
      to $0.26 accretive to earnings on a Non-GAAP basis in the first twelve 
      months.
    

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      This press release includes selected financial information that has not 
      been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
      accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Specifically, we have used 
      non-GAAP accretion to earnings per share, which excludes one-time 
      acquisition-related expenses and amortization of acquired intangible 
      assets, primarily because we do not believe they are reflective of the 
      company’s core operating results. We believe that this non-GAAP 
      financial measure, when considered in conjunction with our financial 
      information prepared in accordance with GAAP, is useful to investors to 
      further aid in evaluating the ongoing financial performance of the 
      Company and to provide greater transparency as supplemental information 
      to our GAAP results. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be 
      considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial 
      information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our 
      presentation of non-GAAP accretion may not be comparable to the 
      presentation of such metric by other companies. Investors are encouraged 
      to review the reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to its most 
      directly comparable GAAP financial measure contained in this press 
      release.
    

Information Relating to Forward-Looking Statements


      This release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of 
      the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including 
      statements regarding our expectations about the effect of the 
      acquisitions on our land segment, our commercial and industrial platform 
      and delivery of value-added solutions, as well as the effect of the 
      transaction on our earnings. These forward-looking statements are 
      qualified in their entirety by cautionary statements and risk factor 
      disclosures contained in the company’s Securities and Exchange 
      Commission (“SEC”) filings, including the company’s Annual Report on 
      Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 16, 2016. Actual results may 
      differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to risks and 
      uncertainties, including, but not limited to: our ability to effectively 
      integrate and derive benefits from the acquisitions, our ability to 
      capitalize on new market opportunities, potential liabilities, limited 
      indemnities and the extent of any insurance coverage, the outcome of 
      pending litigation and other proceedings, the impact of quarterly 
      fluctuations in results, the creditworthiness of our customers and 
      counterparties and our ability to collect accounts receivable, 
      environmental and other risks associated with the storage, 
      transportation and delivery of petroleum products, our failure to 
      effectively hedge certain financial risks associated with the use of 
      derivatives, non-performance by counterparties or customers on 
      derivatives contracts, loss of, or reduced sales, to a significant 
      government customer, uninsured losses, the failure of fuel and other 
      products we sell to meet specifications, fluctuations in world oil 
      prices or foreign currency, changes in political, economic, regulatory, 
      or environmental conditions, adverse conditions in the markets or 
      industries in which we or our customers and suppliers operate, the 
      impact of natural disasters, adverse results in legal disputes, 
      unanticipated tax liabilities, our ability to retain and attract senior 
      management and other key employees and other risks detailed from time to 
      time in the company’s SEC filings. New risks emerge from time to time 
      and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors 
      or to assess the impact of such risks on our business. Accordingly, we 
      undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking 
      statements, whether as a result of new information, changes in 
      expectations, future events, or otherwise.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

World Fuel Services Acquires Two Fuel Distributors
Company also bought Pester Marketing in October.

July 7, 2016, 02:31 pm



 



MIAMI — World Fuel Services Corp. closed on its acquisitions of PAPCO Inc. and Associated Petroleum Products Inc. (APP).
PAPCO is headquartered in Virginia Beach, Va., with 150 employees and 2015 revenue of $1 billion, and APP is headquartered in Tacoma, Wash., with 275 employees and 2015 revenue of $600 million. Both are distributors of gasoline, diesel, lubricants, propane and related services in their respective regions.
"We are pleased to welcome the PAPCO and APP teams to the World Fuel Services organization," said Michael J. Kasbar, chairman and CEO of World Fuel Services Corp. "These transactions, combined with our existing World Fuel land segment operations, will serve to further enhance our commercial and industrial platforms to deliver value-added solutions to customers across the United States."

Excluding the impact of one-time acquisition related expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $4 million and $9 million respectively, the transactions are expected to be $0.22 to $0.26 accretive to earnings on a Non-GAAP basis in the first 12 months.
In October, World Fuel Services purchased 100 percent of the equity securities of Pester Marketing Co. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Alta Fuels LLC and Alta Transportation LLC. Denver-based Pester operated 57 convenience stores and two terminals, and was a distributor of biofuels and lubricants to wholesale, commercial and agricultural customers, as CSNews Online previously reported.
Pester also transported motor fuels to certain Pester retail stores and to the wholesale, commercial and agricultural customers it supplies. Its convenience stores were located in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and New Mexico, primarily under the Alta Convenience brand name.
Miami-based World Fuel Services is a global fuel logistics, transaction management and payment processing company, principally engaged in the distribution of fuel and related products and services in the aviation, marine and land transportation industries.
