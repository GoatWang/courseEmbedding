Helius Medical Technologies, Inc. Key Developments

Helius Medical Technologies and the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Announces Last Subject Enrolled in TBI Registrational Clinical Trial
Jul 13 17
Helius Medical Technologies, Inc. and the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) announced that the last subject has been enrolled in the registrational clinical trial to investigate the safety and effectiveness of the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS™) device for the rehabilitation of chronic balance deficits caused by mild-to-moderate Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). The trial is intended to serve as the basis for Helius to submit applications for marketing clearance in the United States, Canada and Europe for the PoNS™ device. The trial, “a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study of the safety and effectiveness of the PoNS device for cranial nerve noninvasive neuromodulation (CN-NINM) training in subjects with a chronic balance deficit due to mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (mTBI),” was conducted at seven sites in the U.S. and Canada: Oregon Health and Science University in Portland OR, Montreal Neurofeedback Center in Montreal, QB, Orlando Regional Medical Center in Orlando, FL, HealthTech Connex Inc. in Surrey, BC, MedStar National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington D.C., Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA and the University of Wisconsin in Madison, WI. A total of 120 subjects have been enrolled in the trial and the primary endpoint, at five-weeks, is improvement in chronic balance deficit as analyzed by the NeuroCom Balance Manager - Sensory Organization Test (SOT). The SOT test is a six-condition assessment that identifies abnormalities in a patient’s use of the three systems that contribute to balance: somatosensory, visual, and vestibular. In addition, the registrational clinical trial included a wide-range of secondary outcome measures for evaluation.

	Developer of the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS

	TM

	)
	Therapy




	Helius Medical Technologies is a United States-based medical device company developing and commercializing the PoNS

	TM

	Therapy platform, a powerful wearable direct current stimulation technology to treat movement and gait disorders in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and chronic neurological disease. The
	first targeted application of the PoNS

	TM

	is for balance disorder tied to mild to moderate TBI. The US neurostimulation device market is forecast to grow to $4 billion in 2018.



	Features of the PoNS

	TM

	therapy platform:



	 




	 


	


	 


	Proprietary non-invasive wearable platform for treating symptoms of neurological disease or trauma;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Direct impulses delivered to the brain and brainstem via disposable arrays placed on the tongue (razor blade), powered by wearable pulse generator (razor);




	 




	 


	


	 


	The mild to moderate TBI trial with PoNS

	TM

	Therapy was deemed a non-significant risk trial by the FDA; we expect to report on results of this trial in early 2H2017;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Class II regulatory process (120-day timeline from submission to FDA decision), with expected regulatory clearance in 1H2018;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Pilot studies support motor and gait disturbance correction, across a range of neurological conditions, including Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Cerebral Palsy (CP);




	 




	 


	


	 


	Reimbursement framework for physical and cognitive therapy portion of treatment in place with commercial and government payers;




	 




	 


	


	 


	Protected by over 40 patents including proprietary medical methods (5), as well as design and utility of therapeutic delivery mechanisms (35);




	 




	 


	


	 


	Potential opportunity for human performance improvement applications post medical therapy development.





	Company Highlights:



	Helius is led by an experienced
	management team. CEO Phil Deschamps, CFO & COO Joyce LaViscount and CMO Jonathan Sackier each bring over 30+ years of experience in Health Sciences industry with a focus on development and commercialization of healthcare products.


	The company is nearing completion of a 120 patient double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study of the safety and effectiveness of the PoNS

	TM

	device for cranial nerve noninvasive neuromodulation in subjects with a chronic balance deficit due to mild to moderate TBI. The Company plans to submit for FDA, Health Canada and CE Mark and TGA
	regulatory approval of the PoNS

	TM

	device in 2H 2017.


	In addition to over $7 million in grants raised
	by the inventors, the Company has raised $36 million in equity capital since June 2014, and has received $1.8 million in funding from the U.S. Army in support of PoNSTM clinical development, with a further $1 million expected later in 2017.






	The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 in January 2017 establishing a $100 million shelf; $9.5
	million was taken down in the February 2017 registered offering.


	 


	Helius shares are
	currently traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (symbol: HSM) & Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board in the U.S. (symbol: HSDT) with a goal to be listed on a US national securities exchange.


	The Company has received ISO 13485 Certification which permits submission to Health Canada, CE Mark in Europe and TGA in Australia.



	Helius Medicals PoNS Therapy



	 


Click to enlarge


	The PoNS device delivers specially-patterned electrical stimulation developed to mirror nerve impulses to the brain
	through 143-gold-plated electrodes on the mouthpiece which is placed on the tongue;


	Stimulation of the brain and brain-stem via cranial nerve innervation
	of the tongue is hypothesized to encourage neuroplasticity, or a re-routing, enabling the damaged brain to compensate for lost function due to trauma or disease, by recruiting existing working neurons;


	PoNS

	TM

	, when used in combination with specialized physical or cognitive therapy, has been shown to
	improve symptoms of patients with chronic neurological symptoms caused by disease or trauma;


	Relative to most neurological drug and device treatments,
	shorter clinical timelines, fewer study subjects and a shortened regulatory pathway offer relatively lower-cost opportunities to bring new indications to market;


	Key near-term focus is the ongoing FDA registrational trial for PoNS Therapy for the treatment of balance deficit associated with mild to moderate TBI.







	Investment Highlights for Helius Medical Technologies




	One of the few pure-play medical device company in the large and growing neuromodulation market.

	The neuromodulation market is estimated at nearly $6
	billion worldwide by 2020 and is expected to grow in the double digits on a percentage basis annually. Significant industry consolidation by large, diversified medical device companies has left few pure-play companies developing and commercializing
	novel therapies. Differentiated technologies like the PoNS

	TM

	device capture market share relatively quickly post-launch.



	Helius has a number of compelling milestones.

	The company has a goal to have its shares listed on a US national securities exchange, a critical
	component in potentially broadening the US institutional investor base. Data from the 120 patient double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial in TBI is expected to read out in early 2H2017. Assuming FDA clearance, the 510(k)-de Novo to Class II
	device classification could allow for commercial launch as early as 1H2018.



	PoNS

	TM

	Therapy could
	play a unique role in the treatment paradigm for multiple neurological deficits.

	The unique and non-invasive neuromodulation approach, in conjunction with physical or cognitive therapy, as well as pharmacotherapies, could allow for potential
	broad applicability across a range of indications beyond TBI. Positive outcomes with PoNS

	TM

	Therapy could reduce the cost of pharmaceutical and rehabilitation treatments for patients that are
	incurred with todays care plans.


	Flexible business model. If the PoNS

	TM

	Therapy is approved
	for commercialization, the combination of the wearable pulse generator and disposable mouthpiece could result in a recurring revenue stream. The service model is expected to launch in a clinic setting initially, with potential expansion to
	home-based therapy care plan support model, with existing reimbursement for treatment. The de Novo device classification affords for relatively short clinical trials with a small number of subjects, translating to relatively low cost development to
	expand into additional indications.

	


	 


	the Company having incurred losses since its inception and its anticipation that it will continue to incur substantial net losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or sustain profitability;




	 




	 


	


	 


	risks relating to the Company requiring additional financing to carry out its plan of operations;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the Companys independent registered public accounting firm having included an explanatory paragraph relating to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern in its report on the Companys audited
	financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the Companys failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting;




	 




	 


	


	 


	risks related to the Company raising additional capital by issuing securities or through debt financing or licensing arrangements that may cause dilution to existing shareholders, restrict its operations or require the
	Company to relinquish proprietary rights;




	 




	 


	


	 


	risks concerning the Company only having one product candidate, which is still in development, and the Company not having obtained clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the
	

	FDA

	), CE Mark, TGA (Australia) or Health Canada with respect thereto;

	Company will be subject to significant risk of loss of data and proprietary rights and a US$2,000,000 contract penalty payable to A&B pursuant to the Strategic Agreement with A&B;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the risk that the Strategic Agreement with A&B may be terminated;






	 


	


	 


	risks related to the limited market awareness of the Company and its product;






	 


	


	 


	risks related to the neuromodulation market being new and growing but undefined;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the Companys PoNS technology being a new untested form of neurostimulation therapy and the medical community tending to be very conservative in adopting new therapies;




	 




	 


	


	 


	risks related to the Company needing to expand its products beyond its single product by commercializing new product candidates, and the Company not being able to do so in a timely fashion and at expected costs, or at
	all; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	development by others of new or improved devices or products that may result in the Companys present and future products from becoming obsolete.

Helius Medical Technologies Inc. and A&B Company Limited Enter into Strategic Agreement for the Development of PoNSTM Therapy in China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and Singapore | Business Wire
























































Helius Medical Technologies Inc. and A&B Company Limited Enter into 
      Strategic Agreement for the Development of PoNSTM 
      Therapy in China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and Singapore




A&B (HK) Ltd Provides US $7.0M Funding Commitment to Helius Medical 
      Technologies Inc.






October 13, 2015 09:47 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEWTOWN, Pa. & HONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Helius Medical Technologies Inc. (CSE:HSM; OTCQB:HSDT) (“Helius” or the 
      “Company”) announced today that it has entered into strategic agreements 
      with A&B Company Limited (“A&B”) for the development and 
      commercialization of the Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (“PoNS™”) 
      Therapy in China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and Singapore (the 
      “Territories”). A&B is an investment and development company based in 
      Hong Kong owned by Dr. Kong Lam.
    


      The agreement, a sale and licensing transaction, transfers ownership of 
      certain Asian patents, patent applications, and product support material 
      for the PoNSTM device to A&B. A&B assumes all development, 
      patent (both application and defense), future manufacturing, clinical 
      trial, and regulatory approval costs for the Territories. Helius and A&B 
      will share and transfer ownership of any intellectual property or 
      support material (developed by either party) for their respective 
      geographies.
    

      Helius’ PoNSTM device is being investigated for its safety 
      and effectiveness in the treatment of chronic neurological symptoms 
      caused by disease or trauma. In the United States, it is being 
      investigated in a registrational clinical trial for the treatment of 
      balance disorder in patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain 
      injury and the Company expects to submit the PoNSTM to the US 
      Food and Drug Administration (the “US FDA”) for clearance in 2016.
    

      Philippe Deschamps, CEO of Helius, said: “We are very pleased to enter 
      into this collaboration with A&B. Helius believes collaborating with an 
      innovator in Asia will not only accelerate product evolution, but it 
      will also provide us with a partner suited to both expand and defend 
      intellectual property rights in these key markets.”
    

      Commenting on the announcement, Dr. Lam Kong, owner of A&B, said: “It’s 
      a pleasure for A&B to establish a strategic relationship with Helius. 
      There are currently no effective medical devices for the chronic 
      neurological symptoms of traumatic brain injury. Bringing this 
      potentially life changing technology to this significant and underserved 
      market is an exciting prospect for A&B and fits with our vision to 
      provide innovative solutions to those in need.”
    

Highlights:


Helius, as a manufacturer of the PoNS, will receive:


      An ongoing fee relating to the amount paid by A&B for PoNSTM 
      devices and relevant components purchased by A&B from NHC, an affiliate 
      of Helius, or its designated manufacturer for the licensed territories.
    

      A one-time milestone payment once a certain sales milestone is reached.
    

A&B Funding Commitment:


      A&B will provide a US$7.0 mln credit facility. The first US$2.0 mln of 
      this facility will be immediately drawn down and convertible promissory 
      note issued. As agreed, Helius will repay the US $2.0 mln note through 
      the issuance of approximately 2.083 mln shares of Helius at a price of 
      US $0.96/share and approximately 1.042 mln, 3-year, warrants at an 
      exercise price of US $1.44.
    

      Helius, at the Company’s option, can draw down the remaining US $5.0 mln 
      in the facility within six month through issuing additional shares and 
      warrants at a price scheme agreed to by both parties. The facility 
      cannot be cancelled or withdrawn unless there is an event of default by 
      Helius as defined in the document or some material obstacle with regards 
      to the PoNSTM obtaining eventual regulatory approval in the 
      United States.
    

      As long as terms of the credit facility remain competitive Helius 
      intends to, but is not obliged to, draw against the remainder of the 
      credit facility within the next six months to fund PoNSTM 
      continued development.
    

      All securities issues with respect to the credit facility will be 
      subject to a four-month statutory hold period.

AND
 
IN THE MATTER OF 
THE PROCESS FOR 
EXEMPTIVE RELIEF APPLICATIONS IN 
MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS
 
AND
 
IN THE MATTER OF 
HELIUS MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 
(the Filer) 
 
DECISION
 
Background
 
1              The securities regulatory authority or regulator in each of the Jurisdictions (Decision Maker) has received an application from the Filer for a decision under the securities legislation of the Jurisdictions (the Legislation) for an exemption from the prospectus requirement for certain marketing activities not expressly permitted by National Instrument 71-101 The Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (NI 71-101) so that investment dealers acting as underwriters (as defined in the Legislation) or selling group members of (a) the Filer, or (b) a selling securityholder of the Filer are permitted to (i) use Standard Term Sheets (as defined below) and Marketing Materials (as defined below), and (ii) conduct Road Shows (as defined below) in connection with future offerings under a Final MJDS Shelf Prospectus (as defined below) together with applicable supplements as filed by the Filer in each of the provinces of Canada (the Exemption Sought).
 
Under the Process for Exemptive Relief Applications in Multiple Jurisdictions (for a dual application):
 
(a)           the British Columbia Securities Commission is the principal regulator for this application;
 
(b)           the Filer has provided notice that section 4.7(1) of Multilateral Instrument 11-102 Passport System (MI 11-102) is intended to be relied upon in each of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador; and
 
(c)           this decision is the decision of the principal regulator and evidences the decision of the securities regulatory authority or regulator in Ontario.
 
Interpretation
 
2              Terms defined in National Instrument 14-101 Definitions and MI 11-102 have the same meaning if used in this decision, unless otherwise defined.
 
Representations
 
3              This decision is based on the following facts represented by the Filer:
 
1.             the Filer is a corporation continued under the laws of Wyoming;
 
2.             the principal executive offices of the Filer are located at 400-41 University Drive, Newtown, Pennsylvania, 18940;
 
3.             as of the date hereof, the Filer is a reporting issuer in Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador and is an “SEC foreign issuer” as defined under National Instrument 71-102 Continuous Disclosure and Other Exemptions Relating to Foreign Issuers; 
 
4.             the Filer is not in default of the requirements of securities legislation in any of the provinces of Canada;
 
5.             the Filer filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC on December 23, 2016 (the Registration Statement); the Registration Statement contains a preliminary shelf prospectus (the U.S. Shelf Prospectus) and will register for sale in the United States, from time to time, in one or more offerings and pursuant to one or more prospectus supplements, any combination of shares of the Filer’s Class A common stock, debt securities and warrants;
 
6.             the Filer has also filed a final MJDS prospectus dated January 26, 2017 in each of the provinces pursuant to NI 71-101 that includes the final U.S. Shelf Prospectus (the final MJDS prospectus is referred to herein as the Final MJDS Shelf Prospectus), which will qualify the distribution in each province, from time to time, in one or more offerings and pursuant to one or more prospectus supplements, any combination of shares of the Filer’s Class A common stock, debt securities and warrants;
 
7.             National Instrument 44-102 Shelf Distributions (NI 44-102) sets out the requirements for a distribution under a shelf prospectus in Canada, including requirements with respect to advertising and marketing activities; in particular, Part 9A of NI 44-102 entitled Marketing In Connection with Shelf Distributions (Part 9A) permits the conduct of "Road Shows" and the use of "Standard Term Sheets" and "Marketing Materials" (as such terms are defined in National Instrument 41-101 General Prospectus Requirements) following the issuance of a receipt for a final base shelf prospectus provided that the approval, content, use and other applicable conditions and requirements of Part 9A are complied with; NI 71-101 does not contain provisions equivalent to those of Part 9A;
 
8.             in connection with marketing an offering in Canada under the Final MJDS Shelf Prospectus, investment dealers acting as underwriters or selling group members of the Filer may wish to conduct Road Shows and utilize one or more Standard Term Sheets and Marketing Materials; any such Road Shows, Standard Term Sheets and Marketing Materials will comply with the approval, content, use and other conditions and requirements of Part 9A, as though they were applicable; and
 
9.             Canadian purchasers, if any, of securities offered under the Final MJDS Shelf Prospectus will only be able to purchase those securities through an investment dealer registered in the province of residence of the purchaser.
 
Decision
 
4              Each of the Decision Makers is satisfied that the decision meets the test set out in the Legislation for the Decision Maker to make the decision.
 
The decision of the Decision Mkers under the Legislation is that the Exemption Sought is granted in respect of each future distribution under the Final MJDS Shelf Prospectus and applicable supplements provided that in respect of such distribution, the conditions and requirements set out in Part 9A of NI 44-102 for Standard Term Sheets, Marketing Materials and Road Shows are complied with in the manner in which those conditions and requirements would apply if the Final MJDS Shelf Prospectus were a final base shelf prospectus under NI 44-102.

				Clinical Trials			


Over the last few decades, there have been exciting advances in the field of neuromodulation, or the use of external stimulation to intentionally change and regulate the electrochemical environment of the brain.  Helius Medical Technologies (Helius or HMT) is studying the PoNS device to determine whether use of the device, in combination with physical and cognitive therapy, can improve certain neurological symptoms.  It is important to note that the PoNS is an investigational device still in development, and is not cleared or approved for commercial distribution in the United States or Canada.  Helius plans to study the device in the US for mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and is currently studying the device in Canada for multiple sclerosis (MS).  HMT intends to use the results from the planned pivotal, multi-center mTBI study to support an application to FDA for commercial distribution.  Please continue to visit this page often as it is updated regularly to reflect the status of Helius sponsored trials.

 Words to Know








									Electrotactile Stimulation							

Electrotactile stimulation is the process of using a small stimulation electrode to pass a small electric current through the skin, producing controlled, localized touch sensations. This generates an electric field in subcutaneous tissue, which directly excites the afferent nerve fibers (those that direct impulses toward the central nervous system) responsible for normal, mechanical touch sensations. The stimulation is perceived as tingling, pressure, vibration or a pinprick, depending on the electrode and stimulation waveform properties. Depending on the characteristics of the stimulation and the afferent nerves, electrotactile stimulation may directly or indirectly induce neuromodulation.









									Neuromodulation							

Neuromodulation is the use of external stimulation to intentionally change and regulate the electrochemical environment of the brain. Other contemporary forms of neurostimulation aimed at inducing neuromodulation are costly and invasive, with the potential for adverse effects. For example, deep brain stimulation, which uses implanted pacemaker-like electrical devices to decrease tremors in Parkinson’s, carries surgical risks.
PoNS™Therapy couples electrical stimulation with targeted functional therapy, including physical, occupational and cognitive exercises, based on the patient’s deficits. Stimulation is deployed through the tongue using the PoNS™ Device to stimulate two major cranial nerves: the trigeminal (the nerve responsible for sensations in the face, biting and chewing) and the facial (the nerve responsible for motor control of most of the muscles of facial expression).









									Neuroplasticity							

Neuromodulation enhances neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to restructure or relearn in response to new experiences, sensory input and functional demands. The process of neuroplasticity underlies all cerebral learning, training and rehabilitation.

Audit Committee Charter
I. Purpose
The purpose of the Audit Committee shall be to assist the Board of Directors of the Company in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to (1) the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, (2) the independent auditor’s qualifications and independence, (3) the performance of the Company’s internal financial controls and audit function and the performance of the independent auditors, and (4) the compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements.
II. Committee Membership

Each member of the Audit Committee shall in the judgment of the Board have the ability to read and understand the Company’s basic financial statements.
One of the members of the Audit Committee shall be a “financial expert” pursuant to the requirements of the SEC and “financially sophisticated” pursuant to the requirements of NYSE MKT.
No director who serves on the audit committee of more than three public corporations other than the Company shall be eligible to serve as a member of the Audit Committee.

The Audit Committee shall have authority to engage independent counsel and other advisers as it deems necessary to carry out its duties. The Audit Committee shall also have authority to obtain advice and assistance from any officer or employee of the Company.
IV. Funding
The Company shall provide appropriate funding, as determined by the Audit Committee, for payment of (i) compensation to the Company’s independent public accountants as well as any other accounting firm engaged to perform audit, review or attest services for the Company, (ii) any independent counsel or other adviser retained by the Audit Committee and (iii) ordinary administrative expenses of the Audit Committee that are necessary or appropriate in carrying out its duties. The Audit Committee shall promptly report to the Board of Directors its engagement of any advisor, including the scope and terms of such engagement.
V. Responsibilities
The Audit Committee shall:

Meet as often as it determines, but not less frequently than as required by the SEC, NYSE MKT or other applicable rule or regulation.
Be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the Company’s independent public accountants and the independent public accountants shall report directly to the Audit Committee.
Ensure receipt of an annual formal written statement from the Company’s independent public accountants delineating all relationships between the independent public accountants and the Company and discuss with the independent public accountants any such relationships that may impact the objectivity and independence of the independent public accountants; and take appropriate action to oversee the independence of the independent public accountants.
Assure the regular rotation of the lead audit partner and the concurring partner every five years (with a five year time-out period after rotation), and the regular rotation of other audit partners engaged in the Annual Audit every seven years (with a two year time-out period after rotation), or as otherwise required by law or the rules of the NYSE MKT;
Be responsible for the pre-approval of all audit services and permissible non-audit services to be provided to the Company by the independent public accountants, subject to any exceptions provided in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules of the SEC promulgated thereunder.
Review external and internal audit reports of the Company.
Consult with the independent public accountants, senior management, the internal auditing staff of the Company and such other advisers as the Audit Committee may deem necessary regarding their evaluation of the adequacy of the Company’s “internal controls over financial reporting” and “disclosure controls and procedures” (as such terms are defined by the SEC), and make specific recommendations to the Board of Directors in connection therewith.

The device, when used in combination with physiotherapy, is designed to enhance the brain's ability to compensate for damage due to trauma or disease. The Company's PoNS device is designed to induce cranial nerve non-invasive neuromodulation through an increase in stimulation of the facial and trigeminal nerves, which innervate the tongue. The PoNS device is developed to deliver to the tongue a non-invasive neurostimulation, in a form that induces neuromodulation. The PoNS device is an electrical pulse generator that delivers controlled electrical stimulation to the tongue.
