Terry Swift, Swift Energy's chief executive officer, will assume the role of President.  "On behalf of our employees and the entire leadership team, we want to thank Bruce for his outstanding service to Swift Energy. Throughout his 25 years with the Company, Bruce has served tirelessly and faithfully in a variety of strategic roles which have been critical to our transition to a premier Eagle Ford player," said Terry Swift. "Bruce's leadership and vision have had a lasting impact on our company, mirroring his passion for and dedication to the nation's oil and gas industry as a whole, most notably as a recent Past Chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. We wish him continued success, good health and much happiness in his retirement."  Effective February 16, 2015, Swift Energy's board has appointed Ron Saxton and William A.

Bruce H. Akers served the Perk Administration  as Special Executive Assistant (1975-76) and as Chief of Staff (1976-77) and was one of the mayor's closest advisors.
Vincent C. Campanella, a close friend and advisor to the mayor, served the Perk Administration first as Director of the Office of Budget and Management (1971-76) and then as the city's Law Director (1976-77).
Richard A. Ganim, a close friend of the mayor, campaigned twice for Ralph Perk: first for Cuyahoga County Auditor and then for Cleveland Mayor.

Chief Roughneck Award - Wikipedia





















 






Chief Roughneck Award

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

The Chief Roughneck Award has presented annually since 1955 by U.S. Steel Tubular Products, Inc., a subsidiary of United States Steel Corporation. It honors the highest ideals of the petroleum industry and is awarded to honor the achievements and character of a petroleum executive. Recently it has been presented at the annual meeting of the Independent Petroleum Association of America in San Antonio, Texas.
The bronze Joe Roughneck bust, created by Torg Thompson and presented to each Chief Roughneck recipient, began life in Lone Star Steel Company print advertising.
Joe Roughneck's sculpture has been dedicated in several oil patch parks, saluted by governors, and featured in newspaper and magazine articles.
The award is recognized as one of the most meaningful honors in the industry; the award and the character behind it symbolize the spirit, determination, leadership and integrity of individuals who have made a lasting impression on the energy industry.
