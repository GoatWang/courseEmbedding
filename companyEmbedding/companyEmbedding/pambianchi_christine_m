Pambianchi, Calabrese Promoted at Corning

            CORNING, N.Y., Dec. 6, 2010 —  Corning Inc.’s board of directors announced the recent election of two new senior vice presidents: Christine M. Pambianchi and Dr. Gary S. Calabrese. 

Pambianchi joined the company in 2000 as the division human resource manager for Corning Optical Fiber. She then served as director of human resources for Corning Optical Communications, and then as director of Business Human Resources. In 2004, she was named division vice president of Business Human Resources, and then elected vice president in 2007. Most recently, she became vice president of the company’s human resources function in 2008. 

Calabrese joined the company in 2008 as its vice president, Science & Technology. In November 2009, he took on the additional responsibilities as director of Photovoltaic Glass Technologies. 

The promotions are effective immediately. 

A specialty glass and ceramics provider, Corning Inc.’s products include glass substrates for LCD televisions, computer monitors and laptops; ceramic substrates and filters for mobile emission control systems; optical fiber, cable, hardware and equipment for telecommunications networks; and optical biosensors for drug discovery.
