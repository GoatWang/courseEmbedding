Ambition to Action

From an extensive asset stewardship program to sophisticated screening and integration strategies, we’re helping clients harness the potential of ESG investing and transform their ESG ambitions into action.






Featured Topics






ESG Investing


Aligning Factor and ESG Views

Aligning investment portfolios with views on ESG issues  without compromising effectiveness of factor exposures.

Fearless Girl

Why ESG Really Matters

ESG captures information that’s not readily available on the balance sheet or income statement, providing investors with a more complete picture.


 


The Investment Logic For Sustainability

Sustainability is clearly one of the world's most important goals. Chris McKnett argues that large institutional investors have a big role to play.

We actively engage with companies on a range of important governance and sustainability issues to ensure our portfolios are appropriately focused on long-term value creation.

Once your account reaches $5,000, we switch to 0.25% of your account per year.* (that’s $12.50 a year for a $5,000 portfolio)  How does Stash work?Stash is an SEC registered investment adviser. When you sign up for a Stash account you get access to over 30 different investment options and personalized guidance. To make an investment, you’ll need to connect a checking account. All it takes is $5 to make your first investment. We let you buy fractional shares so you can invest what you can afford. That’s it – sign up, customize your portfolio, and boom, you’re an investor. Learn more about Stash. Why should I start investing now?The sooner you start investing, the greater your chance of benefiting from compound returns. It’s the reason you might not want to put off investing any longer, because it takes time to experience the effect. Here’s why... Let's say you invested $20 a week. After 20 years, your $20,800 investment would be worth over $34,000. (Assuming a 5% compound annual return)Why do you need my Social Security number?The Patriot Act requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person opening an account. We also require your Social Security number to issue you a tax reporting form at the end of the year. Your Social Security number is only used to verify your identity. Stash does not perform a credit check.Is the money invested in my Stash Account protected?Your investments with Stash are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).

Investment fund - Wikipedia






















 






Investment fund

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





The values and performance of collective funds are listed in newspapers


An investment fund is a way of investing money alongside other investors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of a group. These advantages include an ability to:

hire professional investment managers, which may potentially be able to offer better returns and more adequate risk management;
benefit from economies of scale, i.e., lower transaction costs;
increase the asset diversification to reduce some unsystematic risk.

Terminology varies with country but investment funds are often referred to as investment pools, collective investment vehicles, collective investment schemes, managed funds, or simply funds. The regulatory term is undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities, or short collective investment undertaking (cf. Law). An investment fund may be held by the public, such as a mutual fund, exchange-traded fund, special-purpose acquisition company or closed-end fund,[1] or it may be sold only in a private placement, such as a hedge fund or private equity fund.[2] The term also includes specialized vehicles such as collective and common trust funds, which are unique bank-managed funds structured primarily to commingle assets from qualifying pension plans or trusts.[3]
Investment funds are promoted with a wide range of investment aims either targeting specific geographic regions (e.g., emerging markets or Europe) or specified industry sectors (e.g., technology). Depending on the country there is normally a bias towards the domestic market due to familiarity, and the lack of currency risk. Funds are often selected on the basis of these specified investment aims, their past investment performance, and other factors such as fees.

History[edit]
Further information: Economic history of the Dutch Republic and Financial history of the Dutch Republic
The first (recorded) professionally managed investment funds or collective investment schemes, such as mutual funds, were established in the Dutch Republic.[4][5] Amsterdam-based businessman Abraham van Ketwich (also known as Adriaan van Ketwich) is often credited as the originator of the world's first mutual fund.
Law[edit]
The term "collective investment scheme" is a legal concept deriving initially from a set of European Union Directives to regulate mutual fund investment and management. The Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directives 85/611/EEC, as amended by 2001/107/EC and 2001/108/EC (typically known as UCITS for short) created an EU wide structure, so that funds fulfilling its basic regulations could be marketed in any member state. The basic aim of collective investment scheme regulation is that the financial "products" that are sold to the public are sufficiently transparent, with full disclosure about the nature of the terms.[6]
In the United Kingdom, the primary statute is the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, where Part XVII, sections 235 to 284 deal with the requirements for a collective investment scheme to operate. It states in section 235 that a “collective investment scheme” means "any arrangements with respect to property of any description, including money, the purpose or effect of which is to enable persons taking part in the arrangements (whether by becoming owners of the property or any part of it or otherwise) to participate in or receive profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of the property or sums paid out of such profits or income."

Constitution and terminology[edit]
Collective investment vehicles may be formed under company law, by legal trust or by statute. The nature of the vehicle and its limitations are often linked to its constitutional nature and the associated tax rules for the type of structure within a given jurisdiction.
Typically there is:

A fund manager or investment manager who manages the investment decisions.
A fund administrator who manages the trading, reconciliations, valuation and unit pricing.
A board of directors or trustees who safeguards the assets and ensures compliance with laws, regulations and rules.
The shareholders or unitholders who own (or have rights to) the assets and associated income.
A "marketing" or "distribution" company to promote and sell shares/units of the fund.

Please see below for general information on specific forms of vehicles in different jurisdictions.
Net asset value[edit]
The net asset value or NAV is the value of a vehicle's assets minus the value of its liabilities. The method for calculating this varies between vehicle types and jurisdiction and can be subject to complex regulation.[citation needed]
Open-end fund[edit]
An open-end fund is equitably divided into shares which vary in price in direct proportion to the variation in value of the fund's net asset value. Each time money is invested, new shares or units are created to match the prevailing share price; each time shares are redeemed, the assets sold match the prevailing share price. In this way there is no supply or demand created for shares and they remain a direct reflection of the underlying assets.
Closed-end fund[edit]
A closed-end fund issues a limited number of shares (or units) in an initial public offering (or IPO) or through private placement. If shares are issued through an IPO,[citation needed] they are then traded on an exchange or directly through the fund manager to create a secondary market subject to market forces. If demand for the shares is high, they may trade at a premium to net asset value. If demand is low they may trade at a discount to net asset value. Further share (or unit) offerings may be made by the vehicle if demand is high although this may affect the share price.
For listed funds, the added element of market forces tends to amplify the performance of the fund increasing investment risk through increased volatility.
Gearing and leverage[edit]
Some collective investment vehicles have the power to borrow money to make further investments; a process known as gearing or leverage. If markets are growing rapidly this can allow the vehicle to take advantage of the growth to a greater extent than if only the subscribed contributions were invested. However this premise only works if the cost of the borrowing is less than the increased growth achieved. If the borrowing costs are more than the growth achieved a net loss is achieved.
This can greatly increase the investment risk of the fund by increased volatility and exposure to increased capital risk.
Gearing was a major contributory factor in the collapse of the split capital investment trust debacle in the UK in 2002.[7][8][9]
Availability and access[edit]
Collective investment vehicles vary in availability depending on their intended investor base:

Public-availability vehicles—are available to most investors within the jurisdiction they are offered. Some restrictions on age and size of investment may be imposed.[citation needed]
Limited-availability vehicles—are limited by laws, regulations, and/or rules to experienced and/or sophisticated investors and often have high minimum investment requirements.
Private-availability vehicles—may be limited to family members or whomever set up the fund. They are not publicly traded and may be arranged for tax- or estate-planning purposes.

Limited duration[edit]
Some vehicles are designed to have a limited term with enforced redemption of shares or units on a specified date.
Unit or share class[edit]
Many collective investment vehicles split the fund into multiple classes of shares or units. The underlying assets of each class are effectively pooled for the purposes of investment management, but classes typically differ in the fees and expenses paid out of the fund's assets.
These differences are supposed to reflect different costs involved in servicing investors in various classes; for example:

One class may be sold through a stockbroker or financial adviser with an initial commission (front-end load) and might be called retail shares.
Another class may be sold with no commission (load) direct to the public called direct shares.
Still a third class might have a high minimum investment limit and only be open to financial institutions, and called institutional shares.

In some cases, by aggregating regular investments by many individuals, a retirement plan (such as a 401(k) plan) may qualify to purchase "institutional" shares (and gain the benefit of their typically lower expense ratios[citation needed]) even though no members of the plan would qualify individually. These also include Unit Trusts.
Generic information—advantages[edit]
Diversity and risk[edit]
One of the main advantages of collective investment is the reduction in investment risk (capital risk) by diversification. An investment in a single equity may do well, but it may collapse for investment or other reasons (e.g., Marconi). If your money is invested in such a failed holding you could lose your capital. By investing in a range of equities (or other securities) the capital risk is reduced.

The more diversified your capital, the lower the capital risk.

This investment principle is often referred to as spreading risk.
Collective investments by their nature tend to invest in a range of individual securities. However, if the securities are all in a similar type of asset class or market sector then there is a systematic risk that all the shares could be affected by adverse market changes. To avoid this systematic risk investment managers may diversify into different non-perfectly-correlated asset classes. For example, investors might hold their assets in equal parts in equities and fixed income securities.
Reduced dealing costs[edit]
If one investor had to buy a large number of direct investments, the amount this person would be able to invest in each holding is likely to be small. Dealing costs are normally based on the number and size of each transaction, therefore the overall dealing costs would take a large chunk out of the capital (affecting future profits).
Generic information—disadvantages[edit]
Costs[edit]
The fund manager managing the investment decisions on behalf of the investors will of course expect remuneration. This is often taken directly from the fund assets as a fixed percentage each year or sometimes a variable (performance based) fee. If the investor managed their own investments, this cost would be avoided.
Often the cost of advice given by a stockbroker or financial adviser is built into the vehicle. Often referred to as commission or load (in the U.S.) this charge may be applied at the start of the plan or as an ongoing percentage of the fund value each year. While this cost will diminish your returns it could be argued that it reflects a separate payment for an advice service rather than a detrimental feature of collective investment vehicles. Indeed it is often possible to purchase units or shares directly from the providers without bearing this cost.
Lack of choice[edit]
Although the investor can choose the type of fund to invest in, they have no control over the choice of individual holdings that make up the fund.
Loss of owner's rights[edit]
If the investor holds shares directly, he has the right to attend the company's annual general meeting and vote on important matters. Investors in a collective investment vehicle often have none of the rights connected with individual investments within the fund.
Style[edit]
Investment aims and benchmarking[edit]
Each fund has a defined investment goal to describe the remit of the investment manager and to help investors decide if the fund is right for them. The investment aims will typically fall into the broad categories of Income (value) investment or Growth investment. Income or value based investment tends to select stocks with strong income streams, often more established businesses. Growth investment selects stocks that tend to reinvest their income to generate growth. Each strategy has its critics and proponents; some prefer a blend approach using aspects of each.
Funds are often distinguished by asset-based categories such as equity, bonds, property, etc. Also, perhaps most commonly funds are divided by their geographic markets or themes.
Examples

The largest markets—U.S., Japan, Europe, UK and Far East are often divided into smaller funds e.g. US large caps, Japanese smaller companies, European Growth, UK mid caps etc.
Themed funds—Technology, Healthcare, Socially responsible funds.

In most instances whatever the investment aim the fund manager will select an appropriate index or combination of indices to measure its performance against; e.g. FTSE 100. This becomes the benchmark to measure success or failure against.
Active or passive management[edit]
The aim of most funds is to make money by investing in assets to obtain a real return (i.e. better than inflation). The philosophy used to manage the fund's investment vary and two opposing views exist.
Active management—Active managers seek to outperform the market as a whole, by selectively holding securities according to an investment strategy. Therefore they employ dynamic portfolio strategies, buying and selling investments with changing market conditions, based on their belief that particular individual holdings or sections of the market will perform better than others.
Passive management—Passive managers stick to a portfolio strategy determined at outset of the fund and not varied thereafter, aiming to minimize the ongoing costs of maintaining the portfolio. Many passive funds are index funds, which attempt to replicate the performance of a market index by holding securities proportionally to their value in the market as a whole. Another example of passive management is the "buy and hold" method used by many traditional unit investment trusts where the portfolio is fixed from outset.
Additionally, some funds use a hybrid management strategy of enhanced indexing, in which the manager minimizes costs by broadly following a passive indexing strategy, but has the discretion to actively deviate from the index in the hopes of earning modestly higher returns.
An example of active management success

In 1998 Richard Branson (head of Virgin) publicly bet Nicola Horlick (head of SG Asset Management) that her SG UK Growth fund would not beat the FTSE 100 index, nor his Virgin Index Tracker fund over three years, nor achieve its stated aim to beat the index by 2% each year. He lost and paid £6,000 to charity.

Alpha, Beta, R-squared and standard deviation[edit]
When analysing investment performance, statistical measures are often used to compare 'funds'. These statistical measures are often reduced to a single figure representing an aspect of past performance:

Alpha represents the fund's return when the benchmark's return is 0. This shows the fund's performance relative to the benchmark and can demonstrate the value added by the fund manager. The higher the 'alpha' the better the manager. Alpha investment strategies tend to favour stock selection methods to achieve growth.
Beta represents an estimate of how much the fund will move if its benchmark moves by 1 unit. This shows the fund's sensitivity to changes in the market. Beta investment strategies tend to favour asset allocation models to achieve outperformance.
R-squared is a measure of the association between a fund and its benchmark. Values are between 0 and 1. Perfect correlation is indicated by 1, and 0 indicates no correlation. This measure is useful in determining if the fund manager is adding value in their investment choices or acting as a closet tracker mirroring the market and making little difference. For example, an index fund will have an R-squared with its benchmark index very close to 1, indicating close to perfect correlation (the index fund's fees and tracking error prevent the correlation from ever equalling 1).
Standard deviation is a measure of volatility of the fund's performance over a period of time. The higher the figure the greater the variability of the fund's performance. High historical volatility may indicate high future volatility, and therefore increased investment risk in a fund.

Types of risk[edit]
Depending on the nature of the investment, the type of 'investment' risk will vary.
A common concern with any investment is that you may lose the money you invest—your capital. This risk is therefore often referred to as capital risk.
If the assets you invest in are held in another currency there is a risk that currency movements alone may affect the value. This is referred to as currency risk.
Many forms of investment may not be readily salable on the open market (e.g. commercial property) or the market has a small capacity and investments may take time to sell. Assets that are easily sold are termed liquid therefore this type of risk is termed liquidity risk.
Charging structures and fees[edit]
Fee types[edit]
For an open-end fund, there may be an initial charge levied on the purchase of units or shares this covers dealing costs, and commissions paid to intermediaries or salespeople. Typically this fee is a percentage of the investment. Some vehicles waive the initial charge and apply an exit charge instead. This may be gradually disappearing after a number of years. Closed-end funds traded on an exchange are subject to brokerage commissions, in the same manner as a stock trade.
The vehicle will charge an annual management charge or AMC to cover the cost of administering the vehicle and remunerating the investment manager. This may be a flat rate based on the value of the assets or a performance related fee based on a predefined target being achieved.
Different unit/share classes may have different combinations of fees/charges.
Pricing models[edit]
Open-ended vehicles are either dual priced or single priced.
Dual priced vehicles have a buying (offer) price and selling or (bid) price. The buying price is higher than the selling price, this difference is known as the spread or bid-offer spread. The difference is typically 5% and may be varied by the vehicle's manager to reflect changes in the market; the amount of variation may be limited by the vehicles rules or regulatory rules. The difference between the buying and selling price includes initial charge for entering the fund.
The internal workings of a fund are more complicated than this description suggests. The manager sets a price for creation of units/shares and for cancellation. There is a differential between the cancellation and bid prices, and the creation and offer prices. The additional units are created are place in the managers box for future purchasers. When heavy selling occurs units are liquidated from the managers box to protect the existing investors from the increased dealing costs. Adjusting the bid/offer prices closer to the cancellation/creation prices allows the manager to protect the interest of the existing investors in changing market conditions. Most unit trusts are dual priced.
Single priced vehicles notionally have a single price for units/shares and this price is the same if buying or selling. As single prices vehicle can't adjust the difference between the buying and selling price to allow for market conditions another mechanism the dilution levy exists. SICAVs, OEICs and U.S. mutual funds are single priced.
A dilution levy can be charged at the discretion of the fund manager, to offset the cost of market transactions resulting from large un-matched buy or sell orders. For example if the volume of purchases outweigh the volume of sales in a particular trading period the fund manager will have to go to the market to buy more of the assets underlying the fund, incurring a brokerage fee in the process and having an adverse effect on the fund as a whole ("diluting" the fund). The same is the case with large sell orders. A dilution levy is therefore applied where appropriate and paid for by the investor in order that large single transactions do not reduce the value of the fund as a whole.

Greece[edit]
We could say that a mutual fund is a pool of money which belongs to many investors. Otherwise a M/F is the common cashier of many investors who trust a third party to operate and manage their wealth. Moreover they order this third party which in Greece is called A.E.D.A.K. (Mutual Fund Management Company S.A.) to spread their money in many different investment products such as shares, bonds, deposits, repo etc. Those companies in Greece may provide services according to article 4 of Law 3283/2004. People who own units (shares) of a mutual fund are called unitholders. In Greece co-unitholders, which are persons participating in the same units of M/F have exactly the same rights as the unitholder (according to the Law for the deposits in common account 5638/1932). The unitholders have to sign and accept the document which describes the purpose of the Mutual Fund, how it operates, and anything concerning the Fund. This document is the regulation of the M/F. The property of each M/F by law have to be under the control of a bank legally operating in Greece (Greek or foreign). The bank is the custodian of the M/F and except of the custody of the fund also controls the lawfulness of all movements of the management company. The Supervisory and Regulatory Body of M.F. Management Companies and Portfolio Investment Companies is the Greek Capital Market Commission. It comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Economy and controls the operation of all M/Fs available in Greece. All investors have to be very careful and about the risk they undertake. They have to have in mind that all investments have a certain degree of risk. Risk–free investments does not exist. You can find more about Greek Mutual Funds in the site of the Association of Greek Institutional Investors[11] or the site of Greek (Hellenic) Capital Market Commission.[12]

Investment fund

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





The values and performance of collective funds are listed in newspapers


An investment fund is a way of investing money alongside other investors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of a group. These advantages include an ability to:

hire professional investment managers, which may potentially be able to offer better returns and more adequate risk management;
benefit from economies of scale, i.e., lower transaction costs;
increase the asset diversification to reduce some unsystematic risk.

Terminology varies with country but investment funds are often referred to as investment pools, collective investment vehicles, collective investment schemes, managed funds, or simply funds. The regulatory term is undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities, or short collective investment undertaking (cf. Law). An investment fund may be held by the public, such as a mutual fund, exchange-traded fund, special-purpose acquisition company or closed-end fund,[1] or it may be sold only in a private placement, such as a hedge fund or private equity fund.[2] The term also includes specialized vehicles such as collective and common trust funds, which are unique bank-managed funds structured primarily to commingle assets from qualifying pension plans or trusts.[3]
Investment funds are promoted with a wide range of investment aims either targeting specific geographic regions (e.g., emerging markets or Europe) or specified industry sectors (e.g., technology). Depending on the country there is normally a bias towards the domestic market due to familiarity, and the lack of currency risk. Funds are often selected on the basis of these specified investment aims, their past investment performance, and other factors such as fees.

History[edit]
Further information: Economic history of the Dutch Republic and Financial history of the Dutch Republic
The first (recorded) professionally managed investment funds or collective investment schemes, such as mutual funds, were established in the Dutch Republic.[4][5] Amsterdam-based businessman Abraham van Ketwich (also known as Adriaan van Ketwich) is often credited as the originator of the world's first mutual fund.
Law[edit]
The term "collective investment scheme" is a legal concept deriving initially from a set of European Union Directives to regulate mutual fund investment and management. The Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directives 85/611/EEC, as amended by 2001/107/EC and 2001/108/EC (typically known as UCITS for short) created an EU wide structure, so that funds fulfilling its basic regulations could be marketed in any member state. The basic aim of collective investment scheme regulation is that the financial "products" that are sold to the public are sufficiently transparent, with full disclosure about the nature of the terms.[6]
In the United Kingdom, the primary statute is the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, where Part XVII, sections 235 to 284 deal with the requirements for a collective investment scheme to operate. It states in section 235 that a “collective investment scheme” means "any arrangements with respect to property of any description, including money, the purpose or effect of which is to enable persons taking part in the arrangements (whether by becoming owners of the property or any part of it or otherwise) to participate in or receive profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of the property or sums paid out of such profits or income."

Constitution and terminology[edit]
Collective investment vehicles may be formed under company law, by legal trust or by statute. The nature of the vehicle and its limitations are often linked to its constitutional nature and the associated tax rules for the type of structure within a given jurisdiction.
Typically there is:

A fund manager or investment manager who manages the investment decisions.
A fund administrator who manages the trading, reconciliations, valuation and unit pricing.
A board of directors or trustees who safeguards the assets and ensures compliance with laws, regulations and rules.
The shareholders or unitholders who own (or have rights to) the assets and associated income.
A "marketing" or "distribution" company to promote and sell shares/units of the fund.

Please see below for general information on specific forms of vehicles in different jurisdictions.
Net asset value[edit]
The net asset value or NAV is the value of a vehicle's assets minus the value of its liabilities. The method for calculating this varies between vehicle types and jurisdiction and can be subject to complex regulation.[citation needed]
Open-end fund[edit]
An open-end fund is equitably divided into shares which vary in price in direct proportion to the variation in value of the fund's net asset value. Each time money is invested, new shares or units are created to match the prevailing share price; each time shares are redeemed, the assets sold match the prevailing share price. In this way there is no supply or demand created for shares and they remain a direct reflection of the underlying assets.
Closed-end fund[edit]
A closed-end fund issues a limited number of shares (or units) in an initial public offering (or IPO) or through private placement. If shares are issued through an IPO,[citation needed] they are then traded on an exchange or directly through the fund manager to create a secondary market subject to market forces. If demand for the shares is high, they may trade at a premium to net asset value. If demand is low they may trade at a discount to net asset value. Further share (or unit) offerings may be made by the vehicle if demand is high although this may affect the share price.
For listed funds, the added element of market forces tends to amplify the performance of the fund increasing investment risk through increased volatility.
Gearing and leverage[edit]
Some collective investment vehicles have the power to borrow money to make further investments; a process known as gearing or leverage. If markets are growing rapidly this can allow the vehicle to take advantage of the growth to a greater extent than if only the subscribed contributions were invested. However this premise only works if the cost of the borrowing is less than the increased growth achieved. If the borrowing costs are more than the growth achieved a net loss is achieved.
This can greatly increase the investment risk of the fund by increased volatility and exposure to increased capital risk.
Gearing was a major contributory factor in the collapse of the split capital investment trust debacle in the UK in 2002.[7][8][9]
Availability and access[edit]
Collective investment vehicles vary in availability depending on their intended investor base:

Public-availability vehicles—are available to most investors within the jurisdiction they are offered. Some restrictions on age and size of investment may be imposed.[citation needed]
Limited-availability vehicles—are limited by laws, regulations, and/or rules to experienced and/or sophisticated investors and often have high minimum investment requirements.
Private-availability vehicles—may be limited to family members or whomever set up the fund. They are not publicly traded and may be arranged for tax- or estate-planning purposes.

Limited duration[edit]
Some vehicles are designed to have a limited term with enforced redemption of shares or units on a specified date.
Unit or share class[edit]
Many collective investment vehicles split the fund into multiple classes of shares or units. The underlying assets of each class are effectively pooled for the purposes of investment management, but classes typically differ in the fees and expenses paid out of the fund's assets.
These differences are supposed to reflect different costs involved in servicing investors in various classes; for example:

One class may be sold through a stockbroker or financial adviser with an initial commission (front-end load) and might be called retail shares.
Another class may be sold with no commission (load) direct to the public called direct shares.
Still a third class might have a high minimum investment limit and only be open to financial institutions, and called institutional shares.

In some cases, by aggregating regular investments by many individuals, a retirement plan (such as a 401(k) plan) may qualify to purchase "institutional" shares (and gain the benefit of their typically lower expense ratios[citation needed]) even though no members of the plan would qualify individually. These also include Unit Trusts.
Generic information—advantages[edit]
Diversity and risk[edit]
One of the main advantages of collective investment is the reduction in investment risk (capital risk) by diversification. An investment in a single equity may do well, but it may collapse for investment or other reasons (e.g., Marconi). If your money is invested in such a failed holding you could lose your capital. By investing in a range of equities (or other securities) the capital risk is reduced.

The more diversified your capital, the lower the capital risk.

This investment principle is often referred to as spreading risk.
Collective investments by their nature tend to invest in a range of individual securities. However, if the securities are all in a similar type of asset class or market sector then there is a systematic risk that all the shares could be affected by adverse market changes. To avoid this systematic risk investment managers may diversify into different non-perfectly-correlated asset classes. For example, investors might hold their assets in equal parts in equities and fixed income securities.
Reduced dealing costs[edit]
If one investor had to buy a large number of direct investments, the amount this person would be able to invest in each holding is likely to be small. Dealing costs are normally based on the number and size of each transaction, therefore the overall dealing costs would take a large chunk out of the capital (affecting future profits).
Generic information—disadvantages[edit]
Costs[edit]
The fund manager managing the investment decisions on behalf of the investors will of course expect remuneration. This is often taken directly from the fund assets as a fixed percentage each year or sometimes a variable (performance based) fee. If the investor managed their own investments, this cost would be avoided.
Often the cost of advice given by a stockbroker or financial adviser is built into the vehicle. Often referred to as commission or load (in the U.S.) this charge may be applied at the start of the plan or as an ongoing percentage of the fund value each year. While this cost will diminish your returns it could be argued that it reflects a separate payment for an advice service rather than a detrimental feature of collective investment vehicles. Indeed it is often possible to purchase units or shares directly from the providers without bearing this cost.
Lack of choice[edit]
Although the investor can choose the type of fund to invest in, they have no control over the choice of individual holdings that make up the fund.
Loss of owner's rights[edit]
If the investor holds shares directly, he has the right to attend the company's annual general meeting and vote on important matters. Investors in a collective investment vehicle often have none of the rights connected with individual investments within the fund.
Style[edit]
Investment aims and benchmarking[edit]
Each fund has a defined investment goal to describe the remit of the investment manager and to help investors decide if the fund is right for them. The investment aims will typically fall into the broad categories of Income (value) investment or Growth investment. Income or value based investment tends to select stocks with strong income streams, often more established businesses. Growth investment selects stocks that tend to reinvest their income to generate growth. Each strategy has its critics and proponents; some prefer a blend approach using aspects of each.
Funds are often distinguished by asset-based categories such as equity, bonds, property, etc. Also, perhaps most commonly funds are divided by their geographic markets or themes.
Examples

The largest markets—U.S., Japan, Europe, UK and Far East are often divided into smaller funds e.g. US large caps, Japanese smaller companies, European Growth, UK mid caps etc.
Themed funds—Technology, Healthcare, Socially responsible funds.

In most instances whatever the investment aim the fund manager will select an appropriate index or combination of indices to measure its performance against; e.g. FTSE 100. This becomes the benchmark to measure success or failure against.
Active or passive management[edit]
The aim of most funds is to make money by investing in assets to obtain a real return (i.e. better than inflation). The philosophy used to manage the fund's investment vary and two opposing views exist.
Active management—Active managers seek to outperform the market as a whole, by selectively holding securities according to an investment strategy. Therefore they employ dynamic portfolio strategies, buying and selling investments with changing market conditions, based on their belief that particular individual holdings or sections of the market will perform better than others.
Passive management—Passive managers stick to a portfolio strategy determined at outset of the fund and not varied thereafter, aiming to minimize the ongoing costs of maintaining the portfolio. Many passive funds are index funds, which attempt to replicate the performance of a market index by holding securities proportionally to their value in the market as a whole. Another example of passive management is the "buy and hold" method used by many traditional unit investment trusts where the portfolio is fixed from outset.
Additionally, some funds use a hybrid management strategy of enhanced indexing, in which the manager minimizes costs by broadly following a passive indexing strategy, but has the discretion to actively deviate from the index in the hopes of earning modestly higher returns.
An example of active management success

In 1998 Richard Branson (head of Virgin) publicly bet Nicola Horlick (head of SG Asset Management) that her SG UK Growth fund would not beat the FTSE 100 index, nor his Virgin Index Tracker fund over three years, nor achieve its stated aim to beat the index by 2% each year. He lost and paid £6,000 to charity.

Alpha, Beta, R-squared and standard deviation[edit]
When analysing investment performance, statistical measures are often used to compare 'funds'. These statistical measures are often reduced to a single figure representing an aspect of past performance:

Alpha represents the fund's return when the benchmark's return is 0. This shows the fund's performance relative to the benchmark and can demonstrate the value added by the fund manager. The higher the 'alpha' the better the manager. Alpha investment strategies tend to favour stock selection methods to achieve growth.
Beta represents an estimate of how much the fund will move if its benchmark moves by 1 unit. This shows the fund's sensitivity to changes in the market. Beta investment strategies tend to favour asset allocation models to achieve outperformance.
R-squared is a measure of the association between a fund and its benchmark. Values are between 0 and 1. Perfect correlation is indicated by 1, and 0 indicates no correlation. This measure is useful in determining if the fund manager is adding value in their investment choices or acting as a closet tracker mirroring the market and making little difference. For example, an index fund will have an R-squared with its benchmark index very close to 1, indicating close to perfect correlation (the index fund's fees and tracking error prevent the correlation from ever equalling 1).
Standard deviation is a measure of volatility of the fund's performance over a period of time. The higher the figure the greater the variability of the fund's performance. High historical volatility may indicate high future volatility, and therefore increased investment risk in a fund.

Types of risk[edit]
Depending on the nature of the investment, the type of 'investment' risk will vary.
A common concern with any investment is that you may lose the money you invest—your capital. This risk is therefore often referred to as capital risk.
If the assets you invest in are held in another currency there is a risk that currency movements alone may affect the value. This is referred to as currency risk.
Many forms of investment may not be readily salable on the open market (e.g. commercial property) or the market has a small capacity and investments may take time to sell. Assets that are easily sold are termed liquid therefore this type of risk is termed liquidity risk.
Charging structures and fees[edit]
Fee types[edit]
For an open-end fund, there may be an initial charge levied on the purchase of units or shares this covers dealing costs, and commissions paid to intermediaries or salespeople. Typically this fee is a percentage of the investment. Some vehicles waive the initial charge and apply an exit charge instead. This may be gradually disappearing after a number of years. Closed-end funds traded on an exchange are subject to brokerage commissions, in the same manner as a stock trade.
The vehicle will charge an annual management charge or AMC to cover the cost of administering the vehicle and remunerating the investment manager. This may be a flat rate based on the value of the assets or a performance related fee based on a predefined target being achieved.
Different unit/share classes may have different combinations of fees/charges.
Pricing models[edit]
Open-ended vehicles are either dual priced or single priced.
Dual priced vehicles have a buying (offer) price and selling or (bid) price. The buying price is higher than the selling price, this difference is known as the spread or bid-offer spread. The difference is typically 5% and may be varied by the vehicle's manager to reflect changes in the market; the amount of variation may be limited by the vehicles rules or regulatory rules. The difference between the buying and selling price includes initial charge for entering the fund.
The internal workings of a fund are more complicated than this description suggests. The manager sets a price for creation of units/shares and for cancellation. There is a differential between the cancellation and bid prices, and the creation and offer prices. The additional units are created are place in the managers box for future purchasers. When heavy selling occurs units are liquidated from the managers box to protect the existing investors from the increased dealing costs. Adjusting the bid/offer prices closer to the cancellation/creation prices allows the manager to protect the interest of the existing investors in changing market conditions. Most unit trusts are dual priced.
Single priced vehicles notionally have a single price for units/shares and this price is the same if buying or selling. As single prices vehicle can't adjust the difference between the buying and selling price to allow for market conditions another mechanism the dilution levy exists. SICAVs, OEICs and U.S. mutual funds are single priced.
A dilution levy can be charged at the discretion of the fund manager, to offset the cost of market transactions resulting from large un-matched buy or sell orders. For example if the volume of purchases outweigh the volume of sales in a particular trading period the fund manager will have to go to the market to buy more of the assets underlying the fund, incurring a brokerage fee in the process and having an adverse effect on the fund as a whole ("diluting" the fund). The same is the case with large sell orders. A dilution levy is therefore applied where appropriate and paid for by the investor in order that large single transactions do not reduce the value of the fund as a whole.

Greece[edit]
We could say that a mutual fund is a pool of money which belongs to many investors. Otherwise a M/F is the common cashier of many investors who trust a third party to operate and manage their wealth. Moreover they order this third party which in Greece is called A.E.D.A.K. (Mutual Fund Management Company S.A.) to spread their money in many different investment products such as shares, bonds, deposits, repo etc. Those companies in Greece may provide services according to article 4 of Law 3283/2004. People who own units (shares) of a mutual fund are called unitholders. In Greece co-unitholders, which are persons participating in the same units of M/F have exactly the same rights as the unitholder (according to the Law for the deposits in common account 5638/1932). The unitholders have to sign and accept the document which describes the purpose of the Mutual Fund, how it operates, and anything concerning the Fund. This document is the regulation of the M/F. The property of each M/F by law have to be under the control of a bank legally operating in Greece (Greek or foreign). The bank is the custodian of the M/F and except of the custody of the fund also controls the lawfulness of all movements of the management company. The Supervisory and Regulatory Body of M.F. Management Companies and Portfolio Investment Companies is the Greek Capital Market Commission. It comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Economy and controls the operation of all M/Fs available in Greece. All investors have to be very careful and about the risk they undertake. They have to have in mind that all investments have a certain degree of risk. Risk–free investments does not exist. You can find more about Greek Mutual Funds in the site of the Association of Greek Institutional Investors[11] or the site of Greek (Hellenic) Capital Market Commission.[12]

Mutual funds and various other forms of structured finance that still exist today emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries in Holland."

Investment fund

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





The values and performance of collective funds are listed in newspapers


An investment fund is a way of investing money alongside other investors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of a group. These advantages include an ability to:

hire professional investment managers, which may potentially be able to offer better returns and more adequate risk management;
benefit from economies of scale, i.e., lower transaction costs;
increase the asset diversification to reduce some unsystematic risk.

Terminology varies with country but investment funds are often referred to as investment pools, collective investment vehicles, collective investment schemes, managed funds, or simply funds. The regulatory term is undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities, or short collective investment undertaking (cf. Law). An investment fund may be held by the public, such as a mutual fund, exchange-traded fund, special-purpose acquisition company or closed-end fund,[1] or it may be sold only in a private placement, such as a hedge fund or private equity fund.[2] The term also includes specialized vehicles such as collective and common trust funds, which are unique bank-managed funds structured primarily to commingle assets from qualifying pension plans or trusts.[3]
Investment funds are promoted with a wide range of investment aims either targeting specific geographic regions (e.g., emerging markets or Europe) or specified industry sectors (e.g., technology). Depending on the country there is normally a bias towards the domestic market due to familiarity, and the lack of currency risk. Funds are often selected on the basis of these specified investment aims, their past investment performance, and other factors such as fees.

History[edit]
Further information: Economic history of the Dutch Republic and Financial history of the Dutch Republic
The first (recorded) professionally managed investment funds or collective investment schemes, such as mutual funds, were established in the Dutch Republic.[4][5] Amsterdam-based businessman Abraham van Ketwich (also known as Adriaan van Ketwich) is often credited as the originator of the world's first mutual fund.
Law[edit]
The term "collective investment scheme" is a legal concept deriving initially from a set of European Union Directives to regulate mutual fund investment and management. The Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directives 85/611/EEC, as amended by 2001/107/EC and 2001/108/EC (typically known as UCITS for short) created an EU wide structure, so that funds fulfilling its basic regulations could be marketed in any member state. The basic aim of collective investment scheme regulation is that the financial "products" that are sold to the public are sufficiently transparent, with full disclosure about the nature of the terms.[6]
In the United Kingdom, the primary statute is the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, where Part XVII, sections 235 to 284 deal with the requirements for a collective investment scheme to operate. It states in section 235 that a “collective investment scheme” means "any arrangements with respect to property of any description, including money, the purpose or effect of which is to enable persons taking part in the arrangements (whether by becoming owners of the property or any part of it or otherwise) to participate in or receive profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of the property or sums paid out of such profits or income."

Constitution and terminology[edit]
Collective investment vehicles may be formed under company law, by legal trust or by statute. The nature of the vehicle and its limitations are often linked to its constitutional nature and the associated tax rules for the type of structure within a given jurisdiction.
Typically there is:

A fund manager or investment manager who manages the investment decisions.
A fund administrator who manages the trading, reconciliations, valuation and unit pricing.
A board of directors or trustees who safeguards the assets and ensures compliance with laws, regulations and rules.
The shareholders or unitholders who own (or have rights to) the assets and associated income.
A "marketing" or "distribution" company to promote and sell shares/units of the fund.

Please see below for general information on specific forms of vehicles in different jurisdictions.
Net asset value[edit]
The net asset value or NAV is the value of a vehicle's assets minus the value of its liabilities. The method for calculating this varies between vehicle types and jurisdiction and can be subject to complex regulation.[citation needed]
Open-end fund[edit]
An open-end fund is equitably divided into shares which vary in price in direct proportion to the variation in value of the fund's net asset value. Each time money is invested, new shares or units are created to match the prevailing share price; each time shares are redeemed, the assets sold match the prevailing share price. In this way there is no supply or demand created for shares and they remain a direct reflection of the underlying assets.
Closed-end fund[edit]
A closed-end fund issues a limited number of shares (or units) in an initial public offering (or IPO) or through private placement. If shares are issued through an IPO,[citation needed] they are then traded on an exchange or directly through the fund manager to create a secondary market subject to market forces. If demand for the shares is high, they may trade at a premium to net asset value. If demand is low they may trade at a discount to net asset value. Further share (or unit) offerings may be made by the vehicle if demand is high although this may affect the share price.
For listed funds, the added element of market forces tends to amplify the performance of the fund increasing investment risk through increased volatility.
Gearing and leverage[edit]
Some collective investment vehicles have the power to borrow money to make further investments; a process known as gearing or leverage. If markets are growing rapidly this can allow the vehicle to take advantage of the growth to a greater extent than if only the subscribed contributions were invested. However this premise only works if the cost of the borrowing is less than the increased growth achieved. If the borrowing costs are more than the growth achieved a net loss is achieved.
This can greatly increase the investment risk of the fund by increased volatility and exposure to increased capital risk.
Gearing was a major contributory factor in the collapse of the split capital investment trust debacle in the UK in 2002.[7][8][9]
Availability and access[edit]
Collective investment vehicles vary in availability depending on their intended investor base:

Public-availability vehicles—are available to most investors within the jurisdiction they are offered. Some restrictions on age and size of investment may be imposed.[citation needed]
Limited-availability vehicles—are limited by laws, regulations, and/or rules to experienced and/or sophisticated investors and often have high minimum investment requirements.
Private-availability vehicles—may be limited to family members or whomever set up the fund. They are not publicly traded and may be arranged for tax- or estate-planning purposes.

Limited duration[edit]
Some vehicles are designed to have a limited term with enforced redemption of shares or units on a specified date.
Unit or share class[edit]
Many collective investment vehicles split the fund into multiple classes of shares or units. The underlying assets of each class are effectively pooled for the purposes of investment management, but classes typically differ in the fees and expenses paid out of the fund's assets.
These differences are supposed to reflect different costs involved in servicing investors in various classes; for example:

One class may be sold through a stockbroker or financial adviser with an initial commission (front-end load) and might be called retail shares.
Another class may be sold with no commission (load) direct to the public called direct shares.
Still a third class might have a high minimum investment limit and only be open to financial institutions, and called institutional shares.

In some cases, by aggregating regular investments by many individuals, a retirement plan (such as a 401(k) plan) may qualify to purchase "institutional" shares (and gain the benefit of their typically lower expense ratios[citation needed]) even though no members of the plan would qualify individually. These also include Unit Trusts.
Generic information—advantages[edit]
Diversity and risk[edit]
One of the main advantages of collective investment is the reduction in investment risk (capital risk) by diversification. An investment in a single equity may do well, but it may collapse for investment or other reasons (e.g., Marconi). If your money is invested in such a failed holding you could lose your capital. By investing in a range of equities (or other securities) the capital risk is reduced.

The more diversified your capital, the lower the capital risk.

This investment principle is often referred to as spreading risk.
Collective investments by their nature tend to invest in a range of individual securities. However, if the securities are all in a similar type of asset class or market sector then there is a systematic risk that all the shares could be affected by adverse market changes. To avoid this systematic risk investment managers may diversify into different non-perfectly-correlated asset classes. For example, investors might hold their assets in equal parts in equities and fixed income securities.
Reduced dealing costs[edit]
If one investor had to buy a large number of direct investments, the amount this person would be able to invest in each holding is likely to be small. Dealing costs are normally based on the number and size of each transaction, therefore the overall dealing costs would take a large chunk out of the capital (affecting future profits).
Generic information—disadvantages[edit]
Costs[edit]
The fund manager managing the investment decisions on behalf of the investors will of course expect remuneration. This is often taken directly from the fund assets as a fixed percentage each year or sometimes a variable (performance based) fee. If the investor managed their own investments, this cost would be avoided.
Often the cost of advice given by a stockbroker or financial adviser is built into the vehicle. Often referred to as commission or load (in the U.S.) this charge may be applied at the start of the plan or as an ongoing percentage of the fund value each year. While this cost will diminish your returns it could be argued that it reflects a separate payment for an advice service rather than a detrimental feature of collective investment vehicles. Indeed it is often possible to purchase units or shares directly from the providers without bearing this cost.
Lack of choice[edit]
Although the investor can choose the type of fund to invest in, they have no control over the choice of individual holdings that make up the fund.
Loss of owner's rights[edit]
If the investor holds shares directly, he has the right to attend the company's annual general meeting and vote on important matters. Investors in a collective investment vehicle often have none of the rights connected with individual investments within the fund.
Style[edit]
Investment aims and benchmarking[edit]
Each fund has a defined investment goal to describe the remit of the investment manager and to help investors decide if the fund is right for them. The investment aims will typically fall into the broad categories of Income (value) investment or Growth investment. Income or value based investment tends to select stocks with strong income streams, often more established businesses. Growth investment selects stocks that tend to reinvest their income to generate growth. Each strategy has its critics and proponents; some prefer a blend approach using aspects of each.
Funds are often distinguished by asset-based categories such as equity, bonds, property, etc. Also, perhaps most commonly funds are divided by their geographic markets or themes.
Examples

The largest markets—U.S., Japan, Europe, UK and Far East are often divided into smaller funds e.g. US large caps, Japanese smaller companies, European Growth, UK mid caps etc.
Themed funds—Technology, Healthcare, Socially responsible funds.

In most instances whatever the investment aim the fund manager will select an appropriate index or combination of indices to measure its performance against; e.g. FTSE 100. This becomes the benchmark to measure success or failure against.
Active or passive management[edit]
The aim of most funds is to make money by investing in assets to obtain a real return (i.e. better than inflation). The philosophy used to manage the fund's investment vary and two opposing views exist.
Active management—Active managers seek to outperform the market as a whole, by selectively holding securities according to an investment strategy. Therefore they employ dynamic portfolio strategies, buying and selling investments with changing market conditions, based on their belief that particular individual holdings or sections of the market will perform better than others.
Passive management—Passive managers stick to a portfolio strategy determined at outset of the fund and not varied thereafter, aiming to minimize the ongoing costs of maintaining the portfolio. Many passive funds are index funds, which attempt to replicate the performance of a market index by holding securities proportionally to their value in the market as a whole. Another example of passive management is the "buy and hold" method used by many traditional unit investment trusts where the portfolio is fixed from outset.
Additionally, some funds use a hybrid management strategy of enhanced indexing, in which the manager minimizes costs by broadly following a passive indexing strategy, but has the discretion to actively deviate from the index in the hopes of earning modestly higher returns.
An example of active management success

In 1998 Richard Branson (head of Virgin) publicly bet Nicola Horlick (head of SG Asset Management) that her SG UK Growth fund would not beat the FTSE 100 index, nor his Virgin Index Tracker fund over three years, nor achieve its stated aim to beat the index by 2% each year. He lost and paid £6,000 to charity.

Alpha, Beta, R-squared and standard deviation[edit]
When analysing investment performance, statistical measures are often used to compare 'funds'. These statistical measures are often reduced to a single figure representing an aspect of past performance:

Alpha represents the fund's return when the benchmark's return is 0. This shows the fund's performance relative to the benchmark and can demonstrate the value added by the fund manager. The higher the 'alpha' the better the manager. Alpha investment strategies tend to favour stock selection methods to achieve growth.
Beta represents an estimate of how much the fund will move if its benchmark moves by 1 unit. This shows the fund's sensitivity to changes in the market. Beta investment strategies tend to favour asset allocation models to achieve outperformance.
R-squared is a measure of the association between a fund and its benchmark. Values are between 0 and 1. Perfect correlation is indicated by 1, and 0 indicates no correlation. This measure is useful in determining if the fund manager is adding value in their investment choices or acting as a closet tracker mirroring the market and making little difference. For example, an index fund will have an R-squared with its benchmark index very close to 1, indicating close to perfect correlation (the index fund's fees and tracking error prevent the correlation from ever equalling 1).
Standard deviation is a measure of volatility of the fund's performance over a period of time. The higher the figure the greater the variability of the fund's performance. High historical volatility may indicate high future volatility, and therefore increased investment risk in a fund.

Types of risk[edit]
Depending on the nature of the investment, the type of 'investment' risk will vary.
A common concern with any investment is that you may lose the money you invest—your capital. This risk is therefore often referred to as capital risk.
If the assets you invest in are held in another currency there is a risk that currency movements alone may affect the value. This is referred to as currency risk.
Many forms of investment may not be readily salable on the open market (e.g. commercial property) or the market has a small capacity and investments may take time to sell. Assets that are easily sold are termed liquid therefore this type of risk is termed liquidity risk.
Charging structures and fees[edit]
Fee types[edit]
For an open-end fund, there may be an initial charge levied on the purchase of units or shares this covers dealing costs, and commissions paid to intermediaries or salespeople. Typically this fee is a percentage of the investment. Some vehicles waive the initial charge and apply an exit charge instead. This may be gradually disappearing after a number of years. Closed-end funds traded on an exchange are subject to brokerage commissions, in the same manner as a stock trade.
The vehicle will charge an annual management charge or AMC to cover the cost of administering the vehicle and remunerating the investment manager. This may be a flat rate based on the value of the assets or a performance related fee based on a predefined target being achieved.
Different unit/share classes may have different combinations of fees/charges.
Pricing models[edit]
Open-ended vehicles are either dual priced or single priced.
Dual priced vehicles have a buying (offer) price and selling or (bid) price. The buying price is higher than the selling price, this difference is known as the spread or bid-offer spread. The difference is typically 5% and may be varied by the vehicle's manager to reflect changes in the market; the amount of variation may be limited by the vehicles rules or regulatory rules. The difference between the buying and selling price includes initial charge for entering the fund.
The internal workings of a fund are more complicated than this description suggests. The manager sets a price for creation of units/shares and for cancellation. There is a differential between the cancellation and bid prices, and the creation and offer prices. The additional units are created are place in the managers box for future purchasers. When heavy selling occurs units are liquidated from the managers box to protect the existing investors from the increased dealing costs. Adjusting the bid/offer prices closer to the cancellation/creation prices allows the manager to protect the interest of the existing investors in changing market conditions. Most unit trusts are dual priced.
Single priced vehicles notionally have a single price for units/shares and this price is the same if buying or selling. As single prices vehicle can't adjust the difference between the buying and selling price to allow for market conditions another mechanism the dilution levy exists. SICAVs, OEICs and U.S. mutual funds are single priced.
A dilution levy can be charged at the discretion of the fund manager, to offset the cost of market transactions resulting from large un-matched buy or sell orders. For example if the volume of purchases outweigh the volume of sales in a particular trading period the fund manager will have to go to the market to buy more of the assets underlying the fund, incurring a brokerage fee in the process and having an adverse effect on the fund as a whole ("diluting" the fund). The same is the case with large sell orders. A dilution levy is therefore applied where appropriate and paid for by the investor in order that large single transactions do not reduce the value of the fund as a whole.

Greece[edit]
We could say that a mutual fund is a pool of money which belongs to many investors. Otherwise a M/F is the common cashier of many investors who trust a third party to operate and manage their wealth. Moreover they order this third party which in Greece is called A.E.D.A.K. (Mutual Fund Management Company S.A.) to spread their money in many different investment products such as shares, bonds, deposits, repo etc. Those companies in Greece may provide services according to article 4 of Law 3283/2004. People who own units (shares) of a mutual fund are called unitholders. In Greece co-unitholders, which are persons participating in the same units of M/F have exactly the same rights as the unitholder (according to the Law for the deposits in common account 5638/1932). The unitholders have to sign and accept the document which describes the purpose of the Mutual Fund, how it operates, and anything concerning the Fund. This document is the regulation of the M/F. The property of each M/F by law have to be under the control of a bank legally operating in Greece (Greek or foreign). The bank is the custodian of the M/F and except of the custody of the fund also controls the lawfulness of all movements of the management company. The Supervisory and Regulatory Body of M.F. Management Companies and Portfolio Investment Companies is the Greek Capital Market Commission. It comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Economy and controls the operation of all M/Fs available in Greece. All investors have to be very careful and about the risk they undertake. They have to have in mind that all investments have a certain degree of risk. Risk–free investments does not exist. You can find more about Greek Mutual Funds in the site of the Association of Greek Institutional Investors[11] or the site of Greek (Hellenic) Capital Market Commission.[12]

Investment fund

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





The values and performance of collective funds are listed in newspapers


An investment fund is a way of investing money alongside other investors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of a group. These advantages include an ability to:

hire professional investment managers, which may potentially be able to offer better returns and more adequate risk management;
benefit from economies of scale, i.e., lower transaction costs;
increase the asset diversification to reduce some unsystematic risk.

Terminology varies with country but investment funds are often referred to as investment pools, collective investment vehicles, collective investment schemes, managed funds, or simply funds. The regulatory term is undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities, or short collective investment undertaking (cf. Law). An investment fund may be held by the public, such as a mutual fund, exchange-traded fund, special-purpose acquisition company or closed-end fund,[1] or it may be sold only in a private placement, such as a hedge fund or private equity fund.[2] The term also includes specialized vehicles such as collective and common trust funds, which are unique bank-managed funds structured primarily to commingle assets from qualifying pension plans or trusts.[3]
Investment funds are promoted with a wide range of investment aims either targeting specific geographic regions (e.g., emerging markets or Europe) or specified industry sectors (e.g., technology). Depending on the country there is normally a bias towards the domestic market due to familiarity, and the lack of currency risk. Funds are often selected on the basis of these specified investment aims, their past investment performance, and other factors such as fees.

History[edit]
Further information: Economic history of the Dutch Republic and Financial history of the Dutch Republic
The first (recorded) professionally managed investment funds or collective investment schemes, such as mutual funds, were established in the Dutch Republic.[4][5] Amsterdam-based businessman Abraham van Ketwich (also known as Adriaan van Ketwich) is often credited as the originator of the world's first mutual fund.
Law[edit]
The term "collective investment scheme" is a legal concept deriving initially from a set of European Union Directives to regulate mutual fund investment and management. The Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directives 85/611/EEC, as amended by 2001/107/EC and 2001/108/EC (typically known as UCITS for short) created an EU wide structure, so that funds fulfilling its basic regulations could be marketed in any member state. The basic aim of collective investment scheme regulation is that the financial "products" that are sold to the public are sufficiently transparent, with full disclosure about the nature of the terms.[6]
In the United Kingdom, the primary statute is the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, where Part XVII, sections 235 to 284 deal with the requirements for a collective investment scheme to operate. It states in section 235 that a “collective investment scheme” means "any arrangements with respect to property of any description, including money, the purpose or effect of which is to enable persons taking part in the arrangements (whether by becoming owners of the property or any part of it or otherwise) to participate in or receive profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of the property or sums paid out of such profits or income."

Constitution and terminology[edit]
Collective investment vehicles may be formed under company law, by legal trust or by statute. The nature of the vehicle and its limitations are often linked to its constitutional nature and the associated tax rules for the type of structure within a given jurisdiction.
Typically there is:

A fund manager or investment manager who manages the investment decisions.
A fund administrator who manages the trading, reconciliations, valuation and unit pricing.
A board of directors or trustees who safeguards the assets and ensures compliance with laws, regulations and rules.
The shareholders or unitholders who own (or have rights to) the assets and associated income.
A "marketing" or "distribution" company to promote and sell shares/units of the fund.

Please see below for general information on specific forms of vehicles in different jurisdictions.
Net asset value[edit]
The net asset value or NAV is the value of a vehicle's assets minus the value of its liabilities. The method for calculating this varies between vehicle types and jurisdiction and can be subject to complex regulation.[citation needed]
Open-end fund[edit]
An open-end fund is equitably divided into shares which vary in price in direct proportion to the variation in value of the fund's net asset value. Each time money is invested, new shares or units are created to match the prevailing share price; each time shares are redeemed, the assets sold match the prevailing share price. In this way there is no supply or demand created for shares and they remain a direct reflection of the underlying assets.
Closed-end fund[edit]
A closed-end fund issues a limited number of shares (or units) in an initial public offering (or IPO) or through private placement. If shares are issued through an IPO,[citation needed] they are then traded on an exchange or directly through the fund manager to create a secondary market subject to market forces. If demand for the shares is high, they may trade at a premium to net asset value. If demand is low they may trade at a discount to net asset value. Further share (or unit) offerings may be made by the vehicle if demand is high although this may affect the share price.
For listed funds, the added element of market forces tends to amplify the performance of the fund increasing investment risk through increased volatility.
Gearing and leverage[edit]
Some collective investment vehicles have the power to borrow money to make further investments; a process known as gearing or leverage. If markets are growing rapidly this can allow the vehicle to take advantage of the growth to a greater extent than if only the subscribed contributions were invested. However this premise only works if the cost of the borrowing is less than the increased growth achieved. If the borrowing costs are more than the growth achieved a net loss is achieved.
This can greatly increase the investment risk of the fund by increased volatility and exposure to increased capital risk.
Gearing was a major contributory factor in the collapse of the split capital investment trust debacle in the UK in 2002.[7][8][9]
Availability and access[edit]
Collective investment vehicles vary in availability depending on their intended investor base:

Public-availability vehicles—are available to most investors within the jurisdiction they are offered. Some restrictions on age and size of investment may be imposed.[citation needed]
Limited-availability vehicles—are limited by laws, regulations, and/or rules to experienced and/or sophisticated investors and often have high minimum investment requirements.
Private-availability vehicles—may be limited to family members or whomever set up the fund. They are not publicly traded and may be arranged for tax- or estate-planning purposes.

Limited duration[edit]
Some vehicles are designed to have a limited term with enforced redemption of shares or units on a specified date.
Unit or share class[edit]
Many collective investment vehicles split the fund into multiple classes of shares or units. The underlying assets of each class are effectively pooled for the purposes of investment management, but classes typically differ in the fees and expenses paid out of the fund's assets.
These differences are supposed to reflect different costs involved in servicing investors in various classes; for example:

One class may be sold through a stockbroker or financial adviser with an initial commission (front-end load) and might be called retail shares.
Another class may be sold with no commission (load) direct to the public called direct shares.
Still a third class might have a high minimum investment limit and only be open to financial institutions, and called institutional shares.

In some cases, by aggregating regular investments by many individuals, a retirement plan (such as a 401(k) plan) may qualify to purchase "institutional" shares (and gain the benefit of their typically lower expense ratios[citation needed]) even though no members of the plan would qualify individually. These also include Unit Trusts.
Generic information—advantages[edit]
Diversity and risk[edit]
One of the main advantages of collective investment is the reduction in investment risk (capital risk) by diversification. An investment in a single equity may do well, but it may collapse for investment or other reasons (e.g., Marconi). If your money is invested in such a failed holding you could lose your capital. By investing in a range of equities (or other securities) the capital risk is reduced.

The more diversified your capital, the lower the capital risk.

This investment principle is often referred to as spreading risk.
Collective investments by their nature tend to invest in a range of individual securities. However, if the securities are all in a similar type of asset class or market sector then there is a systematic risk that all the shares could be affected by adverse market changes. To avoid this systematic risk investment managers may diversify into different non-perfectly-correlated asset classes. For example, investors might hold their assets in equal parts in equities and fixed income securities.
Reduced dealing costs[edit]
If one investor had to buy a large number of direct investments, the amount this person would be able to invest in each holding is likely to be small. Dealing costs are normally based on the number and size of each transaction, therefore the overall dealing costs would take a large chunk out of the capital (affecting future profits).
Generic information—disadvantages[edit]
Costs[edit]
The fund manager managing the investment decisions on behalf of the investors will of course expect remuneration. This is often taken directly from the fund assets as a fixed percentage each year or sometimes a variable (performance based) fee. If the investor managed their own investments, this cost would be avoided.
Often the cost of advice given by a stockbroker or financial adviser is built into the vehicle. Often referred to as commission or load (in the U.S.) this charge may be applied at the start of the plan or as an ongoing percentage of the fund value each year. While this cost will diminish your returns it could be argued that it reflects a separate payment for an advice service rather than a detrimental feature of collective investment vehicles. Indeed it is often possible to purchase units or shares directly from the providers without bearing this cost.
Lack of choice[edit]
Although the investor can choose the type of fund to invest in, they have no control over the choice of individual holdings that make up the fund.
Loss of owner's rights[edit]
If the investor holds shares directly, he has the right to attend the company's annual general meeting and vote on important matters. Investors in a collective investment vehicle often have none of the rights connected with individual investments within the fund.
Style[edit]
Investment aims and benchmarking[edit]
Each fund has a defined investment goal to describe the remit of the investment manager and to help investors decide if the fund is right for them. The investment aims will typically fall into the broad categories of Income (value) investment or Growth investment. Income or value based investment tends to select stocks with strong income streams, often more established businesses. Growth investment selects stocks that tend to reinvest their income to generate growth. Each strategy has its critics and proponents; some prefer a blend approach using aspects of each.
Funds are often distinguished by asset-based categories such as equity, bonds, property, etc. Also, perhaps most commonly funds are divided by their geographic markets or themes.
Examples

The largest markets—U.S., Japan, Europe, UK and Far East are often divided into smaller funds e.g. US large caps, Japanese smaller companies, European Growth, UK mid caps etc.
Themed funds—Technology, Healthcare, Socially responsible funds.

In most instances whatever the investment aim the fund manager will select an appropriate index or combination of indices to measure its performance against; e.g. FTSE 100. This becomes the benchmark to measure success or failure against.
Active or passive management[edit]
The aim of most funds is to make money by investing in assets to obtain a real return (i.e. better than inflation). The philosophy used to manage the fund's investment vary and two opposing views exist.
Active management—Active managers seek to outperform the market as a whole, by selectively holding securities according to an investment strategy. Therefore they employ dynamic portfolio strategies, buying and selling investments with changing market conditions, based on their belief that particular individual holdings or sections of the market will perform better than others.
Passive management—Passive managers stick to a portfolio strategy determined at outset of the fund and not varied thereafter, aiming to minimize the ongoing costs of maintaining the portfolio. Many passive funds are index funds, which attempt to replicate the performance of a market index by holding securities proportionally to their value in the market as a whole. Another example of passive management is the "buy and hold" method used by many traditional unit investment trusts where the portfolio is fixed from outset.
Additionally, some funds use a hybrid management strategy of enhanced indexing, in which the manager minimizes costs by broadly following a passive indexing strategy, but has the discretion to actively deviate from the index in the hopes of earning modestly higher returns.
An example of active management success

In 1998 Richard Branson (head of Virgin) publicly bet Nicola Horlick (head of SG Asset Management) that her SG UK Growth fund would not beat the FTSE 100 index, nor his Virgin Index Tracker fund over three years, nor achieve its stated aim to beat the index by 2% each year. He lost and paid £6,000 to charity.

Alpha, Beta, R-squared and standard deviation[edit]
When analysing investment performance, statistical measures are often used to compare 'funds'. These statistical measures are often reduced to a single figure representing an aspect of past performance:

Alpha represents the fund's return when the benchmark's return is 0. This shows the fund's performance relative to the benchmark and can demonstrate the value added by the fund manager. The higher the 'alpha' the better the manager. Alpha investment strategies tend to favour stock selection methods to achieve growth.
Beta represents an estimate of how much the fund will move if its benchmark moves by 1 unit. This shows the fund's sensitivity to changes in the market. Beta investment strategies tend to favour asset allocation models to achieve outperformance.
R-squared is a measure of the association between a fund and its benchmark. Values are between 0 and 1. Perfect correlation is indicated by 1, and 0 indicates no correlation. This measure is useful in determining if the fund manager is adding value in their investment choices or acting as a closet tracker mirroring the market and making little difference. For example, an index fund will have an R-squared with its benchmark index very close to 1, indicating close to perfect correlation (the index fund's fees and tracking error prevent the correlation from ever equalling 1).
Standard deviation is a measure of volatility of the fund's performance over a period of time. The higher the figure the greater the variability of the fund's performance. High historical volatility may indicate high future volatility, and therefore increased investment risk in a fund.

Types of risk[edit]
Depending on the nature of the investment, the type of 'investment' risk will vary.
A common concern with any investment is that you may lose the money you invest—your capital. This risk is therefore often referred to as capital risk.
If the assets you invest in are held in another currency there is a risk that currency movements alone may affect the value. This is referred to as currency risk.
Many forms of investment may not be readily salable on the open market (e.g. commercial property) or the market has a small capacity and investments may take time to sell. Assets that are easily sold are termed liquid therefore this type of risk is termed liquidity risk.
Charging structures and fees[edit]
Fee types[edit]
For an open-end fund, there may be an initial charge levied on the purchase of units or shares this covers dealing costs, and commissions paid to intermediaries or salespeople. Typically this fee is a percentage of the investment. Some vehicles waive the initial charge and apply an exit charge instead. This may be gradually disappearing after a number of years. Closed-end funds traded on an exchange are subject to brokerage commissions, in the same manner as a stock trade.
The vehicle will charge an annual management charge or AMC to cover the cost of administering the vehicle and remunerating the investment manager. This may be a flat rate based on the value of the assets or a performance related fee based on a predefined target being achieved.
Different unit/share classes may have different combinations of fees/charges.
Pricing models[edit]
Open-ended vehicles are either dual priced or single priced.
Dual priced vehicles have a buying (offer) price and selling or (bid) price. The buying price is higher than the selling price, this difference is known as the spread or bid-offer spread. The difference is typically 5% and may be varied by the vehicle's manager to reflect changes in the market; the amount of variation may be limited by the vehicles rules or regulatory rules. The difference between the buying and selling price includes initial charge for entering the fund.
The internal workings of a fund are more complicated than this description suggests. The manager sets a price for creation of units/shares and for cancellation. There is a differential between the cancellation and bid prices, and the creation and offer prices. The additional units are created are place in the managers box for future purchasers. When heavy selling occurs units are liquidated from the managers box to protect the existing investors from the increased dealing costs. Adjusting the bid/offer prices closer to the cancellation/creation prices allows the manager to protect the interest of the existing investors in changing market conditions. Most unit trusts are dual priced.
Single priced vehicles notionally have a single price for units/shares and this price is the same if buying or selling. As single prices vehicle can't adjust the difference between the buying and selling price to allow for market conditions another mechanism the dilution levy exists. SICAVs, OEICs and U.S. mutual funds are single priced.
A dilution levy can be charged at the discretion of the fund manager, to offset the cost of market transactions resulting from large un-matched buy or sell orders. For example if the volume of purchases outweigh the volume of sales in a particular trading period the fund manager will have to go to the market to buy more of the assets underlying the fund, incurring a brokerage fee in the process and having an adverse effect on the fund as a whole ("diluting" the fund). The same is the case with large sell orders. A dilution levy is therefore applied where appropriate and paid for by the investor in order that large single transactions do not reduce the value of the fund as a whole.

Greece[edit]
We could say that a mutual fund is a pool of money which belongs to many investors. Otherwise a M/F is the common cashier of many investors who trust a third party to operate and manage their wealth. Moreover they order this third party which in Greece is called A.E.D.A.K. (Mutual Fund Management Company S.A.) to spread their money in many different investment products such as shares, bonds, deposits, repo etc. Those companies in Greece may provide services according to article 4 of Law 3283/2004. People who own units (shares) of a mutual fund are called unitholders. In Greece co-unitholders, which are persons participating in the same units of M/F have exactly the same rights as the unitholder (according to the Law for the deposits in common account 5638/1932). The unitholders have to sign and accept the document which describes the purpose of the Mutual Fund, how it operates, and anything concerning the Fund. This document is the regulation of the M/F. The property of each M/F by law have to be under the control of a bank legally operating in Greece (Greek or foreign). The bank is the custodian of the M/F and except of the custody of the fund also controls the lawfulness of all movements of the management company. The Supervisory and Regulatory Body of M.F. Management Companies and Portfolio Investment Companies is the Greek Capital Market Commission. It comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Economy and controls the operation of all M/Fs available in Greece. All investors have to be very careful and about the risk they undertake. They have to have in mind that all investments have a certain degree of risk. Risk–free investments does not exist. You can find more about Greek Mutual Funds in the site of the Association of Greek Institutional Investors[11] or the site of Greek (Hellenic) Capital Market Commission.[12]

Investment fund

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





The values and performance of collective funds are listed in newspapers


An investment fund is a way of investing money alongside other investors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of a group. These advantages include an ability to:

hire professional investment managers, which may potentially be able to offer better returns and more adequate risk management;
benefit from economies of scale, i.e., lower transaction costs;
increase the asset diversification to reduce some unsystematic risk.

Terminology varies with country but investment funds are often referred to as investment pools, collective investment vehicles, collective investment schemes, managed funds, or simply funds. The regulatory term is undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities, or short collective investment undertaking (cf. Law). An investment fund may be held by the public, such as a mutual fund, exchange-traded fund, special-purpose acquisition company or closed-end fund,[1] or it may be sold only in a private placement, such as a hedge fund or private equity fund.[2] The term also includes specialized vehicles such as collective and common trust funds, which are unique bank-managed funds structured primarily to commingle assets from qualifying pension plans or trusts.[3]
Investment funds are promoted with a wide range of investment aims either targeting specific geographic regions (e.g., emerging markets or Europe) or specified industry sectors (e.g., technology). Depending on the country there is normally a bias towards the domestic market due to familiarity, and the lack of currency risk. Funds are often selected on the basis of these specified investment aims, their past investment performance, and other factors such as fees.

History[edit]
Further information: Economic history of the Dutch Republic and Financial history of the Dutch Republic
The first (recorded) professionally managed investment funds or collective investment schemes, such as mutual funds, were established in the Dutch Republic.[4][5] Amsterdam-based businessman Abraham van Ketwich (also known as Adriaan van Ketwich) is often credited as the originator of the world's first mutual fund.
Law[edit]
The term "collective investment scheme" is a legal concept deriving initially from a set of European Union Directives to regulate mutual fund investment and management. The Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directives 85/611/EEC, as amended by 2001/107/EC and 2001/108/EC (typically known as UCITS for short) created an EU wide structure, so that funds fulfilling its basic regulations could be marketed in any member state. The basic aim of collective investment scheme regulation is that the financial "products" that are sold to the public are sufficiently transparent, with full disclosure about the nature of the terms.[6]
In the United Kingdom, the primary statute is the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, where Part XVII, sections 235 to 284 deal with the requirements for a collective investment scheme to operate. It states in section 235 that a “collective investment scheme” means "any arrangements with respect to property of any description, including money, the purpose or effect of which is to enable persons taking part in the arrangements (whether by becoming owners of the property or any part of it or otherwise) to participate in or receive profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of the property or sums paid out of such profits or income."

Constitution and terminology[edit]
Collective investment vehicles may be formed under company law, by legal trust or by statute. The nature of the vehicle and its limitations are often linked to its constitutional nature and the associated tax rules for the type of structure within a given jurisdiction.
Typically there is:

A fund manager or investment manager who manages the investment decisions.
A fund administrator who manages the trading, reconciliations, valuation and unit pricing.
A board of directors or trustees who safeguards the assets and ensures compliance with laws, regulations and rules.
The shareholders or unitholders who own (or have rights to) the assets and associated income.
A "marketing" or "distribution" company to promote and sell shares/units of the fund.

Please see below for general information on specific forms of vehicles in different jurisdictions.
Net asset value[edit]
The net asset value or NAV is the value of a vehicle's assets minus the value of its liabilities. The method for calculating this varies between vehicle types and jurisdiction and can be subject to complex regulation.[citation needed]
Open-end fund[edit]
An open-end fund is equitably divided into shares which vary in price in direct proportion to the variation in value of the fund's net asset value. Each time money is invested, new shares or units are created to match the prevailing share price; each time shares are redeemed, the assets sold match the prevailing share price. In this way there is no supply or demand created for shares and they remain a direct reflection of the underlying assets.
Closed-end fund[edit]
A closed-end fund issues a limited number of shares (or units) in an initial public offering (or IPO) or through private placement. If shares are issued through an IPO,[citation needed] they are then traded on an exchange or directly through the fund manager to create a secondary market subject to market forces. If demand for the shares is high, they may trade at a premium to net asset value. If demand is low they may trade at a discount to net asset value. Further share (or unit) offerings may be made by the vehicle if demand is high although this may affect the share price.
For listed funds, the added element of market forces tends to amplify the performance of the fund increasing investment risk through increased volatility.
Gearing and leverage[edit]
Some collective investment vehicles have the power to borrow money to make further investments; a process known as gearing or leverage. If markets are growing rapidly this can allow the vehicle to take advantage of the growth to a greater extent than if only the subscribed contributions were invested. However this premise only works if the cost of the borrowing is less than the increased growth achieved. If the borrowing costs are more than the growth achieved a net loss is achieved.
This can greatly increase the investment risk of the fund by increased volatility and exposure to increased capital risk.
Gearing was a major contributory factor in the collapse of the split capital investment trust debacle in the UK in 2002.[7][8][9]
Availability and access[edit]
Collective investment vehicles vary in availability depending on their intended investor base:

Public-availability vehicles—are available to most investors within the jurisdiction they are offered. Some restrictions on age and size of investment may be imposed.[citation needed]
Limited-availability vehicles—are limited by laws, regulations, and/or rules to experienced and/or sophisticated investors and often have high minimum investment requirements.
Private-availability vehicles—may be limited to family members or whomever set up the fund. They are not publicly traded and may be arranged for tax- or estate-planning purposes.

Limited duration[edit]
Some vehicles are designed to have a limited term with enforced redemption of shares or units on a specified date.
Unit or share class[edit]
Many collective investment vehicles split the fund into multiple classes of shares or units. The underlying assets of each class are effectively pooled for the purposes of investment management, but classes typically differ in the fees and expenses paid out of the fund's assets.
These differences are supposed to reflect different costs involved in servicing investors in various classes; for example:

One class may be sold through a stockbroker or financial adviser with an initial commission (front-end load) and might be called retail shares.
Another class may be sold with no commission (load) direct to the public called direct shares.
Still a third class might have a high minimum investment limit and only be open to financial institutions, and called institutional shares.

In some cases, by aggregating regular investments by many individuals, a retirement plan (such as a 401(k) plan) may qualify to purchase "institutional" shares (and gain the benefit of their typically lower expense ratios[citation needed]) even though no members of the plan would qualify individually. These also include Unit Trusts.
Generic information—advantages[edit]
Diversity and risk[edit]
One of the main advantages of collective investment is the reduction in investment risk (capital risk) by diversification. An investment in a single equity may do well, but it may collapse for investment or other reasons (e.g., Marconi). If your money is invested in such a failed holding you could lose your capital. By investing in a range of equities (or other securities) the capital risk is reduced.

The more diversified your capital, the lower the capital risk.

This investment principle is often referred to as spreading risk.
Collective investments by their nature tend to invest in a range of individual securities. However, if the securities are all in a similar type of asset class or market sector then there is a systematic risk that all the shares could be affected by adverse market changes. To avoid this systematic risk investment managers may diversify into different non-perfectly-correlated asset classes. For example, investors might hold their assets in equal parts in equities and fixed income securities.
Reduced dealing costs[edit]
If one investor had to buy a large number of direct investments, the amount this person would be able to invest in each holding is likely to be small. Dealing costs are normally based on the number and size of each transaction, therefore the overall dealing costs would take a large chunk out of the capital (affecting future profits).
Generic information—disadvantages[edit]
Costs[edit]
The fund manager managing the investment decisions on behalf of the investors will of course expect remuneration. This is often taken directly from the fund assets as a fixed percentage each year or sometimes a variable (performance based) fee. If the investor managed their own investments, this cost would be avoided.
Often the cost of advice given by a stockbroker or financial adviser is built into the vehicle. Often referred to as commission or load (in the U.S.) this charge may be applied at the start of the plan or as an ongoing percentage of the fund value each year. While this cost will diminish your returns it could be argued that it reflects a separate payment for an advice service rather than a detrimental feature of collective investment vehicles. Indeed it is often possible to purchase units or shares directly from the providers without bearing this cost.
Lack of choice[edit]
Although the investor can choose the type of fund to invest in, they have no control over the choice of individual holdings that make up the fund.
Loss of owner's rights[edit]
If the investor holds shares directly, he has the right to attend the company's annual general meeting and vote on important matters. Investors in a collective investment vehicle often have none of the rights connected with individual investments within the fund.
Style[edit]
Investment aims and benchmarking[edit]
Each fund has a defined investment goal to describe the remit of the investment manager and to help investors decide if the fund is right for them. The investment aims will typically fall into the broad categories of Income (value) investment or Growth investment. Income or value based investment tends to select stocks with strong income streams, often more established businesses. Growth investment selects stocks that tend to reinvest their income to generate growth. Each strategy has its critics and proponents; some prefer a blend approach using aspects of each.
Funds are often distinguished by asset-based categories such as equity, bonds, property, etc. Also, perhaps most commonly funds are divided by their geographic markets or themes.
Examples

The largest markets—U.S., Japan, Europe, UK and Far East are often divided into smaller funds e.g. US large caps, Japanese smaller companies, European Growth, UK mid caps etc.
Themed funds—Technology, Healthcare, Socially responsible funds.

In most instances whatever the investment aim the fund manager will select an appropriate index or combination of indices to measure its performance against; e.g. FTSE 100. This becomes the benchmark to measure success or failure against.
Active or passive management[edit]
The aim of most funds is to make money by investing in assets to obtain a real return (i.e. better than inflation). The philosophy used to manage the fund's investment vary and two opposing views exist.
Active management—Active managers seek to outperform the market as a whole, by selectively holding securities according to an investment strategy. Therefore they employ dynamic portfolio strategies, buying and selling investments with changing market conditions, based on their belief that particular individual holdings or sections of the market will perform better than others.
Passive management—Passive managers stick to a portfolio strategy determined at outset of the fund and not varied thereafter, aiming to minimize the ongoing costs of maintaining the portfolio. Many passive funds are index funds, which attempt to replicate the performance of a market index by holding securities proportionally to their value in the market as a whole. Another example of passive management is the "buy and hold" method used by many traditional unit investment trusts where the portfolio is fixed from outset.
Additionally, some funds use a hybrid management strategy of enhanced indexing, in which the manager minimizes costs by broadly following a passive indexing strategy, but has the discretion to actively deviate from the index in the hopes of earning modestly higher returns.
An example of active management success

In 1998 Richard Branson (head of Virgin) publicly bet Nicola Horlick (head of SG Asset Management) that her SG UK Growth fund would not beat the FTSE 100 index, nor his Virgin Index Tracker fund over three years, nor achieve its stated aim to beat the index by 2% each year. He lost and paid £6,000 to charity.

Alpha, Beta, R-squared and standard deviation[edit]
When analysing investment performance, statistical measures are often used to compare 'funds'. These statistical measures are often reduced to a single figure representing an aspect of past performance:

Alpha represents the fund's return when the benchmark's return is 0. This shows the fund's performance relative to the benchmark and can demonstrate the value added by the fund manager. The higher the 'alpha' the better the manager. Alpha investment strategies tend to favour stock selection methods to achieve growth.
Beta represents an estimate of how much the fund will move if its benchmark moves by 1 unit. This shows the fund's sensitivity to changes in the market. Beta investment strategies tend to favour asset allocation models to achieve outperformance.
R-squared is a measure of the association between a fund and its benchmark. Values are between 0 and 1. Perfect correlation is indicated by 1, and 0 indicates no correlation. This measure is useful in determining if the fund manager is adding value in their investment choices or acting as a closet tracker mirroring the market and making little difference. For example, an index fund will have an R-squared with its benchmark index very close to 1, indicating close to perfect correlation (the index fund's fees and tracking error prevent the correlation from ever equalling 1).
Standard deviation is a measure of volatility of the fund's performance over a period of time. The higher the figure the greater the variability of the fund's performance. High historical volatility may indicate high future volatility, and therefore increased investment risk in a fund.

Types of risk[edit]
Depending on the nature of the investment, the type of 'investment' risk will vary.
A common concern with any investment is that you may lose the money you invest—your capital. This risk is therefore often referred to as capital risk.
If the assets you invest in are held in another currency there is a risk that currency movements alone may affect the value. This is referred to as currency risk.
Many forms of investment may not be readily salable on the open market (e.g. commercial property) or the market has a small capacity and investments may take time to sell. Assets that are easily sold are termed liquid therefore this type of risk is termed liquidity risk.
Charging structures and fees[edit]
Fee types[edit]
For an open-end fund, there may be an initial charge levied on the purchase of units or shares this covers dealing costs, and commissions paid to intermediaries or salespeople. Typically this fee is a percentage of the investment. Some vehicles waive the initial charge and apply an exit charge instead. This may be gradually disappearing after a number of years. Closed-end funds traded on an exchange are subject to brokerage commissions, in the same manner as a stock trade.
The vehicle will charge an annual management charge or AMC to cover the cost of administering the vehicle and remunerating the investment manager. This may be a flat rate based on the value of the assets or a performance related fee based on a predefined target being achieved.
Different unit/share classes may have different combinations of fees/charges.
Pricing models[edit]
Open-ended vehicles are either dual priced or single priced.
Dual priced vehicles have a buying (offer) price and selling or (bid) price. The buying price is higher than the selling price, this difference is known as the spread or bid-offer spread. The difference is typically 5% and may be varied by the vehicle's manager to reflect changes in the market; the amount of variation may be limited by the vehicles rules or regulatory rules. The difference between the buying and selling price includes initial charge for entering the fund.
The internal workings of a fund are more complicated than this description suggests. The manager sets a price for creation of units/shares and for cancellation. There is a differential between the cancellation and bid prices, and the creation and offer prices. The additional units are created are place in the managers box for future purchasers. When heavy selling occurs units are liquidated from the managers box to protect the existing investors from the increased dealing costs. Adjusting the bid/offer prices closer to the cancellation/creation prices allows the manager to protect the interest of the existing investors in changing market conditions. Most unit trusts are dual priced.
Single priced vehicles notionally have a single price for units/shares and this price is the same if buying or selling. As single prices vehicle can't adjust the difference between the buying and selling price to allow for market conditions another mechanism the dilution levy exists. SICAVs, OEICs and U.S. mutual funds are single priced.
A dilution levy can be charged at the discretion of the fund manager, to offset the cost of market transactions resulting from large un-matched buy or sell orders. For example if the volume of purchases outweigh the volume of sales in a particular trading period the fund manager will have to go to the market to buy more of the assets underlying the fund, incurring a brokerage fee in the process and having an adverse effect on the fund as a whole ("diluting" the fund). The same is the case with large sell orders. A dilution levy is therefore applied where appropriate and paid for by the investor in order that large single transactions do not reduce the value of the fund as a whole.

Greece[edit]
We could say that a mutual fund is a pool of money which belongs to many investors. Otherwise a M/F is the common cashier of many investors who trust a third party to operate and manage their wealth. Moreover they order this third party which in Greece is called A.E.D.A.K. (Mutual Fund Management Company S.A.) to spread their money in many different investment products such as shares, bonds, deposits, repo etc. Those companies in Greece may provide services according to article 4 of Law 3283/2004. People who own units (shares) of a mutual fund are called unitholders. In Greece co-unitholders, which are persons participating in the same units of M/F have exactly the same rights as the unitholder (according to the Law for the deposits in common account 5638/1932). The unitholders have to sign and accept the document which describes the purpose of the Mutual Fund, how it operates, and anything concerning the Fund. This document is the regulation of the M/F. The property of each M/F by law have to be under the control of a bank legally operating in Greece (Greek or foreign). The bank is the custodian of the M/F and except of the custody of the fund also controls the lawfulness of all movements of the management company. The Supervisory and Regulatory Body of M.F. Management Companies and Portfolio Investment Companies is the Greek Capital Market Commission. It comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Economy and controls the operation of all M/Fs available in Greece. All investors have to be very careful and about the risk they undertake. They have to have in mind that all investments have a certain degree of risk. Risk–free investments does not exist. You can find more about Greek Mutual Funds in the site of the Association of Greek Institutional Investors[11] or the site of Greek (Hellenic) Capital Market Commission.[12]

Investment fund

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





The values and performance of collective funds are listed in newspapers


An investment fund is a way of investing money alongside other investors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of a group. These advantages include an ability to:

hire professional investment managers, which may potentially be able to offer better returns and more adequate risk management;
benefit from economies of scale, i.e., lower transaction costs;
increase the asset diversification to reduce some unsystematic risk.

Terminology varies with country but investment funds are often referred to as investment pools, collective investment vehicles, collective investment schemes, managed funds, or simply funds. The regulatory term is undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities, or short collective investment undertaking (cf. Law). An investment fund may be held by the public, such as a mutual fund, exchange-traded fund, special-purpose acquisition company or closed-end fund,[1] or it may be sold only in a private placement, such as a hedge fund or private equity fund.[2] The term also includes specialized vehicles such as collective and common trust funds, which are unique bank-managed funds structured primarily to commingle assets from qualifying pension plans or trusts.[3]
Investment funds are promoted with a wide range of investment aims either targeting specific geographic regions (e.g., emerging markets or Europe) or specified industry sectors (e.g., technology). Depending on the country there is normally a bias towards the domestic market due to familiarity, and the lack of currency risk. Funds are often selected on the basis of these specified investment aims, their past investment performance, and other factors such as fees.

History[edit]
Further information: Economic history of the Dutch Republic and Financial history of the Dutch Republic
The first (recorded) professionally managed investment funds or collective investment schemes, such as mutual funds, were established in the Dutch Republic.[4][5] Amsterdam-based businessman Abraham van Ketwich (also known as Adriaan van Ketwich) is often credited as the originator of the world's first mutual fund.
Law[edit]
The term "collective investment scheme" is a legal concept deriving initially from a set of European Union Directives to regulate mutual fund investment and management. The Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directives 85/611/EEC, as amended by 2001/107/EC and 2001/108/EC (typically known as UCITS for short) created an EU wide structure, so that funds fulfilling its basic regulations could be marketed in any member state. The basic aim of collective investment scheme regulation is that the financial "products" that are sold to the public are sufficiently transparent, with full disclosure about the nature of the terms.[6]
In the United Kingdom, the primary statute is the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, where Part XVII, sections 235 to 284 deal with the requirements for a collective investment scheme to operate. It states in section 235 that a “collective investment scheme” means "any arrangements with respect to property of any description, including money, the purpose or effect of which is to enable persons taking part in the arrangements (whether by becoming owners of the property or any part of it or otherwise) to participate in or receive profits or income arising from the acquisition, holding, management or disposal of the property or sums paid out of such profits or income."

Constitution and terminology[edit]
Collective investment vehicles may be formed under company law, by legal trust or by statute. The nature of the vehicle and its limitations are often linked to its constitutional nature and the associated tax rules for the type of structure within a given jurisdiction.
Typically there is:

A fund manager or investment manager who manages the investment decisions.
A fund administrator who manages the trading, reconciliations, valuation and unit pricing.
A board of directors or trustees who safeguards the assets and ensures compliance with laws, regulations and rules.
The shareholders or unitholders who own (or have rights to) the assets and associated income.
A "marketing" or "distribution" company to promote and sell shares/units of the fund.

Please see below for general information on specific forms of vehicles in different jurisdictions.
Net asset value[edit]
The net asset value or NAV is the value of a vehicle's assets minus the value of its liabilities. The method for calculating this varies between vehicle types and jurisdiction and can be subject to complex regulation.[citation needed]
Open-end fund[edit]
An open-end fund is equitably divided into shares which vary in price in direct proportion to the variation in value of the fund's net asset value. Each time money is invested, new shares or units are created to match the prevailing share price; each time shares are redeemed, the assets sold match the prevailing share price. In this way there is no supply or demand created for shares and they remain a direct reflection of the underlying assets.
Closed-end fund[edit]
A closed-end fund issues a limited number of shares (or units) in an initial public offering (or IPO) or through private placement. If shares are issued through an IPO,[citation needed] they are then traded on an exchange or directly through the fund manager to create a secondary market subject to market forces. If demand for the shares is high, they may trade at a premium to net asset value. If demand is low they may trade at a discount to net asset value. Further share (or unit) offerings may be made by the vehicle if demand is high although this may affect the share price.
For listed funds, the added element of market forces tends to amplify the performance of the fund increasing investment risk through increased volatility.
Gearing and leverage[edit]
Some collective investment vehicles have the power to borrow money to make further investments; a process known as gearing or leverage. If markets are growing rapidly this can allow the vehicle to take advantage of the growth to a greater extent than if only the subscribed contributions were invested. However this premise only works if the cost of the borrowing is less than the increased growth achieved. If the borrowing costs are more than the growth achieved a net loss is achieved.
This can greatly increase the investment risk of the fund by increased volatility and exposure to increased capital risk.
Gearing was a major contributory factor in the collapse of the split capital investment trust debacle in the UK in 2002.[7][8][9]
Availability and access[edit]
Collective investment vehicles vary in availability depending on their intended investor base:

Public-availability vehicles—are available to most investors within the jurisdiction they are offered. Some restrictions on age and size of investment may be imposed.[citation needed]
Limited-availability vehicles—are limited by laws, regulations, and/or rules to experienced and/or sophisticated investors and often have high minimum investment requirements.
Private-availability vehicles—may be limited to family members or whomever set up the fund. They are not publicly traded and may be arranged for tax- or estate-planning purposes.

Limited duration[edit]
Some vehicles are designed to have a limited term with enforced redemption of shares or units on a specified date.
Unit or share class[edit]
Many collective investment vehicles split the fund into multiple classes of shares or units. The underlying assets of each class are effectively pooled for the purposes of investment management, but classes typically differ in the fees and expenses paid out of the fund's assets.
These differences are supposed to reflect different costs involved in servicing investors in various classes; for example:

One class may be sold through a stockbroker or financial adviser with an initial commission (front-end load) and might be called retail shares.
Another class may be sold with no commission (load) direct to the public called direct shares.
Still a third class might have a high minimum investment limit and only be open to financial institutions, and called institutional shares.

In some cases, by aggregating regular investments by many individuals, a retirement plan (such as a 401(k) plan) may qualify to purchase "institutional" shares (and gain the benefit of their typically lower expense ratios[citation needed]) even though no members of the plan would qualify individually. These also include Unit Trusts.
Generic information—advantages[edit]
Diversity and risk[edit]
One of the main advantages of collective investment is the reduction in investment risk (capital risk) by diversification. An investment in a single equity may do well, but it may collapse for investment or other reasons (e.g., Marconi). If your money is invested in such a failed holding you could lose your capital. By investing in a range of equities (or other securities) the capital risk is reduced.

The more diversified your capital, the lower the capital risk.

This investment principle is often referred to as spreading risk.
Collective investments by their nature tend to invest in a range of individual securities. However, if the securities are all in a similar type of asset class or market sector then there is a systematic risk that all the shares could be affected by adverse market changes. To avoid this systematic risk investment managers may diversify into different non-perfectly-correlated asset classes. For example, investors might hold their assets in equal parts in equities and fixed income securities.
Reduced dealing costs[edit]
If one investor had to buy a large number of direct investments, the amount this person would be able to invest in each holding is likely to be small. Dealing costs are normally based on the number and size of each transaction, therefore the overall dealing costs would take a large chunk out of the capital (affecting future profits).
Generic information—disadvantages[edit]
Costs[edit]
The fund manager managing the investment decisions on behalf of the investors will of course expect remuneration. This is often taken directly from the fund assets as a fixed percentage each year or sometimes a variable (performance based) fee. If the investor managed their own investments, this cost would be avoided.
Often the cost of advice given by a stockbroker or financial adviser is built into the vehicle. Often referred to as commission or load (in the U.S.) this charge may be applied at the start of the plan or as an ongoing percentage of the fund value each year. While this cost will diminish your returns it could be argued that it reflects a separate payment for an advice service rather than a detrimental feature of collective investment vehicles. Indeed it is often possible to purchase units or shares directly from the providers without bearing this cost.
Lack of choice[edit]
Although the investor can choose the type of fund to invest in, they have no control over the choice of individual holdings that make up the fund.
Loss of owner's rights[edit]
If the investor holds shares directly, he has the right to attend the company's annual general meeting and vote on important matters. Investors in a collective investment vehicle often have none of the rights connected with individual investments within the fund.
Style[edit]
Investment aims and benchmarking[edit]
Each fund has a defined investment goal to describe the remit of the investment manager and to help investors decide if the fund is right for them. The investment aims will typically fall into the broad categories of Income (value) investment or Growth investment. Income or value based investment tends to select stocks with strong income streams, often more established businesses. Growth investment selects stocks that tend to reinvest their income to generate growth. Each strategy has its critics and proponents; some prefer a blend approach using aspects of each.
Funds are often distinguished by asset-based categories such as equity, bonds, property, etc. Also, perhaps most commonly funds are divided by their geographic markets or themes.
Examples

The largest markets—U.S., Japan, Europe, UK and Far East are often divided into smaller funds e.g. US large caps, Japanese smaller companies, European Growth, UK mid caps etc.
Themed funds—Technology, Healthcare, Socially responsible funds.

In most instances whatever the investment aim the fund manager will select an appropriate index or combination of indices to measure its performance against; e.g. FTSE 100. This becomes the benchmark to measure success or failure against.
Active or passive management[edit]
The aim of most funds is to make money by investing in assets to obtain a real return (i.e. better than inflation). The philosophy used to manage the fund's investment vary and two opposing views exist.
Active management—Active managers seek to outperform the market as a whole, by selectively holding securities according to an investment strategy. Therefore they employ dynamic portfolio strategies, buying and selling investments with changing market conditions, based on their belief that particular individual holdings or sections of the market will perform better than others.
Passive management—Passive managers stick to a portfolio strategy determined at outset of the fund and not varied thereafter, aiming to minimize the ongoing costs of maintaining the portfolio. Many passive funds are index funds, which attempt to replicate the performance of a market index by holding securities proportionally to their value in the market as a whole. Another example of passive management is the "buy and hold" method used by many traditional unit investment trusts where the portfolio is fixed from outset.
Additionally, some funds use a hybrid management strategy of enhanced indexing, in which the manager minimizes costs by broadly following a passive indexing strategy, but has the discretion to actively deviate from the index in the hopes of earning modestly higher returns.
An example of active management success

In 1998 Richard Branson (head of Virgin) publicly bet Nicola Horlick (head of SG Asset Management) that her SG UK Growth fund would not beat the FTSE 100 index, nor his Virgin Index Tracker fund over three years, nor achieve its stated aim to beat the index by 2% each year. He lost and paid £6,000 to charity.

Alpha, Beta, R-squared and standard deviation[edit]
When analysing investment performance, statistical measures are often used to compare 'funds'. These statistical measures are often reduced to a single figure representing an aspect of past performance:

Alpha represents the fund's return when the benchmark's return is 0. This shows the fund's performance relative to the benchmark and can demonstrate the value added by the fund manager. The higher the 'alpha' the better the manager. Alpha investment strategies tend to favour stock selection methods to achieve growth.
Beta represents an estimate of how much the fund will move if its benchmark moves by 1 unit. This shows the fund's sensitivity to changes in the market. Beta investment strategies tend to favour asset allocation models to achieve outperformance.
R-squared is a measure of the association between a fund and its benchmark. Values are between 0 and 1. Perfect correlation is indicated by 1, and 0 indicates no correlation. This measure is useful in determining if the fund manager is adding value in their investment choices or acting as a closet tracker mirroring the market and making little difference. For example, an index fund will have an R-squared with its benchmark index very close to 1, indicating close to perfect correlation (the index fund's fees and tracking error prevent the correlation from ever equalling 1).
Standard deviation is a measure of volatility of the fund's performance over a period of time. The higher the figure the greater the variability of the fund's performance. High historical volatility may indicate high future volatility, and therefore increased investment risk in a fund.

Types of risk[edit]
Depending on the nature of the investment, the type of 'investment' risk will vary.
A common concern with any investment is that you may lose the money you invest—your capital. This risk is therefore often referred to as capital risk.
If the assets you invest in are held in another currency there is a risk that currency movements alone may affect the value. This is referred to as currency risk.
Many forms of investment may not be readily salable on the open market (e.g. commercial property) or the market has a small capacity and investments may take time to sell. Assets that are easily sold are termed liquid therefore this type of risk is termed liquidity risk.
Charging structures and fees[edit]
Fee types[edit]
For an open-end fund, there may be an initial charge levied on the purchase of units or shares this covers dealing costs, and commissions paid to intermediaries or salespeople. Typically this fee is a percentage of the investment. Some vehicles waive the initial charge and apply an exit charge instead. This may be gradually disappearing after a number of years. Closed-end funds traded on an exchange are subject to brokerage commissions, in the same manner as a stock trade.
The vehicle will charge an annual management charge or AMC to cover the cost of administering the vehicle and remunerating the investment manager. This may be a flat rate based on the value of the assets or a performance related fee based on a predefined target being achieved.
Different unit/share classes may have different combinations of fees/charges.
Pricing models[edit]
Open-ended vehicles are either dual priced or single priced.
Dual priced vehicles have a buying (offer) price and selling or (bid) price. The buying price is higher than the selling price, this difference is known as the spread or bid-offer spread. The difference is typically 5% and may be varied by the vehicle's manager to reflect changes in the market; the amount of variation may be limited by the vehicles rules or regulatory rules. The difference between the buying and selling price includes initial charge for entering the fund.
The internal workings of a fund are more complicated than this description suggests. The manager sets a price for creation of units/shares and for cancellation. There is a differential between the cancellation and bid prices, and the creation and offer prices. The additional units are created are place in the managers box for future purchasers. When heavy selling occurs units are liquidated from the managers box to protect the existing investors from the increased dealing costs. Adjusting the bid/offer prices closer to the cancellation/creation prices allows the manager to protect the interest of the existing investors in changing market conditions. Most unit trusts are dual priced.
Single priced vehicles notionally have a single price for units/shares and this price is the same if buying or selling. As single prices vehicle can't adjust the difference between the buying and selling price to allow for market conditions another mechanism the dilution levy exists. SICAVs, OEICs and U.S. mutual funds are single priced.
A dilution levy can be charged at the discretion of the fund manager, to offset the cost of market transactions resulting from large un-matched buy or sell orders. For example if the volume of purchases outweigh the volume of sales in a particular trading period the fund manager will have to go to the market to buy more of the assets underlying the fund, incurring a brokerage fee in the process and having an adverse effect on the fund as a whole ("diluting" the fund). The same is the case with large sell orders. A dilution levy is therefore applied where appropriate and paid for by the investor in order that large single transactions do not reduce the value of the fund as a whole.

Greece[edit]
We could say that a mutual fund is a pool of money which belongs to many investors. Otherwise a M/F is the common cashier of many investors who trust a third party to operate and manage their wealth. Moreover they order this third party which in Greece is called A.E.D.A.K. (Mutual Fund Management Company S.A.) to spread their money in many different investment products such as shares, bonds, deposits, repo etc. Those companies in Greece may provide services according to article 4 of Law 3283/2004. People who own units (shares) of a mutual fund are called unitholders. In Greece co-unitholders, which are persons participating in the same units of M/F have exactly the same rights as the unitholder (according to the Law for the deposits in common account 5638/1932). The unitholders have to sign and accept the document which describes the purpose of the Mutual Fund, how it operates, and anything concerning the Fund. This document is the regulation of the M/F. The property of each M/F by law have to be under the control of a bank legally operating in Greece (Greek or foreign). The bank is the custodian of the M/F and except of the custody of the fund also controls the lawfulness of all movements of the management company. The Supervisory and Regulatory Body of M.F. Management Companies and Portfolio Investment Companies is the Greek Capital Market Commission. It comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Economy and controls the operation of all M/Fs available in Greece. All investors have to be very careful and about the risk they undertake. They have to have in mind that all investments have a certain degree of risk. Risk–free investments does not exist. You can find more about Greek Mutual Funds in the site of the Association of Greek Institutional Investors[11] or the site of Greek (Hellenic) Capital Market Commission.[12]

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)

What are REITs?
Real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) allow individuals to invest in large-scale, income-producing real estate. A REIT is a company that owns and typically operates income-producing real estate or related assets. These may include office buildings, shopping malls, apartments, hotels, resorts, self-storage facilities, warehouses, and mortgages or loans. Unlike other real estate companies, a REIT does not develop real estate properties to resell them. Instead, a REIT buys and develops properties primarily to operate them as part of its own investment portfolio.
Why would somebody invest in REITs?
REITs provide a way for individual investors to earn a share of the income produced through commercial real estate ownership – without actually having to go out and buy commercial real estate.
What types of REITs are there?
Many REITs are registered with the SEC and are publicly traded on a stock exchange. These are known as publicly traded REITs. Others may be registered with the SEC but are not publicly traded. These are known as non- traded REITs (also known as non-exchange traded REITs). This is one of the most important distinctions among the various kinds of REITs. Before investing in a REIT, you should understand whether or not it is publicly traded, and how this could affect the benefits and risks to you.
What are the benefits and risks of REITs?
REITs offer a way to include real estate in one’s investment portfolio. Additionally, some REITs may offer higher dividend yields than some other investments.
But there are some risks, especially with non-exchange traded REITs. Because they do not trade on a stock exchange, non-traded REITs involve special risks:
Lack of Liquidity: Non-traded REITs are illiquid investments. They generally cannot be sold readily on the open market. If you need to sell an asset to raise money quickly, you may not be able to do so with shares of a non-traded REIT.
Share Value Transparency: While the market price of a publicly traded REIT is readily accessible, it can be difficult to determine the value of a share of a non-traded REIT. Non-traded REITs typically do not provide an estimate of their value per share until 18 months after their offering closes. This may be years after you have made your investment. As a result, for a significant time period you may be unable to assess the value of your non-traded REIT investment and its volatility.
Distributions May Be Paid from Offering Proceeds and Borrowings: Investors may be attracted to non-traded REITs by their relatively high dividend yields compared to those of publicly traded REITs. Unlike publicly traded REITs, however, non-traded REITs frequently pay distributions in excess of their funds from operations. To do so, they may use offering proceeds and borrowings. This practice, which is typically not used by publicly traded REITs, reduces the value of the shares and the cash available to the company to purchase additional assets.
Conflicts of Interest: Non-traded REITs typically have an external manager instead of their own employees. This can lead to potential conflicts of interests with shareholders. For example, the REIT may pay the external manager significant fees based on the amount of property acquisitions and assets under management. These fee incentives may not necessarily align with the interests of shareholders.
How to buy and sell REITs
You can invest in a publicly traded REIT, which is listed on a major stock exchange, by purchasing shares through a broker. You can purchase shares of a non-traded REIT through a broker that participates in the non-traded REIT’s offering. You can also purchase shares in a REIT mutual fund or REIT exchange-traded fund.
Understanding fees and taxes
Publicly traded REITs can be purchased through a broker. Generally, you can purchase the common stock, preferred stock, or debt security of a publicly traded REIT. Brokerage fees will apply.
Non-traded REITs are typically sold by a broker or financial adviser. Non-traded REITs generally have high up-front fees. Sales commissions and upfront offering fees usually total approximately 9 to 10 percent of the investment. These costs lower the value of the investment by a significant amount.
Special Tax Considerations
Most REITS pay out at least 100 percent of their taxable income to their shareholders. The shareholders of a REIT are responsible for paying taxes on the dividends and any capital gains they receive in connection with their investment in the REIT. Dividends paid by REITs generally are treated as ordinary income and are not entitled to the reduced tax rates on other types of corporate dividends. Consider consulting your tax adviser before investing in REITs.
Avoiding fraud
Be wary of any person who attempts to sell REITs that are not registered with the SEC.
You can verify the registration of both publicly traded and non-traded REITs through the SEC’s EDGAR system. You can also use EDGAR to review a REIT’s annual and quarterly reports as well as any offering prospectus. For more on how to use EDGAR, please visit Research Public Companies.
You should also check out the broker or investment adviser who recommends purchasing a REIT. To learn how to do so, please visit Working with Brokers and Investment Advisers.

Introduction to Investing




Many people just like you turn to the markets to help buy a home, send children to college, or build a retirement nest egg. But unlike the banking world, where deposits are guaranteed by federal deposit insurance, the value of stocks, bonds, and other securities fluctuates with market conditions. No one can guarantee that you’ll make money from your investments, and they may lose value.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforces the laws on how investments are offered and sold to you. Protecting investors is an important part of our mission. We cannot tell you what investments to make, but this website provides unbiased information to help you evaluate your choices and protect yourself against fraud.

Visit the Roadmap to Saving and Investing
A few people may stumble into financial security. But for most people, the only way to attain financial security is to save and invest over a long period of time. You just need to have your money work for you. That’s investing.
Knowing how to secure your financial well-being is one of the most important things you’ll ever need in life. You don’t have to be a genius to do it. You just need to know a few basics, form a plan, and be ready to stick to it. There is no guarantee that you’ll make money from investments you make. But if you get the facts about saving and investing and follow through with an intelligent plan, you should be able to gain financial security over the years and enjoy the benefits of managing your money. For more information, SEC’s publication Saving and Investing: A Roadmap To Your Financial Security Through Saving and Investing.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1277 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

                         Out of
803
 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long term capital appreciation.




Strategy



The central premise of the fund's investment style is "growth at a reasonable price" or "GARP." The fund usually invests in a diversified portfolio of common stocks from small, medium and large capitalization companies. It invests primarily in common stocks. While it is anticipated that the fund will invest across a range of industries, certain sectors are likely to be overweighted compared to others because the Adviser seeks best investment opportunities regardless of sector.


Risk



Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.

Hedge Funds

What are hedge funds?
Hedge funds pool money from investors and invest in securities or other types of investments with the goal of getting positive returns. Hedge funds are not regulated as heavily as mutual funds and generally have more leeway than mutual funds to pursue investments and strategies that may increase the risk of investment losses. Hedge funds are limited to wealthier investors who can afford the higher fees and risks of hedge fund investing, and institutional investors, including pension funds.
What should I know if I am considering investing in a hedge fund?
Be an accredited investor. You generally must be an accredited investor, which means having a minimum level of income or assets, to invest in hedge funds.
Read a fund's prospectus and related materials. Make sure you understand the level of risk involved in the fund's investment strategies, and that the risks are suitable to your personal investing goals, time horizons, and risk tolerance. As with any investment, the higher the potential returns, the higher the risks you must assume.
Understand how fund assets are valued. Hedge funds may hold investments that are difficult to sell and may be difficult to value. You should understand the valuation process and know the extent to which a fund's holdings are valued by independent sources.
Understand fees. Fees impact your return on investment. Hedge funds typically charge an asset management fee of 1-2% of assets, plus a “performance fee” of 20% of the hedge fund’s profit. A performance fee could motivate a hedge fund manager to take greater risks in the hope of generating a larger return.
Understand any limitations on your right to redeem your shares. Hedge funds typically limit opportunities to redeem, or cash in, your shares, to four times a year or less, and often impose a "lock-up" period of one year or more, during which you cannot cash in your shares.
Research hedge fund managers. Make sure hedge fund managers are qualified to manage your money, and find out whether they have a disciplinary history within the securities industry.
You can get this information by reviewing the adviser’s Form ADV, which is the investment adviser's registration form. You can search for and view a firm’s Form ADV using the SEC’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) website.
If you don’t find the investment adviser firm in the SEC’s IAPD database, call your state securities regulator or search FINRA's BrokerCheck database.
Ask questions. You are entrusting your money to someone else. You should know where your money is going, who is managing it, how it is being invested, and how you can get it back. In addition, you may wish to read FINRA’s investor alert, which describes some of the risks of investing in funds of hedge funds.

Introduction to Investing




Many people just like you turn to the markets to help buy a home, send children to college, or build a retirement nest egg. But unlike the banking world, where deposits are guaranteed by federal deposit insurance, the value of stocks, bonds, and other securities fluctuates with market conditions. No one can guarantee that you’ll make money from your investments, and they may lose value.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforces the laws on how investments are offered and sold to you. Protecting investors is an important part of our mission. We cannot tell you what investments to make, but this website provides unbiased information to help you evaluate your choices and protect yourself against fraud.

                Mutual Funds: Brand Names Vs. House Brands            


    By Ken Hawkins 






Share















































If you stroll down the aisle of any large supermarket today, mixed in with the merchandise of well-known national brands is similar merchandise in the store's brand. Next to a major brand-named can of creamed corn, you might also see a can of the house brand of creamed corn. In the financial supermarkets that house today's large brokerage firms, banks and insurance companies, banks often sell their own investment products and services alongside of those from outside suppliers. And, on the virtual shelves of a large financial company, the mutual funds of major companies - like Fidelity or Franklyn - sit side-by-side with the house brand mutual funds. In this article, we'll show you how to decide between purchasing a house-brand fund over a major brand fund. (For other things to consider, read Picking The Right Mutual Fund.)
Tutorial:An Introduction To Mutual FundsHouse-Brand (Proprietary) Funds Vs. Third-Party FundsA house-brand, or proprietary, mutual fund is created when the bank or brokerage firm that distributes the fund also acts an investment advisor for the fund. The mutual fund business has two components: managing fund assets and distributing (or selling) funds. Each side can be very profitable and the creation of proprietary mutual funds is considered a form of vertical integration - not to mention a profitable way to leverage an existing sales force. Typically, these mutual funds are developed, managed and sold in-house.
Third-party mutual funds, on the other hand, are managed by outside, independent managers. These include the brand names of the business such as Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Franklyn and Fidelity. They might be sold directly to the investor or they may be sold by other companies or by an independent advisor. Those who sell the funds are often totally independent from those who manage the funds. In theory, this should result in totally unbiased advice when advisors recommend these funds to their clients.
Sellers of Proprietary FundsProprietary funds can normally be found at just about every company that has a large sales force who can sell mutual funds. This includes banks, credit unions, brokerage firms, insurance companies and wealth management companies. In-house mutual funds were developed by companies to be sold by their own distribution networks, and are now part of an overall move into wealth management.
The brokerage industry entered into the proprietary mutual fund business as a means of averaging out their revenues. The fees generated from managing assets tend be smoother and more predictable than the potentially volatile revenues of their traditional lines of business of investment banking, trading and commissions.
Although most sellers of in-house funds will also offer third-party funds, some advisors or firms may only sell and promote their own funds.Companies that have their own sales force may only sell their brand of funds. If an advisor recommends an in-house fund, investors should ask if they sell third-party funds as well, because they may be required to promote internal funds first.
Issues Surrounding Proprietary FundsAlthough there are hundreds of mutual fund companies and thousands of mutual funds to choose from, if you are purchasing funds from an advisor or a company that is only offering in-house funds, this narrows your choices considerably.
This could be a problem for a number of reasons:
The investment style they use might currently be out of favor and buying from an in-house fund could result in lagging performances.
The bank may not offer an international growth fund among its proprietary offerings, which may be needed for diversification. (To read more about diversifying your portfolio, see Introduction To Diversification and The Importance Of Diversification.)
If the bank does offer a growth fund, the foreign assets that have been selected for the fund may be out of favor for the duration of the client's investment horizon. This would be less likely to occur if there was a larger offering of international growth funds available.
The type of fund or style you desire might not be found within the fund family. 
PricingProprietary funds can be priced differently than third-party funds. The sales commissions and management fees can differ. This will depend on a number of factors:
First, the in-house funds might be relatively smaller in size to third-party funds. This means they may not enjoy the same economies of scale, resulting in relatively higher costs. (To learn more, see What Are Economies Of Scale?)
Secondly, because the same company manages and distributes the funds, it has more leeway about how to charge. For example, some companies might decide to charge lower fees on their proprietary funds as a means of building market share and keeping more money in-house.
Thirdly, the company has a captive market, which means it can offer advantageous pricing to catch the "lazy" investors who don't comparison shop and would rather continue to work with only one broker. 
TransferabilityUnlike third-party funds, typical proprietary funds may not be transferable from one firm to another. If an investor wants to move his or her account, the units of the in-house funds will have to be sold. This can result in additional fees, commissions and administrative costs. Also, there is some additional market risk between the time the mutual funds are sold and when the proceeds are reinvested. Investors may purchase proprietary funds without appreciating portability restriction and the firms do not necessarily tell their clients that the assets of proprietary funds are not transferable.Sales IncentivesBecause there is the potential for advisors to steer client money to in-house mutual funds that may not be in the clients' best interest , the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has outlawed the use of sales incentives for the sale of proprietary funds. The reason FINRA barred this action is because it gives brokers a financial reason to put their interests ahead of those of their clients - which is completely prohibited according to advisor rules
However, some firms may still have incentives in place; although they might meet the letter of the regulations, they do not meet the spirit of the underlying rules. As a result, some advisors and customers have taken the opposite position and will not buy or offer their in-house funds at all in order to avoid any nuance of indiscretion.
Further Buying ConsiderationsProprietary funds can be found at almost all large financial institutions. Like third-party funds, they can be excellent investment products. However, before buying these funds, you should make sure you understand what you are buying and how it will fit in with your portfolio. The same due diligence that is necessary for buying mutual funds in general should be carried out when purchasing those developed in-house. Some might argue that even more due diligence is necessary, especially when an in-house fund is recommended over a third-party fund. Advisors should be able to disclose all incentives to the client in writing to ensure they do not offer influenced advice. (To keep reading on due diligence, see Due Diligence In 10 Easy Steps.)
Clients should also check to see if in-house funds can be transferred to other firms and, if so, whether this transfer would involve any costs or fees.
The Bottom LineIf you are careful in your research of these house-brand funds, you may find that you don't need to put your money in with the major brands to experience good growth and a personalized investing experience.

Investment

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about investment in finance. For investment in macroeconomics, see Investment (macroeconomics). For other uses, see Investment (disambiguation).
"Invest" redirects here. For the term in meteorology, see Invest (meteorology).





This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (February 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


To invest is to allocate money (or sometimes another resource, such as time) in the expectation of some benefit in the future.
In finance, the benefit from investment is called a return. The return may consist of capital gain or investment income, including dividends, interest, rental income etc., or a combination of the two. The projected economic return is the appropriately discounted value of the future returns. The historic return comprises the actual capital gain (or loss) or income (or both) over a period of time.
Investment generally results in acquiring an asset, also called an investment. If the asset is available at a price worth investing, it is normally expected either to generate income, or to appreciate in value, so that it can be sold at a higher price (or both).
Investors generally expect higher returns from riskier investments. Financial assets range from low-risk, low-return investments, such as high-grade government bonds, to those with higher risk and higher expected commensurate reward, such as emerging markets stock investments.
Investors, particularly novices, are often advised to adopt an investment strategy and diversify their portfolio. Diversification has the statistical effect of reducing overall risk.

Related terms[edit]
Investment differs from arbitrage, in which profit is generated without investing capital or bearing risk.
An investor may bear a risk of loss of some or all of their capital invested, whereas in saving (such as in a bank deposit) the risk of loss in nominal value is normally remote. (Note that if the currency of a savings account differs from the account holder's home currency, then there is the risk that the exchange rate between the two currencies will move unfavorably, so that the value in the account holder's home currency of the savings account decreases.)
Speculation involves a level of risk which is greater than most investors would generally consider justified by the expected return. An alternative characterization of speculation is its short-term, opportunistic nature.
Famous investors[edit]
Investors famous for their success include Warren Buffett. In March 2013 Forbes magazine, Warren Buffett ranked number 2 in their Forbes 400 list.[1] Buffett has advised in numerous articles and interviews that a good investment strategy is long term and choosing the right assets to invest in requires due diligence.
Edward O. Thorp was a highly successful hedge fund manager in the 1970s and 1980s who spoke of a similar approach.[2]
The investment principles of both of these investors have points in common with the Kelly criterion for money management.[3] Numerous interactive calculators which use the Kelly criterion can be found online.[4]
Intermediaries and collective investments[edit]
Investments are often made indirectly through intermediary financial institutions. These intermediaries include pension funds, banks, and insurance companies. They may pool money received from a number of individual end investors into funds such as investment trusts, unit trusts, SICAVs, etc. to make large scale investments. Each individual investor holds an indirect or direct claim on the assets purchased, subject to charges levied by the intermediary, which may be large and varied.
Approaches to investment sometimes referred to in marketing of collective investments include dollar cost averaging and market timing.
History[edit]
The Code of Hammurabi (around 1700 BC) provided a legal framework for investment, establishing a means for the pledge of collateral by codifying debtor and creditor rights in regard to pledged land. Punishments for breaking financial obligations were not as severe as those for crimes involving injury or death.[5]
In the early 1900s purchasers of stocks, bonds, and other securities were described in media, academia, and commerce as speculators. By the 1950s, the term investment had come to denote the more conservative end of the securities spectrum, while speculation was applied by financial brokers and their advertising agencies to higher risk securities much in vogue at that time. Since the last half of the 20th century, the terms speculation and speculator have specifically referred to higher risk ventures.
Value investment[edit]
Main article: value investing
A value investor buys assets that they believe to be undervalued (and sells overvalued ones). To identify undervalued securities, a value investor uses analysis of the financial reports of the issuer to evaluate the security. Value investors employ accounting ratios, such as earnings per share and sales growth, to identify securities trading at prices below their worth.
Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham are notable examples of value investors. Graham and Dodd's seminal work Security Analysis was written in the wake of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. [6]
The price to earnings ratio (P/E), or earnings multiple, is a particularly significant and recognized fundamental ratio, with a function of dividing the share price of stock, by its earnings per share. This will provide the value representing the sum investors are prepared to expend for each dollar of company earnings. This ratio is an important aspect, due to its capacity as measurement for the comparison of valuations of various companies. A stock with a lower P/E ratio will cost less per share, than one with a higher P/E, taking into account the same level of financial performance; therefore, it essentially means a low P/E is the preferred option.[7]
An instance, in which the price to earnings ratio has a lesser significance, is when companies in different industries are compared. An example; although, it is reasonable for a telecommunications stock to show a P/E in the low teens; in the case of hi-tech stock, a P/E in the 40s range, is not unusual. When making comparisons the P/E ratio can give you a refined view of a particular stock valuation.
For investors paying for each dollar of a company's earnings, the P/E ratio is a significant indicator, but the price-to-book ratio (P/B) is also a reliable indication of how much investors are willing to spend on each dollar of company assets. In the process of the P/B ratio, the share price of a stock is divided by its net assets; any intangibles, such as goodwill, are not taken into account. It is a crucial factor of the price-to-book ratio, due to it indicating the actual payment for tangible assets and not the more difficult valuation, of intangibles. Accordingly, the P/B could be considered a comparatively, conservative metric.
Free cash flow and capital structure[edit]
Free cash flow measures the cash a company generates which is available to its debt and equity investors, after allowing for reinvestment in working capital and capital expenditure. High and rising free cash flow therefore tend to make a company more attractive to investors.
The debt-to-equity ratio is an indicator of capital structure. A high proportion of debt, reflected in a high debt-to-equity ratio, tends to make a company's earnings, free cash flow, and ultimately the returns to its investors, more risky or volatile. Investors compare a company's debt-to-equity ratio with those of other companies in the same industry, and examine trends in debt-to-equity ratios and free cash flow.
EBITDA[edit]
A popular valuation metric is Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), with application for example to valuing unlisted companies and mergers and acquisitions.[8]
For an attractive investment, for example a company competing in a high growth industry, an investor might expect a significant acquisition premium above book value or current market value, which values the company at several times the most recent EBITDA. A private equity fund for example may buy a target company for a multiple of its historical or forecasted EBITDA, perhaps as much as 6 or 8 times.
In certain cases, an EBITDA may be sacrificed by a company, in order for the pursuance of future growth; a strategy frequently used by corporate giants, such as, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, among others. This is a business decision that can impact negatively on buyout offers, founded on EBITDA and can be the cause of many negotiations, failing. It may be recognized as a valuation breach, with many investors maintaining that sellers are too demanding, while buyers are regarded as failing to realize the long-term potential of, expenditure or acquisitions.
Capital gains taxes[edit]

The amount to pay in taxes for long term investments, investments that span over a year long term, and short term investments such as those that are below a year are different. The long term investments range from Zero to twenty percent for capital gains and they are regulated by what tax bracket you are in for income taxes. For the zero to fifteen percent income tax bracket you could qualify for the zero percent long-term capital gains rate. The next bracket is the fifteen to twenty percent income tax bracket where you are set at fifteen percent capital gains tax for long term investments. The next bracket is between twenty and 39.6 percent and that leads to a twenty percent capital gains tax however with these numbers you should add 3.8 percent for the health care surtax. The short term capital gains tax is also related to your total taxable income and is taxed at the same rate as your income and ranges from ten to 39.6 percent.[9]

Investment

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about investment in finance. For investment in macroeconomics, see Investment (macroeconomics). For other uses, see Investment (disambiguation).
"Invest" redirects here. For the term in meteorology, see Invest (meteorology).

To invest is to allocate money (or sometimes another resource, such as time) in the expectation of some benefit in the future.
In finance, the benefit from investment is called a return. The return may consist of capital gain or investment income, including dividends, interest, rental income etc., or a combination of the two. The projected economic return is the appropriately discounted value of the future returns. The historic return comprises the actual capital gain (or loss) or income (or both) over a period of time.
Investment generally results in acquiring an asset, also called an investment. If the asset is available at a price worth investing, it is normally expected either to generate income, or to appreciate in value, so that it can be sold at a higher price (or both).
Investors generally expect higher returns from riskier investments. Financial assets range from low-risk, low-return investments, such as high-grade government bonds, to those with higher risk and higher expected commensurate reward, such as emerging markets stock investments.
Investors, particularly novices, are often advised to adopt an investment strategy and diversify their portfolio. Diversification has the statistical effect of reducing overall risk.

Related terms[edit]
Investment differs from arbitrage, in which profit is generated without investing capital or bearing risk.
An investor may bear a risk of loss of some or all of their capital invested, whereas in saving (such as in a bank deposit) the risk of loss in nominal value is normally remote. (Note that if the currency of a savings account differs from the account holder's home currency, then there is the risk that the exchange rate between the two currencies will move unfavorably, so that the value in the account holder's home currency of the savings account decreases.)
Speculation involves a level of risk which is greater than most investors would generally consider justified by the expected return. An alternative characterization of speculation is its short-term, opportunistic nature.
Famous investors[edit]
Investors famous for their success include Warren Buffett. In March 2013 Forbes magazine, Warren Buffett ranked number 2 in their Forbes 400 list.[1] Buffett has advised in numerous articles and interviews that a good investment strategy is long term and choosing the right assets to invest in requires due diligence.
Edward O. Thorp was a highly successful hedge fund manager in the 1970s and 1980s who spoke of a similar approach.[2]
The investment principles of both of these investors have points in common with the Kelly criterion for money management.[3] Numerous interactive calculators which use the Kelly criterion can be found online.[4]
Intermediaries and collective investments[edit]
Investments are often made indirectly through intermediary financial institutions. These intermediaries include pension funds, banks, and insurance companies. They may pool money received from a number of individual end investors into funds such as investment trusts, unit trusts, SICAVs, etc. to make large scale investments. Each individual investor holds an indirect or direct claim on the assets purchased, subject to charges levied by the intermediary, which may be large and varied.
Approaches to investment sometimes referred to in marketing of collective investments include dollar cost averaging and market timing.
History[edit]
The Code of Hammurabi (around 1700 BC) provided a legal framework for investment, establishing a means for the pledge of collateral by codifying debtor and creditor rights in regard to pledged land. Punishments for breaking financial obligations were not as severe as those for crimes involving injury or death.[5]
In the early 1900s purchasers of stocks, bonds, and other securities were described in media, academia, and commerce as speculators. By the 1950s, the term investment had come to denote the more conservative end of the securities spectrum, while speculation was applied by financial brokers and their advertising agencies to higher risk securities much in vogue at that time. Since the last half of the 20th century, the terms speculation and speculator have specifically referred to higher risk ventures.
Value investment[edit]
Main article: value investing
A value investor buys assets that they believe to be undervalued (and sells overvalued ones). To identify undervalued securities, a value investor uses analysis of the financial reports of the issuer to evaluate the security. Value investors employ accounting ratios, such as earnings per share and sales growth, to identify securities trading at prices below their worth.
Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham are notable examples of value investors. Graham and Dodd's seminal work Security Analysis was written in the wake of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. [6]
The price to earnings ratio (P/E), or earnings multiple, is a particularly significant and recognized fundamental ratio, with a function of dividing the share price of stock, by its earnings per share. This will provide the value representing the sum investors are prepared to expend for each dollar of company earnings. This ratio is an important aspect, due to its capacity as measurement for the comparison of valuations of various companies. A stock with a lower P/E ratio will cost less per share, than one with a higher P/E, taking into account the same level of financial performance; therefore, it essentially means a low P/E is the preferred option.[7]
An instance, in which the price to earnings ratio has a lesser significance, is when companies in different industries are compared. An example; although, it is reasonable for a telecommunications stock to show a P/E in the low teens; in the case of hi-tech stock, a P/E in the 40s range, is not unusual. When making comparisons the P/E ratio can give you a refined view of a particular stock valuation.
For investors paying for each dollar of a company's earnings, the P/E ratio is a significant indicator, but the price-to-book ratio (P/B) is also a reliable indication of how much investors are willing to spend on each dollar of company assets. In the process of the P/B ratio, the share price of a stock is divided by its net assets; any intangibles, such as goodwill, are not taken into account. It is a crucial factor of the price-to-book ratio, due to it indicating the actual payment for tangible assets and not the more difficult valuation, of intangibles. Accordingly, the P/B could be considered a comparatively, conservative metric.
Free cash flow and capital structure[edit]
Free cash flow measures the cash a company generates which is available to its debt and equity investors, after allowing for reinvestment in working capital and capital expenditure. High and rising free cash flow therefore tend to make a company more attractive to investors.
The debt-to-equity ratio is an indicator of capital structure. A high proportion of debt, reflected in a high debt-to-equity ratio, tends to make a company's earnings, free cash flow, and ultimately the returns to its investors, more risky or volatile. Investors compare a company's debt-to-equity ratio with those of other companies in the same industry, and examine trends in debt-to-equity ratios and free cash flow.
EBITDA[edit]
A popular valuation metric is Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), with application for example to valuing unlisted companies and mergers and acquisitions.[8]
For an attractive investment, for example a company competing in a high growth industry, an investor might expect a significant acquisition premium above book value or current market value, which values the company at several times the most recent EBITDA. A private equity fund for example may buy a target company for a multiple of its historical or forecasted EBITDA, perhaps as much as 6 or 8 times.
In certain cases, an EBITDA may be sacrificed by a company, in order for the pursuance of future growth; a strategy frequently used by corporate giants, such as, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, among others. This is a business decision that can impact negatively on buyout offers, founded on EBITDA and can be the cause of many negotiations, failing. It may be recognized as a valuation breach, with many investors maintaining that sellers are too demanding, while buyers are regarded as failing to realize the long-term potential of, expenditure or acquisitions.
Capital gains taxes[edit]

And what I want to do in this video is think about how real interest rates drive planned investment. Think about the function - investment as a function of real interest rates. Planned investment as a function of real interest rates. And when I'm talking about real interest rates I'm really just talking about nominal interest rates, factoring out or discounting what's going on with inflation. And there's other videos where we go into more depth on that. Another way to think about that is if there were no inflation real and nominal interest rates would be the same thing. And I want to tackle it with a very tangible example. So, let's say in this upcoming year there is a bunch of potential planned projects, so let's call this "Projects"... so these are really potential investments. So you have projects and then you have some level of expected return. So each of the people who are thinking about these projects, they all have their spreadsheets out and have taken in risk and probabilites and all of the rest and they've come up with their expected return numbers. And let's say Project A has an expected return of 20% B 18%, C 16%, I'll do a couple more, D 10%, E is 5% and then let's say F is 2% And let's say, initially, in one state of affairs interest rates are relatively high. So let's say r1 is equal to 19% interest rates So if we have 19% real interest rates and these are the real expected returns, which of these projects will actually be invested in? Which ones will people actually do? Well if someone has the cash, they say "I could either lend my money out for 19% or I could do this Project A and get 20%" So if they have the cash, they would definitely do this, and if they don't have the cash, they could say "Well, I could borrow money for 19% and I can invest it at 20%, I'll make money off of that!" So Project A - Project A will definitely be done. Now what about Project B? Well, Project B, if the person actually has the cash on hand to do Project B, they say "Well, I could do Project B and get an 18% real return, or I could lend that money out and get a 19% real return." So actually I would not do Project B and obviously I would not do anything that has an even lower real return. And, if I could potentially do Project B, but I had to borrow the money, well if I had to borrow the money at 19% real interest and I'm only getting 18% on it, that's a money-losing proposition. So I wouldn't do B, and I definitely wouldn't do all of these things that get a lower return. So when I have high interest rates over here, the only thing I would is Project A. Project A. So now let's think about what would happen if interest rates went down, if real interest rates went down. So let's say real interest rates, we'll call that r2, go down to 3%. Well, once again, Project A you're definitely going to do. If you have the money on hand, you get 20% doing Project A. You definitely don't want to lend it out at 3%. If you don't have the money on hand you can borrow at 3% and invest at 20%. And so, by the same logic, people would do Project B. You could borrow at 3% and make 18%. Or if you have the money, you get 18% versus 3% on your money, so you definitely do this. You do all of these, you would even do Project E. If you have the money you would rather put that money and get 5% than lend it out and only get 3%. So you'll even do Project E. If you need to borrow it, it still makes sense. Borrow money at 3%, invest it at 5% and you're making some real return. The only one you would not do is Project F right over here, because here you aren't actually covering your cost of borrowing. If you had to borrow at 3% and invest at 2%, doesn't make sense. If you have the money you would rather lend your money out at 3% than do Project F, so you're definitely not going to do Project F in this scenario. And you obviously do it in neither scenario. So right over here... you'd do all of the above. So you would do A, B, C, D, all of the above except for F. A, B, C, D and E. So let's just think about the rough level of investment. If we were to plot on this axis right over here, if we were to plot the investment as a function of real interest rates. And over here we actually have our indepedent variable - real interest rate. At a high real interest we had a low level of investment. We only did Project A. So that's right over there: That is A only. So this is when we were at r1. And when we lowered interest rates to r2, we had a much higher level of investment. We did all of these projects right over here. So you had a much higher level of investment. So this is A, B, C, D and E. And so you see that you have an inverse relationship: The lower the real interest rate, the more investment is going to go on. The higher the interest rate, the less investment that goes on. And you can debate whether it's a curve or a line but for sake of simplicity we'll assume that it looks something like this... I'll draw a dotted line, it's easier for me to do that. It might look something like that. And now we can use this insight to start thinking about how a change in real interest rate might shift our planned expenditures on our Keynesian cross. And from that we can start to think about the IS curve, the famous IS curve from the IS-LM model.Connecting the keynesian cross to the IS curveUp NextConnecting the keynesian cross to the IS curve

and I welcome you to throw examples my way, and we
can think about whether something is consumption
or investment. And my argument, in general,
is that investment is something good for society. It's good for you. It is capital, right? Or money that's being put to
work to create more wealth or more capital or more
good for society. While consumption is capital
that is, essentially, being burned in some way, usually for
some type of social status or ego gratification. Well, let's think about that. What about a going out once a
month-- Let's say a vacation, this is an interesting case. A simple vacation with family. Maybe it's a family reunion,
depending on your family, it might be simple, or it might
be relaxing, it might not. But let's assume this is
a relaxing vacation. You're going camping,
or you're going to Yosemite or something. It's a very peaceful, tranquil
thing to do. So your original gut reaction
would be, well, if we take a vacation, me and my family,
we're going to take time off, we're not going to work,
my kids aren't going to be in school. So you might say, oh, well,
that's consumption because we're going to spend money. Let's say, the vacation
cost $2,000, right? We're spending $2,000
on this vacation. So that might be an investment,
or that might be consumption. So, at first you might say
that's consumption, you're not going to be working. Once you go on that vacation,
there's nothing left over. But there could be a counter
argument here. There could be an argument that,
by taking this simple vacation with the family, it
recenters you, it bonds with your family, it makes you
a happier human being. And it makes you more likely
to be able to contribute to society once you
get back home. And if you didn't take this
vacation, you would eventually burn out. So in this example, and it
depends on what you consider a simple vacation, I would
consider that actually, probably an investment. Especially if it makes you more
relaxed, it eases your brain, it allows you to become
more creative and more productive for society. That could be an investment. That's why I think it's
important that people don't overwork. Now, what if I were to take me
and my family and we were to have someone carry us or we rode
on someone's back as they swam across the ocean to go stay
in golden thrones while an army of people
danced for us. Right? So let's say, an extravagant
vacation. So you could argue a lot of
things, this is, I have a family of four and let's say
it costs me $200,000. Well here, there's
a couple things. There might be some part of this
vacation that makes you more relaxed and might make
you more productive. I'd argue that it is probably
the opposite, the extravagant vacation is probably going to
make you more stressed and probably feed your ego in ways
that are in some ways self-destructive. But let's say that there is some
component, let's stick to the benefit of the doubt,
that does relax you. And I would say that that
component is an investment. But you know what? You probably could have gotten
that for $2,000. So we could say that $2,000
of this is something of an investment and that $198,000
of this probably is consumption. Because it's not making
you more productive. Sure enough, when you go to this
place, it is giving those people something to do and it
is giving them jobs, but I would call that a transfer
of wealth. This isn't investment. When you go to whatever country
you decide to go to and you blow, essentially,
$198,000 that you didn't need to just because it feels good
to have the locals dote on you, you're transferring
money to them. And then, maybe, they transfer
that money to someone else, but it in no way is increasing
the wealth of the world. It's not leading to innovation;
it's not leading to more factories; and
it's not leading to the pie getting bigger. And you know what? I don't even think this is,
necessarily, a bad idea because, frankly, this is just
the transfer of wealth from someone who needs ego
gratification to a transfer of wealth from someone who's
willing to do fairly simple things to, essentially, take
that wealth from them. But, at the end of the day,
it is consumption. And I think you can imagine,
let's say, a simple purse. My wife goes out and buys
a purse from Target and it costs $20. Is that consumption or is
that an investment? Well, I'd argue that that's
an investment. Maybe her old purse is falling
apart and by having a new purse, maybe it helps her get
a job, be more productive; maybe it helps her get
more organized. So this could be
an investment. And what about a Louis Vuitton--
not to pick on them in particular-- but what about
a Louis Vuitton purse. I don't know how much they--
I don't even know how to spell it. I think these cost upwards
of $2,000, or whatever. Well, this, clearly, is some
form of consumption. You could maybe make some
argument that in certain circles, you could get a job
if you carry around one of these purses. But there's some basic core
value to it that you probably could have gotten with
a simple purse. So that, maybe, is $20
of investment. And then the rest of it, I don't
know, the other $1,980, is consumption. Now, I'll ask you a further
question: do you think that this is bad or good
for society? Well, I'd actually argue that
it's probably neutral for society, because it does look
like a quote, unquote, waste of money, this extra almost
$2,000 that you spent that you really didn't have to, to get
something of fairly basic utility, but that those
resources weren't burned. Those resources went from,
frankly, someone who just wanted some ego gratification. It went from someone's
ego, essentially. So let's say this is
you, or your ego. And this is Louis Vuitton,
the company. So you gave them $1,980 that
you didn't have to. Their cost of making the purse
probably didn't cost a lot more than that simple purse. And in exchange, they gave
you ego gratification. So they really didn't have to
waste a lot of resources. They gave you all of this brand
imagery that makes you feel better about yourself. So I would argue that this
capital actually didn't get lost, it just got transferred
from someone who was probably a little insecure to someone
who knows how to sell to insecure people. And then Louis Vuitton will then
have that $1,980 and then who knows, maybe they give that
to their private equity friend or their venture capital
friend, and then that gets invested in some new
start-up idea, some solar-cell company that actually can create
energy from the sun. And in which case, that money
did not go wasted. So they might actually
invest it in solar. So this, actually, was
not a waste of money. Although, this transaction, I
would agree, is consumption. I would say that the waste
of money is all of the advertising and all the
sponsorship that Louis Vuitton has to do to convince you that
this will make you, somehow, a better person if you
buy that purse. Because those ads you see on TV
with those people you want to look like, that will not
give you-- that is not creating any net wealth for the
world, or is not making the pie any bigger. Anyway, let me think of
another example here. Well, let's say, so this example
with the Louis Vuitton purse, this is just a
transfer of wealth. But let's say, instead of doing
that, you had your ego and instead of buying a Louis
Vuitton purse, you just-- so this is you-- you thought it
would be nice-- but let's say, you thought it was nice, instead
of buying a Louis Vuitton purse, which we
established would just be a transfer of wealth-- it is
consumption, but at least that money doesn't disappear-- let's
say that you wanted to pay $2,000 to have-- I don't
know-- $10 an hour, you can have 200 people dance for you
and recite your name and talk about what an amazing
person you are. This, I would argue, is
pure consumption. Because those 200 people, sure
this money gets transferred to them, but they didn't
do anything productive with that time. Right? Those 200 people, they could
have been tilling the soil; they could have been working in
a factory; they could have been teaching their children how
to read; they could have been doing something that was
productive for society. But instead, they spent one hour
dancing for you for your ego gratification. And this is, in my mind, the
worst form of consumption because, not only-- it's not
just the transfer of wealth, it is the destruction
of wealth. Because 200 people's time is
wealth, that is capital that could be used to improve
someone's life. But instead, this $2,000 was,
essentially destroyed. Sure, it goes to those
people, right? But in the end, they didn't
create anything in that amount of time. And I'll touch more
about that anyway. In essence, the amount of money
didn't change in the system, but the amount of
value in the system got degraded because all these
people time got wasted. And, In the end, that actually
leads to inflation. If you have more money in a
system with less productive goods and services, the price
for our productive goods and services goes up. But anyway, I'm out
of time again. But I encourage you to think as
much as you can about just this idea: when you spend money,
is it consumption or is it investment? And I'll continue this more into
kind of a lot of what the government tells you to do when
the economy goes down. How they say, go by yourself a
nice dress, instead of saying, hey why don't you go
build a factory? Or why don't you save your
money and invest in your child's education? Anyway, see you in
the next video.Investment vs. consumption 1Wealth destruction 1Up NextWealth destruction 1

video is compare investment to consumption. And we're going to think
about it in two contexts. One I would call the everyday
conventional context. And then the other
one would be how we would think about it
in an economics context. Because these words
mean something very particular to an economist. And that's important that it
means something particular, because we're going
to start using these words, or
this terminology, or these classifications,
to understand where GDP is coming from. So in everyday-- let me
draw a line over here. This is going to be
everyday or, conversational, versions of this term. And down here, we'll
put the economics, the economic versions
of this term, especially when we think of it
in the context of accounting for GDP. And they're not necessarily
all that different. But they are different
in important ways. So in investment,
really in both cases, you can generally
view it as something that you do to get
some future gain. So for example, if I today build
a house-- so I build a house. So that is the house. I built it today. And this will be the timeline. The house will keep lasting. And it's an investment,
because it's going to be giving
me future gain. A year from now, I'll still
be able to live in that house. So I will have the saved rent. That's a future gain, a future
gain two years from now. It'll keep giving
some type of gain. You could have a financial
instrument, maybe some type of debt instrument. You're lending money
to someone else. So maybe you buy a bond,
which is essentially you lending money to someone else. That is an investment in
the everyday sense of it. Because when have that asset,
when you've bought that asset, it's going to pay off
something in the future. It's going to pay off some
interest or some profits. And in the everyday sense,
I would consider something like-- hopefully
it would be-- going to college would
be an investment. So education, I'll
say education, because you invest that time
and energy and education, it's going to keep paying off. Hopefully by doing
that, you're going to get better employment
and higher wages the rest of your life. It will keep paying off. So this is the everyday
notion of investment. The everyday notion
of consumption, the way I think about it,
is you are buying something or you're doing something
that you're just going to use up
in the short-term. And just by using it up,
whatever that object is, if you just use it up-- and it's
just going to hopefully benefit you in some way, but it's
more of a short-term thing-- I would consider
that consumption in the everyday sense. So if you go buy a
candy bar and eat it, you have consumed the candy bar. You have not made an investment. If you go to a movie,
that is consumption. And I'm not making
any value judgment that one is better
than the other. Investment, at the
end of the day, you're investing so that you
can get future benefit that could lead to consumption. Because at the end of
the day, consumption is one of the things that might
make your life a little bit better off. So I'm not saying that one
is better than the other. But watching a movie, that
would also be consumption. Spending time buying
a book, well, you could debate whether
that's education or not. But let's say you buy a book
that is not educational, that is consumption. But it is making you happier. Hopefully, it's making your
life better in some way. Now, the economic
definitions are related to these
everyday definitions, but they're a little
bit more precise. And they make the
definitions in a way that they're easier to account
for if you are a nation. They're easier to keep track of. So the way an economist
would define it, they would define
economic investment as spending on
capital equipment. Capital equipment are things
like, if you are a factory, you will buy the equipment
to run your factory. You buy the robots. And you buy the assembly line. And you buy the wheelbarrows
or whatever else, the things that have
to cart things around. That is capital equipment. It would be things
like inventory. So for example, the
inventory-- and this is still not so different. Both of these things
are being used to produce things in the future,
to produce future benefit. You're buying that inventory,
sometimes raw material, you're going to add value to it. And then they're
going to be used to produce something
in the future. It includes things like even
the structures, the buildings. And so for all of this, in
the economic sense, and this is why it's easier to account
for, this, for the most part, is being done by the firms. And it also includes the one
thing that households do, which is construction
of new homes. This is from the households. Actually, the buying
of a house does not show up in consumption
or investment, because nothing
new was produced. Something just exchanged hands. So whenever we talk about
any of these things, especially when we're
talking about it in precise economic
terms, it's the production of new capital equipment, new
inventory, new structures, new homes. If I just buy a factory
from someone else, that does not add to GDP. It would not be considered
investment or consumption, because I'm just
transferring an asset from one person to another. It would only be added to
GDP when it is first created. And on the consumption
side, from an economic point of view-- let me draw a little
bit of a line right over here-- consumption is considered to
be any spending on final goods by households except
for new homes. And let me make
this even clearer. Because remember, if we're
just transferring goods, that shouldn't count. So let me put it on newly
produced final goods. Now, what's unintuitive
a little bit over here is, according to the way we
account for GDP, the tuition that you spend on a
college education, that is new spending
on final goods. And here are the final
goods or services. The service you're
getting is your education. That would be consumption. So education would fall
here in the economic sense. While in the every day sense, I
would consider education right over here. Maybe you are buying a car. And you're not buying a
car for leisure purposes. You're buying a car because you
need your car to go to work. There's an argument
that that would be an investment in
the everyday sense. By having that car,
you have something that can take you
to work every day. So you're getting
future benefit. So there's an argument
that maybe that's an investment in
the everyday sense. But in the accounting sense,
that car would sit right here. You bought a new car. But that is considered
consumption. You did not buy a new house. And the whole reason, at
least as far as I understand, why it's set up this way is this
is this easier to account for. You look at all of
the spending by firms, that's easy to account for. You essentially call
that investment. Because at the end of
the day, all the spending that firms are making
is they're doing it to produce some
good or service. So we call this investment any
spending that the firms do. And on top of that, when
households purchase new homes, we also call that investment. And that's just easier
for the accounting offices of governments to keep track of. And everything else
that households do, we consider consumption. And we'll see in
the next few videos, there are a few other
categories in terms of things that
the government do. And then we'll have to think
about imports and exports.Income and expenditure views of GDPUp NextIncome and expenditure views of GDP

video on a couple of terms that people have really thrown
around for a while now. And I think it really hits the
core of some of the issues we're dealing with now with the
credit debacle but it's kind of at a deeper level. So the things I want to go over
are the ideas of savings, consumption, and investment. And you hear these a lot. Everyone obviously says, I've
invested in the stock market or I've invested in a house and
I really want to give you a framework for how I think
about these ideas. And frankly, I haven't seen them
depicted this way in any economics book, although they've
kind of touched on this, but I think this is really
how you should think about these things. So if you save money, and I
think we all know what that means, that's money that you
didn't spend, there's a couple of things that you
can do with it. You can either consume
your money or you could invest your money. So, let's just think about a
bunch of different situations and think about whether those
things are consumption or investment. So let's say, I have $100,000
that I'm dealing with. So let's say, I take
that $100,000 and I build a factory. And I think that that factory
is going to be able to produce-- I'll make up some
product-- it'll be able to produce cars more efficiently
and cheaper than any other car factory out there. Well, I think we'd all agree
that this is an investment. And why is it an investment? Because I'm taking this $100,000
and I'm putting it to some use that is creating,
hopefully, more value than my original $100,000. In fact, I'm expecting some
type of a return on this investment. And I've made a bunch of videos
on what a return on investment is, and you can
usually quantify it. If I take a $100,000 and I build
this factory and this factory spits out $50,000 a
year, it's probably creating at least $50,000 a year value,
assuming that nothing corrupt is happening in our system. In fact, it's normally creating
more than $50,000 a year of value. It may be creating a $100,000 a
year of value and $50,000 of that may be going to the
person who's doing the production and then the other
half of the value is actually going to the consumer
of whatever this factory is making. And you have to think about
it, because if all of the value went to the person who
produced the factory then there's not a huge incentive
for someone to use his products anymore. But anyway, that's not the
topic of discussion. We're just trying to get at
a mental framework on what consumption is versus
investment. So I think we all agree that if
I were to build a factory that this is-- let's say I'll
do everything in green as investment. So building a factory
is an investment. Now let's say that I'm homeless and I have this $100,000. And because I'm homeless, I
don't have a place to go and eat dinner and rest and relax. Because I don't have that, I
can't get a job and I can't become a productive
member of society. So maybe, I'm going to use this
$100,000 to buy a simple house that meets all
of my needs. Let's say build a simple house,
and I'll do that in a neutral color. This is my other use of this
$100,000, instead of building a factory, I'm going to
build a simple house. And this house, it provides
shelter for me and my family, it allows us that security that
now my kids can go to school and they can
themselves become more productive citizens. I now have an address. I have a place to take a shower,
that allows me to go get a job and I can now create
value for society as a whole, instead of being on the
corner and begging for money from people. I would argue that this
is also an investment. Why is it? Because I'm taking this
$100,000, that maybe I had or someone gave to me, and it's
generating a return. And what is that return? Well, with a factory,
it's maybe a little easier to quantify. But at minimum, it's this work
that I'm able to do because I now have a house. Because I have the security,
I have the address. I have the shelter. I'm able to relax. It's that security and it's also
the return that probably my kids are going to be able to
now contribute to society. Maybe if they grew up homeless,
they would have never been able to contribute. And now that they have a roof
over their head, and are able to go to school, et cetera, they
are going to be able to give some economic value
back to society. It's hard to value, maybe I
didn't have any job before and now I have a job and
I can contribute $30,000 a year to society. Maybe I'm working at
someone's factory. Maybe I'm providing
some other-- maybe I'm a farmer now. Whatever, I'm providing
some source of value. And maybe my kids-- if they
never got an education, they would have maybe added $10,000
of value per year to people and now they can add
$20,000 of value. So that difference would also be
some of the return on this investment. So I also consider this
to be an investment. Now, my question to you is,
let's say that I already had a house-- so this is
an investment. Let's say I already had a house
and my family is happy and we have everything
we need. We have food on the table and
my kids go to school and I'm able to get a job and
all of that exists. But let's say, I still have
a $100,000 and I use that $100,000-- I'll do it in
yellow-- to put in some granite counter tops. I have some money left over,
let's say, I'm going to add a bathroom to my house and I will
put the latest hardwood floors, so that my family
will be impressed. You can imagine. And maybe I add 2,000
square feet. You normally can't get all
that for a $100,000 but I think you'll bear with me. So I'm essentially doing some
major home improvements. So my question to you is-- is
this an investment or is this consumption? Now, in our everyday world, with
most people we deal with, they will call this investment
in my house. And why are they saying that? Because they say, by spending
a $100,000 in the house in this way, that maybe-- if you
watch the Home and Garden channel, they're doing this
all the time-- that if you pour this a $100,000 into your
house, that maybe the value of your house is going to
increase by $150,000. Or someone else, all of a
sudden, is going to perceive the value of your house
as being $150,000. They'll say, well, you got a
$50,000 return on investment. I'd argue that that
is not investment. That it's speculation. You are, essentially, piling
money into this stuff-- and I'll do this in red,
consumption is red. What's happening here
truly economically? When you add granite, or you
add an extra bathroom or hardwood floors or this extra
2,000 square feet, is it making anyone who's living in
that house more productive? Is it making you harder working;
is it making you more likely to invent the cure for
cancer, or more likely to invent a way of getting
cheap energy, or produce more widgets? No, it's just, if anything,
providing more things for you to have to take care of, that
you're not going to be able to focus as much on your work. Or more energy is going to
have to be extended to maintain this type of place,
to heat and cool a 2,000 square foot house. So if anything, by actually
pouring the $100,000 here, you're actually creating
something that is going to suck more out of society. In fact, in no way is this going
to contribute to the collective wealth of society. The last two examples I gave
contribute to the collective wealth society, some of which
you share, and that is your return on the investment. But as a whole, this is an
investment into society. And it's going to make
the pie bigger. This right here, does not
make the pie bigger. It might make you a little bit
happier, make your ego feel a little bit better, let your
pride grow, and your self righteousness grow, and show
other people that you've arrived, but it's not
going to increase the wealth of society. And when you say that you've
invested, you are really just saying I've speculated. What you're saying is-- by
paying this $100,000, you're going to find, essentially,
a greater fool out there. They could have done the same
thing, they could have bought your house, spent $100,000 and
done this, if this is what would have made them happy. But what you're saying is,
essentially, that you're going to find somebody out there who's
willing to pay $150,000 extra for something that should have only cost $100,000. And in fact, if anything, if you
use this at all, the value of this is going to go down. So you're just somehow assuming
that the granite counter tops that you choose are
going to be the taste that someone else would like or that
the hardwood floors are going to be the taste someone
else would like. I would actually argue that when
you customize your house in this way, you are creating
$100,000 of consumption to your taste. And I'd be surprised if someone
else, truly, is willing to pay more than
$100,000 unless they're being, in some way, irrational or they
can finance this because it's part of the mortgage. Anyway, this is, I think, just
the big picture: investment adds value to society. A simple house adds
value to society. Consumption is something where
people might call it an investment because it's
kind of speculation. One might find some other guy
willing to emotionally pay more for something. But it's money that's burned;
it's not creating more value for society. I continue this in
the next video.Return on capitalInvestment vs. consumption 2Up NextInvestment vs. consumption 2

videos, we've been talking about the
production possibilities frontier as a relatively
static thing, something that you couldn't change
but you could move along. What I want to do in this
video is think about, maybe there are ways
to change or expand the production
possibilities frontier. And to do that let's assume that
our little hunter-gatherer has decided to become
a strict carnivore. So he's only focused
on rabbits now. And his whole happiness in
life is optimizing the number of rabbits he can catch
and eat in a given day. And so let's-- on
one axis let's draw, let's say the number of rabbits
that he can catch in a given day. Let's say it's 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-- I could keep going on and on. So this right over
here is rabbits that he can catch in a
given day, rabbits in a day. But remember, he wants
to optimize this. He wants to think about how he
can increase his productivity in terms of the
number of rabbits. And he knows-- we'll
just assume that he knows how to build rabbit traps. So now we're going to do
a production possibilities frontier, not between
rabbits and berries, but between rabbits and building
rabbit traps, so rabbit traps. So maybe he's able
to get twigs together and he builds something. Puts the twigs together
in a little thing. It's a little box that--
maybe he puts a little, I don't know some type of
carrot down over there. And then if the rabbit comes
then takes the carrot then the box falls on the rabbit
or something like that. We don't have to go into the
particulars of the actual trap. But he can also spends his
time building rabbit traps. So let's say, 1 rabbit
trap, 2 rabbit traps, and 3 rabbit traps. And let's say-- we're going to
hold all other things equal, ceteris parabus. So we're not worrying
about other things. And as we'll see, in most
introductory economics class, whenever you do a production
possibilities frontier you're only doing it
with two dimensions. And so that's why you
have a regular curve. You could have one with three
dimensions, where you're doing the trade off
between three things. But then you would have to
have a three dimensional graph, and essentially the production
possibilities frontier would be a surface. But let's just focus
on this right now. Maybe I'll do a surface in
the future, just for fun. So these are the rabbit traps. And let's say the production
possibilities frontier between rabbit traps and rabbits
look something like this. He could spend all his
time making rabbit traps, but in that case he
won't get any rabbits and he'll probably starve. And that wouldn't
be a good scenario. Or he could spend all of
this time hunting for rabbits and he would catch, on
average, 5 rabbits per day. But that would leave him no
time to make rabbit traps. So this is our
current production possibilities-- let
me just draw it. This is our current production
possibilities frontier. So I'll call this p, production
possibilities frontier. And I'll put a little
0 subscript there. That's our starting point. So he can he can sit
anywhere over here, and he would have achieved
productive efficiency anywhere on this curve. But as we saw, if he just spent
all of his time doing this over here, he'll never
get any rabbit traps. And so he won't
be able to change the productive
possibility frontier. But what happens if
instead he decides that he does want to
build some rabbit traps? So he decreases the number
of rabbits a day to 4 and that allows him to
make 1 rabbit trap per day. So he wants to hang
out in this scenario. So every day that
goes by, on average, he's going to make 4 rabbits. And he's going to
build a rabbit trap. So what's going to happen? So as we go into, maybe
into the next period, he would now have a rabbit
trap after just one day that he can use to
help catch rabbits. So that will actually change
the production possibilities frontier. So if he makes
this investment, it will actually allow him,
in a given amount of time, to actually catch more rabbits. So if he does that, the
production possibilities frontier-- having a rabbit
trap won't make him that much, won't allow him to make
more rabbit traps in a day. So the most rabbit traps
he can make in a day is still going to be 3. But maybe now he can
catch 6 rabbits a day. So now it might look
something like that. So now he could either
stop making rabbit traps, and catch 6 a day just
with that 1 rabbit trap he has, or he could
continue that. And now actually he can
catch 5 rabbits a day and still make 1
rabbit trap a day. And maybe he decides to do that. But it could be anywhere along
this production possibilities frontier. Or he could say, hey, I'm happy
eating the 4 rabbits a day. I'm going to make 2 rabbit
traps now every day. And now after another period
he gets even more productive. And so then the production--
so let me call this one, this is after one day. Production possibilities
frontier after one day, and then after two
days, let's say he did this scenario
right over here. Now he's produce 2 rabbit traps. And obviously, maybe I'm
exaggerating how quickly his productivity would grow. But maybe now the new production
possibilities frontier looks something like this. He now has 2 rabbit traps. Or he has 2 more rabbit
traps, he already had 1. So now he has 3 rabbit
traps after two days. And so now if he wanted to
devote themselves purely to rabbit trapping he
can get 8 rabbits a day. Or he could do some
combination in between. And actually this curve,
it shouldn't go up at all. I don't want to give
you the impression that it went up and then down. It just goes kind of
straight and does something like that right over here. So this right over
here, I'll call that the production
possibilities frontier 2. So what this hunter-gatherer
is doing in this scenario right here is, he is
making an investment. He is accumulating capital. This right over here,
this is capital. He is choosing, instead of to
consume all of his resources-- so there's two things he can do. He can either spend all of
his time in pure consumption, getting as many rabbits
as possible a day and then eating them
all, pure consumption. Or he could reduce
his consumption and then allocate
some of his resources towards and investment. So this right over here,
this is an investment. It makes him more productive. This right over
here is consumption. There's some base
level of consumption he needs to survive. But if he invests,
then it increases his overall productive capacity. So if you viewed
him as an economy by himself, by investing
instead of consuming all of his resources,
by investing some of his resources--
and in this case, his resources are his
time and his expertise-- by investing some of them
he's able to increase his productivity. And if you viewed
him as an economy, he's experiencing
economic growth. And so there's multiple
types of investments. And we'll talk about
these in multiple videos. In this case, he is doing
capital accumulation. He is building tools that
will make him more productive. Another type of
investment is essentially technological change,
technological improvement, which would actually make
his tools even better. So we could maybe draw another
production possibilities frontier between
making rabbit traps and then doing R&D on inventing
new types of rabbit traps. And so he could decide
which of those two things he wants to decide between. But what I wanted you to
just appreciate in this video is that the production
possibilities frontier can change. You can become more
productive if you do have investment in R&D
or capital accumulation. And in this case, that just
happened to be rabbit traps.Allocative efficiency and marginal benefitThe production possibilities frontier and social choicesUp NextThe production possibilities frontier and social choices

To invest is to allocate money (or sometimes another resource, such as time) in the expectation of some benefit in the future.
In finance, the benefit from investment is called a return. The return may consist of capital gain or investment income, including dividends, interest, rental income etc., or a combination of the two. The projected economic return is the appropriately discounted value of the future returns. The historic return comprises the actual capital gain (or loss) or income (or both) over a period of time.
Investment generally results in acquiring an asset, also called an investment. If the asset is available at a price worth investing, it is normally expected either to generate income, or to appreciate in value, so that it can be sold at a higher price (or both).
Investors generally expect higher returns from riskier investments. Financial assets range from low-risk, low-return investments, such as high-grade government bonds, to those with higher risk and higher expected commensurate reward, such as emerging markets stock investments.
Investors, particularly novices, are often advised to adopt an investment strategy and diversify their portfolio. Diversification has the statistical effect of reducing overall risk.

Related terms[edit]
Investment differs from arbitrage, in which profit is generated without investing capital or bearing risk.
An investor may bear a risk of loss of some or all of their capital invested, whereas in saving (such as in a bank deposit) the risk of loss in nominal value is normally remote. (Note that if the currency of a savings account differs from the account holder's home currency, then there is the risk that the exchange rate between the two currencies will move unfavorably, so that the value in the account holder's home currency of the savings account decreases.)
Speculation involves a level of risk which is greater than most investors would generally consider justified by the expected return. An alternative characterization of speculation is its short-term, opportunistic nature.
Famous investors[edit]
Investors famous for their success include Warren Buffett. In March 2013 Forbes magazine, Warren Buffett ranked number 2 in their Forbes 400 list.[1] Buffett has advised in numerous articles and interviews that a good investment strategy is long term and choosing the right assets to invest in requires due diligence.
Edward O. Thorp was a highly successful hedge fund manager in the 1970s and 1980s who spoke of a similar approach.[2]
The investment principles of both of these investors have points in common with the Kelly criterion for money management.[3] Numerous interactive calculators which use the Kelly criterion can be found online.[4]
Intermediaries and collective investments[edit]
Investments are often made indirectly through intermediary financial institutions. These intermediaries include pension funds, banks, and insurance companies. They may pool money received from a number of individual end investors into funds such as investment trusts, unit trusts, SICAVs, etc. to make large scale investments. Each individual investor holds an indirect or direct claim on the assets purchased, subject to charges levied by the intermediary, which may be large and varied.
Approaches to investment sometimes referred to in marketing of collective investments include dollar cost averaging and market timing.
History[edit]
The Code of Hammurabi (around 1700 BC) provided a legal framework for investment, establishing a means for the pledge of collateral by codifying debtor and creditor rights in regard to pledged land. Punishments for breaking financial obligations were not as severe as those for crimes involving injury or death.[5]
In the early 1900s purchasers of stocks, bonds, and other securities were described in media, academia, and commerce as speculators. By the 1950s, the term investment had come to denote the more conservative end of the securities spectrum, while speculation was applied by financial brokers and their advertising agencies to higher risk securities much in vogue at that time. Since the last half of the 20th century, the terms speculation and speculator have specifically referred to higher risk ventures.
Value investment[edit]
Main article: value investing
A value investor buys assets that they believe to be undervalued (and sells overvalued ones). To identify undervalued securities, a value investor uses analysis of the financial reports of the issuer to evaluate the security. Value investors employ accounting ratios, such as earnings per share and sales growth, to identify securities trading at prices below their worth.
Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham are notable examples of value investors. Graham and Dodd's seminal work Security Analysis was written in the wake of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. [6]
The price to earnings ratio (P/E), or earnings multiple, is a particularly significant and recognized fundamental ratio, with a function of dividing the share price of stock, by its earnings per share. This will provide the value representing the sum investors are prepared to expend for each dollar of company earnings. This ratio is an important aspect, due to its capacity as measurement for the comparison of valuations of various companies. A stock with a lower P/E ratio will cost less per share, than one with a higher P/E, taking into account the same level of financial performance; therefore, it essentially means a low P/E is the preferred option.[7]
An instance, in which the price to earnings ratio has a lesser significance, is when companies in different industries are compared. An example; although, it is reasonable for a telecommunications stock to show a P/E in the low teens; in the case of hi-tech stock, a P/E in the 40s range, is not unusual. When making comparisons the P/E ratio can give you a refined view of a particular stock valuation.
For investors paying for each dollar of a company's earnings, the P/E ratio is a significant indicator, but the price-to-book ratio (P/B) is also a reliable indication of how much investors are willing to spend on each dollar of company assets. In the process of the P/B ratio, the share price of a stock is divided by its net assets; any intangibles, such as goodwill, are not taken into account. It is a crucial factor of the price-to-book ratio, due to it indicating the actual payment for tangible assets and not the more difficult valuation, of intangibles. Accordingly, the P/B could be considered a comparatively, conservative metric.
Free cash flow and capital structure[edit]
Free cash flow measures the cash a company generates which is available to its debt and equity investors, after allowing for reinvestment in working capital and capital expenditure. High and rising free cash flow therefore tend to make a company more attractive to investors.
The debt-to-equity ratio is an indicator of capital structure. A high proportion of debt, reflected in a high debt-to-equity ratio, tends to make a company's earnings, free cash flow, and ultimately the returns to its investors, more risky or volatile. Investors compare a company's debt-to-equity ratio with those of other companies in the same industry, and examine trends in debt-to-equity ratios and free cash flow.
EBITDA[edit]
A popular valuation metric is Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), with application for example to valuing unlisted companies and mergers and acquisitions.[8]
For an attractive investment, for example a company competing in a high growth industry, an investor might expect a significant acquisition premium above book value or current market value, which values the company at several times the most recent EBITDA. A private equity fund for example may buy a target company for a multiple of its historical or forecasted EBITDA, perhaps as much as 6 or 8 times.
In certain cases, an EBITDA may be sacrificed by a company, in order for the pursuance of future growth; a strategy frequently used by corporate giants, such as, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, among others. This is a business decision that can impact negatively on buyout offers, founded on EBITDA and can be the cause of many negotiations, failing. It may be recognized as a valuation breach, with many investors maintaining that sellers are too demanding, while buyers are regarded as failing to realize the long-term potential of, expenditure or acquisitions.
Capital gains taxes[edit]





The examples and perspective in this article may not represent a worldwide view of the subject. You may improve this article, discuss the issue on the talk page. (January 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


The amount to pay in taxes for long term investments, investments that span over a year long term, and short term investments such as those that are below a year are different. The long term investments range from Zero to twenty percent for capital gains and they are regulated by what tax bracket you are in for income taxes. For the zero to fifteen percent income tax bracket you could qualify for the zero percent long-term capital gains rate. The next bracket is the fifteen to twenty percent income tax bracket where you are set at fifteen percent capital gains tax for long term investments. The next bracket is between twenty and 39.6 percent and that leads to a twenty percent capital gains tax however with these numbers you should add 3.8 percent for the health care surtax. The short term capital gains tax is also related to your total taxable income and is taxed at the same rate as your income and ranges from ten to 39.6 percent.[9]

Special Report: How Much Money Do House Flippers Make?How Smart Real Estate Investors are Flipping Houses in 2016.





How much money do house flippers make? According to RealtyTrac's U.S. Home Flipping Report, investors made an average gross profit of $65,993 per flip last quarter and an average gross profit per flip of $55,000 in the year 2015. 
		
		With the United States real estate market heating up, many people are getting into flipping houses. Cities with the highest number of flips include Detroit, Los Angeles, Memphis, and Miami. Cities with the highest profit on flips include St. Louis, Jacksonville, and Chicago, according to the report.

How to Find Discount Properties 
The first step to flipping a house is finding a discount property. The goal is to buy low and sell high and keep repair costs to a minimum.  Fortunately you can find bargain properties in many different areas of the U.S.
For example, if you live near the Tampa, Florida area, you will find bank-owned houses listed in the $10,000-$40,000 range.



Example: Here is a look inside a bank owned home purchased at a big discount. After upgrades the owners made a healthy profit.  Click Here for a Free DVD That Shows You How to Flip Houses

Many house rehabbers find undervalued houses by looking for foreclosures/bank owned properties - also called "REO" houses. Banks have carrying costs on any house in their inventory. 
Carrying costs include insurnace, taxes, and property maintenance. As a result, banks are often very motivated to get rid of their housing inventory - even if they have
to sell it at a discount.
HUD houses, which are foreclosed homes with an FHA backed mortgage, are also a source of bargain properties. HUD publishes all its houses on a website which makes it easy for 
investors to look for potential deals.

How to Get Funding for Your Flip If you do not have a lot of start up capital to work with, you can still get into flipping houses.  You can access to funding to flip houses so that you use only a fraction of your own money.  

One way to use other people's money to flip houses is to get a "Hard Money Loan".  A "Hard Money Lender" is an individual, or a group of wealthy individuals, who lend money for the purpose of rehabbing houses. It is a short term loan you repay monthly with the balance paid in full when the house is sold.  

Getting a hard money loan is easier than getting a loan from a bank. There is less paperwork and your credit history is not as big of a factor.  Often you can receive an approval in 48 to 72 hours and have the funds in as little as 7 days. 
Some Hard Money Lenders provide funding without checking your income or your credit report.
Using hard money will reduce your overall profit because you pay interest and points on the loan. 
However, it is a good strategy to use if you do not have funds set aside - or prefer not to put your own money at risk. 



Example: This home in California was purchased for $45,000. After repairs and upgrades it sold for $215,000. Click Here for a Free DVD That Shows You How to Flip Houses


What Repairs to Make to Maximize Profits

We asked an expert from Capital Rehab Group, a company that actively flips houses across the U.S., for advice on which repairs and upgrades are most important. Here is what he said:

Kitchen and Bathrooms. Redo them from top to bottom. If you are not sure what materials to use, look at homes that sold for top dollar per 
		square foot in the area and copy them.
Flooring. In most flips, use laminate hardwood flooring in the primary living areas and carpet in the bedrooms. Laminate hardwood flooring is difficult to tell apart from real hard wood.  It is not only much more durable, and scratch 
		resistant; it is also less expensive.
Paint. Paint every room in the home. If the walls have a lot of minor flaws in them, use flat paint. Otherwise, use an eggshell finish. And always use earth-tones. 

Landscaping. Donald Trump himself stated that you get a $10,000 return for every $1,000 you invest in landscaping. It is amazing what rocks, trees, and shrubs can do to increase
the perceived value of a property.  A good rule of thumb is to budget 1% to 2% of the final expected sale price of your home for landscaping.  Plant a couple flats of fresh flowers
the day before putting the house on the market.  This simple, inexpensive final step will drastically increase your overall profit.  
 

Roof. If the home needs a new roof, replace it.  But factor this into your costs before you purchase the home. 
 

HVAC. Make sure the home has a working heating and cooling system.  Air conditioning is a must in areas with warm climates like Florida and Texas.  
 

Garage. Other than paint, do not spend much money here.  

Back Patio. This is an often overlooked but important area.  A simple $1,500 deck with two chairs, a small table in between them, and a couple wine glasses sitting on the 
	  table paints an awesome picture in the head of the potential buyer.
 
Have you considered flipping houses? We asked our expert from Capital Rehab Group,  to outline what it takes to start flipping houses.

Capital Rehab Group explained that flipping houses isn't for everyone. There is risk in real estate, but explained you can minimize risk and the benefits of flipping houses are extremely rewarding.
Here are three strategies to be successful: 


 Only buy properties with lots of equity;
 Be realistic about your expected costs; 
 Seek knowledge from others with house flipping experience.

What Others Are Saying


Ben M. made a healthy profit on his first flip by purchasing a bank-owned property in a nice upstate New York neighborhood.



Tim Stevens, a full-time real estate investor from Tampa, Florida, flips 3-4 houses per month by purchasing mostly bank owned properties.






With so many bank-owned houses it’s possible to find properties for pennies on the dollar in many markets in the United States. 

(appraised value = $214,000, asking price = $92,000)

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
