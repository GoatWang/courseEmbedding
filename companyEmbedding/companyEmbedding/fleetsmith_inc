"Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Personal Data” includes the information that is automatically collected when you use certain network related features of the Services, such as public or private IP addresses, subnets, etc., location information (e.g. based on IP lookup), check-in time for user laptop, affiliation with an organization, and any other information related to your affiliation with such organization and/or such organization’s employees, with respect to their use of any employer-provided device. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data, but is pulled from such data and compiled into an anonymous and aggregated form. Further, in order for Fleetsmith to collect certain necessary Personal Data, Fleetsmith must have access to your Google account, via Google OAuth. You agree to grant Fleetsmith access to your Personal Data to the extent such access is necessary for Fleetsmith to access your Google account and to the extent necessary for Fleetsmith to perform the Services. In addition, we collect Personal Data as described below.(a) Online PaymentsFor any online payments, we use the payment services of Stripe (https://stripe.com). For more information on how payments are handled, or to understand the data security and privacy afforded such information, please refer to https://stripe.com/us/privacy.(b) Information You Provide to UsWe may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, gender, e-mail and mailing addresses, picture, phone numbers, any relevant background information, company information, credit card and billing information and password when you create an account to log in to Our network and/or when you order Services through our Website (“Account”)If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we may collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.We may collect certain unique identifiers associated with your Google account (e.g., OAuth tokens) after you have approved our permission request(s). By providing us with access to your OAuth tokens, we may can access any data that you have granted us permission to access within your Google account.We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to Us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, and other requested information if you contact Us via e-mail regarding support for the Service.We may also collect Personal Data at other points on our Website that state that Personal Data is being collected.(c) Information Collected via TechnologyInformation Collected by Our Servers. To make Our Website more useful to you, Our servers (which may be hosted by third party service providers) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We may also record any information necessary for identifying and proactively blocking attempted attacks on our service.Log Files. As is true of most websites and applications, We may gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, provide you with access to the Website, track users’ movements around the Website, gather demographic information about Our user base as a whole, and better tailor the Website and Service to Our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Website again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, We do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.Cookies. Like many online websites, We use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience. This type of information is collected to make the Website more useful to you and to tailor the experience with Us to meet your special interests and needs.Pixel Tags. In addition, We may use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, which are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow Us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell Us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that We are sending only messages that are of interest to Our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.Collection of Data by Advertisers. From time to time, Fleetsmith may partner with certain third party business partners, and display Fleetsmith’s and/or such partner’s logo on or through its products and services. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit Our Website (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number). They do this by using Cookies, Pixel Tags or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, in connection with Fleetsmith’s business partners to better understand the usage and visitation of Our Website and other sites. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies. If you would like more information about certain practices of how third parties handle information, and to know your choices about not having this information Used by these companies, click here: https://www.aboutads.info/choices or http://www.networkadvertising.org.How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals. We do not currently respond to “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that might enable consumers to opt out of tracking.Flash LSOs. If We post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “Flash Cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies.
