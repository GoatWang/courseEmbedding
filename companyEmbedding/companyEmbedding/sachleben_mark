                Mark Sachleben is chief financial officer at New Relic, Inc.            








 



Finalist: Transformation agent - Mark Sachleben, New Relic
New Relic Inc.’s “secret sauce,” says CFO Mark Sachleben, is that the company “was created one hundred percent” as a SaaS (Software as a Service) business.













 Enlarge






                            Mark Sachleben is chief financial officer at New Relic, Inc.                        










 


That let New Relic — a provider of real-time analytics for web and mobile applications — skip the traditional “heavy product” phase, with its big sales force, professional services, and hefty price tag that only the Fortune 5000 could afford.




“The idea was to make it an easy product to use, to adopt, and at a much lower price point, so new and smaller companies, down to a couple of folks in a garage, can go to our website, download the product, and within a couple of minutes be viewing metrics and getting value,” Sachleben says.
“Every business is becoming a software business. You used to walk into a bank, talk to a teller, and deposit a check. These days you take a picture of the check and, boom, it’s deposited,” he adds. “Your software has become the primary vehicle through which customers now interact.”
New Relic employee number four, Sachleben remembers the early days “sitting on a couch trying to figure things out.” Since then, he has led four rounds of funding totaling $205 million and, in late 2014, guided the company through an IPO that raised $115 million. Currently valued at $1.6 billion, New Relic has more than 11,000 customers covering the market spectrum from small to enterprise.




 


“It’s been amazing to watch,” he says. “When I see what our team has been able to do, both in finance, as well as the company, and see thousands of customers use our product and get a positive experience.”
Post-IPO, and in today’s fast-paced and shifting market, the challenge is balancing growth and profitability. “Investors want both,” he says.
Sachleben and New Relic CEO and Founder Lew Cirne approach that balancing act with a “consistent outlook” shaped by a 15-year partnership. At Cirne’s previous start-up, Wily Technology, Sachleben was also employee number four and the senior financial executive until the company’s sale to CA Technologies.

“As the CFO working with the CEO, we’ve really got to be disciplined in making decisions,” he says. “Information flows so fast in this day and age, it’s tempting to be scared of potential short term issues that will cloud judgment, when you should be looking at the long term.”

Consensus Ratings for New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 9 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.90)Consensus Price Target: $47.50 (0.48% downside)
