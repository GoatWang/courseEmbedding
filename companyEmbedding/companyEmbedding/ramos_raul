Paso del Norte Entrepreneurship Oral History Project
 



Title
Interview no. 1494



Interviewee
Raul Ramos



Interviewer
Kristine Navarro



Project
Paso del Norte Entrepreneurship Oral History Project



Biographical Synopsis of Interviewee
Raul Ramos lives in El Paso, Texas and is married with children. He operates and distributes Han-D-Pak spices in El Paso, Texas.



Summary of Interview
Raul Ramos purchased Han-D-Pak from Mr. Young. Raul admits not knowing much about owning a small business however he did see a need for the products within the local market. Raul worked out of a small grocery owned by his mother-in-law and had the help of his two brothers and mother. They would all work to package and deliver the products to the local grocery stores. Raul hand made the racks to hold his product until he was able to hire a carpenter to assist him in the creation of the racks. Raul bought into El Paso products from companies such as Lawry’s, La Costena, Dona Maria, Reyes, Gamesa and Tapatio. Raul enjoys meeting people and selling his products. Although Raul has had success with Han-D-Pak, current economic conditions as well as bigger companies taking away business have affected Han-D-Pak. Raul hopes to stay in the business, offering quality spices at an affordable price. The advice Raul would offer entrepreneurs is to keep the faith and watch the spending.
