Investment Strategies




Since inception, Siguler Guff has managed over $15 billion of investor commitments, of which over $3 billion have been in separate accounts and other advisory activities.
 








Distressed, Special Situations and Specialty Finance










Distressed Opportunities Funds




Investor Commitments: $5.3 billion 



Siguler Guff’s Distressed Opportunities Funds are diversified portfolios that invest in the securities and other interests of companies, structures or assets undergoing financial distress, operating difficulties or restructuring. The portfolios use an active management, broad-based approach and include corporate debt and equity, structured credit, real estate, other special situations and niche opportunities, as well as secondary investments. The Firm takes a dynamic approach, looking across geographies, asset classes and strategies to tactically allocate capital to investments appropriate to the market opportunity and cycle. Siguler Guff actively reevaluates market conditions to target market inefficiencies and dislocations in value which are inherently limited in time. The strategy is implemented through a variety of fund structures, separate accounts, joint ventures, secondary transactions, and direct investments / co-investments.
 













Trade Finance Opportunities Fund




Investor Commitments: $263 million 



Through the Distressed Opportunities Funds, Siguler Guff identified a unique opportunity to take advantage of the disconnect between mandatory new capital charges for trade finance assets and low expected losses. Siguler Guff’s Trade Finance Opportunities Fund seeks to structure and enter into separate accounts or joint ventures with operating partners to negotiate investments primarily in trade finance regulatory capital relief transactions and to own, hold, sell or otherwise dispose of such investments.
 













Secondary Opportunities Fund




Investor Commitments: $337 million 



Siguler Guff has been investing in the secondary market since 2010 through its distressed investment platform. The Firm focuses on special situations/credit-focused secondary market opportunities including purchasing interests in funds managed by traditional distressed managers and out-of-favor managers/fallen angels, side pocket liquidations, and value and yield-oriented strategies.
 





 

 



Real Estate








Investor Commitments: $1.8 billion 



Siguler Guff’s Distressed Real Estate Opportunities Funds are diversified portfolios that invest in various types of real property interests, including equity interests in commercial property, commercial mortgages and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and the debt and equity securities of real estate operating companies and real estate investment trusts. The portfolios target high quality properties, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, which have deteriorated in value due to high levels of vacancy and deferred maintenance issues resulting from overleveraged capital structures. Siguler Guff employs a value-oriented, cycle-aware and structure-agnostic strategy to target the evolving opportunity in the current cycle. The Firm seeks to create a program with access to a broad universe of value opportunities at lower fees and with better governance than the traditional opportunity fund or fund-of-fund models, through greater control and alignment of managers.
Siguler Guff’s real estate experience dates back to 1993 when the Firm, in partnership with a leading small business lender, formed Business Mortgage Investors, Inc. in the wake of the Savings and Loan Crisis to purchase performing small business mortgages from the Resolution Trust Company and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

 



 

 



Small Business








Investor Commitments: $1.7 billion 



Siguler Guff’s Small Buyout Opportunities Funds are diversified portfolios that invest in small buyout funds (funds capitalized with less than $250 million) and small-lower middle market companies (companies with $3-$15 million of EBITDA) which are difficult for many investors to access. The program targets specialized, small, yet well-established, companies that are typically family-owned, founder-owned and/or owner-operated. Siguler Guff believes that the small and lower middle market offers inefficiencies and a variety of appealing characteristics, including substantial deal flow, less competitive transactions, lower purchase multiples, low leverage and significant value creation potential. To effectively and efficiently target this segment of the market, Siguler Guff works with small buyout fund managers as both a limited partner and a co-investment partner. The Firm seeks to partner with managers who have reliably demonstrated the ability to acquire high-quality companies at purchase price and leverage multiples below prevailing market multiples, stemming from their ability to source robust deal flow and exert a disciplined investment style.

 



 

 



Emerging Markets










BRIC Opportunities Funds and Emerging Markets Separate Accounts




Investor Commitments: $2.6 billion 



Siguler Guff’s BRIC Opportunities Funds are diversified portfolios that selectively invest in the rapidly growing economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, and other emerging markets with attractive private equity characteristics. The Firm targets small and medium-sized businesses that benefit from the expanding middle class, growth of local industries and growth in per capita GDP of these emerging economies. Siguler Guff partners with local teams who are capable of sourcing attractively priced, high-growth companies in non-competitive processes and who focus on fast growing Tier II and Tier III cities and regions.
 













Russia Partners Funds




Investor Commitments:  $1.3 billion 



Operating since 1991, Russia Partners is a leading private equity investor in Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union. Russia Partners has managed six private equity funds and more than 65 investments. The core investment strategy of Russia Partners is to make direct equity and equity-related investments in fast-growing medium-sized companies operating in industries that meet the developing demands of the region’s rapidly growing and maturing middle class. Russia Partners’ founding partners have worked together for over 20 years, investing in the region through numerous economic cycles, including the economic crises of 1998 and 2008.
 













RP Tech




Investor Commitments: $93 million 



RP Tech was established in 2011 to make direct equity and equity-related investments in high-growth businesses in areas related to technology and innovation in Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union, as well as in companies that are implementing global technologies and processes throughout this region. Notable investments made by RP Tech include GlobalLogic, a full-lifecycle product development services leader, Viagogo, a leading European online ticket marketplace, Mirantis, a leading pure-play OpenStack software company, and RetailNext, the worldwide market leader for in-store retail analytics.

Separate Accounts








Investor Commitments: $2.8 billion 



Siguler Guff recognizes the need for certain clients to maintain a unique degree of focus and diversification within their private equity portfolios, and consequently works with select clients to provide customized solutions through separate accounts. The Firm currently manages separate accounts with aggregate investor commitments of approximately $2.8 billion on behalf of clients such as public and corporate pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, unions, endowments, foundations and superannuation funds.
Siguler Guff began managing its first separate account in 1993 and has prudently increased the number of separate accounts that it manages over time. These portfolios include a range of investment strategies such as buyouts, growth capital, distressed and special situations, venture capital, mezzanine, real estate, and secondary investments that invest globally across North America, Europe, and the emerging markets. Siguler Guff’s separate account mandates typically include direct investments / co-investments as well as underlying fund investments and leverage resources across the Firm to manage customized portfolios for investors.
As an advisor, Siguler Guff evaluates the global private equity market, assesses the best investment opportunities in the market at any given point in time and provides specific advice on sectors of particular interest to its clients. Siguler Guff provides extensive due diligence and a comprehensive evaluation of fund managers and direct investments / co-investments in these sectors. The Firm manages all transactions (investor capital calls and distributions) and provides consolidated, customized client reports and portfolio analysis. Siguler Guff also advocates on behalf of its clients through advisory board participation and active management of underlying investments.
 



 

 



Advisory Activities and Other Strategies










Venture Lending & Leasing




Investor Commitments: $374 million 



Venture Lending & Leasing was formed as a joint venture between Siguler Guff Advisers and Western Technology Investments in 1994. Siguler Guff served as a co-adviser to the first three Venture Lending & Leasing funds. Starting with Venture Lending & Leasing IV, Siguler Guff's role transitioned to that of a special limited partner.
The Venture Lending & Leasing funds were organized to provide asset-backed financing to carefully selected venture capital-backed companies in the form of secured loans and equipment leases and in exchange for current coupon payments and equity warrants. Loans to each company range from $1 million to $25 million, with warrant coverage of 7% to 12% of the loan amount. Venture Lending & Leasing provides an alternative, carefully structured layer of financing that complements venture capital equity. 
 













Siguler Guff Capital Partners




Investor Commitments: $265 million 



Established in 1999, Siguler Guff Capital Partners is a unique program in which Siguler Guff co-invests with investors in top-quality, best of breed private equity funds, both domestically and internationally, across a range of opportunities including buyouts, venture capital, distressed, mezzanine financing, and special situations/turnarounds. The Firm identifies, evaluates, and accesses these unique private equity opportunities and allows each investor in the Siguler Guff Capital Partners program to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to participate. In most cases, access to these top-tier private equity firms and investment minimums would otherwise be prohibitive to smaller investors.
 













WMAM Funds




Investor Commitments: $529 million 



In April 2009, Siguler Guff became the investment adviser to the WMAM funds, a portfolio of four multi-manager funds and one direct investment fund that were part of a joint venture between BNY Mellon and WestLB.
 





 

 

 



Note: Investor commitments for Siguler Guff’s dedicated emerging markets and small business separate accounts are included in the Separate Accounts section and also in the respective strategy section.

 The prolonged low interest rate environment has created enormous pressure to take greater risk in order to achieve higher returns and meet actuarial return targets. A fiduciary can most responsibly achieve target returns through active asset management and investing with strong, experienced partners.
  —   George Siguler, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 A high rate of disposable income, increasing 4G and broadband penetration, and an educational system that produces over 50,000 graduates with technical degrees each year, make Russia strongly positioned to become one of the largest and most dynamic consumer Internet markets in the world.
 — Drew Guff, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 Historically, the high returns in the buyout business have come from investments that were made during a recession or in the early stages of economic recovery.
 —  George Siguler, Managing Director & Founding Partner 



 In the coming years, emerging markets will continue to play a major role in global economic power and private consumption shifts. The private equity asset class in emerging markets continues to show strong returns and better downside protection compared to public markets. The recent discorrelation presents an interesting entry point for experienced investors looking to increase their emerging markets exposure in an attractive pricing and currency environment.
 — Ralph Jaeger, Managing Director 



 In both the U.S. and Europe, the hangover effects from over-indulgence in the prior economic cycle – risk aversion and low conviction – are leaving pockets of inefficiency and opportunity in today's market. This circumstance is particularly pronounced in Europe, where the Euro crisis of 2012 is still fresh and the disposition of non-performing loans and bad assets from the boom era is in full swing. In both markets, a value investor in commercial real estate has to be selective, but the opportunity remains to uncover good quality assets at a low basis by taking advantage of financially distressed situations.
 — James Corl, Managing Director 



 Siguler Guff takes a highly opportunistic approach to distressed investing and tactically allocates capital across assets and strategies. In a market of waning and waxing conviction, we continue to believe in a strategy of high selectivity and patience for investors with longer-term outlooks.
 — James Gereghty, Managing Director 



 Small buyout funds target a portion of the U.S. economy that is similar in aggregate size to the middle market, generating approximately $4.6 trillion of total annual revenue and employing 22 million people. However, only $26 billion of capital was raised by small buyout funds in 2013 to target a universe of 177,000 small companies. When compared to the middle market, this represents nearly ten times as many target companies but only a small fraction of the capital raised. We believe these compelling supply-demand characteristics make the small buyout market significantly more attractive than any other segment of the buyout space. (Sources: The Market that Moves America by GE Capital and The Ohio State University, 2011; Pitchbook, 2H 2014 PE and VC Fundraising and Capital Overhang Report)
 — Kevin Kester, Managing Director 



 We chose Siguler Guff as our partner due to their unparalleled experience investing in the region and long history of venture investing in the U.S.
 — Arkadiy Dobkin, Co-Founder, CEO & President of EPAM Systems 



 In our experience, small buyouts have remained inefficient and difficult for large investors to access. Providing capital to facilitate the transition of family-owned and owner-operated companies is private equity investing at its best.
 — Kevin Kester, Managing Director

(“SBCOF” or the “Fund”), a Maryland corporation, is a newly organized, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company electing status as a business development company (a “BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).
 
The Fund’s investment objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income from debt investments and capital appreciation from equity investments. The Fund will primarily invest in carefully selected companies in the lower middle market. The Investment Manager (as defined below) defines the “lower middle market” as privately-owned companies with between $2-15 million of earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), and between $10-100 million of revenue. Investments will take the form of mezzanine debt as well as “unitranche” loans with a first lien on the company’s assets, as well as second lien loans. The Fund generally will seek to purchase equity securities alongside its investments to those same companies, generally with an aggregate cost of up to 20% of the value of the investment. The
Fund also may extend mezzanine financing in forms other than subordinated loans, such as convertible loans and preferred stock.
 
Siguler Guff Advisers, LLC (“Siguler Guff Advisers” or the “Investment Manager”) will serve as the Fund’s Investment Manager. See Items 5 and 7 for information about the Investment Manager. The Fund was incorporated on July 7, 2014. The Fund has not yet commenced operations and is registering its shares of Common Stock, $.001 par value per share (the “Shares”), pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act” or the “1934 Act”), in compliance with the requirement of Section 54(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. Its principal office is located at 825 Third Avenue, 10th Floor, New York, NY and its telephone number is (212) 332-5100.
 
Ownership of the Fund. Initially, the Fund will be owned entirely by Siguler Guff Small Business Credit Opportunities Fund, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Partnership”), to which the Fund sold 100,000 Shares (“Initial Shares”), at a price of $0.25 per Share in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“1933 Act”) pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and Regulation D (“Regulation D”) thereof. The Partnership will offer and sell limited partnership interests (the “Interests”) to investors (the “Limited Partners”) in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act pursuant to Regulation D, and will sell its Interests in that offering solely to persons that are both “accredited investors”, as that term is defined in Regulation D, and “qualified purchasers” within the meaning of the 1940 Act. To the extent
called for by the Fund, the Partnership, subject to its approval of the need for such funds, may make further contributions to the capital (“LP Contributions”) of the Fund to the extent of the Limited Partners’ capital commitment to the Partnership (“Committed Equity Capital”). The Partnership intends to seek $350 million in such capital commitments, but reserves the right to commence business with lesser or greater capital commitments.
 
Use of Proceeds. The Fund intends to apply the net proceeds from its initial sale of Shares and the LP Contributions primarily to provide debt financing to selected lower middle market companies. Such debt financing will be primarily in the form of subordinated mezzanine loans and, in the case of unitranche financing, senior secured loans, as well as second lien loans. The Fund generally will seek to purchase equity securities of companies to which it makes loans. The Fund also may extend mezzanine financing in forms other than subordinated loans, such as convertible loans and preferred stock. The net proceeds of this offering also will be used to fund expenses of the Partnership and/or the Fund.

Investment Program
 
Investment Program – General. The Fund’s investment objective is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income from debt investments and capital appreciation from equity investments. There can be no assurance that the Fund will attain its investment objective. The Fund will primarily invest in carefully selected companies in the lower middle market. The Investment Manager defines the “lower middle market” as privately-owned companies with between $2-15 million of EBITDA, and between $10-100 million of revenue. Investments will take the form of mezzanine debt as well as some “unitranche” loans with a first lien on the company’s assets, as well as second lien loans. The Fund generally will seek to purchase equity securities alongside its investments into those same companies, generally with an aggregate cost
of up to 20% of the value of the Fund’s total investment. The Fund also may extend mezzanine financing in forms other than subordinated loans, such as convertible loans and preferred stock. The Fund will make available significant managerial assistance through its officers to certain companies whose securities are held in the Fund’s portfolio, as described under the caption “Regulation.”
 
As a BDC, the Fund must invest at least 70% of its total assets in qualifying assets (“Qualifying Assets”) consisting of (a) interests in “eligible portfolio companies” as defined in the 1940 Act (“Eligible Portfolio Companies”) and (b) certain other assets including cash and cash equivalents. An Eligible Portfolio Company is a United States company that is not an investment company, as defined in the 1940 Act or excluded from the definition of investment company by Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act, and that either: (i) does not have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, or does have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million; or (ii) is actively controlled by a BDC and has an affiliate of a BDC on the Eligible Portfolio Company’s board of directors; or (iii) has total assets of not
more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million; or (iv) meets such other criteria as may be established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Control under the 1940 Act is presumed to exist where a BDC owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the Eligible Portfolio Company. Also included in Qualifying Assets are follow-on investments in a company that met the definition of Eligible Portfolio Company at the time of the Fund’s initial investment, but subsequently does not meet such definition because it has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, if, at the time of the follow-on investment, the Fund (a) owns at least 50% of (i) the greatest number of equity securities of such company, including securities convertible into or exchangeable for such securities, and (ii) the greatest amount of certain debt securities of such company held by the Fund at any time during the period
when such company was an Eligible Portfolio Company, and (b) is one of the twenty largest holders of record of the company’s outstanding voting securities. The Fund may invest up to 30% of its total assets in non-Qualifying Assets, including interests in companies that are not Eligible Portfolio Companies (for example, because the company’s securities are quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market and do not meet the capitalization thresholds described above) and Eligible Portfolio Companies as to which the Fund does not offer to make available significant managerial assistance.
 
Note: The descriptions of investments below reflect the terms and conditions that the Investment Manager expects will be typical based on current market conditions – the terms of individual securities may vary from those described below, and changes in market practices or conditions could change the typical terms and conditions upon which the Fund’s investments will be made. In addition, the summary of the investment limitations applicable to BDCs described above is qualified by the full text of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder.

2



Mezzanine Loans. Mezzanine loans are individually negotiated with each borrower, with detailed documentation of matters such as affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default. Mezzanine loans are typically unsecured, are subordinate to one or more classes of senior secured debt, have priority over equity investors and, in some cases, over junior subordinated lenders. The Fund’s mezzanine loans will typically have a stated term of 5-7 years, with a “bullet” maturity, meaning that, while the lender pays periodic interest payments over the term of the loan, the entire principal amount is due only at maturity. Mezzanine loans frequently require that the borrower pay a prepayment fee, which could be substantial, to make a full or partial voluntary repayment of the loan prior to maturity. Prepayment fees may also apply to mandatory prepayments, such as prepayments upon a change in control.
 
Mezzanine loans generally provide for a portion of the interest due to be paid in cash periodically, typically on a monthly basis (the “cash coupon”), with the remainder “paid in kind,” meaning that the accrued interest is added to the outstanding principal (the “PIK coupon”). In addition to interest payments and prepayment fees, mezzanine loans often require borrowers to pay origination, structuring or commitment fees, as well as the lender’s legal and other out-of-pocket fees.
 
Mezzanine loans are subordinate to more senior indebtedness, and certain senior indebtedness will have security interests in property of the borrower, which could make that property unavailable to satisfy claims by the mezzanine lender.  The mezzanine lender generally will enter into an intercreditor agreement with the more senior lenders, which may limit or delay the ability of the mezzanine lender to receive payment following a default under the senior credit facility, limit or delay the mezzanine lender’s ability to exercise its rights upon a default under the mezzanine debt facility, and otherwise limit the mezzanine lender’s rights.
 
Unitranche Loans. Unitranche (also called “one-stop”) loans combine senior and subordinated debt in one facility. Unitranche loans are typically issued under a single set of documents and carry a single “blended” interest rate (which may be fixed or floating) derived from both the senior and subordinated tranches. Unitranche loans are backed by a first lien on specific assets of the borrower. Unitranche loans typically have a term of five years with amortization over the term of the loan and prepayment permissible, although with some prepayment fees.
 
Unitranche loans may involve fees from the borrower that are similar to those of mezzanine debt. Representations and covenants are generally more restrictive than those for mezzanine debt, and include covenants relating to maintenance and preservation of collateral. Because the senior and subordinated indebtedness are owned by the same lender, documentation generally is less complex and detailed.
 
Second Lien Loans. Second lien loans are secured loans with security interests subordinate to the borrower’s senior secured debt. Thus, second lien loans generally rank between senior secured and mezzanine debt, and are often used to fill a gap in the available financing for a transaction. In some cases, second lien loans are subordinate to senior secured debt with respect to shared collateral, but hold the primary lien with respect to other collateral. Similar to mezzanine loans, the holders of second lien loans typically enter into an intercreditor agreement with the senior secured and mezzanine debtholders, which may limit the rights of the second lien loan holder vis a vis the senior secured debtholders, particularly with respect to acceleration and foreclosure on collateral. Second lien loans may involve fees from the borrower that are similar to those of other tiers of debt. Representations and covenants are generally more
restrictive than those for mezzanine debt, and include covenants relating to maintenance and preservation of collateral.

3



Equity Securities. The Fund will frequently acquire equity securities of a borrower in connection with a mezzanine or unitranche loan. These will typically be co-investments made alongside the equity sponsor. The Fund will typically acquire convertible or participating preferred stock, although the Fund may acquire common stock. The Fund typically will acquire the same or similar equity securities as those owned by the equity sponsor of the borrower.
 
When the Fund acquires an equity security, it typically will become a party to a shareholder agreement between the Fund and the other shareholders of the borrower, and a registration rights agreement granting shareholders the right, under specified circumstances and subject to specified limitations, to cause the company to register the shareholders’ securities for sale under the 1933 Act.
 
The Fund will seek board observer rights with each investment that it makes. In times of financial distress or other situations involving a conflict of interest between a borrower and the Fund, the Fund’s representative would recuse itself from the relevant board meetings and information flows. Because the Fund will typically own a relatively small percentage of the total equity of a borrower, its ability to negotiate the terms of a shareholder agreement generally will be limited, and the Fund typically will have limited corporate governance rights, and limited ability to cause the company or other shareholders to engage in exit transactions such as a sale of the company or an initial public offering.
 
Warrants to Acquire Equity Securities. In lieu of or in addition to acquiring equity securities of a borrower in connection with a mezzanine or unitranche loan, the Fund might acquire warrants to acquire equity securities.
 
The equity securities issuable upon the exercise of warrants generally will have the characteristics described under “Equity Securities” above.
 
Special Situations. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its aggregate investments determined cumulatively over the life of the Fund in special situation investments, including investments in secondary transactions. Special situation investments may be structured as senior debt, convertible debt, or other debt/equity structures. In addition, special situations could include investments in a “troubled” company undergoing a restructuring or recapitalization of its existing debt or equity, and making investments in subordinated debt, providing bridge financing to a company which is in the process of raising additional private equity, planning an initial public offering or is seeking to enter into a business combination through which it would be acquired.
 
Convertible Preferred Securities and Convertible Debt.  The Fund may provide mezzanine financing in the form of convertible preferred securities or convertible debt. Convertible preferred securities may contain provisions comparable to those of mezzanine debt, but rank lower in seniority to all debt of the issuer and lack the covenant provisions that benefit debt securities. Income to the Fund from preferred securities is paid in the form of dividends rather than interest. Dividends, unlike interest, are payable only if declared by the borrower’s board of directors, and might not be legally payable if the borrower is unprofitable or if prohibited by the terms of the borrower’s agreements with lenders.

Investment Policies and Restrictions.
 
Diversification Standards. The Fund will be classified as a “non-diversified” closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act. Until the Fund qualifies as a regulated investment company (“RIC”), it will not be subject to the diversification requirements applicable to RICs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Commencing with the Partnership’s first capital call, the Investment Manager will seek to increase the diversification of the Fund’s portfolio so as to make it possible (commencing with its second year of investment operations) to meet the RIC diversification requirements, as described below. There can be no assurance, however, that the Fund will be able to meet those requirements.
 
To qualify as a RIC, the Fund must meet the issuer diversification standards under the Code that require that, at the close of each quarter of the Fund’s taxable year (a) at least 50% of the value of the Fund’s total assets is represented by (i) cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, and securities of other RICs, and (ii) other securities (counting each investment in such other securities only if the value of such securities does not exceed 5% of the value of the Fund’s total assets and the Fund does not own more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer of such securities), and (b) not more than 25% of the value of the Fund’s total assets is invested in (i) the securities (other than U.S. government securities and securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, (ii) the securities (other than securities of other RICs) of two or more issuers that the Fund controls (defined as 20% or more of the voting power) and that are engaged
in the same, similar, or related trades or businesses, or (iii) the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships. For more information about the requirements imposed on RICs under the Code, please see the disclosure under the caption “Taxation.”
 
Industry Segment Concentration. The Fund will seek to invest no more that 30% of its total assets in securities of companies in any single industry segment. The broad industry categories in which the Fund anticipates that most of the investments will fall (and within each of which there may be several “segments” for purposes of the industry diversification policy) include: industrial goods and services, consumer products, oil and gas-related products and services, health care, food and beverage, technology, and media. The industry segment concentration requirements will not require that the Fund divest securities in its portfolio because of a subsequent change in the value of securities the Fund has previously acquired
 
Investment Guidelines. In selecting investments for the Fund’s portfolio, the Investment Manager will endeavor to meet the investment guidelines as established by the Fund’s board of directors. However, the Fund may make investments that do not conform to one or more of these guidelines when deemed appropriate by the Investment Manager. Such investments might be made if the Investment Manager believes that a failure to conform in one area is offset by exceptional strength in another or is compensated for by a higher yield, favorable equity or warrant issuance or other attractive transaction terms or features.
 
In general, the Fund will pursue the following investment guidelines:
 




·
The Fund will invest in later stage, profitable companies, typically with EBITDA between $2-15 million, and with revenue between $10-100 million.



 




·
Companies may use the capital for a range of purposes, including but not limited to change of control transactions, organic growth, acquisition, debt refinancing and dividend recapitalizations.



 




·
The Fund will invest in companies that the Investment Manager considers to have stable operating performance and a strong position in their respective markets. Underwriting criteria may include some or all of the following:



 




°
Historical profitability, with predictable cash flow and realistic growth prospects;



 




°
Strong management team, with incentives to perform;




5






°
Good strategic position in the market with high barriers to entry, reasonable customer concentration risk and a differentiated product or service;



 




°
Strong operating performance with good margins;



 




°
Strong balance sheet and liquidity;



 




°
Good reputation among customers and suppliers; and



 




°
Backing by a high-quality financial sponsor.



 




·
Transaction guidelines will include:



 




°
Debt investments ranging from $2-30 million;



 




°
Equity investments totaling up to 20% of the total investment in a deal;



 




°
Sufficient cash flow to cover debt service expense; and



 




°
Underwriting parameters will be set and regularly reviewed by the Investment Manager and team and may include: maximum leverage multiples, minimum debt service coverage ratios, and minimum capitalization requirements.



 
International Investments. With certain exceptions, as a BDC, the Fund may invest no more than 30% of its total assets in companies which are not “Eligible Portfolio Companies.” An “Eligible Portfolio Company” must be organized under the laws of, and have its principal place of business in, the United States. Therefore, the Fund could invest up to, but no more than, 30% of its total assets in foreign based companies. It is anticipated that the majority of non-U.S. investments would be in companies doing business in North America or Western Europe. These requirements generally will not require the Fund to divest an investment if this threshold is exceeded due to market movements.
 
Leverage. The Fund intends to borrow money from and issue debt securities to banks, insurance companies and other lenders to obtain additional funds to originate loans, if such borrowings are available on terms that are acceptable to the Investment Manager and the board of directors of the Fund. It is possible, in the event of the tightening of the credit markets, that the Fund may not be able to secure such borrowings on acceptable terms. See the discussion at Item lA under the captions “Risk Factors – General Economic, Market and Political Conditions” and “Risk Factors - Regulatory Risks.” The Fund may also seek to obtain leverage from the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) by forming a subsidiary that will obtain a license as a Small Business Investment Company (an “SBIC”). See the discussion at Item 1A under the caption “Risk Factors - Risks Associated with the Fund’s
SBIC Subsidiaries.” Any borrowings of the Fund (other than those through its SBIC, if one is formed), will be subject to the Asset Coverage requirements under the 1940 Act. See the discussion below under the caption “Regulation.” The use of leverage increases investment risk. See the discussion at Item lA under the caption “Risk Factors - Leverage.”
 
Temporary Investments. Pending investment, and until distributions to the stockholders are made, the Fund and the Partnership will invest excess cash in: (i) time deposits, certificates of deposit and similar instruments of highly-rated banks; (ii) securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities; (iii) repurchase agreements that are: (a) issued by highly-rated banks or securities dealers; and (b) fully collateralized by U.S. government securities; (iv) short-term high-quality debt instruments of U.S. corporations; and (v) money market funds and other pooled investment funds whose investments are restricted to those described above. The average maturity of such investments, weighted by their par value, will not exceed 90 days.

6



Other Investment Policies. The Fund will not sell securities short (except to the extent the Fund has a warrant for, or owns, shares equal to the number of shares which is the subject of the proposed short sale), purchase securities on margin (except to the extent the Fund’s permitted borrowings are deemed to constitute margin purchases), purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts (except interest rate hedging transactions in connection with the Fund’s permitted borrowings), or purchase or sell real estate. The Fund may, however, write puts and calls, and acquire options, as a hedge for equity investments and to increase return through a covered call. The Fund will not underwrite the securities of other companies, except to the extent it may be deemed an underwriter upon the disposition of restricted securities acquired in the ordinary
course of its business. The Fund may, however, use borrowed funds for its lending activities. See the discussion at Item 1A under the caption “Risk Factors - Leverage.”
 
The Fund’s investment objectives, investment policies and investment guidelines (other than its status as a BDC) are not fundamental policies and may be changed by the Fund’s board of directors at any time.
 
Regulation.
 
The Fund
 
After filing an election to be treated as a BDC, a company may not withdraw its election without securing the approval of the holders of a majority of its outstanding voting securities (as defined under the 1940 Act).  The following is a brief description of the BDC regime under the 1940 Act and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder.
 
Generally, to be eligible to elect BDC status, a company must engage in the business of furnishing capital and offering significant managerial assistance to Eligible Portfolio Companies. More specifically, in order to qualify as a BDC, a company must (i) be a domestic company; (ii) have registered a class of its securities, or have filed a registration statement, with the SEC pursuant to Section 12 of the 1934 Act; (iii) operate for the purpose of investing in the securities of certain types of Eligible Portfolio Companies; (iv) either make available significant managerial assistance to such Eligible Portfolio Companies or the Eligible Portfolio Company (x) has total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million or (y) meets such criteria as the SEC otherwise may provide; (v) have a majority of disinterested directors; and (vi) file (or under certain circumstances, intend to file) a proper notice of election with
the SEC.
 
“Making available significant managerial assistance” is defined under the 1940 Act, in relevant part, as: (i) an arrangement whereby the BDC, through its officers, directors, employees or general partners, offers to provide and, if accepted, does provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives of a portfolio company; or (ii) the exercise by a BDC of a controlling influence over the management or polices of the portfolio company by the BDC acting individually or as part of a group acting together which controls the portfolio company. The officers of the Fund, and the officers of the Investment Manager, on behalf of the Fund, intend to offer to provide managerial assistance, including advice on equipment acquisition and financing, cash flow and expense management, general financing opportunities, acquisition opportunities and opportunities to access the public securities markets, to the great
majority of companies to whom the Fund provides financing. The right to offer such assistance will typically be provided in the negotiated documents for the loan transactions. In some instances, officers of the Fund may serve on the board of directors of borrowers or of companies in which it makes an equity investment.

7



An “Eligible Portfolio Company” is a domestic company with its principal place of business in the United States that is not an investment company, as defined in the 1940 Act, or excluded from the definition of an investment company by Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act, and that either: (i) does not have a class of securities registered on a national securities exchange, or does have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million; or (ii) is actively controlled by a BDC and has an affiliate of a BDC on the Eligible Portfolio Company’s board of directors; (iii) has total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million; or (iv) meets such other criteria as may be established by the SEC. Control under the 1940 Act is presumed to exist where a BDC owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting
securities of the Eligible Portfolio Company.
 
The 1940 Act prohibits or restricts BDCs from investing in certain types of companies, such as brokerage firms, insurance companies, investment banking firms, and investment companies. Moreover, the 1940 Act limits the type of assets that BDCs may acquire to certain prescribed “Qualifying Assets” and certain assets necessary for its operations (such as office furniture, equipment, and facilities) if, at the time of acquisition, less than 70% of the value of the BDC’s assets consist of Qualifying Assets. Qualifying Assets include: (i) privately acquired securities of companies that were Eligible Portfolio Companies at the time such BDC acquired their securities; (ii) securities of bankrupt or insolvent companies; (iii) securities of Eligible Portfolio Companies controlled by a BDC; (iv) securities received in exchange for or distributed with respect to any of the foregoing; and (v) cash items, government securities and high-quality short-term debt.
Also included in Qualifying Assets are follow-on investments in a company that met the definition of Eligible Portfolio Company at the time of the Fund’s initial investment, but subsequently does not meet such definition because it has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, if, at the time of the follow-on investment, the Fund (a) owns at least 50% of (i) the greatest number of equity securities of such company, including securities convertible into or exchangeable for such securities, and (ii) the greatest amount of certain debt securities of such company held by the Fund at any time during the period when such company was an Eligible Portfolio Company, and (b) is one of the twenty largest holders of record of the company’s outstanding voting securities. The 1940 Act also places restrictions on the nature of transactions in which, and the persons from whom,
securities can be purchased in order for the securities to be considered Qualifying Assets. Such restrictions include limiting purchases to transactions not involving a public offering.
 
The Fund, upon election as a BDC, may sell its securities at a price that is below its net asset value per share under limited circumstances. These include certain types of rights offerings, as well as offerings approved by a majority of the Fund’s disinterested directors upon their determination that such sale would be in the best interests of the Fund and its stockholders and upon the approval by the holders of a majority of its outstanding voting securities, including a majority of the voting securities held by non-affiliated persons, of the policy or practice of making such sales within one year of such sale. A majority of the disinterested directors also must determine in good faith, in consultation with the underwriters of the offering if the offering is underwritten, that the price of the securities being sold is not less than a price which closely approximates market value of the securities, less any distribution discounts or commissions. As defined
in the 1940 Act, the term “majority of the outstanding voting securities” of the Fund means the vote of (i) 67% or more of the shares present at a meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of outstanding shares, whichever is less.

8



Many of the transactions involving a company and its affiliates (as well as affiliates of those affiliates) which are prohibited without the prior approval of the SEC for registered investment companies are permissible for BDCs, including the Fund, upon the prior approval of a majority of the Fund’s disinterested directors and a majority of the directors having no financial interest in the transactions. Some transactions, however involving certain persons related to the Fund, including its directors, officers, the Investment Manager and the Partnership may still require the prior approval of the SEC. In general: (i) any person who owns, controls or holds power to vote more than 5% of the Fund’s outstanding shares; (ii) any director, executive officer, or general partner of a person described in clause (i); and (iii) any person who directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, a person described in clause (i), must
obtain the prior approval of a majority of the Fund’s disinterested directors and, in some situations, the prior approval of the SEC before engaging in certain transactions with the Fund or any company controlled by the Fund. Other persons, such as persons who control the BDC and certain persons under common control with the BDC, must seek prior approval of the SEC for certain transactions. The 1940 Act generally does not restrict transactions between the Fund and its Eligible Portfolio Companies absent some other prohibited affiliation. Because Siguler Guff (as defined below in Item 5) is a private equity sponsor with other products and lines of business, these restrictions may limit the investment opportunities that are made available to the Fund. While a BDC may change the nature of its business so as to cease being a BDC (and in connection therewith withdraw its election to be treated as a BDC) only if authorized to do so by a majority vote (as defined by the 1940
Act) of its outstanding voting securities, shareholder approval of changes in other fundamental investment policies of a BDC is not required (in contrast to the general 1940 Act requirement which requires shareholder approval for a change in any fundamental investment policy).
 
Under  the  1940 Act, the  Fund  may  not  incur borrowings  unless, immediately after  the  borrowing is incurred, such borrowings would have “Asset  Coverage” of at least 200%. “Asset Coverage” means the ratio which the value of the Fund’s total assets, less all liabilities not represented by liabilities constituting “senior securities” under the 1940 Act, bears to the aggregate amount of such borrowings and senior securities. The practical effect of this restriction is to limit the Fund’s borrowings and other senior securities to 50% of its total assets less its liabilities other than the borrowings and other senior securities. The 1940 Act also requires that, with respect to certain types of indebtedness, provisions be made to prohibit the declaration of any dividend or other distribution on the Shares (other than a dividend payable in Shares), or the repurchase by the Fund of Shares, if, after payment of such dividend or repurchase
of Shares, the Asset Coverage of such borrowings would be below 200%. If the Fund is unable to pay dividends or distributions in the amounts required under the Code, it may not be able to qualify for the pass-through status as a RIC or, if qualified, to continue to so qualify. If the Fund establishes an SBIC, borrowings by the SBIC will not be counted against the Fund’s regulatory leverage limitations.
 
The SBIC Subsidiary
 
The Fund may make investments in qualifying small businesses through a wholly-owned subsidiary (the “SBIC Subsidiary”), which will apply to be licensed by the SBA to act as an SBIC and as a result, will be subject to SBA regulations. The rules and regulations governing SBICs, including the controlling statute, the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended (the “SBIC Act”), are lengthy and complex. The Fund will provide a copy of the rules and regulations to any prospective investor upon request. Additional information about SBICs may also be found on the SBA’s website at http://www.sba.gov/INV/.
 
Taxation.
 
The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences which may be relevant to prospective investors. The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, administrative rulings, court cases, and other applicable law, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.

The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to invest in the Fund. In addition, except to the extent specifically addressed below, it does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules, such as governmental entities, bank holding companies, insurance companies, organizations exempt from taxation, non-U.S. persons, and pass-through entities, including partnerships and entities and arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal tax purposes, or investors in such entities. Such investors should consult their own tax advisers as to the applicability of such special rules. In addition, the discussion does not address the state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences of an investment in the Fund. All prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisers about the
U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. and other tax consequences of purchasing and holding and disposing of Shares.
 
Taxation of the Fund as an Ordinary Corporation
 
It is anticipated that, commencing with the second year of its investment operations, the Fund will seek to meet the requirements, including diversification requirements, to qualify for the special pass-through status available to RICs under the Code, and thus to be relieved of federal income tax on that part of its net investment income and realized capital gains that it distributes to stockholders. Unless and until the Fund meets these requirements, it will be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income for that year (even if that income is distributed to the stockholders) and all distributions out of its earnings and profits will be taxable to the stockholders as dividends; thus, such income will be subject to two layers of tax (although corporate stockholders may be entitled to a dividends-received deduction). There is no assurance that the Fund will meet the requirements to qualify as a RIC.
 
Taxation of the Fund as a RIC
 
Consequences of Converting From an Ordinary Corporation to a RIC. In order to qualify as a RIC, the Fund must, at the end of the first year in which it so qualifies, have no accumulated earnings and profits from years in which it was not taxed as a RIC. To meet this requirement, the Fund must, before the end of the first year in which it qualifies as a RIC, distribute as dividends all of its accumulated earnings and profits. In addition to the foregoing, pursuant to the Treasury regulations, the Fund must either (i) recognize gain on the disposition of any asset during the subsequent recognition period (generally 10 years) (the “Recognition Period”) beginning on the first day of the first taxable year for which the Fund qualifies for pass-through status as a RIC that is held by the Fund as of the beginning of such Recognition Period, to the extent of the excess of (a) the fair market value of such asset as of the beginning
of such Recognition Period over (b) the Fund’s adjusted tax basis in such asset as of the beginning of such Recognition Period (such excess, hereinafter, “built-in gain”), taxable at the highest regular corporate rates or (ii) elect to immediately recognize and pay tax on any such built-in gain with respect to any of its portfolio holdings and, as described above, distribute the earnings and profits from such deemed sales. As a RIC, the Fund generally would not be able to use any net operating loss carryforwards relating to periods prior to the first year in which the Fund qualifies as a RIC.
 
RIC Qualification Requirements. In order to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, the Fund must, among other things, (1) at all times during the taxable year, have a valid and effective election to be a BDC under Sections 6(f) and 54 of the 1940 Act; (2) derive at least 90% of its gross income for each taxable year from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income (including gains from options, futures and forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership (as defined in Section 851(h) of the Code); (3) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable
year:  (a) at least 50% of the value of the Fund’s total assets is represented by (i) cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, and securities of other RICs, and (ii) other securities (counting each investment in such other securities only if the value of such securities does not exceed 5% of the value of the Fund’s total assets and the Fund does not own more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer of such securities), and (b) not more than 25% of the value of the Fund’s total assets is invested in (i) the securities (other than U.S. government securities and securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, (ii) the securities (other than securities of other RICs) of two or more issuers that the Fund controls (defined as 20% or more of the voting power) and that are engaged in the same, similar, or related trades or businesses, or (iii) the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships; and (4) file an election to be a RIC.

10



If the Fund qualifies as a RIC and properly distributes to its stockholders each taxable year an amount equal to or exceeding the sum of (1) 90% of its “investment company taxable income” as that term is defined in the Code (which includes, among other things, dividends, taxable interest, and the excess of any net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, as reduced by certain deductible expenses) without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and (2) 90% of the excess of its gross tax-exempt interest, if any, over certain disallowed deductions, the Fund generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any income of the fund, including “net capital gain” (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss), distributed to the stockholders. However, if the Fund meets such distribution requirements and, thus, is eligible for pass-through status, but chooses to retain some portion of its
investment company taxable income or net capital gain, it generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate income tax rates on the amount retained. A distribution of warrants or equity investments to its stockholders will be treated as a sale by the Fund of such assets with the excess of the fair market value of those assets over their tax basis being the amount of the income or gain to the Fund arising from the distribution.
 
If, after initially qualifying as a RIC, the Fund fails to qualify as a RIC that is eligible for pass-through status for any taxable year, it will be treated as a U.S. corporation subject to U.S. federal income tax, thereby subjecting any income earned by the Fund to tax at the corporate level and to a further tax at the stockholder level when such income is distributed. In such a case, there may be substantial tax and other costs associated with re-qualifying as a RIC.
 
If the Fund qualifies as a RIC, the Fund will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax (“Excise Tax”) to the extent it fails to distribute by the end of any calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for such calendar year and 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the one-year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year, plus certain other undistributed amounts. For these purposes, any taxable income retained by the Fund, and on which it pays federal income tax, will be treated as having been distributed.
 
The Fund currently intends to distribute in each year for which it qualifies as a RIC substantially all of its net investment income and capital gain net income so as not to be subject to either federal income tax or Excise Tax.
 
Effect of Certain Investments and Investment Practices. The Fund’s activities generally may be unlike the typical activities engaged in by most investment companies that seek to qualify as RICs for federal income tax purposes. Certain aspects of these activities may at times make it more difficult for the Fund to satisfy the requirements for qualifying as a RIC than is the case for other investment companies. For example, because the Fund generally will call capital from the Partnership on an “as needed” basis and will have relatively few investments in its early period of operations, the Fund will not be holding substantial amounts of “cash and cash items” that could be counted towards the Fund’s RIC diversification requirements. As noted above, it is anticipated that the Fund will not meet the RIC requirements (and in particular the diversification requirement) until the second year of its investment operations,
and there is no assurance that the Fund will meet the requirements to qualify as a RIC within that timeframe.

11



To the extent that the terms of certain loans provide for the receipt by the Fund of additional interest at the end of the loan term (known as residual income), the Fund would be required to accrue such residual income over the life of the loan, and to include such accrued income in its gross income for each taxable year even if it receives no portion of such residual income in that year. Thus, in order to meet the distribution requirement and avoid payment of income taxes or the Excise Tax on undistributed income, the Fund may be required in a particular year to distribute as a dividend an amount in excess of the total amount of income it actually receives. Those distributions will be made from the Fund’s cash assets, from amounts received through amortization of loans or from borrowed funds.
 
Taxation of the Fund’s Stockholders if the Fund Qualifies as a RIC
 
General. Generally, dividends paid to the stockholders that are attributable to the Fund’s net investment income (which, for this purpose, includes net short-term capital gains) will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income. Since the Fund’s income is expected to be derived primarily from sources that do not pay “qualified dividend income,” such dividends generally will not qualify for the maximum 20% federal income tax rate available to individuals on qualified dividend income. Capital gain distributions are taxable to stockholders as long-term capital gains regardless of how long the stockholder has held its Shares. It is not anticipated that a significant portion of the Fund’s dividends will qualify for the dividends-received deduction for corporate stockholders.
 
Distributions are generally includible in the income of the stockholders at the time the distribution is received. Any distribution, however, declared by the Fund as of a record date in October, November or December, and paid to the stockholders the following January, is deemed to have been paid by the Fund and received by the stockholders on December 31 of the year declared for both federal income and Excise Tax purposes. This will prevent the application of the Excise Tax, discussed above, to the Fund as a result of certain delays in the payment of the dividends.
 
If, for any calendar year, the Fund’s total distributions exceed its current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess will generally be considered a tax-free return of capital to the stockholders to the extent of each stockholder’s adjusted basis in its shares and then as capital gain. The amount treated as tax-free return of capital will reduce the adjusted tax basis of the stockholders’ Shares, thereby increasing the potential gain or reducing the potential loss on the sale of the Shares.
 
In general, upon the sale or other disposition of Shares, the seller will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale and its adjusted basis in the shares. Any loss on the sale recognized will be disallowed to the extent the seller has acquired (or entered into a contract to acquire) substantially identical shares within a period beginning 30 days before the disposition and ending 30 days after the disposition. In such case, the basis of the shares acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss. Gain or loss realized upon a sale of shares generally will be treated as a capital gain or loss. The gain or loss will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the shares were held for more than one year. In addition, if the shares sold were not held for more than six months, any loss on the sale will be treated as long-term
capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividend received by the seller with respect to such shares.
 
The Fund is required to withhold 28% of reportable payments (which may include dividends and capital gain distributions) to U.S. individuals and certain other U.S. non-corporate stockholders who do not provide the Fund with a correct taxpayer identification number on IRS Form W-9 or who otherwise are subject to backup withholding. Each non-U.S. stockholder will need to provide the appropriate IRS Form W-8 (W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8IMY or W-8EXP) to demonstrate it is not subject to backup withholding.

12



The Fund will notify stockholders following the end of each calendar year of the amounts of dividends and capital gain distributions paid or deemed paid during the year.
 
Certain Considerations for Tax-Exempt Investors. Qualified plans, individuals retirement accounts and investors exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code (collectively “tax-exempt entities”) are generally exempt from taxation except to the extent that they have “unrelated business taxable income” (“UBTI”) (determined in accordance with Sections 511-514 of the Code). If the Fund qualifies as a RIC, it is likely that distributions by the Fund to a stockholder that is a tax-exempt entity that are treated as dividends will not be considered UBTI and, therefore, will be exempt from federal income tax even if the Fund borrows to acquire its investment assets. Under Section 512(b) of the Code, UBTI does not include dividends received by a tax-exempt entity. As a general rule, the income tax provisions relating to corporations apply to RICs unless Subchapter M of the Code provides otherwise and, thus,
Section 512(b) should apply to exclude from UBTI dividends paid by a RIC to a tax-exempt entity. This conclusion is also supported by Revenue Ruling 66-106, which applies Section 512(b) to exclude from UBTI dividends paid to the tax-exempt stockholders of a real estate investment trust, a conduit entity that invests in real estate and is substantially similar to a RIC for tax purposes, on the same theory. If a tax-exempt entity, however, borrows money to purchase its interests in the Company, a portion of its income from the Company will constitute UBTI pursuant to the “debt-financed property” rules of the Code.
 
Certain organizations that are exempt from taxation under the Code are subject to different rules. For example, a charitable remainder trust (as defined in Section 664 of the Code) that realizes UBTI during a taxable year must pay an excise tax annually of an amount equal to 100% of such income. Each investor that is a tax-exempt entity is urged to consult with its own tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. income and other tax treatment of its investment in the Fund based upon its particular circumstances.
 
Certain Considerations for Non-U.S. Investors. Absent a specific statutory exemption, dividends other than capital gain dividends paid by the Fund to a stockholder that is not a “U.S. person” within the meaning of the Code (a “foreign stockholder”) are subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) even if they are funded by income or gains (such as portfolio interest, short-term capital gains, or foreign-source dividend and interest income) that, if paid to a foreign stockholder directly, would not be subject to withholding. Distributions properly reported as capital gain dividends generally are not subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax.
 
For distributions with respect to taxable years of the Fund beginning before January 1, 2014, the Fund was not required to withhold any amounts (i) with respect to distributions from U.S.-source interest income of types similar to those not subject to U.S. federal income tax if earned directly by an individual foreign stockholder, to the extent such distributions were properly reported as such by the Fund in a written notice to stockholders (“interest-related dividends”), and (ii) with respect to distributions of net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses to the extent such distributions were properly reported as such by the Fund in a written notice to stockholders (“short-term capital gain dividends”). This exception to withholding for interest-related dividends did not apply to distributions to a foreign stockholder (A) that had  not provided a satisfactory statement
that the beneficial owner was  not a U.S. person, (B) to the extent that the dividend is attributable to certain interest on an obligation if the foreign stockholder was the issuer or was a 10% stockholder of the issuer, (C) that was within certain foreign countries that had inadequate information exchange with the United States, or (D) to the extent the dividend was attributable to interest paid by a person that is a related person of the foreign stockholder and the foreign stockholder was a controlled foreign corporation. The exception to withholding for short-term capital gain dividends did not apply to (A) distributions to an individual foreign stockholder who was present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the year of the distribution and (B) distributions subject to special rules regarding the disposition of U.S. real property interests, as described below. The Fund was permitted to report such part of its dividends
as interest-related and/or short-term capital gain dividends as were eligible, but was not required to do so. In the case of shares held through an intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if the Fund reports all or a portion of a payment as an interest-related or short-term capital gain dividend to stockholders.

13



This exemption from withholding for interest-related and short-term capital gain dividends has expired for distributions with respect to taxable years of the Fund beginning on or after January 1, 2014. Therefore, the Fund (or intermediary, as applicable) is currently required to withhold on distributions to foreign stockholders attributable to net interest or short-term capital gains that were formerly eligible for this withholding exemption. It is currently unclear whether Congress will extend this exemption from withholding for interest-related and short-term capital gain dividends for distributions with respect to taxable years of the Fund beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and what the terms of such an extension would be, including whether such extension would have retroactive effect.
 
Foreign stockholders should contact their intermediaries regarding the application of these rules to their accounts.
 
A foreign stockholder is not, in general, subject to U.S. federal income tax on gains (and is not allowed a deduction for losses) realized on the sale of shares of the Fund or on capital gain dividends unless (i) such gain or dividend is effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign stockholder of a trade or business within the United States, (ii) in the case of a foreign stockholder that is an individual, the stockholder is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the year of the sale or the receipt of the capital gain dividend and certain other conditions are met or (iii) the special rules relating to gain attributable to the sale or exchange of “U.S. real property interests” (“USRPIs”) apply to the foreign stockholder’s sale of shares of the Fund or to the capital gain dividend the foreign stockholder received (as described below).
 
Foreign stockholders with respect to whom income from the Fund is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the foreign stockholder within the United States will in general be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the income derived from the Fund at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, residents or domestic corporations, whether such income is received in cash or reinvested in shares of the Fund and, in the case of a foreign corporation, may also be subject to a branch profits tax. If a foreign stockholder is eligible for the benefits of a tax treaty, any effectively connected income or gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis only if it is also attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the stockholder in the United States. More generally, foreign stockholders who are residents in a country with an income tax treaty with the United States may obtain different tax results than those
described herein, and are urged to consult their tax advisors.
 
Special rules would apply if the Fund were either a “U.S. real property holding corporation” (“USRPHC”) or would be a USRPHC but for the operation of certain exceptions to the definition thereof. Very generally, a USRPHC is a domestic corporation that holds USRPIs the fair market value of which equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market values of the corporation’s USRPIs, interests in real property located outside the United States, and other trade or business assets. USRPIs are generally defined as any interest in U.S. real property and any interest (other than solely as a creditor) in a USRPHC or, very generally, an entity that has been a USRPHC in the last five years. If an interest in the Fund were a USRPI, a greater-than-5% foreign stockholder generally would be required to file a U.S. tax return in connection with the sale of its Fund shares, and pay related taxes due on any gain realized on the sale.

14



If the Fund were a USRPHC or would be a USRPHC but for the exceptions referred to above, under a special “look-through” rule, any distributions by the Fund to a foreign stockholder attributable directly or indirectly to distributions received by the Fund from a lower-tier REIT that the Fund is required to treat as USRPI gain in its hands, generally would be subject to U.S. tax withholding. In addition, such distributions could result in the foreign stockholder being required to file a U.S. tax return and pay tax on the distributions at regular U.S. federal income tax rates. The consequences to a foreign stockholder, including the rate of such withholding and character of such distributions (e.g., as ordinary income or USRPI gain), would vary depending upon the extent of the foreign stockholder’s current and past ownership of the Fund. Prior to January 1, 2014, the special “look-through”
rule described above for distributions by the Fund to foreign stockholders also applied to distributions attributable to (i) gains realized on the disposition of USRPIs by the Fund and (ii) distributions received by the Fund from a lower-tier RIC that the Fund was required to treat as USRPI gain in its hands. It is currently unclear whether Congress will extend these former “look-through” provisions to distributions made on or after January 1, 2014, and what the terms of any such extension would be, including whether any such extension would have retroactive effect.
 
Foreign stockholders should consult their tax advisers and, if holding shares through intermediaries, their intermediaries, concerning the application of these rules to their investment in the Fund.
 
Provisions of FATCA. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) generally requires the Fund to obtain information sufficient to identify the status of each of its stockholders under FATCA, as described more fully below. If a stockholder fails to provide this information or otherwise fails to comply with FATCA, the Fund may be required to withhold under FATCA at a rate of 30% with respect to that stockholder on dividends, including capital gain distributions, and the proceeds of the sale, redemption or exchange of Fund Shares. If a payment by the Fund is subject to FATCA withholding, the Fund is required to withhold even if such payment would otherwise be exempt from withholding under the rules applicable to foreign stockholders described above (e.g., capital gain distributions and short-term capital gain and interest-related dividends), beginning as early as July 1, 2014.
 
Payments to a stockholder will generally not be subject to FATCA withholding, provided the stockholder provides the Fund with such certifications, waivers or other documentation or information as the Fund requires, including, to the extent required, with regard to such stockholder’s direct and indirect owners, to establish the stockholder’s FATCA status and otherwise to comply with these rules. In order to avoid withholding, a stockholder that is a “foreign financial institution” (“FFI”) must either (i) become a “participating FFI” by entering into a valid U.S. tax compliance agreement with the IRS, (ii) qualify for an exception from the requirement to enter into such an agreement, for example by becoming a “deemed compliant FFI,” or (iii) be covered by an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the United States and a non-U.S. government to implement FATCA and improve international tax compliance. In any of these cases,
the investing FFI generally will be required to provide the Fund with appropriate identifiers, certifications or documentation concerning its status.
 
The Fund will disclose the information that it receives from (or concerning) its stockholders to the IRS, non-U.S. taxing authorities or other parties as necessary to comply with FATCA, related intergovernmental agreements or other applicable law or regulation.
 
Each prospective investor is urged to consult its tax adviser regarding the applicability of FATCA and any other reporting requirements with respect to the prospective investor’s own situation, including investments through an intermediary.

15



Employees.
 
The Fund expects to have no employees and will rely on the Investment Manager and its officers (all of whom are employed and paid by the Investment Manager) to administer its affairs, subject to the supervision of the Fund’s board of directors.
 
(d)  Financial Information About Geographic Areas.
 
Not applicable; the Fund has not yet commenced business.
 



ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS



 
Lack of Operating History. The Fund will begin operations upon the initial closing and has no operating history with which to evaluate its future performance.
 
Risks Associated with Investing in Smaller and Lower Middle Market Companies. The Fund is expected to invest primarily in mezzanine, unitranche and second lien loans in privately-held companies with EBITDA between approximately $2 million and $15 million. Companies of this size typically have weaker financial and human resources than larger companies, have less extensive research and development, manufacturing, marketing and/or service capabilities, and may be susceptible to competition from larger and better capitalized companies. Smaller companies often depend upon the management talents and efforts of a small group of individuals, and the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a significant impact on the investment returns from a particular company. Also, smaller companies frequently have less diverse product lines and smaller market presence than larger companies, and may not have as great
an ability to raise additional capital. Smaller companies may have a shorter history of operations as compared to larger companies, which could make it more difficult for the Fund to evaluate their future performance. There is often less publicly available information about smaller companies than larger companies. They are thus generally less liquid and more vulnerable to economic downturns and may experience substantial variations in operating results.
 
Although the Fund will seek to mitigate these risks through diversification and conservative deal terms (covenants, monitoring, board observation rights, etc.), it must be anticipated that (a) one or more of the Fund’s investments (collectively, “Portfolio Investments”) may be unprofitable over the Fund’s investment life and (c) the Fund will incur losses on some of the Portfolio Investments.
 
Leverage. Borrowings to finance the acquisition of Portfolio Investments may occur at the Fund level or the portfolio company level, if any or all directly incur leverage in connection with a Portfolio Investment or an investment by a portfolio company, as applicable. The leverage used by the Fund may take the form of indebtedness for borrowed money as well as financial leverage in the form of options and other similar transactions. Any borrowings of the Fund will be subject to the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act. See the discussion at Item 1 under the caption “Regulation.”
 
Leverage may have important adverse consequences to the Fund and its portfolio companies. The amount borrowed in connection with an investment and the interest rates on those borrowings, which may fluctuate from time to time, as well as the fees and other costs of borrowing, may have a marked effect on such investment’s performance. The borrower may be subject to restrictive financial and operating covenants. Leverage also may impair the borrowers’ ability to finance their future operations and capital needs. As a result, their flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to business opportunities may be limited. A leveraged investment’s income and net assets will tend to fluctuate at a greater rate than if leverage were not used. In addition, if an investment has a leveraged capital structure, it will be subject to increased exposure to adverse economic factors such as a significant rise in interest rates, a severe downturn
in the economy or deterioration in the condition of the borrower or its industry. Furthermore, a borrower that has secured its leverage through the pledging of collateral may, if such borrower is unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet principal and interest payments on its indebtedness, be subject to risk that a lender seizes its assets through margin calls or otherwise.

16



The Fund (and the SBIC Subsidiary, if one is formed) will each pay a management fee (the “Investment Management Fee”) to the Investment Manager. The Investment Management Fee base will include the cost basis of portfolio investments acquired with borrowed funds.  This effectively increases the cost of the Fund’s (and the SBIC Subsidiary’s, if applicable) borrowings by the incremental Investment Management Fee.
 
If the Fund borrows at variable rates without hedging to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations, and makes the bulk of its loans at fixed rates, an increase in prevailing interest rates would narrow the spread between the Fund’s cost of capital and its investment return, to the detriment of the Fund’s performance. In addition, because the terms of the Fund’s borrowing facilities are set for relatively long periods of time, reductions in the returns available from the Fund’s investments due to changes in prevailing rates could make the use of leverage unattractive unless the terms of the borrowing facility were renegotiated.
 
Risks Associated with Loans. The Fund will invest primarily in senior secured and unsecured loans. The Fund generally will make the loan directly, although occasionally loans may be originated and syndicated by banks or other financial institutions, or acquired in the secondary market. Loans generally will not be readily marketable and will be subject to restrictions on resale. In some cases, negotiations involved in disposing of indebtedness may require weeks to complete. Consequently, some indebtedness may be difficult or impossible to dispose of readily at what the Investment Manager believes to be a fair price. In addition, loans are often less liquid than other types of debt securities, particularly in times of significant market dislocation.
 
Lenders depend primarily upon the creditworthiness of the corporate or other borrower for payment of principal and interest. If the Fund does not receive scheduled interest or principal payments on such indebtedness, the value of the Portfolio Investments would be adversely affected. The Fund may invest in secured and unsecured loans. Loans that are fully secured may offer the Fund more protection than an unsecured loan in the event of non-payment of scheduled interest or principal. However, there is no assurance that the liquidation of any collateral from a secured loan would satisfy the borrower’s obligation, or that such collateral could be liquidated. In the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower, the Fund could experience delays or limitations in its ability to realize the benefits of any collateral securing a loan.
 
Loans may permit or require, in addition to scheduled payments of interest and principal, the prepayment of the loan from free cash flow. The degree to which borrowers prepay loans, whether as a contractual requirement or at their election, may be affected by prevailing interest rates, general business conditions, the financial condition of the borrower and competitive conditions among lenders, among others. As such, prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy. Upon a prepayment, either in part or in full, the actual outstanding debt on which the Fund derives interest income will be reduced. The effect of prepayments on the Fund’s performance may or may not be mitigated by the receipt of prepayment fees and/or the Fund’s reinvestment of prepayments in other loans that have comparable yields. See “Credit Risk” below.

17



Credit Risk. The Fund is subject to credit risk, i.e., the risk that an issuer or borrower will default in the payment of principal and/or interest on an instrument. Credit risk also includes the risk that a counterparty to a derivatives instrument (e.g., a swap counterparty) will be unwilling or unable to meet its obligations. Financial strength and solvency of an issuer or borrower are the primary factors influencing credit risk. Degree of subordination, lack or inadequacy of collateral or credit enhancement for a debt instrument may affect the Fund’s credit risk. There are no restrictions on the credit quality of the Portfolio Investments. Securities in which the Fund may invest generally will not have been rated by any rating agency, with the result that the Investment Manager must rely on its own evaluation of the financial strength of the borrower, without
the benefit of rating agency research.
 
Subordination of Investments. Portfolio Investments may be in subordinated loans, structurally subordinated loans, mezzanine loans and other structured investments and preferred equity interests or equity interests of an issuer. These Portfolio Investments will be subordinated to the senior obligations of the property or issuer, either contractually, structurally or inherently due to the nature of the securities. Greater credit risks are usually attached to these subordinated investments than to investments in senior obligations. In addition, these securities may not be protected by financial or other covenants, such as limitations upon additional indebtedness, typically protecting the senior debt, and may have limited liquidity. Adverse changes in the borrower’s financial condition and/or in general economic conditions may impair the ability of the borrower to make payments on the subordinated securities
and cause it to default more quickly with respect to such securities than with respect to the borrower’s senior obligations. Holders of subordinated securities are generally not entitled to receive any payments in bankruptcy or liquidation until senior creditors are paid in full. In addition, in many cases, the Fund’s management of its investment and its remedies with respect thereto, including the ability to foreclose on any collateral securing such investment will be limited by restrictions benefiting more senior lenders and contractual intercreditor provisions.
 
Interest Rate Risk. “Interest rate risk” refers to the risks associated with market changes in interest rates. In general, rising interest rates will negatively impact the price of fixed rate debt instruments and falling interest rates will have a positive effect on the price of fixed rate debt instruments. The prices of long term debt obligations generally fluctuate more than prices of short term debt obligations as interest rates change. To the extent the Fund invests primarily in longer term debt obligations, the Fund will be impacted to a greater degree by changes in market interest rates than if the Fund invested primarily in short term debt securities. Even in the case of debt investments that are guar­anteed or insured in whole or in part, such guarantees and insurance do not protect the Fund from declines in market value caused by changes in interest rates. However, to the extent that the Fund
holds a loan to maturity (as will generally be the case), interim changes in the value of the loan due to interest rate fluctuations will not affect the Fund’s ultimate return on the investment, provided interest and principal are paid in a timely fashion.
 
Increasing interest rates may also increase the amount of interest owed with respect to different types of financing the Fund may enter into in order to finance its investments, and may create or exacerbate financial stress on the Fund’s borrowers.
 
Declining interest rates also can adversely affect the Fund’s overall performance, because the Fund may be forced to re-deploy principal and interest payments from existing investments into lower-yielding investments. This “reinvestment risk” can be exacerbated to the extent borrowers can prepay their loans without significant penalties, particularly because such prepayments tend to increase as interest rates decline.
 
Although variable or floating rate investments allow the Fund to participate in increases in interest rates through upward adjustments of the coupon rates on such investments, during periods of increasing interest rates, changes in the coupon rates may lag behind the change in market rates or may have limits on the maximum increase in coupon rates. Alternatively, during periods of declining interest rates, the coupon rates on such investments re-adjust downward, resulting in a lower yield. Further, while increases in interest rates are generally beneficial with respect to instruments owned by the Fund, such increases may also be detrimental to the investment itself and therefore to the Fund, depending on the investments owned, particularly if such investment is subordinated to more senior loans. Interest rate sensitivity is generally more pronounced and less predictable in instruments with uncertain payment or prepayment schedules. Declines in market value,
if not offset by any corresponding gains on hedging instruments, if any, may ultimately reduce earnings or result in losses to the Fund.

18



Bridge Financings. The Fund may provide interim debt or interim equity financing to an existing or prospective portfolio company in anticipation of permanent financing (including an investment by the Fund). These bridge loans will typically be convertible into a term loan or permanent equity investment in the portfolio company; however, for reasons not always in the Investment Manager’s control, the anticipated long term securities issuance or other refinancing or syndication may not occur and the bridge loan may remain outstanding. In such event, the interest rate on such bridge loan may not adequately reflect the risk associated with the unsecured position taken by the Fund.
 
Payment-In-Kind Securities. Payment-in-kind securities (“PIKs”) are debt obligations that pay “interest” in the form of other debt obligations, instead of in cash. Because PIKs allow an issuer to avoid or delay the need to generate cash to meet current interest payments, such securities may involve greater credit risk than bonds that pay interest currently or in cash.
 
Warrants and Rights. The Fund may obtain and hold warrants to purchase equity securities. Warrants do not carry with them the right to dividends or voting rights with respect to the securities that they entitle their holder to purchase, and they do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuer. As a result, warrants may be considered more speculative than certain other types of investments. In addition, the market value of a warrant does not necessarily change with the market value of the underlying securities, and a warrant ceases to have market value if it is not exercised prior to its expiration date. Furthermore, the terms of warrants or rights may limit the Fund’s ability to exercise the warrants or rights at such time, or in such quantities, as the Fund would otherwise desire.
 
Additional Risks Associated With Portfolio Investments. The proceeds from the issuance of the Shares and the LP Contributions are intended to be invested directly or indirectly in Portfolio Investments, none of which, as of the date of this Registration Statement, have been selected by the Investment Manager. In some cases the Fund will make investments as part of an investment group with one or more other investment funds (or with their sponsors), while in others the Fund may independently invest in a financing opportunity (alongside another investment fund, as part of a joint venture or alone). When the Fund invests as part of an investment group alongside another investment fund or a joint venture partner, the Fund will typically be required to rely on the sponsor of the other investment fund or its joint venture partner to make decisions regarding the investment and, accordingly, the value of the Portfolio
Investment could be adversely affected if the interests of the Fund diverge from those of the sponsor, its joint venture partner or the investment group. When the Fund invests independently, it may not have the same level of governance rights and other protections it would enjoy as part of a larger group. Furthermore, with respect to independently-sourced Portfolio Investments, the Investment Manager may have to rely solely on its own research and analysis.
 
Historical Performance Not a Guarantee of Future Results. The Fund’s investment performance may be better or worse than that of other investment funds managed by the Investment Manager. In particular, the debt and mezzanine financing markets have historically been cyclical, and debt and mezzanine financing market conditions during the Fund’s investment period may differ from those that prevailed during the investment periods for other investment funds managed by the Investment Manager. It is impossible to predict the precise conditions in the debt and mezzanine financing and private equity markets in the future. In addition, even though previous activities and investments of other funds managed by the Investment Manager have been subject to similar risk factors discussed herein, the Fund may not be able to duplicate any previous success in avoiding certain deleterious effects from the
risks involved.

19



Illiquidity of Shares. An investment in the Fund is intended for long-term investors who can accept the risks associated with making speculative, primarily illiquid, investments in privately negotiated transactions. The Shares will not be registered under the 1933 Act or the securities laws of the various states or other jurisdictions and are subject to substantial restrictions on transfer. There will be no trading market for Shares, and stockholders are likely to be required to hold their Shares until the final liquidation of the Fund. An investment in the Fund is therefore illiquid and should be considered only by investors financially able to maintain their investment for the long term.
 
Similarly, most Portfolio Investments are expected to be illiquid when acquired and may be subject to certain transfer restrictions. Some Portfolio Investments will not provide any liquidity rights. See “Illiquidity of the Portfolio Investments” below. Even if the Fund is able to obtain liquidity rights, economic factors (such as the inability to dispose of investments at the price desired) may limit the Fund’s ability to exercise these rights. In addition, applicable law, including the 1940 Act, may limit the amount of dividends and other distributions payable by the Fund, and all such dividends and other distributions must be authorized by the board of directors of the Fund. Furthermore, since the amount and timing of the Fund’s cash distributions to investors is dependent upon the cash flow that the Fund receives from the Portfolio Investments and upon the realization of the Portfolio Investments, and because of the Fund’s ability to reinvest
proceeds, the Portfolio Investments, even if they prove successful, are unlikely to produce significant cash flow for investors for a period of years. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to liquidate a particular Portfolio Investment or distribute securities at the time or upon the terms it desires.
 
Illiquidity of the Portfolio Investments. The Portfolio Investments are expected in general to range from somewhat to extremely illiquid. It is possible that the liquidity of a security will decline sharply after its purchase, whether because of adverse developments affecting that security or a general withdrawal of capital from the small and lower middle market.
 
General Economic, Market and Political Conditions. The success of the Fund’s activities will be affected by general economic and market conditions, changes in laws, trade barriers, currency exchange controls, and national and international political circumstances. These factors may affect the level and volatility of prices and the liquidity of Portfolio Investments, which could adversely affect the Fund’s profitability or result in losses. Events such as war, terrorism and related geopolitical risks have led, and may in the future lead, to increased volatility and may have adverse long-term effects on the U.S. and world economies and markets generally.
 
Global financial markets have occasionally experienced periods of unprecedented turmoil. The debt and equity capital markets in the United States were negatively impacted by significant write-offs in the financial services sector relating to subprime mortgages and the re-pricing of credit risk in the broader market, among other things. These events, along with the deterioration of the housing market, the failure of major financial institutions and the concerns that other financial institutions as well as the global financial system were also experiencing severe economic distress materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial firms in particular. These events contributed to severe market volatility and caused severe liquidity strains in the credit markets, which in turn severely affected participants in the private equity industry.
Volatile financial markets can expose the Fund to greater market and liquidity risk. Risks to a robust resumption of growth persist (albeit to a lesser extent): a weak consumer weighed down by too much debt and significant joblessness, the growing size of the federal budget deficit and national debt, and the threat of inflation.

20



The public securities markets have seen significant volatility and the ability of companies to obtain financing for ongoing operations or expansions may be severely constrained by the tightening of the credit markets and deterioration of the U.S. and global financial market conditions. The ability to realize investments depends not only on the underlying portfolio companies and their historical results and prospects, but also on political, market and economic conditions at the time of realization of such investments. The trading market, if any, for the securities of any portfolio company may not be sufficiently liquid to enable the Fund to sell these securities when it believes it is most advantageous to do so, or without adversely affecting the stock price.  The instability in the financial markets has led the U.S. government to take a number of unprecedented actions designed to support certain financial institutions and segments of the financial markets
that have experienced extreme volatility, and in some cases a lack of liquidity. See “Regulatory Risks” below. Federal, state, and other governments, their regulatory agencies, or self-regulatory organizations may take actions that affect the regulation of the instruments in which the Fund is expected to invest, or the issuers of such instruments, in ways that are unforeseeable.
 
In addition, on August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor’s lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States from AAA to AA+. Because of the unprecedented nature of negative credit rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations, the ultimate impact of the downgrade is unpredictable and may not be immediately apparent. However, if the other major credit rating agencies issue downgrades, or if Standard & Poor’s issues further downgrades, the resulting market response could be extreme and possibly adverse to the Portfolio Investments.
 
Investment Selection. The success of the Fund depends to a great extent upon the Investment Manager’s ability to identify superior investments. While the Portfolio Investment selection process entails consideration of many subjective factors, investors in the Fund will not have an opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant subjective factors and will be dependent on the judgment and ability of the Investment Manager in selecting such investments. There can be no assurance that the Investment Manager will fulfill the Fund’s objective of investing in Portfolio Investments that can produce superior returns over the lifetime of the Fund.
 
Risks Regarding Dispositions of Portfolio Investments. In connection with the disposition of Portfolio Investments, the Fund may be required to make representations and warranties about the business and financial affairs of the issuer typical of those made in connection with the sale of any busi­ness. The Fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that such representations and warranties turn out to be inaccurate or misleading. These arrangements may result in liabilities for the Fund. Although the securities in which the Fund is expected to invest generally will not be publicly traded, the ability to successfully exit those investments may be negatively impacted by public market conditions.
 
Concentration/Diversification Standards. Although the Investment Manager will seek to diversify the Fund’s investment portfolio to the extent possible consistent with the Fund’s investment strategy, various factors, including prevailing market conditions, available investment opportunities, regulatory constraints, constraints imposed by certain portfolio companies, and the timing of investments, may prevent the Investment Manager from diversifying the Fund’s portfolio or may result in the Fund’s portfolio not being as diversified as the Investment Manager may otherwise prefer. The Fund will not be “diversified” for purposes of the 1940 Act.

21



It is anticipated that, commencing with the second year of its investment operations, the Fund will seek to meet the requirements, including diversification requirements, to qualify as a RIC under the Code. See the discussion at Item l under the caption “Taxation.” There can be no assurance, however, that the Fund will be able to meet those requirements. In addition, prior to the time, if any, that the Fund qualifies as a RIC, it will not be subject to such diversification requirements.
 
For these and other reasons, the Fund could potentially be concentrated in relatively few Portfolio Investments, or types of Portfolio Investments. One risk of having a limited number of Portfolio Investments is that the aggregate returns realized by the investors may be substantially adversely affected by the unfavorable performance of a small number of such Portfolio Investments. Similarly, should the Portfolio Investments be concentrated in a small number of industries or related industries, the risk to the investors would increase, because companies in the same industry or related industries are often subject to similar business risks and regulatory burdens, and the impact of a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence may have a greater adverse impact on the Portfolio Investments.
 
Risks Associated with the Fund’s SBIC Subsidiaries. The Fund may make investments in qualifying small businesses through the SBIC Subsidiary, which will apply to be licensed by the SBA to act as an SBIC and as a result, will be subject to SBA regulations.  There can be no guarantee that the SBA will issue an SBIC license to the SBIC Subsidiary nor can there be any assurance of the timing required to do so. If the SBIC Subsidiary does not receive an SBIC license, the Fund will continue with its investment program without the benefit of SBA Debentures.


Even if an SBIC license is granted, there can be no assurance that the SBIC Subsidiary will obtain access to SBA-guaranteed debenture leverage (“SBA Debentures”), of the timing to achieve such access, or, if access is achieved, the interest rates and fees that would be imposed, because access to SBA Debentures is subject to satisfaction of SBA performance requirements and compliance with applicable regulations under the SBIC Act.  Furthermore, the amount of SBA Debenture funding available to SBICs is dependent upon annual Congressional authorizations and in the future may be subject to annual Congressional appropriations. There can be no assurance that there will be sufficient SBA Debenture funding available at the times desired by the SBIC Subsidiary.


The SBA Debentures have a maturity of ten years and require semi-annual payments of interest. The SBIC Subsidiary (if formed) will need to generate sufficient cash flow to make required interest payments on the SBA Debentures.  The interest payments on drawn SBA Debenture leverage generally have priority over payments to limited partners of an SBIC including the Fund.  Covenants and financial tests governing SBA Debentures may also limit the ability of the SBIC Subsidiary to make new investments.


If successfully licensed as an SBIC, the SBIC Subsidiary will be subject to SBA regulations, which are lengthy and complex.  Furthermore, Congress may amend or supplement the rules governing SBICs in a manner that imposes additional regulatory burdens or otherwise adversely affects an SBIC.


The SBA has significant ability to supervise and regulate many critical aspects of the affairs of an SBIC.  The SBA imposes greater restrictions on the portfolio of an SBIC than would generally be the case for an unregulated private investment fund.  Certain activities and decisions require SBA approval, and there are uncertain timeframes for such approvals.  For instance, the SBA places restrictions on the companies in which an SBIC can invest and on certain terms of investments by SBICs, thereby restricting the companies that the Fund can finance and potentially adversely affecting the returns on investments by the Fund.  Compliance with SBA regulations and policies, including those addressing conflicts of interest, may cause an SBIC subsidiary of the Fund to forego attractive investment opportunities that such SBIC subsidiary may otherwise pursue.  Further, the SBA regulations require that a licensed SBIC be periodically examined and audited by the
SBA to determine its compliance with the relevant SBA regulations, and the SBA has the power to penalize an SBIC in a number of ways.  If the SBIC Subsidiary fails to comply with applicable SBIC regulations, the SBA could, depending on the severity of the violation, limit or prohibit its use of SBA Debentures, declare outstanding SBA Debentures immediately due and payable, and/or limit it from making new investments.  In addition, the SBA can revoke or suspend a license for willful or repeated violation of, or willful or repeated failure to observe, any provision of the SBIC Act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder.  Such actions by the SBA would, in turn, negatively affect the Fund.

22



The SBIC Subsidiary (if formed) may be limited by the SBIC Act, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to the Fund that may be necessary to maintain the Fund’s status as a RIC, and avoid a consequent imposition of an entity-level tax on the Fund. If this occurred, the Investment Manager could seek to liquidate other Fund investments to generate sufficient cash to make the required distributions, although there can be no assurance that such liquidations could be accomplished in the required timeframe or on attractive terms. The general partner of the Partnership, as the sole stockholder of the Fund, is authorized under the Partnership’s governing documents to consent to the deemed receipt by the Partnership of a cashless “consent dividend” if necessary to enable the Fund to maintain its status as a RIC. The general partner of the Partnership might be willing to provide such a consent to avoid the negative consequences
to the Partnership’s limited partners should the Fund lose its RIC status. There can be no assurance, however, that the general partner of the Partnership will provide such consent. The Fund could also request a waiver of the SBA’s restrictions for its SBIC subsidiaries to make the distributions required to maintain the Fund’s RIC status, although the SBA does not grant such waivers as a matter of course and there can be no assurance that the SBA will grant such waiver.
 
Risks Associated With Control Strategies. The Fund may hold a controlling position in a Portfolio Investment and may hold board or observer seats on many of its portfolio companies. Although such positions may be important to the Fund’s investment strategy, they may subject the Fund to claims it would not otherwise be subject to if such controlling position or board or observer seats were not held. The Fund will generally indemnify the Investment Manager and its affiliates from such claims, which may be costly to defend and could result in substantial liability.
 
The exercise of control over a company may impose, for example, additional risks of liability for environmental damage, product defects, failure to supervise management, pension and other fringe benefits, violation of governmental regulations (including securities laws) or other types of related liability. If these liabilities were to arise, the Fund may suffer a significant loss in such investment.
 
Lack of Control of Portfolio Investments. In some cases, the Fund will not have the right to participate in the day-to-day management, control or operation of the Portfolio Investments, nor will it have the unilateral right to remove the managers thereof. The Fund also will not necessarily have the opportunity to evaluate the relevant economic, financial and other information which will be utilized by the managers of its portfolio companies with respect to the operation of such portfolio companies. As a result, the Fund’s ability to protect its position in such asset will be limited. In addition, these Portfolio Investments may involve risks in connection with third-party management or strategic partners having financial difficulties, resulting in a negative impact on such investment, and such third parties may have economic or business interests or goals which are inconsistent with those
of the Fund or may be in a position to take (or block) action contrary to the Fund’s investment objectives. In addition, the Fund may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of such third-party management or strategic partners.

23



Abundance of Capital. The Investment Manager believes that the supply of investments in the small and lower middle market today exceeds the amount of capital committed to these markets. This imbalance could be reduced or even reversed, in certain markets or sub-markets, as publicly traded companies (including public BDCs), private equity funds, hedge funds, proprietary trading desks and other investors increase their commitments to these markets. Some of these competing sources of capital might be able to obtain investment capital more readily or on better terms than the Fund, particularly competitors that have access to the public equity or debt markets. Increased demand for the securities of small and lower middle market companies could drive up pricing and make investing in the sector less attractive. Similarly, the Investment Manager may not
obtain as favorable terms as it would otherwise in a less competitive environment. Additionally, the Fund’s need to comply with provisions of the 1940 Act pertaining to BDCs and, if the Fund qualifies as a RIC, provisions of the Code pertaining to RICs, may restrict the Fund’s flexibility as compared with its competitors. The Fund and its portfolio companies may incur significant expenses investigating potential investments which are ultimately not consummated, including expenses relating to due diligence, transportation, legal expenses and the fees of other third-party advisers.
 
Uncertainty of Valuation. Generally, there will be no readily available market for all or a substantial number of the Portfolio Investments and, hence, most of the Portfolio Investments will be difficult to value. This uncertainty of valuations could both limit the ability of the Fund’s investors to gauge the Fund’s ongoing performance, and the ability of the Investment Manager to evaluate the past performance of prospective Portfolio Investments. For these and other reasons, it will be difficult for an investor to value its interest in the Fund.
 
Regulatory Restrictions. The Fund is electing to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Although BDCs are exempt from registration under the 1940 Act and are relieved from compliance with some (but not all) of the provisions of the 1940 Act, there are greater restrictions in some respects on permitted types of investments for BDCs than there are for unregulated funds. These requirements may limit the Fund’s investment opportunities. Moreover, the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act continue to impose numerous restrictions on the activities of the Fund, including restrictions on leverage and on the nature of its investments. While the Fund is not aware of any judicial rulings under, and is aware of only a few administrative interpretations of, the Small Business Incentive Act of 1980, there can be no assurance that such act will be interpreted or administratively implemented in a manner
consistent with the Fund’s objectives or manner of operation. See the discussion at Item 1 under the caption “Regulation.”
 
Lack of Ability to Participate. Investors will have limited rights and powers to participate in the management or control of the business of the Fund and thus must depend solely upon the ability of the Investment Manager with respect to making, monitoring and disposing of investments.
 
Regulatory Risks. Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Fund that may adversely affect the Fund. In particular, changes in the laws or regulations, or the interpretations of the laws and regulations, which govern BDCs, SBICs, RICs or non-depository commercial lenders could significantly and adversely affect the Fund’s operations and cost of doing business.  In addition, the regulatory environment for private funds is evolving, and changes in the regulation of private funds may adversely affect the value of Portfolio Investments and the ability of the Fund and the Portfolio Investments to obtain the leverage they may otherwise obtain. The SEC and other regulators and self-regulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies. The regulation of private investment funds is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification
by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Fund or the Investment Manager could be substantial and adverse.

24



Additionally, certain Portfolio Investments may be in industries subject to extensive government regulation. Certain regulations may prevent the Fund from making certain investments that it otherwise would make. Other regulations may require the Fund to incur substantial additional costs or lengthy delays in connection with the completion of an investment, or substantially reduce the value of the Portfolio Investments. In addition, governmental regulation may not be predictable and may be subject to political, economic, social and/or market developments. For example, the Fund may be subject to the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) if the Fund invests in an entity that has a direct or indirect interest in, owns or controls a “media company,” such as a television or radio station, cable system or daily newspaper, or a company providing wireless communications pursuant to an FCC license (“wireless
licensee”). These restrictions may, among other things, prohibit certain communications between an investor (or such investor’s officers, directors, partners or other officials) and the Investment Manager pertaining to the operations of the media company and may limit an investor from serving as an agent or employee of the Fund. These restrictions may also prevent the Fund from investing in certain media companies or wireless licensees, or require the Fund to divest certain media companies or wireless licensees, due to FCC restrictions on concentration of ownership of media companies and wireless licensees. See also “Regulatory Restrictions,” “Risks Associated with the Fund’s SBIC Subsidiaries,” and “Business and Regulatory Risks of Private Investment Funds.”
 
Key Personnel. The performance of the Fund will depend in significant part upon the skill and expertise of the key personnel of the Investment Manager and the Portfolio Investments, and may be adversely affected by key individuals joining or leaving the Investment Manager or the portfolio companies’ investment or management teams. Although the Investment Manager’s personnel will devote as much time as they believe necessary to assist the Fund in achieving its investment objectives, only some individuals will devote substantially all of his or her working time to the affairs of the Fund. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Fund or a Portfolio Investment.
 
Management Fees and Expenses. The Fund bears its management fees and expenses, and also indirectly bears the management fees and expenses of the SBIC Subsidiary (if one is formed). The investment return on the Portfolio Investments therefore must be sufficient to offset all levels of fees and expenses before the Fund will earn a positive investment return.
 
In-Kind Distribution of Illiquid Securities. The Fund may make in-kind distributions of Portfolio Investments, all of which may be highly illiquid. There can be no assurance that investors in the Fund will be able to dispose of these Portfolio Investments or will not incur significant costs and expenses in connection with any such disposition, or that the value of these Portfolio Investments as determined by the Investment Manager in connection with the determination of distributions will ultimately be realized.
 
Business and Regulatory Risks of Private Investment Funds. The financial markets are extensively regulated and subject to frequent regulatory change. Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Fund that may adversely affect the Fund. New laws or revised regulations imposed by the SEC, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), the Federal Reserve and other U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets that could adversely affect the Fund may be adopted in the future. The Fund may also be adversely affected by changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing statutes and rules by these governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations. The regulatory environment for private investment funds is
evolving, and changes in the regulation or taxation of private investment funds may adversely affect the value of Portfolio Investments and/or the ability of the Fund and its portfolio companies to obtain leverage or otherwise execute their investment or operating strategies. In addition, the securities and futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations and margin requirements. The SEC, CFTC and other U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and self-regulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of financial market emergencies. The regulation of derivatives transactions and funds that engage in such transactions is an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Fund could be substantial and adverse.

25



Tax Status. The Fund must meet a number of requirements, described in Item 1 under the caption “Taxation” to qualify for the pass-through status as a RIC and, if qualified, to continue to so qualify. If the Fund experiences difficulty in meeting the diversification requirement for any fiscal quarter of its taxable year, it may accelerate capital calls or, if available, borrowings in order to increase the portion of the Fund’s total assets represented by cash, cash items and U.S. government securities as of the close of the following fiscal quarter and thus attempt to meet the diversification requirement. The Fund, however, would incur additional interest and other expenses in connection with any such accelerated borrowings, and increased investments by the Fund in cash, cash items and U.S. government securities (whether the funds to make such investments are derived from called equity capital or from
accelerated borrowings) are likely to reduce the Fund’s return. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Fund would be able to meet the diversification requirements through such actions. Failure to qualify as a RIC would deny the Fund pass-through status and, in a year in which the Fund has taxable income, would have a significant adverse effect on the returns of the Fund.
 
When the Fund elects to convert its status from that of an ordinary, or C, corporation to that of a RIC, it must choose either to (i) pay tax whenever an asset is sold during the subsequent “conversion period” (generally, ten years) following the conversion on the amount of gain which would have been realized had the asset been sold on the conversion date, or (ii) treat the entire amount of “built-in gain” as income at the time of conversion.
 
Accelerated Transactions. For the Fund to take advantage of available investment opportunities, the Investment Manager may need to make investment decisions on an expedited basis. In such cases, the information available to the Investment Manager at the time of an investment decision may be limited. The Investment Manager may not, therefore, have access to the detailed information necessary for a full analysis and evaluation of the investment opportunity.
 
Follow-On Investments. Following its initial investment in a Portfolio Investment, the Fund may have the opportunity to increase its investment in such Portfolio Investment. There is no assurance that the Fund will make follow-on investments or that the Fund will have sufficient resources to, or be permitted to, make such investments. Any decision not to make follow-on investments or the Fund’s inability to make them may have a substantial negative impact on such Portfolio Investment in need of such an additional investment, may result in missed opportunities for the Fund or may result in dilution of the Fund’s investment. In certain cases, the 1940 Act may impose restrictions on the Fund’s ability to make follow-on investments even when such an investment would be beneficial to the Fund.
 
Counterparty Risk. The Fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivative contracts and other instruments entered into directly or indirectly by it. The Fund will also be subject to the risk that a counterparty to a trade may become unwilling or unable to meet its obligations prior to settlement. This risk may be more acute with respect to fixed income securities because the settle­ment periods for such securities are often longer than for equity securities. If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract due to financial difficulties, the Fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery under the derivative contract
in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding. The Fund may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.
 
In situations where the Fund is required to post margin or other collateral with a counterparty, the counterparty may fail to segregate the collateral or may commingle the collateral with the counterparty’s own assets. As a result, in the event of the counterparty’s bankruptcy or insolvency, the Fund’s collateral may be subject to the conflicting claims of the counterparty’s creditors and the Fund may be exposed to the risk of a court treating it as a general unsecured creditor of the counterparty, rather than as the owner of the collateral.

26



The Fund may effect certain transactions in “over-the-counter” or “interdealer” markets. The participants in such markets are typically not subject to credit evaluation and regulatory oversight, as are members of “exchange based” markets. The Fund is likely to be treated as an unsecured creditor of any “over-the-counter” derivative counterparty in the event of the counterparty’s insolvency, both with respect to the amounts owed by the counterparty under the derivatives transaction and with respect to any collateral that has been transferred to such counterparty. The credit risk arising from futures and cleared derivatives is generally different from the credit risk arising from “over-the-counter” derivatives, because a party to a futures contract or a cleared derivatives transaction is generally subject to the credit risk of the
clearing house and the futures commission merchant or clearing member through which it holds its cleared position, rather than the credit risk of a market “counterparty.” The Fund generally may only close out “over-the-counter” transactions (including swaps and contracts for differences) with the relevant counterparty, and may only transfer a position with the consent of the particular counterparty. Also, if the counterparty defaults, the Fund will have contractual remedies, but there is no assurance that the counterparty will be able to meet its contractual obligations or that, in the event of default, the Fund will succeed in enforcing them.
 
Securities Markets Risk. The value of Portfolio Investments could be affected by factors affecting the securities markets generally, such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions, supply and demand for particular instruments, changes in the general outlook for the securities market or corporate earnings, interest rates, announcements of political information or adverse investor sentiment generally. The market values of Portfolio Investments may decline for a number of reasons, including increases in defaults resulting from overall economic conditions, increases in prepayments resulting from increased borrower mobility or the availability of “cash-out” refinancing opportunities or widening of credit spreads. Unfavorable securities markets conditions may also increase the Fund’s costs, limit its access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to the Fund or
a Portfolio Investment.
 
Inflation/Deflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from Portfolio Investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of payments at future dates. As inflation increases, the real value of Portfolio Investments could decline and the interest payments on any related borrowings may increase. Deflation risk is the risk that prices throughout the economy decline over time. Deflation may have an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of issuers, increase the real value of debts owed, and may make issuer default more likely, which may result in a decline in the value of the Portfolio Investments.
 
Risks of Litigation. The Fund’s investment activities may include activities that are hostile in nature and will subject it to the risks of becoming involved in litigation with third parties. This risk may be greater where the Fund exercises control or significant influence over a Portfolio Investment. The Fund may have indemnification obligations in connection with any such litigation. In particular, the Fund may be obligated to indemnify the Investment Manager, its affiliates, members, employees and agents, and each director and officer of the Fund.
 
Satisfaction of Liabilities of the Fund. It is anticipated that the assets of the Fund, including any Portfolio Investments, will be available to satisfy the liabilities and other obligations of the Fund. If the Fund becomes subject to a liability, parties seeking to have the liability satisfied may have recourse to the Fund’s assets generally and not be limited to any particular assets, such as the asset representing the Portfolio Investment giving rise to the liability. This may result in the Fund disposing of assets it holds in order to satisfy liabilities arising from other assets, which could have a material adverse effect on the Fund.

27



Cyclical Nature of Debt Markets. From time to time the market for private equity/debt transactions has been adversely affected by a decrease in the availability of senior and subordinated financing for transactions, sometimes in response to regulatory pressures on providers of financing to reduce or eliminate their exposure to such transactions. A general downturn in the debt markets can create a situation in which Portfolio Investments suffer rising default rates. Such rising default rates may further tighten the lending environment, leading to a cycle of default and increasing interest rates. The inability of portfolio companies to secure debt financing at reasonable interest rates may adversely affect their profitability and financial stability, and will subject such portfolio companies to increased exposure to adverse economic factors such as a significant rise in interest rates, a severe downturn in the
economy or deterioration in the condition of that portfolio company.
 
The debt markets have, from time to time, experienced a significant lack of liquidity. This lack of liquidity creates a number of risks. There can be no assurance that the market will, in the future, become more liquid and it may well continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. It is also possible that illiquidity in the debt markets could cause prices to decline further, which may have the result of forcing portfolio companies or other leveraged investment vehicles to sell assets to satisfy requirements under their borrowing arrangements or to meet margin calls, which could, in turn, create further downward price pressure.
 
Foreign Investing. Portfolio Investments may be subject to changing political environments, regulatory restrictions, and changes in government institutions and policies, any of which could adversely affect their value. The Fund does not intend to obtain political risk insurance. As a BDC, the Fund may invest up to 30% of its total assets in securities of companies which are not “Eligible Portfolio Companies.” An “Eligible Portfolio Company” must be organized under the laws of, and have its principal place of business in, the United States. (See the discussion at Item 1 under the caption “Regulation.”)  Therefore, the Fund may invest up to 30% of its total assets in non-U.S. companies. To the extent that the Fund invests in non-U.S. assets and securities, actions by the governments of foreign countries could have a significant effect on the economies of various countries, which could adversely
affect market conditions, as well as prices and, if applicable, yields, and the cost and availability of leverage. Political and economic instability in any of the foreign countries in which the Fund invests could adversely affect the Fund. While the developed economies and many emerging economies have achieved relatively stable political, economic and social structures, it is possible that conditions could change materially during the lifetime of the Fund. Investments in developing economies or emerging markets may be more subject than those in developed markets to the risks of internal and external conflicts, currency devaluations, foreign ownership limitations and tax increases. Also, nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockage, market disruption, political changes, security suspensions or diplomatic developments could adversely affect investments in foreign economies, particularly emerging market countries.
 
Although developed countries generally recognize basic commercial relationships and rights, some still lack the extensive body of law and practice normally encountered in Western business environments. Laws and regulations in developing market countries affecting Western business and investment, particularly those involving taxation, foreign investment and trade, can change quickly and unpredictably in a more volatile manner than in the United States or other developed market economies. Additionally, attempts at judicial enforcement of existing laws, judgments or arbitral awards may encounter significant delay and difficulty, and courts may not be totally impartial in adjudicating disputes between foreigners and local persons or companies. In addition, although substantial revisions have been made to the commercial law of some of the countries in which the Fund may invest, the judicial and civil procedures often have not been modernized to nearly the same
extent. As a result, not only do courts lack experience in commercial dispute resolution, but many of the procedural remedies for enforcement and protection of legal rights typically found in Western jurisdictions are less available. In particular, the bankruptcy or receivership process in countries outside the United States may be less transparent, or provide less protection to creditors, than is the case in the United States.

Because non-U.S. entities are not subject to uniform accounting, auditing, and financial reporting standards, practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to U.S. companies, there may be different types of, and lower-quality, information available about companies in foreign markets than is the case for companies in the U.S. This reduced transparency may make it more difficult to select and manage investments, and makes the valuation of the securities of companies less reliable.
 
Changes in any jurisdiction’s policy with regard to taxation, fiscal and monetary policies, repatriation of profits, and other economic regulations are possible, any of which may have an adverse effect on investments in such jurisdiction. Any such changes may adversely affect the value of Portfolio Investments. The economies of the foreign countries in which the Fund makes investments may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy with regard to the rate of growth of gross domestic product, the rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payments.
 
Restrictions on Repatriation of Capital and Profits. Some countries in which the Fund may invest control, in varying degrees, the repatriation of capital and profits that result from foreign investment. Capital markets, often opaque, continue to be highly regulated and will likely be subject to continuing government restrictions. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be permitted to repatriate capital or profits, if any, from these countries.
 
Euro-Related Risk. The recent global economic crisis brought several small economies in Europe to the brink of bankruptcy and many other economies into recession and weakened the banking and financial sectors of many European countries. For example, the governments of Greece, Spain, Portugal, and the Republic of Ireland have all recently experienced large public budget deficits, the effects of which are still yet unknown and may slow the overall recovery of the European economies from the recent global economic crisis. In addition, due to large public deficits, some European countries may be dependent on assistance from other European governments and institutions or multilateral agencies and offices. Assistance may be dependent on a country’s implementation of reforms or reaching a certain level of performance. Failure to reach those objectives or an insufficient level of assistance could result in a deep
economic downturn which could significantly affect the value of European Portfolio Investments.
 
The Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (“EMU”) is comprised of the European Union members that have adopted the euro currency. By adopting the euro as its currency, a member state relinquishes control of its own monetary policies. As a result, European countries are significantly affected by fiscal and monetary controls implemented by the EMU. The euro currency may not fully reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the various economies that comprise the EMU and Europe generally.
 
It is possible that EMU member countries could abandon the euro and return to a national currency and/or that the euro will cease to exist as a single currency in its current form. The effects of such an abandonment or a country’s forced expulsion from the euro on that country, the rest of the EMU, and global markets are impossible to predict, but are likely to be negative. The exit of any country out of the euro would likely have an extremely destabilizing effect on all Eurozone countries and their economies and a negative effect on the global economy as a whole. In addition, under these circumstances, it may be difficult to value investments denominated in euros or in a replacement currency.

29


Currency Risk. A portion of the Portfolio Investments may be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the value of such Portfolio Investments and the cash flow generated therefrom may decline due to fluctuations in the exchange rates between U.S. dollars and such other currencies. Because such Portfolio Investments may require the Fund to transact business in non-U.S. dollar currencies during the completion of its investment program, the Fund may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency rates and in exchange control regulations and may incur transaction costs in connection with conversions between various currencies.

Lender Liability Considerations and Equitable Subordination. In recent years, a number of judicial decisions in the United States have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories (collectively termed “lender liability”). Generally, lender liability is founded upon the premise that an institutional lender has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower or the borrower’s assets resulting in creation of a duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or interest holders. In addition, courts have in some cases applied the doctrine of equitable subordination to subordinate the claim of a lending institution against a borrower to claims of other creditors of the borrower when the lending institution, or its assignor or predecessor in
interest, is found to have engaged in unfair, inequitable or fraudulent conduct. Because of the nature of certain of the Portfolio Investments, the Fund could be subject to allegations of lender liability or to claims that such investments should be equitably subordinated.
 
Fraudulent Conveyance and Preference Considerations. Various federal and state laws enacted for the protection of creditors may apply to the purchase of Portfolio Investments by virtue of the Fund’s role as a creditor with respect to the borrowers under such investments or as a holder of equity interests in such borrowers. If a court in a lawsuit brought by an unpaid creditor or representative of creditors of a borrower were to find that the borrower did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring indebtedness evidenced by an investment and the grant of any security interest or other lien securing such investment, such court could, under certain circumstances, invalidate, in whole or in part, such indebtedness and such security interest or other lien as fraudulent conveyances, could subordinate such indebtedness to existing or future creditors of the borrower or could allow
the borrower to recover amounts previously paid by the borrower to the creditor (including to the Fund) in satisfaction of such indebtedness or the proceeds of such security interest or other lien previously applied in satisfaction of such indebtedness. In addition, in the event of the insolvency of an issuer of an investment, payments made with respect to the Portfolio Investment could be subject to avoidance as a “preference” if made within a certain period of time (which may be as long as one year) before insolvency depending on a number of factors, and such payments can be recaptured either from the initial recipient (such as the Fund) or from subsequent transferees of such payments, including Limited Partners.
 
The Investment Manager does not intend to cause the Fund to engage in conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon fraudulent conveyance, preference or equitable subordination. There can be no assurance, however, as to whether any portfolio company or lending institution or other party from which the Fund may acquire such indebtedness engaged in any such conduct (or any other conduct that would subject such indebtedness and the Fund to insolvency laws) and, if it did, as to whether such creditor claims could be asserted in a U.S. court (or in the courts of any other country) against the Fund.
 
Indebtedness consisting of obligations of non-U.S. issuers may be subject to various laws enacted in the countries of their issuance for the protection of creditors. These insolvency considerations and the levels of protection provided will differ depending on the country in which each issuer is located or domiciled and may differ depending on whether the issuer is a non-sovereign or a sovereign entity.

30



Uncertainties Associated With the Bankruptcy Process. Issuers of the Portfolio Investments may file for bankruptcy. Bankruptcy proceedings generally are contested and adversarial, and unanticipated adverse developments can occur that are often beyond the control of the creditors or the debtor. While creditors generally are afforded an opportunity to object to significant actions, there can be no assurance that a bankruptcy court would not approve actions that may be contrary to the interests of the Fund. These include the risks that one or more classes of securities could be deemed to have priority over the Fund’s interest, undue delays or expenses in resolving the bankruptcy, use of the cash flow by the debtor during the bankruptcy process in a way that is adverse to its creditors, and the possibility that, to facilitate
emergence from bankruptcy, it may be necessary to provide some level of recovery to one or more classes of securities beyond what these classes are entitled to from a strict economic standpoint. Moreover, the duration of a bankruptcy case can only be roughly estimated. In some cases the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings can adversely affect a company’s business, particularly if customers, suppliers and employees lose confidence in the company’s viability as a going concern. If a company in bankruptcy is forced to dispose of assets (particularly in a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding), the value realized on the disposition of those assets may be less than if the assets were disposed of outside the bankruptcy context.
 
During the bankruptcy, an automatic stay will prevent all creditors from taking action against the debtor to collect on amounts owed to such creditors. Unless a creditor’s claim in such case is secured by assets having a value in excess of such claim, no interest will be permitted to accrue and, therefore, the creditor’s return on investment can be adversely affected by the passage of time during which the plan of reorganization of the debtor is being negotiated, approved by the creditors and confirmed by the bankruptcy court.
 
Notwithstanding special purpose entities created to hold assets and to structure for bankruptcy remoteness, such entities may, in certain cases, be consolidated in bankruptcy proceedings which can affect the outcome of such proceedings and the amounts ultimately received by creditors.
 
The administrative costs in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding are frequently high and will generally be paid out of the debtor’s estate prior to any return to creditors (other than out of assets or proceeds thereof which are subject to valid and enforceable liens and other security interests) and equity holders. In addition, certain claims that have priority by law over the claims of certain creditors (for example, claims for taxes) may be quite high.
 
U.S. bankruptcy law permits the classification of “substantially similar” claims in determining the classification of claims in a reorganization for purpose of voting on a plan of reorganization. Because the standard for classification is vague, there exists a significant risk that the Fund’s influence with respect to a class of securities can be lost by the inflation of the number and the amount of claims in, or other gerrymandering of, the class.
 
Claims in bankruptcy cases are often paid at less than par and depending on the debtor’s assets and liabilities, there may be no recovery at all for some classes of creditors. The claims of secured creditors are often paid out over time. Initially, only the debtor may file and prosecute a plan of reorganization. While the U.S. bankruptcy code permits other parties-in-interest to file and prosecute a plan of reorganization after the debtors’ “exclusive period” to do so ends, bankruptcy courts often extend the debtor’s exclusive period, which effectively permits only the debtor to file or prosecute a reorganization plan. While creditors can vote on the plan of reorganization, the unanimous
consent of all creditor classes is not necessarily required for the bankruptcy court to confirm the plan. Therefore, a plan can, subject to the provisions of the bankruptcy code, be “crammed down” on dissenting classes of creditors.
 
Some of the Portfolio Investments may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws may be substantially less favorable to creditors than or otherwise significantly different from U.S. bankruptcy and insolvency laws.

31



Use of Derivatives. The Fund may, but is not required to, use derivatives to seek to hedge the Fund’s exposure to changes in value of one or more Portfolio Investments, including hedging interest rate and currency risk. To the extent the Fund elects to engage in these transactions, it will incur additional costs, and there can be no assurance that any particular derivatives transaction will achieve its intended purpose or that suitable derivatives transactions will be available. Many derivative instruments are inherently leveraged, and will expose the Fund to the risks of leverage discussed elsewhere.
 
Unanticipated movements in markets may result in a poorer overall performance for the Fund than if the Fund had not engaged in any derivatives transaction. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a derivatives strategy and price movements in the underlying reference instrument (e.g., securities of the Portfolio Investment being hedged) may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, the Fund may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such derivatives instruments and the underlying reference instrument. Such imperfect correlation may prevent the Fund from achieving the intended result or expose the Fund to risk of loss. Finally, the Fund may simply not anticipate the occurrence of a particular risk or may deem the probability of such
occurrence too low (or the cost of hedging too high) to warrant establishing a hedging position. Engaging in derivative transactions will also expose the Fund to the risk that a counterparty will be unwilling or unable to meet its obligations, and to the risks related to the relatively untested nature of the markets for certain derivative instruments. See “Counterparty Risk” above.
 
Certain derivatives transactions used by the Fund, including certain interest rate swaps and certain credit default index swaps, will be required to be centrally cleared. In a cleared derivatives transaction, the Fund’s counterparty to the transaction is a central derivatives clearing organization, or clearing house, rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of a clearing house, and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives transactions through accounts at clearing members, who are futures commission merchants who are members of the clearing houses. The Fund will make and receive payments owed under cleared derivatives transactions (including margin payments)
through the Fund’s accounts at clearing members. Such clearing members guarantee the Fund’s performance of its obligations to the clearing house. In contrast to bilateral derivatives transactions, following a period of advance notice to the Fund, clearing members can generally require termination of existing cleared derivatives transactions at any time and increase the amount of margin required to be provided by the Fund to the clearing member for any cleared derivatives transaction above the amount of margin that was required at the beginning of the transaction. Also, the Fund is subject to execution risk if it enters into a derivatives transaction that is required to be cleared (or which the Investment Manager expects to be cleared), and no clearing member is willing to clear the transaction on the Fund’s behalf. In that case, the transaction may have
to be terminated, and the Fund could lose some or all of the benefit of any increase in the value of the transaction after the time of the trade and will not be able to maintain the desired transaction.
 
Derivatives are also subject to a number of other risks described herein such as interest rate risk, liquidity risk, management risk and the risk of mispricing or improper or subjective valuation.
 
The foregoing list of risk factors does not purport to be a complete enumeration or explanation of the risks involved in an investment in the Fund. No assurance can be made that profits will be achieved or that substantial losses will not be incurred.

Conflicts of Interest.
 
Description of Small Buyout Portfolios. The Investment Manager serves as investment manager, and affiliates of the Investment Manager serve as general partner, to Siguler Guff Small Buyout Opportunities Fund, LP, Siguler Guff Small Buyout Opportunities Fund II, LP, and their parallel funds (the “SBOF Funds”). The Investment Manager and its affiliates also serve as investment manager and/or general partner to certain separate accounts with investment strategies that, in whole or in part, overlap with those of the SBOF Funds (the SBOF Funds and such separate accounts are referred to collectively as the “Small Buyout Portfolios”). The Small Buyout Portfolios invest in investment funds managed by other managers (the “Underlying Funds”) that acquire equity and equity-related investments in lower-middle market companies with characteristics similar to those of the companies to which the Fund will make loans and equity
investments. The Small Buyout Portfolios also invest a specified portion of their assets directly in equity and equity-related investments in lower-middle market companies, typically as a “co-investment” made alongside an investment by an Underlying Fund, or potential Underlying Fund, into some of the same portfolio companies. Investments by the Small Buyout Portfolios into Underlying Funds are referred to as “Fund Investments” and investments by the Small Buyout Portfolios directly into lower-middle market companies are referred to as “Direct Investments”. As of December 31, 2013, the Small Buyout Portfolios had an aggregate investment capital of $1.4 billion, of which $737 million had not yet been deployed. The Investment Manager or its affiliates may manage additional entities in the future which would be considered Small Buyout Portfolios.
 
In general, the Small Buyout Portfolios invest in Underlying Funds as limited partners and, as such, do not have the power to direct the day-to-day management of the Underlying Funds, including selection of investments and management of portfolio companies in which the Underlying Funds invest. In many cases, however, the Small Buyout Portfolios are relatively large investors in the Underlying Funds, which give rise to limited governance rights such as seats on advisory boards. Furthermore, when the Small Buyout Portfolios are among the largest investors in an Underlying Fund, the Investment Manager may be able to influence the actions of the Underlying Fund’s general partner, because the general partner appreciates the large investment and hopes that the Small Buyout Portfolios will continue to invest in the general partner’s subsequent investment vehicles. In certain cases, the Investment Manager may obtain specific governance rights with respect to an
Underlying Fund or its related entities, such as the right to veto investments proposed to be made by the general partner.
 
Potential Conflicts Involving the Small Buyout Portfolios. The Investment Manager expects that the majority of the Fund’s investments will be in companies in which an Underlying Fund, or a fund in which a Small Buyout Portfolio is considering investing, holds or is about to acquire a significant (and in most cases controlling) equity investment. Accordingly, the Fund will frequently acquire loans and, in most cases, equity investments, in companies in which the Small Buyout Portfolios hold an indirect equity interest through a Fund Investment in Underlying Funds. In some cases the Small Buyout Portfolios may also own additional equity securities in a Fund portfolio company through a Direct Investment. A company in which an Underlying Fund or a Small Buyout Portfolio owns securities or will own securities when the Fund completes its investment is referred to as a “Related Company”. A company in which a Small Buyout Portfolio
owns securities or will own securities as a Direct Investment when the Fund completes its investment is referred to as a “Direct Related Company”.
 
Investment by the Fund in Related Companies can give rise to potential conflicts of interest, as described below. To the extent that the Investment Manager believes that successful investments by the Small Buyout Portfolios will create a greater economic benefit to the Investment Manager than successful investments by the Fund (or vice versa), the potential conflicts described would be aggravated, because the Investment Manager would have an economic incentive to favor one party over the other. This divergent economic benefit could occur, for example, because of different compensation arrangements between the Investment Manager and the clients in question, the relative size of the investments involved, or because the relative investment performance of the various vehicles has made it more likely that the Investment Manager or its affiliates will collect more incentive compensation from one client or the other. In addition, the restrictions on affiliated
transactions described below, as well as those described under the caption “Regulation”, could prevent the Fund from making certain transactions even when Siguler Guff believes it would be beneficial for the Fund to make such an investment.

33



Negotiation of Terms and Conditions. Portfolio Investments will consist primarily of debt securities, and the investments in the same companies by Underlying Funds (and, if applicable, Direct Investments by Small Buyout Portfolios) will consist primarily of equity securities. The interests of debt investors differ significantly from the interests of equity investors in the same company. For example, debt investors will seek to negotiate the highest interest rate and fees possible, and negotiate restrictive covenants and events of default to protect their overriding interest in being repaid as scheduled. Equity investors, in contrast, seek the lowest possible interest rate and fees, and less restrictive covenants and events of default. In most cases, however, the general partner of the Underlying Fund, as the “lead investor”, takes primary responsibility for negotiating the terms of the portfolio company’s
borrowings, and the Small Buyout Portfolios will have a limited ability to participate in such negotiations. The Investment Manager generally will have broad discretion to negotiate terms and conditions with respect to the Portfolio Investments.
 
Use of Proceeds. The Investment Manager anticipates that the proceeds of most loans made by the Fund will be used to finance the acquisition of a borrower by a financial sponsor, to refinance existing debt, or to expand the borrower’s business through acquisition or organic growth. The proceeds of some loans, however, may be used in whole or in part to finance distributions to the borrower’s equity investors (a “dividend recapitalization” transaction). The Investment Manager would permit the proceeds of a loan to be used for a dividend recapitalization only if the Investment Manager believes that the borrower will have the ability to service the debt notwithstanding its distribution of the loan proceeds to the equity holders. Financing a dividend recapitalization by a Related Company would benefit the Small Buyout Portfolios, as they would receive a portion of the proceeds of the dividend recapitalization.
 
Allocation of Equity Investment Opportunities. The Fund will frequently make its debt (and, if applicable, equity) investment in a portfolio company at the same time as an equity investment in that portfolio company by the Underlying Fund (and, if applicable, a Direct Investment by a Small Buyout Portfolio). Equity investors typically seek to limit the amount of equity to be acquired by debt investors like the Fund, while the debt investors seek to maximize that amount. To the extent that the Fund secures an equity investment as part of a financing, the amount of equity available to the Small Buyout Portfolios (indirectly through its Fund Investment in the Underlying Fund and/or directly through a Direct Investment) could be reduced.
 
Investment at Different Levels of the Capital Structure. The Small Buyout Portfolios and the Fund may invest in a broad range of asset classes throughout the corporate capital structure, including investments in loans and debt securities, preferred equity securities and common equity securities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Small Buyout Portfolios and the Fund may invest in a portfolio company at a level that is the same as, senior to or subordinate to an investment in the same company made by another fund or account managed by Siguler Guff. This may give rise to actual or potential conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts of interest. In that regard, actions may be taken for the Small Buyout Portfolios that are adverse to the Fund.
 
For example, if the Fund were to invest in the debt of a portfolio company in which a Small Buyout Portfolio holds equity or some other interest junior to the Fund’s debt, the interests of the Fund and such Small Buyout Portfolio would be adverse. The Fund would be senior to the Small Buyout Portfolio in the capital structure of such company and, in a distress or workout scenario, the Fund could recover on its investment while the Small Buyout Portfolio may not. It is also possible that the Small Buyout Portfolios could hold securities that are senior to those owned by the Fund although, for the entities and accounts that presently comprise the Small Buyout Portfolios, this is unlikely to occur because the existing Small Buyout Portfolios concentrate on equity investments. These situations would present numerous conflicts or the appearance of conflicts, and the furtherance by the Fund or the Small Buyout Portfolio of their respective interests could cause
a decline in the value of the other’s investment.

34



In a different example, a borrower may default under a loan from the Fund. The Fund generally would have the ability to pursue a number of remedies, including acceleration of the outstanding principal and interest, foreclosing on collateral in the case of a secured loan, and pursuing recovery against the borrower through the civil or bankruptcy courts. Borrowers may at times request that the Fund waive enforcement of a loan covenant or other provision, and the Fund may demand that the borrower compensate the Fund for the waiver through a cash payment or modification of loan terms. Under certain circumstances, the Investment Manager may conclude that restructuring a defaulted loan, or otherwise forbearing from exercising all the remedies available to the Fund as a lender, would ultimately result in a better outcome for the Fund. Such forbearance could benefit the owners of the borrower’s equity securities, which may include the Small Buyout Portfolios in
the case of Related Companies.
 
Certain Policies. In light of these potential conflicts of interest, the Investment Manager will seek prior approval by the Fund’s board of directors (including a majority of the disinterested directors) if (a) the Fund invests in a Related Company and (b) the Investment Manager proposes that the Fund engage in any of the following transactions:
 



·
A loan to a Direct Related Company (other than a loan primarily intended to finance a dividend recapitalization – see below) if the Fund is not acquiring equity securities with a value equal to at least 10% of the loan amount, or warrants with an exercise price equal to at least 10% of the loan value;



 




·
If, in connection with a loan to a Direct Related Company, the amount of equity available in the aggregate to the Fund and one or more Small Buyout Portfolios is limited by the equity sponsor or borrower to less than the aggregate amount desired by the Fund and such Small Buyout Portfolios, the equity securities available to the Fund will be limited to a maximum of: (a) 10% of the loan amount, plus (b) such additional amounts as are available after all the Small Buyout Portfolios have acquired their desired allocations of the available equity securities. This policy could result in the Fund receiving an allocation that is less favorable than desired.



 



·
A loan to a Related Company if 50% or more of the loan proceeds can be used to finance a dividend recapitalization;



 



·
Following a default by a Related Company, forbearance from exercising one or more material available remedies;



 



·
Restructuring of an existing loan to a Related Company that changes the interest rate, amortization terms or maturity; or



 



·
Any investment into a Related Company in which the Small Buyout Portfolios (and any other persons affiliated with the Investment Manager) own in the aggregate 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities.



 
In addition, the Fund will not invest in a Related Company if:
 



·
A person who is an affiliate of the Investment Manager is a voting member of the Related Company’s board of directors;




35





·
The Small Buyout Portfolios (and any other persons affiliated with the Investment Manager) own in the aggregate 25% or more of the Related Company’s outstanding voting securities; or



 



·
The Small Buyout Portfolios (and any other persons affiliated with the Investment Manager) “control” the Related Company, as that term is defined under the 1940 Act.



 
In addition, when the Fund invests in a Related Company:
 



·
The Investment Manager will provide a detailed report to the Fund’s board of directors at each regular meeting regarding the Fund’s investments in Related Companies, including the amount and general terms of such investment, the identity of the parties that cause the company to be a Related Company, and the Related Company’s relationship with such parties, and any recent significant developments that could affect the Fund’s ability to be paid on its loan; and



 



·
The Investment Manager and its affiliates will seek, consistent with their duties to the Small Buyout Portfolios, to make arrangements with the Related Company and its controlling shareholders to reduce the likelihood that personnel of the Investment Manager or its affiliates will receive information that could inhibit the ability of the Fund to enforce its rights against the Related Company.



 
Effect of Borrowings. The Investment Management Fee will be based on a percentage of cost basis of the Fund’s assets, including assets acquired with borrowed funds. Therefore, decisions by the Investment Manager to cause the Fund to borrow additional funds may increase the quarterly fees payable to the Investment Manager. The Fund’s overall borrowing limits, however, are set by the Fund’s board of directors in light of its fiduciary obligations.
 
Indemnification and Exculpation. The charter of the Fund authorizes it and the bylaws of the Fund (the “Bylaws”) obligate it to indemnify its directors, officers, employees and agents (including the Investment Manager), among others of the Fund to the full extent permitted by Maryland law and the 1940 Act, including the advance of expenses and reasonable counsel fees. The charter of the Fund also contains a provision eliminating personal liability of a Fund director or officer to the Fund or its stockholders for money damages, subject to specified exceptions. A successful claim for such indemnification, including payment of any expenses and counsel fees, would reduce the Fund’s assets by the amounts paid. For a more detailed discussion of such indemnification
provisions, see the discussion herein at Item 12, “Indemnification of Directors and Officers.”
 
Selection of Disinterested Directors. Initially, at the time the Fund is formed, a majority of the Fund’s directors will be interested directors. The board of directors of the Fund intends that, prior to the commencement of the Fund’s operations, a majority of the Fund’s directors will be disinterested directors. Although the continued service of all directors will be subject to periodic election by the Fund’s stockholders, the initial selection of directors, including the disinterested directors, will be made by the Investment Manager.
 
Although the fact that the Fund has a board of directors (a majority of whose members are disinterested) may mitigate certain conflicts, it will not necessarily prevent or mitigate all conflicts or prevent or mitigate them to the extent desired.
 



ITEM 2.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION



 
The Fund has not commenced business and has no revenues or assets other than the $25,000 received from the Partnership as consideration for the purchase of Shares.

36





ITEM 3.
PROPERTIES



 
The Fund has not commenced business and has no assets other than the $25,000 received from the Partnership as consideration for the purchase of Shares. It is anticipated that the Fund’s principal assets following commencement of operations will be securities.
 




ITEM 4.


SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGERS




 
An affiliate of the Investment Manager has contributed $25,000 to the Partnership, and the Partnership in turn has purchased 100,000 Shares at a price of $0.25 per share as the Fund’s initial capital. Therefore, until immediately subsequent to the first call for further capital contributions to the Fund, the general partner of the Partnership (the “General Partner”) will be deemed to “control” the Fund through its control of the Partnership.

The Investment Manager
 
Siguler Guff Advisers, LLC is a limited liability company that serves as Investment Manager to the Fund. The Investment Manager is a New York-based multi-strategy private equity investment firm which, across all its affiliated companies, manages investments and commitments for its clients of over $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2013. The Investment Manager is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Investment Manager’s principal business address is 825 Third Avenue, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10022.
 
George Siguler, Drew Guff, Donald Spencer and Ken Burns, each a Managing Director of the Investment Manager, own 100% of the voting interests in Siguler Guff & Company, LP (“Siguler Guff”), which in turn owns 100% of the membership interests in the Investment Manager.

BNY Mellon Asset Management (the umbrella organization for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s affiliated investment management firms and global distribution companies) has a 20% non-voting interest in Siguler Guff.

Siguler and Guff, and affiliated entities established for the benefit of their family members, together own a majority of Siguler Guff, in equal amounts.
 




ITEM 6.


EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION




 
The Fund will pay no compensation to its officers who are “interested persons” (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Investment Manager or to its directors other than its disinterested directors. The Fund’s disinterested directors are expected to each receive an annual fee from the Fund of $20,000. Such directors also will be reimbursed by the Fund for their expenses in attending meetings of the board of directors or any committee thereof and are expected to receive a fee for attendance in person at any meeting at a per diem rate of $1,000. The Chair of the Fund’s Audit Committee are also expected to receive an annual retainer fee from the Fund of $5,000. Because the executive officers of the Fund will not receive compensation for their services to the Fund, the Fund will not have a Compensation Committee.
 




ITEM 7.


CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE




 
(a)  Transactions With Related Persons.
 
See “Conflicts of Interest” within Item 1A.

40


(b)  Review and Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons
 
The board of directors of the Fund intends to adopt a policy that any transaction with a “related person” that would require disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K must be approved by a majority of the Fund’s directors who have no interest in the transaction, and a majority of the Fund’s disinterested directors, taking into account, among such other factors as the directors deem appropriate, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unrelated party under the same or similar circumstances, and the extent of the related person’s interest in the transaction.
 
(c)  Indebtedness of Management
 
None.
 
(d)  Transactions With Promoters
 
Siguler Guff Advisers may be deemed a promoter of the Fund. The Fund will enter into a Investment Management Agreement with Siguler Guff Advisers pursuant to which Siguler Guff Advisers will, subject to the investment policies and guidelines established by the board of directors, identify, evaluate, structure and close the investments to be made by the Fund, arrange debt financing for the Fund, provide portfolio management and servicing of loans held in the Fund’s portfolio, and administer the Fund’s day-to-day affairs.
 
The Fund will pay all of its operating expenses except those specifically required to be borne by the Investment Manager, including: (i) costs related to the organization of the Fund and the offer and placement of its shares, including legal and accounting fees; (ii) costs related to the acquisition, ownership and sale of Fund investments (including hedging and derivative transactions), including brokerage commissions, transaction taxes and due diligence, travel, investment banking, legal, accounting, custodian and research expenses, including all such costs with respect to transactions that are not consummated to the extent that such costs are not reimbursed by entities in which the Fund invests or proposes to invest; (iii) transfer, registration and similar expenses incurred by the Fund; (iv) expenses allocable to the Fund as a partner or investor in Fund investments; (v) legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the review and negotiation
of the terms and conditions of Fund investments; (vi) SEC fees and expenses, including the expenses of compliance with SEC rules and regulations, and any fees and expenses of state securities regulatory authorities; (vii) costs of proxy solicitations; (viii) costs of meetings of stockholders and the board of directors; (ix) charges and expenses of the Fund’s custodian, transfer and dividend disbursing agents; (x) compensation and expenses of the Fund’s directors who are not interested persons of the Fund, the Investment Manager or the placement agent, and of any of the Fund’s officers who are not interested persons of the Investment Manager, and expenses of directors in attending board of director or stockholder meetings; (xi) costs of any certificates representing the shares of capital stock of the Fund; (xii) fees and expenses of consultants, contractors, experts or custodians retained by the Fund; (xiii) auditing and tax preparation expenses; (xiv) interest expenses;
(xv) costs of indemnification arrangements to which the Fund is a party and premiums for liability insurance; (xvi) all extraordinary expenses, such as litigation and indemnification costs and expenses, judgments and settlements; (xvii) the Investment Management Fee (as defined below); (xviii) any taxes levied upon the Fund; (xix) costs of preparing, printing and distributing reports to stockholders; (xx) costs of stationery and supplies; (xxi) the costs of membership by the Fund in any trade organizations; and (xxii) costs of any service providers engaged by the Fund.

41



The expenses to be borne by the Investment Manager are limited to the following:  (i) compensation and expenses of the Investment Manager’s officers, directors and employees that relate to the services provided to the Fund and other normal and routine administrative expenses that relate to the services provided to the Fund; provided, however, that the Investment Manager shall not be required to pay (and if paid by the Investment Manager, the Investment Manager shall be reimbursed by the Fund for payments of) any fees or expense required to be borne by the Fund pursuant to the preceding paragraph; (ii) the cost of adequate office space for the Fund and all necessary office equipment and services, including telephone service, heat, utilities and similar items; and (iii) the cost of providing the Fund with such corporate, administrative and clerical personnel (including officers and directors of the Fund who are interested persons of the Investment Manager
and are acting in their respective capacities as officers and directors) as the Fund’s board of directors reasonably deems necessary or advisable to perform the services required to be performed by the Investment Manager under the Investment Management Agreement.
 
As compensation for its services to the Fund, the Investment Manager will receive the Investment Management Fee from the Fund. The Investment Management Fee will be paid by the Fund and computed and paid quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to 1.75% per annum of the Fund’s Invested Capital (as defined below), as measured as of the close of business on the last business day of such quarterly period. “Invested Capital” means the cost basis of the portfolio investments of the Fund (excluding cash and cash equivalents) that have not been written off or disposed of, including portfolio investments acquired with borrowed funds, and excluding any portfolio investments held indirectly through any SBIC Subsidiary (if formed).  Any portfolio investment that has been written down to ten percent (10%) or less of its cost basis shall be treated as written off for purposes of calculating the Investment Management Fee.
 
 The Investment Management Fee is higher than those of most investment companies, although it is comparable to those of many investment funds offered privately to institutional investors that have investment programs similar to that of the Fund.
 
One hundred percent (100%) of all directors’ fees, consulting and monitoring fees, advisory board or investment committee fees, commitment fees, break-up fees and advisory fees received by the Investment Manager or its affiliates in respect of the Fund’s portfolio investments other than any investments held through any SBIC Subsidiary (if formed) shall be applied to reduce subsequent payments of the Investment Management Fee by the Fund.
 
Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Manager will not be liable for any error in judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Fund in connection with the Investment Management Agreement, except a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the Investment Manager in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard of its duties and obligations under the Investment Management Agreement. The Investment Management Agreement will continue in effect for a period longer than two years from its date of execution only if such continuation is approved at least annually by the board of directors or a majority of outstanding voting securities of the Fund, and by a majority of the directors who are not parties to the Investment Management Agreement or interested persons of such parties. The Investment Management Agreement is terminable by vote of the Fund’s board of directors or by
the holders of a majority of the Interests, at any time without penalty, on 60 days’ written notice to the Investment Manager. The Investment Management Agreement may also be terminated by the Investment Manager on 60 days’ written notice to the Fund, and will terminate automatically upon its assignment.

42


(e)  Director Independence

All of the current directors and officers of the Fund are officers of the Investment Manager. The board of directors of the Fund anticipates electing three or more additional directors who are not “interested persons” of the Fund, as defined under the 1940 Act.
 




ITEM 8.


LEGAL PROCEEDINGS




 
None.
 




ITEM 9.


MARKET PRICE OF AND DIVIDENDS ON THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.




 
(a)  Market Information
 
The offer and sale of the Shares will not be registered under the 1933 Act. The offer and sale are exempt from such registration requirements as they do not constitute a public offering pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and Regulation D of the 1933 Act.
 
Because the Shares will be acquired by investors in one or more transactions “not involving a public offering,” they will be “restricted securities” and may be required to be held indefinitely. Shares may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise disposed of unless registered under applicable securities laws or specifically exempted from registration (in which case the stockholder will, at the option of the Fund, be required to provide the Fund with a legal opinion, in form and substance satisfactory to the Fund, that registration is not required). Accordingly, an investor must be willing to bear the economic risk of investment in the Shares until the Fund is liquidated. No sale, transfer, assignment, pledge or other disposition, whether voluntary or involuntary, of the Shares may be made except by registration of the transfer on the Fund’s books. Each transferee will be required to execute an instrument agreeing to be bound
by these restrictions and the other restrictions imposed on the Shares, and to execute such other instruments or certifications as are reasonably required by the Fund.
 
(b)  Holders
 
An affiliate of the Investment Manager has contributed $25,000 to the Partnership, and the Partnership in turn has purchased 100,000 Shares at a price of $0.25 per share as the Fund’s initial capital. Therefore, until immediately subsequent to the first call for further capital contributions to the Fund, the General Partner will be deemed to “control” the Fund through its control of the Partnership since it is the only stockholder as of the date of this Form 10 Registration Statement.
 
(c)  Dividends
 
It is anticipated that, commencing with the second year of its investment operations, the Fund will seek to meet the requirements, including diversification requirements, to qualify for the special pass-through status available to RICs under the Code. Unless and until the Fund meets these requirements, it will be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income for that year (even if that income is distributed to the stockholders) and all distributions out of its earnings and profits will be taxable to the stockholders as dividends; thus, such income will be subject to two layers of tax (although corporate stockholders may be entitled to a dividends-received deduction).  As a result, it is expected that, during the period before the Fund qualifies as a RIC, it will have little or no investment income, and will pay little or no dividends.

43



After the Fund qualifies as a RIC, it intends to distribute to its stockholders substantially all of its net investment income and net realized capital gains, if any, as determined for income tax purposes. Applicable law, including provisions of the 1940 Act, may limit the amount of dividends and other distributions payable by the Fund. Income dividends will generally be paid quarterly to the stockholders of record on the last day of each preceding calendar quarter end. Substantially all of the Fund’s net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss) and net short-term capital gain, if any, will be distributed at least annually with the Fund’s final quarterly dividend distribution for the year. The Fund also expects to make in-kind distributions to its stockholders of any warrants it receives in connection with loans and any securities acquired as a result of direct equity investments, although as a result of
regulatory issues under the 1940 Act, equity investments from time to time may be retained.
 




ITEM 10.


RECENT SALES OF UNREGULATED SECURITIES




 
See Item 9(b).
 




ITEM 11.


DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES TO BE REGISTERED.




 
GENERAL. The Limited Partners will instruct the Partnership, pro rata in accordance with each Limited Partner’s percentage interest in the Partnership, as to how to vote the Shares held by the Partnership, as required by Section 12(d)(1)(E) of the 1940 Act. All Shares will participate equally in dividends and distributions and in the proceeds of any liquidation. Shares have no preference, conversion, exchange or cumulative voting rights. The Fund has 10,000,000 Shares authorized.
 
Annual meetings may be held at such time as is set by the Fund’s board of directors and special meetings may be called by the Chairman of the board of directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, a majority of the board of directors or by Limited Partners holding at least 30% of the Interests in the Partnership. The Fund anticipates soliciting proxies from Limited Partners for each annual meeting.
 
TRANSFERABILITY OF SHARES. The offer and sale of the Shares will not be registered under the 1933 Act. The offer and sale are exempt from such registration requirements as they do not constitute a public offering pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and Regulation D of the 1933 Act.
 
Because the Shares will be acquired by investors in transactions “not involving a public offering,” they will be “restricted securities” and may be required to be held indefinitely. Shares may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise disposed of unless registered under applicable securities laws or exempted from registration (in which case the stockholder will, at the option of the Fund, be required to provide the Fund with a legal opinion, in form and substance satisfactory to the Fund, that registration is not required). No sale, transfer, assignment, pledge or other disposition, whether voluntary or involuntary, of the Shares may be made except by registration of the transfer on the Fund’s books. Each transferee will be required to execute an instrument agreeing to be bound by these restrictions and the other restrictions imposed on the Shares and to execute such other instruments or certifications as are reasonably required
by the Fund.
 




ITEM 12.


INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS




 
The Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”) permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from (a) actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or (b) active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action.  The charter of the Fund contains such a provision which eliminates such liability to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law.

44



The Fund’s charter authorizes the Fund, and the Bylaws require the Fund, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law and subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act, to indemnify any present or former director, officer, employee or agent (including any “investment adviser” or “principal underwriter,” as those terms are defined in the 1940 Act) and any individual who, while serving as the Fund’s director or officer and at the Fund’s request, serves or has served another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise as a director, officer, member, manager, partner, trustee, employee or agent who, in either case, is made, or threatened to be made, a party to, or witness in, a proceeding by reason of his or her service in any such capacity, from and against any claim or liability to which
that person may become subject or which that person may incur by reason of such service and to pay or reimburse his or her reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding. The charter and Bylaws also permit the Fund to indemnify and advance expenses to any person who served a predecessor of the Fund in any of the capacities described above.


The MGCL requires a corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which the Fund’s charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he is made a party to by reason of his service in that capacity.  The MGCL permits a corporation to indemnify its present and former directors and officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that (a) the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (i) was committed in bad faith or (ii) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (b) the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services
or (c) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful.  However, under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation may not indemnify for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of the corporation or for a judgment of liability on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received, unless in either case a court orders indemnification and then only for expenses.  In addition, the MGCL permits a corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the corporation’s receipt of (a) a written affirmation by the director or officer of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation and (b) a written undertaking by him or on his behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the corporation if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct was not met.


The Bylaws provide that the Fund may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer or agent of the Fund or who is or was serving at the request of the Fund as a director, officer, member, manager, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against that person and incurred by that person in or arising out of his or her position, whether or not the Fund would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability.

93% of small business funding is rejected by banks. Banks overwhelmingly say “No” to small business loan requests. However, just because a bank won’t fund a deal doesn’t mean there is no startup business funding or business credit available for that deal. Since 2003, Ed Keels and his staff at Beyond Breakeven, Inc. (BBI) have been helping people with deal structures that provide business funding and business credit when banks won’t. In fact, BBI has developed more than 100 ways to fund a business acquisition or startup and do so with little to none of the buyer’s own money.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
