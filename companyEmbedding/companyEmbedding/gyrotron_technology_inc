Industry Technology Examples
Manufacturing processes today demand many capabilities from materials. Enhancements such as composite formulations, complex shapes, and multi-layer processes are subject to ever-increasing production speeds. The Gyrotron beam meets these needs by selectively heating one material while leaving others cool, focusing its energy only where needed by heating one layer or material through a surrounding layer. Thus, manufacturers can make the most of advanced product formulations.
The Gyrotron technology combines the focusing ability of a beam (like lasers or e-beams) with the volumetric heating capabilities of microwave. This results in ultra-fast, efficient thermal treatment of almost any material. Plastics, ceramics or glass, for example, can be joined by the Gyrotron beam without degrading their properties. A coating can be selectively melted, or parts can be overheated for precision bending.
The Gyrotron beam is a great technology to increase productivity. It provides rapid heating where local/exclusive heating is desirable, and maintains material integrity. It is energy-saving and imparts less impact on environmental conditions. The following are examples of some Gyrotron beam technologies:

Glass
Semiconductors
Solar
Polymers
Adhesives
Joining
Drying
Coating
Food

What is Gyrotron
HomeWhat is Gyrotron
What is Gyrotron
Gyrotron is the first and only microwave generated in the form of a beam.  This revolutionary process heater is a distinct cut above common microwave (2.45GHz). The Gyrotron Beam has a high frequency (between 30 to 110 GHz) that creates exceptionally high power density of up to 15 KW/mm2 (10,000 KW per sq. inch). Gyrotron users can shape the beam to a point, a strip, or even a layer of heat. Once properly shaped, users can direct the beam by a motion system set to scan, oscillate, or focus the heat exactly where it is needed.
Gyrotron Beam’s milimetric wavelength ensures that the energy is used in heating the material being processed, not the space around it, thereby creating high efficiencies. Because of its ability to achieve volumetric, uniform heating at virtually any temperature, sensitive processes such as joining dissimilar materials, bending glass and processing semiconductors become elementary. This technology is instrumental in laying the groundwork for the creation of new products with unique properties.

BENEFITS
 

]

1 - Very High Temperature
The Gyrotron Beam is the most efficient and effective industrial heating device and can heat an object to over 3,000º C with high repeatability and accuracy.

 
 



2 - More Efficient Solar Panels
The efficiency of solar cells can be increased as a result of the high temperature annealing made possible by the gyrotron.

 
 



3 - Controlled Shapes
The Gyrotron Beam is controllable and can allow for glass to be shaped into any form – circular, strip, square, etc greatly increasing processing possibilities

 
 



4 - Safer Food & Produce
The Gyrotron can reduce bacteria by almost a million times without “cooking” of meat. A 2000% improvement over current technology!
