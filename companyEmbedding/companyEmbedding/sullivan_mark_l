If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related.

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?
