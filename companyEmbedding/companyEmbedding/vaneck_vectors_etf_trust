VanEck Vectors CEF Municipal Income ETF - Any Alpha, Or Just Double Fees? - VanEck Vectors CEF Municipal Income ETF (NYSEARCA:XMPT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»VanEck Vectors CEF Municipal Income ETF - Any Alpha, Or Just Double Fees?Jul.24.17 | About: VanEck Vectors (XMPT) Maks F. S. Registered investment advisor, portfolio strategy, REITs, mutual fundsMarketplaceIncome IdeaSummaryAn in depth discussion of the VanEck Municipal Bond CEF ETF.Take a hard look at the S-Network Muni Bond CEF Index and its methodology.We discuss various ways this ETF may fit into your overall financial plans.Over the last few weeks I have been focusing on doing updates on previously researched closed end funds. In particular, over the last few articles I have been looking at various fixed income closed end funds, namely municipal CEFs such as the Blackrock Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:MUI), Nuveen Build America Bond Fund (NYSE:NBD) and the Nuveen AMT Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:NEA). During the research I have discovered another interesting option for the Muni CEF theme, and that is the VanEck Vectors CEF Municipal Income ETF (NYSEARCA:XMPT), an ETF that invests in a portfolio of municipal closed end funds.  Well I'll be darned... how did I miss this. Let's take a look. Fund Basics  Sponsor: VanEck Index: S-Network Municipal Bond Closed-End Fund Index (CEFMXTR) AUM: Approximately $94 Million Historical Style : National Muni Investment Objectives: Seeks Federal tax-free income. Number of Holdings: 71 Current Yield: 4.81% Inception Date: 07-12-2011 Fees: 1.70% Gross, 1.56% Net (after expense reinbursement/fee waiver), including underlying CEF funds' fees.  Source: YCharts & VanEck Website Why This Fund VanEck does not do as good a job as many other ETF and Mutual Fund companies putting together a "sales pitch" for its products. On their website, the best attempt at identifying it would be the small section talking about the "key points" of the fund. 

 Source: VanEck Website In essence, a diverisfied, one ticket solution for buying a portfolio of closed end funds. This would describe their point of diversification. 
 The other two, "Potential High Level of Tax-Exempt Income" and "The Discount Advantage" are really a benefit of buying closed end funds, and not necessarily a benefit of this particular ETF. The Index & The Fund The firm that did a better job at pitching the fund I feel is actually the index sponsor, S-Network. In their index presentation, S-Network does a great job of both pitching the fund and explaining their index methodology. Below is what the index provider believes are the key features and rationale behind the index they provide for the ETF. 

Source: S-Net Index Presentation 

Source: S-Net Index Presentation 

Source: S-Net Index Presentation From the above, we can sum up the index as that of one seeking tax free income from municipal bonds, using leverage to increase returns. By investing in multiple funds, they can provide diversification in a variety of categories including asset class, strategy and management. By investing in CEFs, they may also benefit from buying at discounts to NAV. Looking at how the index is constructed we start with the index eligibility. 

Source: S-Net Index Presentation
 To be included the CEF must be at least $100 million in market cap and registered in the United States. The funds must generally have a 3 month average daily trading volume of at least $500k, and reasonable fees, typically 2% or less. Furthermore, CEFs trading at premiums of more than 20% are excluded. Next we look at the weighting methodology. 

Source: S-Net Index Presentation As we can see above, the index weights the CEFs in the index based on the total net assets of the fund. Those "net assets" are then adjusted to reflect either the discount or premium in the price to NAV. Then the funds are capped to 8% of the index. Furthermore, any funds weighted at over 5% cannot be more than 45% combined. Essentially, the index screens out illiquid, expensive fee, and premium priced CEFs, and weights the remaining funds based on total fund assets. This is the resulting top 10 holdings in the index. 

Source: VanEck Website So how has it worked so far? Let's take a look. Performance We can first take a look at how the ETF has performed against the the iShares National Muni Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:MUB) and the broader iShares US Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:AGG). As we can see, much like the municipal CEFs we have looked at over the past few articles, the fund has performed well YTD, being up 8.11% on a total return basis, compared to a 3.77% total return gain for the unlevered iShares ETF and 3% for the US Aggregate ETF.
 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts Looking at a 1 year number however, we can see a different picture. Simply put, levered closed end funds were decimated in Q4 2016 as the Fed started raising interest rates. 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts Looking at a longer 3 year time frame, we can see the "benefits" and characteristics of closed end funds, namely leverage. The VanEck ETF is up more than 24% on a total return basis.  It is interesting to point out the big roller-coaster from July to December 2016.  

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts For the 5 year chart, I added another set of metrics, that is the price per share % change. This way you can appreciate and see what percentage of the total return comes from the dividends and income, rather than the actual growth in share price. Once again, over the 5 year time frame XMPT has achieved a total return of over 23%. Yet, not including the income, the price per share is actually down 5.81%. Over the same time-frame, MUB's price fell only .69% and achieved a total return of 13.02% whereas AGG fell 2.21% and achieved a total return of 10.58%.
 

XMPT data by YCharts Lastly, we can take a look at the fund's since inception numbers. Since inception, the fund has done extremely well, certainly outperforming the ETF competition. It has achieved a price per share increase of 9.05% and a total return of 50.78%, compared to 6.79% and 25.40% for MUB and 2.08% and 18.76% for AGG. 

XMPT data by YCharts All great, right? The question is, why not just buy a few good top performing CEFs and save on the fees? Let's take a look at how the ETF compares against just holding some of the individual holdings. We take a look at XMPT against the Nuveen AMT Free Quality Muni Income Fund (NEA), the Nuveen AMT-Free Muni Credit Fund (NVG), the Eaton Vance Muni Bond Fund (EIM) and the BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund (MUI). As we can see over the YTD number, the ETF has performed quite well against its peers, only second best to the red line, representing the Nuveen AMT Free Muni Fund (NVG). 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts The exact same holds true for the 1 year time frame. 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts
 ... and the 3 year number.  

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts On the 5 year time frame nearly the same picture is present although the difference in performance is significantly greater and the Eaton Vance fund outperformed the ETF. 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts Examining the since inception however the trend resumes with XMPT taking second place again, behind NVG. 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts Finally, I wanted to take a look at how this "managed" ETF does compared to the way I typically looked at diversification in CEFs, and that is through Unit Investment Trusts, or UITs. One popular sponsor is Guggenheim. They currently have a 2 year portfolio maturing this November. Since November 10th, 2015, the UIT has achieved a total return of 13.90%. The ETF has achieved a return of 15.07% over the same time period. The one thing not considered however is the dividends reinvested, where the ETF would incur transaction fees if reinvesting the dividend. 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts
 Another popular series of Municipal CEF UITs is the First Trust Portfolios series. One portfolio that I looked at is a 5 year portfolio launched in August 15, 2012, which is due to mature in about a month. Over that time frame the portfolio has returned 19.78%. During the same time-frame, XMPT would achieve a total return of 23.94%.  

XMPT data by YCharts While it is not definitive, I will be looking at this more closely in the future. Bottom Line So bottom line, you would of been better off just buying the Nuveen AMT-Free Muni Credit Closed End Fund (NYSEMKT:NVG). It is the largest holding in the ETF and it has outperformed the ETF over every observed time frame. The other funds, the Nuveen funds in particular have performed quite well as well. The value of the ETF I believe is that it is a 1 ticket solution to having a basket of muni closed end funds over buying and managing your own basket. Beyond that, the ETF will in essence automatically routinely rebalance and reallocate itself, possibly saving you ticket charges. I am quite sure if you picked a good basket of muni CEFs and managed the quarterly rebalancing yourself, you would likely come out ahead, saving the 40 bpts fee. Is this fund solving some massive CEF problem? No, not at all. What it is however is a good "introductory" investment for those looking at closed end funds but do not know where to start.  It is also a perfect investment for investors looking to dollar cost average into without spending too much on monthly purchase trading fees. The alternative for those investors is then a UIT which will reinvest with no additional fees.  So would I rush out and buy the fund? No... not really, but I can certainly understand however why someone would.
 For investors with some time and knack for CEFs, I would simply do some due diligence and select some quality municipal CEFs, perhaps starting with NVG and NEA.  I hope this update is helpful. Until the next update, keep doing your due diligence. More information on this ETF is available at the fund's website. More information about the Index can be found here.

Overview

The VanEck Merk Gold Trust (the “Trust” or "OUNZ") provides investors with a convenient and cost-efficient way to buy and hold gold through an exchange traded product with the option to take physical delivery of gold.
 
The Trust’s primary objective is to provide investors with an opportunity to invest in gold through the shares and be able to take delivery of physical gold bullion (physical gold) in exchange for their shares. The Trust’s secondary objective is for the shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold less the expenses of the Trust’s operations.
 














 

Key Points

DeliverabilityVanEck Merk Gold Trust holds gold bullion in the form of allocated London Bars. It differentiates itself by providing investors with the option to take physical delivery of gold bullion in exchange for their shares. ConvertibilityFor the purpose of facilitating delivery, Merk has developed a proprietary process for the conversion of London Bars into gold coins and bars in denominations investors may desire. Tax EfficiencyTaking delivery of gold is not a taxable event as investors merely take possession of what they already own: the gold.

VanEck Vectors CEF Municipal Income ETF - Any Alpha, Or Just Double Fees? - VanEck Vectors CEF Municipal Income ETF (NYSEARCA:XMPT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»VanEck Vectors CEF Municipal Income ETF - Any Alpha, Or Just Double Fees?Jul.24.17 | About: VanEck Vectors (XMPT) Maks F. S. Registered investment advisor, portfolio strategy, REITs, mutual fundsMarketplaceIncome IdeaSummaryAn in depth discussion of the VanEck Municipal Bond CEF ETF.Take a hard look at the S-Network Muni Bond CEF Index and its methodology.We discuss various ways this ETF may fit into your overall financial plans.Over the last few weeks I have been focusing on doing updates on previously researched closed end funds. In particular, over the last few articles I have been looking at various fixed income closed end funds, namely municipal CEFs such as the Blackrock Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:MUI), Nuveen Build America Bond Fund (NYSE:NBD) and the Nuveen AMT Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:NEA). During the research I have discovered another interesting option for the Muni CEF theme, and that is the VanEck Vectors CEF Municipal Income ETF (NYSEARCA:XMPT), an ETF that invests in a portfolio of municipal closed end funds.  Well I'll be darned... how did I miss this. Let's take a look. Fund Basics  Sponsor: VanEck Index: S-Network Municipal Bond Closed-End Fund Index (CEFMXTR) AUM: Approximately $94 Million Historical Style : National Muni Investment Objectives: Seeks Federal tax-free income. Number of Holdings: 71 Current Yield: 4.81% Inception Date: 07-12-2011 Fees: 1.70% Gross, 1.56% Net (after expense reinbursement/fee waiver), including underlying CEF funds' fees.  Source: YCharts & VanEck Website Why This Fund VanEck does not do as good a job as many other ETF and Mutual Fund companies putting together a "sales pitch" for its products. On their website, the best attempt at identifying it would be the small section talking about the "key points" of the fund. 

 Source: VanEck Website In essence, a diverisfied, one ticket solution for buying a portfolio of closed end funds. This would describe their point of diversification. 
 The other two, "Potential High Level of Tax-Exempt Income" and "The Discount Advantage" are really a benefit of buying closed end funds, and not necessarily a benefit of this particular ETF. The Index & The Fund The firm that did a better job at pitching the fund I feel is actually the index sponsor, S-Network. In their index presentation, S-Network does a great job of both pitching the fund and explaining their index methodology. Below is what the index provider believes are the key features and rationale behind the index they provide for the ETF. 

Source: S-Net Index Presentation 

Source: S-Net Index Presentation 

Source: S-Net Index Presentation From the above, we can sum up the index as that of one seeking tax free income from municipal bonds, using leverage to increase returns. By investing in multiple funds, they can provide diversification in a variety of categories including asset class, strategy and management. By investing in CEFs, they may also benefit from buying at discounts to NAV. Looking at how the index is constructed we start with the index eligibility. 

Source: S-Net Index Presentation
 To be included the CEF must be at least $100 million in market cap and registered in the United States. The funds must generally have a 3 month average daily trading volume of at least $500k, and reasonable fees, typically 2% or less. Furthermore, CEFs trading at premiums of more than 20% are excluded. Next we look at the weighting methodology. 

Source: S-Net Index Presentation As we can see above, the index weights the CEFs in the index based on the total net assets of the fund. Those "net assets" are then adjusted to reflect either the discount or premium in the price to NAV. Then the funds are capped to 8% of the index. Furthermore, any funds weighted at over 5% cannot be more than 45% combined. Essentially, the index screens out illiquid, expensive fee, and premium priced CEFs, and weights the remaining funds based on total fund assets. This is the resulting top 10 holdings in the index. 

Source: VanEck Website So how has it worked so far? Let's take a look. Performance We can first take a look at how the ETF has performed against the the iShares National Muni Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:MUB) and the broader iShares US Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:AGG). As we can see, much like the municipal CEFs we have looked at over the past few articles, the fund has performed well YTD, being up 8.11% on a total return basis, compared to a 3.77% total return gain for the unlevered iShares ETF and 3% for the US Aggregate ETF.
 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts Looking at a 1 year number however, we can see a different picture. Simply put, levered closed end funds were decimated in Q4 2016 as the Fed started raising interest rates. 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts Looking at a longer 3 year time frame, we can see the "benefits" and characteristics of closed end funds, namely leverage. The VanEck ETF is up more than 24% on a total return basis.  It is interesting to point out the big roller-coaster from July to December 2016.  

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts For the 5 year chart, I added another set of metrics, that is the price per share % change. This way you can appreciate and see what percentage of the total return comes from the dividends and income, rather than the actual growth in share price. Once again, over the 5 year time frame XMPT has achieved a total return of over 23%. Yet, not including the income, the price per share is actually down 5.81%. Over the same time-frame, MUB's price fell only .69% and achieved a total return of 13.02% whereas AGG fell 2.21% and achieved a total return of 10.58%.
 

XMPT data by YCharts Lastly, we can take a look at the fund's since inception numbers. Since inception, the fund has done extremely well, certainly outperforming the ETF competition. It has achieved a price per share increase of 9.05% and a total return of 50.78%, compared to 6.79% and 25.40% for MUB and 2.08% and 18.76% for AGG. 

XMPT data by YCharts All great, right? The question is, why not just buy a few good top performing CEFs and save on the fees? Let's take a look at how the ETF compares against just holding some of the individual holdings. We take a look at XMPT against the Nuveen AMT Free Quality Muni Income Fund (NEA), the Nuveen AMT-Free Muni Credit Fund (NVG), the Eaton Vance Muni Bond Fund (EIM) and the BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund (MUI). As we can see over the YTD number, the ETF has performed quite well against its peers, only second best to the red line, representing the Nuveen AMT Free Muni Fund (NVG). 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts The exact same holds true for the 1 year time frame. 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts
 ... and the 3 year number.  

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts On the 5 year time frame nearly the same picture is present although the difference in performance is significantly greater and the Eaton Vance fund outperformed the ETF. 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts Examining the since inception however the trend resumes with XMPT taking second place again, behind NVG. 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts Finally, I wanted to take a look at how this "managed" ETF does compared to the way I typically looked at diversification in CEFs, and that is through Unit Investment Trusts, or UITs. One popular sponsor is Guggenheim. They currently have a 2 year portfolio maturing this November. Since November 10th, 2015, the UIT has achieved a total return of 13.90%. The ETF has achieved a return of 15.07% over the same time period. The one thing not considered however is the dividends reinvested, where the ETF would incur transaction fees if reinvesting the dividend. 

XMPT Total Return Price data by YCharts
 Another popular series of Municipal CEF UITs is the First Trust Portfolios series. One portfolio that I looked at is a 5 year portfolio launched in August 15, 2012, which is due to mature in about a month. Over that time frame the portfolio has returned 19.78%. During the same time-frame, XMPT would achieve a total return of 23.94%.  

XMPT data by YCharts While it is not definitive, I will be looking at this more closely in the future. Bottom Line So bottom line, you would of been better off just buying the Nuveen AMT-Free Muni Credit Closed End Fund (NYSEMKT:NVG). It is the largest holding in the ETF and it has outperformed the ETF over every observed time frame. The other funds, the Nuveen funds in particular have performed quite well as well. The value of the ETF I believe is that it is a 1 ticket solution to having a basket of muni closed end funds over buying and managing your own basket. Beyond that, the ETF will in essence automatically routinely rebalance and reallocate itself, possibly saving you ticket charges. I am quite sure if you picked a good basket of muni CEFs and managed the quarterly rebalancing yourself, you would likely come out ahead, saving the 40 bpts fee. Is this fund solving some massive CEF problem? No, not at all. What it is however is a good "introductory" investment for those looking at closed end funds but do not know where to start.  It is also a perfect investment for investors looking to dollar cost average into without spending too much on monthly purchase trading fees. The alternative for those investors is then a UIT which will reinvest with no additional fees.  So would I rush out and buy the fund? No... not really, but I can certainly understand however why someone would.
 For investors with some time and knack for CEFs, I would simply do some due diligence and select some quality municipal CEFs, perhaps starting with NVG and NEA.  I hope this update is helpful. Until the next update, keep doing your due diligence. More information on this ETF is available at the fund's website. More information about the Index can be found here.

VanEck Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) Rises 0.33% for Jul 25







27/07/2017 







It is not typically recommended, however to use it as a stand-alone to generate trading signals. The STC combines an exponential moving average with slow stochastics to display a signal line that oscillates between two levels on a scale of 0 to 100. Checking on another technical indicator, the 14-day RSI is now sitting at 62.67, the 7-day rests at 73.92, and the 3-day is presently at 85.90 for VanEck Vectors High Income MLP ETF (YMLP). Typically, the CCI oscillates above and below a zero line. A reading between 0 and -20 would indicate an overbought situation. Many investors will use the CCI in conjunction with other indicators when evaluating a trade. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Stryker Corp (SYK) is noted at 26.55. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX reading over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading from -80 to -100 would signal an oversold situation. Traders may use the indicator to determine stock trends or to identify overbought/oversold conditions. Generally speaking, a rising ADX line means that an existing trend is gaining strength.Taking a look at some additional technical indicators, we see that now VanEck Vectors High Income MLP ETF (YMLP)'s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is resting at 0.00. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. The RSI may be more volatile using a shorter period of time.Taking a closer look from a technical standpoint, VanEck Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF (REMX) presently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 103.06. In general, if the indicator goes above -20, the stock may be considered overbought. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally.Tracking other technical indicators, the 14-day RSI is presently standing at 64.62, the 7-day sits at 70.04, and the 3-day is resting at 66.94 for Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VXUS).
Israel removes more security installations at Temple Mount
					Jordan said initially that the guard could leave only after an investigation, while Israel said he enjoyed diplomatic immunity. The installation of the metal detectors set off widespread protests and deadly Israeli-Palestinian violence in the past week.
				Investors may be looking to compare the current stock price of Guggenheim BulletShares 2018 High Yld Corp Bd ETF (BSJI) to some of its moving averages. This is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. The RSI value will always move between 0 and 100. Since its inception, RSI has remained very popular with traders and investors. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold.For further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator. Using a longer term moving average such as the 200-day may help block out the noise and chaos that is sometimes created by daily price fluctuations. The moving average is a popular investing tool among traders. On the other side, a stock may be considered to be in a downtrend if trading below the moving average and sloping downward. In some cases, MA's may be used as strong reference points for finding support and resistance levels. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. The time horizon for each investor may be different.More notable recent Market Vector Russia ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:RSX) news were published by: Streetinsider.com which released: "Market Vectors Russia ETF Trust (RSX) IV flat into Kushner denies colluding ..." on July 24, 2017, also Investorplace.com with their article: "Market Vector Russia ETF Trust (RSX): The Quick Guide to RSX" published on May 18, 2017, Streetinsider.com published: "Market Vectors Russia ETF Trust (RSX) call put ratio 3.74 calls to 1 put into ..." on July 07, 2017.

27/07/2017 







It is not typically recommended, however to use it as a stand-alone to generate trading signals. The STC combines an exponential moving average with slow stochastics to display a signal line that oscillates between two levels on a scale of 0 to 100. Checking on another technical indicator, the 14-day RSI is now sitting at 62.67, the 7-day rests at 73.92, and the 3-day is presently at 85.90 for VanEck Vectors High Income MLP ETF (YMLP). Typically, the CCI oscillates above and below a zero line. A reading between 0 and -20 would indicate an overbought situation. Many investors will use the CCI in conjunction with other indicators when evaluating a trade. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Stryker Corp (SYK) is noted at 26.55. Many technical chart analysts believe that an ADX reading over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading from -80 to -100 would signal an oversold situation. Traders may use the indicator to determine stock trends or to identify overbought/oversold conditions. Generally speaking, a rising ADX line means that an existing trend is gaining strength.Taking a look at some additional technical indicators, we see that now VanEck Vectors High Income MLP ETF (YMLP)'s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is resting at 0.00. The Williams %R is a momentum indicator that helps measure oversold and overbought levels. The RSI may be more volatile using a shorter period of time.Taking a closer look from a technical standpoint, VanEck Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF (REMX) presently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 103.06. In general, if the indicator goes above -20, the stock may be considered overbought. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally.Tracking other technical indicators, the 14-day RSI is presently standing at 64.62, the 7-day sits at 70.04, and the 3-day is resting at 66.94 for Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VXUS).
Israel removes more security installations at Temple Mount
					Jordan said initially that the guard could leave only after an investigation, while Israel said he enjoyed diplomatic immunity. The installation of the metal detectors set off widespread protests and deadly Israeli-Palestinian violence in the past week.
				Investors may be looking to compare the current stock price of Guggenheim BulletShares 2018 High Yld Corp Bd ETF (BSJI) to some of its moving averages. This is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the Fast Stochastic Oscillator. The RSI value will always move between 0 and 100. Since its inception, RSI has remained very popular with traders and investors. The RSI was created by J. Welles Wilder who was striving to measure whether or not a stock was overbought or oversold.For further review, we can take a look at another popular technical indicator. Using a longer term moving average such as the 200-day may help block out the noise and chaos that is sometimes created by daily price fluctuations. The moving average is a popular investing tool among traders. On the other side, a stock may be considered to be in a downtrend if trading below the moving average and sloping downward. In some cases, MA's may be used as strong reference points for finding support and resistance levels. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. The time horizon for each investor may be different.More notable recent Market Vector Russia ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:RSX) news were published by: Streetinsider.com which released: "Market Vectors Russia ETF Trust (RSX) IV flat into Kushner denies colluding ..." on July 24, 2017, also Investorplace.com with their article: "Market Vector Russia ETF Trust (RSX): The Quick Guide to RSX" published on May 18, 2017, Streetinsider.com published: "Market Vectors Russia ETF Trust (RSX) call put ratio 3.74 calls to 1 put into ..." on July 07, 2017.

(“NYSE Arca”) until market close on September 28, 2016, and they may incur typical transaction fees from their broker-dealer. The Funds’ shares will no longer trade on NYSE Arca after market close on September 28, 2016, and the shares will subsequently be de-listed. Shareholders who continue to hold shares of any of the Funds on the Funds’ liquidation date, which is expected to be on or about October 18, 2016, will receive a liquidating distribution of cash in the cash portion of their brokerage accounts equal to the amount of the net asset value of their shares. Proceeds from the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on or about October 18, 2016, although this may occur prior to or later than this date. For tax purposes, shareholders will generally recognize a capital gain or loss equal to the amount received for their shares over their adjusted basis in such shares. The Funds will stop accepting creation orders from Authorized Participants on September 28, 2016.In addition, shareholders who hold shares of the Funds may receive a final distribution of net income and capital gains earned by the Funds and not previously distributed prior to liquidation.The final tax status of distributions made by the Funds, including the liquidating distribution, will be provided to shareholders with the year-end tax reporting for the Funds (including any portion which may be treated as a return of capital for tax purposes, reducing a shareholder’s basis in such shares).If you have any questions concerning this information or the VanEck Vectors ETFs in general, please call 800.826.2333 between 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.About VanEckVanEck’s mission is to offer intelligently designed investment strategies that take advantage of targeted market opportunities. Founded in 1955, the firm is a pioneer in global investing with a history of placing clients’ interests first in all market environments. Today, VanEck continues this tradition by offering innovative active and passive investment portfolios in hard assets, emerging markets equity and debt, precious metals, fixed income, and other alternative asset classes. VanEck Vectors exchange-traded products are one of the largest ETP families in the world, managing more than 70 funds that span a range of sectors, asset classes, and geographies. As of July 31, 2016, VanEck managed approximately $39.1 billion in assets, including mutual funds, ETFs, and institutional accounts.Please call 800.826.2333 or visit our website for the most recent month-end performance of VanEck Vectors ETFs. This information will be available no later than seven business days after the most recent month end.The “net asset value” (NAV) of an ETF is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the ETF; it is calculated by taking the total assets of an ETF subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as an ETF's intraday trading value. Investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV. Total returns are based upon closing “market price” (price) of the ETF on the dates listed.Fund shares are not individually redeemable and will be issued and redeemed at their NAV only through certain authorized broker-dealers in large, specified blocks of shares called “creation units” and otherwise can be bought and sold only through exchange trading. Creation units are issued and redeemed principally in kind. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market. You will incur brokerage expenses when trading Fund shares in the secondary market.Investors may call 800.826.2333 or visit vaneck.com for a free prospectus and summary prospectus. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Bonds and bond funds will decrease in value as interest rates rise.

History
Founded in 1955 by John C. van Eck, Van Eck Associates Corporation was among the first U.S. investment managers to help investors achieve greater diversification through global investing. Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund was launched in 1968 and was the first U.S. gold fund. Today the firm continues its tradition of responding to the needs of investors by offering innovative investment strategies in emerging markets equity and fixed income, natural resources and commodities, gold and precious metals, liquid alternatives, and other specialized, global asset classes.
VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have been offered by VanEck since 2006 when the firm launched the nation’s first gold-mining ETF, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). Today we offer more than 50 ETFs that span several asset classes, including equity, fixed income, and currency markets. Many of our ETFs are based on pure-play indices whose constituents must derive a majority of revenues from the target region or sector. VanEck is one of the largest ETP providers in the U.S. and worldwide.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
