	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Expressed in US dollars)










	NOTE 1 — NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN




	Zoompas Holdings, Inc. formerly known as UVIC. Inc. ("Zoompass Holdings," or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 21, 2013.  Effective August 22, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement for the Exchange of Stock (the "Agreement") with Zoompass, Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation ("Zoompass").   Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 8,050,784 shares of its restricted common stock to Zoompass' shareholders ("Zoompass' shareholders") in exchange for all the shares of Zoompass Inc. owned by the Zoompass Inc.'s Shareholders.  At the Closing Date, Rob Lee, a significant shareholder of the Company agreed to cancel 7,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, which shares constituted the control shares of the Company.  Other than this one significant shareholder, shareholders of the Company held 2,670,000 shares. As a result of the Agreement, Zoompass is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  The Company has amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Zoompass Holdings, Inc. and the appropriate forms were filed with FINRA and the SEC to change its name, address and symbol and complete a 3.5-1 forward split, which was consented to by the majority of shareholders on September 7, 2016 and approved in February 2017, for shareholders of record on September 7, 2016.





	All share figures have been retroactively stated to reflect the stock split approved by shareholders, unless otherwise indicated.  Additionally, the Company's shareholders consented to an increase of the shares authorized to 500,000,000 and a revision of the par value to $0.0001.





	As the former Zoompass shareholders ended up owning the majority of the Company, the transaction does not constitute a business combination and was deemed to be a recapitalization of the Company with Zoompass being the accounting acquirer, accordingly the accounting and disclosure information is that of Zoompass going forward.





	Zoompass Inc., was incorporated under the laws of Ontario on June 8, 2016.  On June 28, 2016, pursuant to an agreement with a shareholder of Zoompass, certain net assets were acquired by Zoompass in exchange for shares of Zoompass (note 3).  The net assets primarily consisted of a virtual payment platform, certain customer contracts, cash held in trust and customer deposits as well as the associated client funds.  As Zoompass Inc. was incorporated in June 2016, comparative information for the three months ended March 31, 2016 has not been presented.





	There is no certainty that the Company will be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or achieving and maintaining profitable operations in the future to enable it to meet its obligations as they come due and consequently continue as a going concern. The Company will require additional financing this year to fund its operations and it is currently working on securing this funding through corporate collaborations, public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Sales of additional equity securities by the Company would result in the dilution of the interests of existing shareholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available when required.





	The Company expects the forgoing, or a combination thereof, to meet the Company's anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months; however, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

	ZOOMPASS HOLDINGS, INC. (FORMERLY UVIC Inc.)


	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Expressed in US dollars)










	These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, which presumes that it will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business as they come due. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported expenses and consolidated statement of balance sheets classifications that would be necessary if the Company were unable to realize its assets and settle its liabilities as a going concern in the normal course of operations. Such adjustments could be material.


	 





	NOTE 2 — SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS





	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those annual audited financial statements filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown. The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for a full year or for any future period.


	 


	The Company's significant accounting policies have not changed from the year ended December 31, 2016.





	NEWLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS





	Newly Adopted Accounting Standards


	In August 2014, the FASB issued a new financial accounting standard on going concern, ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Sub-Topic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." The standard provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about the organization's ability to continue as a going concern. The amendments in this Update apply to all companies. They become effective in the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. There was no impact on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets or the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss from the adoption of this standard.





	Recently issued accounting pronouncements


	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)". The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. The accounting standard is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The impact on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of adopting ASU 2014-09 will be assessed by management.





	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes," which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent based on an analysis of each taxpaying component within a jurisdiction. ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for the fiscal year commencing after December 15, 2017. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 will have a material effect on the consolidated balance sheet or the consolidated results of operations.

	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Expressed in US dollars)








	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 740): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2016-01 enhances the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-01.





	 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This update requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new guidance will also require additional disclosure about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated results of operations.



	 



	NOTE 3 – ACQUISTION AND REVERSE TAKEOVER TRANSACTION


	 


	Acquisition


	 


	Zoompass Inc.


	Pursuant to an agreement dated June 28, 2016, certain net assets were acquired by Zoompass in exchange for 8,060,913 shares of Zoompass.  The net assets primarily consisted of a virtual payment platform, certain customer contracts, cash held in trust and deposits and the associated customer liabilities.





	Based on an examination of the net assets acquired, the acquisition of the net assets was determined to be a business as defined under

	ASC 805. 






	The value attributed to the shares given in exchange for the net assets was determined to be C$1.50 based on recent financings.  The following table sets forth the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired, based on preliminary estimates of fair value.  The Company's assessment of fair value is substantially complete in respect of cash and cash equivalents, customer deposits and cash in trust, other current assets, accounts payable and customer liabilities.  Final valuations for the remaining items are not yet complete due to the inherent complexity associated with the valuations.  The below is a preliminary purchase price allocation and therefore subject to adjustment on the completion of the valuation process and analysis of resulting tax effects, if any.

	Agreement with Zoompass Inc.


	Effective August 22, 2016, UVIC, Inc. ("UVIC") entered into an Agreement for the Exchange of Stock (the "Agreement") with Zoompass, Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation.   Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 8,060,913 shares of its restricted common stock to Zoompass' shareholders ("Zoompass' shareholders") in exchange for all the shares of Zoompass Inc. owned by the Zoompass' Shareholders.  At the Closing Date, Rob Lee, a significant shareholder, of UVIC agreed to cancel 7,000,000 shares of UVIC's common stock, which shares constituted the control shares of the Company.  Other than this one significant shareholder, shareholders of the Company held 2,670,000 shares. As a result of the Agreement, Zoompass is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.





	 As the former Zoompass shareholders ended up owning the majority of the Company, Zoompass is deemed to be the accounting acquirer.  As UVIC was the accounting acquiree the net assets acquired are reflected in the statement of equity.





	As at the effective date of the reverse takeover UVIC Inc. had $nil in net assets.





	Proforma information has not been presented as there was no operating activity in Zoompass Inc. from the date of incorporation to the date of the acquisition of assets, accordingly the results presented reflect all results of Zoompass during the period as well as that of the consolidated entity.

	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Expressed in US dollars)












	NOTE 6 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT






	The Company has exposure to liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.  The Company's risk management objective is to preserve and redeploy the existing treasury as appropriate, ultimately to protect shareholder value.  Risk management strategies, as discussed below, are designed and implemented to ensure the Company's risks and the related exposure are consistent with the business objectives and risk tolerance.





	Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they come due.  The Company manages its liquidity by ensuring that there is sufficient capital to meet short and long-term business requirements, after taking into account cash requirements from operations and the Company's holdings of cash and cash equivalents. The Company also strives to maintain sufficient financial liquidity at all times in order to participate in investment opportunities as they arise, as well as to withstand sudden adverse changes in economic circumstances.





	Management forecasts cash flows for its current and subsequent fiscal years to predict future financing requirements.  Future requirements may be met through a combination of credit and access to capital markets.  The Company's cash requirements are dependent on the level of operating activity, a large portion of which is discretionary.  Should management decide to increase its operating activity, more funds than what is currently in place would be required.  It is not possible to predict whether financing efforts will be successful or sufficient in the future.   At March 31, 2017, the Company had $93,101 (December 31, 2016, $422,385), in cash and cash equivalents.





	Additionally, the Company has commitments as detailed in note 10.





	Currency risk: The Company's expenditures are incurred in Canadian and US dollars.  The results of the Company's operations are subject to currency transaction risk.  The Company mitigates foreign exchange risk through forecasting its foreign currency denominated expenditures and maintaining an appropriate balance of cash in each currency to meet the expenditures.  As the Company's reporting currency is the US dollar, fluctuations in US dollar will affect the results of the Company. 





	Credit risk:

	 

	Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counterparty's inability to fulfill its payment obligations. As at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company's credit risk is primarily attributable to cash and cash equivalents, cash in trust and customer deposits, and accounts receivable. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, cash held in trust and customer deposits was held with reputable Canadian chartered banks.  At March 31, 2017, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $16,531 (December 31, 2016, - $16,396) as a result of a review of collectability of the amount outstanding and the duration of time it was outstanding.





	Interest rate risk:

	 

	Interest rate risk is the risk borne by an interest-bearing asset or liability as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.  Financial assets and financial liabilities with variable interest rates expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk.  The Company's does not have significant interest rate risk.





	Fair values:  The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, cash held in trust and customer deposits, accounts receivables, accounts payable and client funds approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization.

	Contingencies



	From time to time, the Company may be involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, collections claims, breach of contract claims, labor and employment claims, tax and other matters. Although claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the resolution of current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, balance sheet, results of operations or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.





	The Company's trademark application has been opposed in the US based on the most recent application.  The trademark had been previously acquired through a US registration obtained on the basis of its Canadian registration. 





	The same party has challenged the Company's trademark in Canada, the Company has filed its affidavit evidence in response and is awaiting a final decision.  The Company is confident that the Company's registration will be maintained.










	NOTE 11 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





	Subsequent to March 31, 2017, in April and May of 2017, the Company completed several private placements which have raised approximately C$652,998 in gross proceeds through the issuance of 320,796 non-registered shares in the common stock of the Company.

	ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION





	Forward-looking Statements





	This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. These statements appear in a number of places, including, but not limited to in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." These statements represent our reasonable judgment of the future based on various factors and using numerous assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results and financial position to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts, and use words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "may," "will", "should," "plan," "project" and other words of similar meaning. In particular, these include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the following:







	 



	●




	projected operating or financial results, including anticipated cash flows used in operations;










	 



	●




	expectations regarding capital expenditures; and










	 



	●




	assumptions relating to our liquidity position, including our ability to obtain additional financing, if required.








	Any or all of our forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors including, among others:







	 



	●




	the loss of key management personnel on whom the Company depends;










	 



	●




	our ability to operate our business efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs (including general and administrative expenses) and obtain financing if required.










	 



	●




	our expectations with respect to our acquisition activity.








	In addition, there may be other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from the results referenced in the forward-looking statements, some of which are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Many of these factors will be important in determining our actual future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Our actual future results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. All forward- looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, except as otherwise required by applicable law.


	 


	 


	 










	- 15 -




















	This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated interim financial statements and related notes for the period ended March 31, 2017 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and included in this Form 10-Q and the financial statements and management discussion and analysis for the period ended December 31, 2016.





	The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis management reviews our estimates and assumptions. The estimates were based on historical experience and other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.





	As detailed in this 10-Q, the historic accounts are that of Zoompass Inc., a Company incorporated in June 2016.  As a result there is no comparative information for the three months ended March 31, 2016.





	Nature of Operations





	Zoompas Holdings, Inc. formerly known as UVIC. Inc. ("Zoompass Holdings," or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 21, 2013.  Effective August 22, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement for the Exchange of Stock (the "Agreement") with Zoompass, Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation ("Zoompass").   Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 8,050,784 shares of its restricted common stock to Zoompass' shareholders ("Zoompass' shareholders") in exchange for all the shares of Zoompass Inc. owned by the Zoompass Inc.'s Shareholders.  At the Closing Date, Rob Lee, a significant shareholder of the Company agreed to cancel 7,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, which shares constituted the control shares of the Company.  Other than this one significant shareholder, shareholders of the Company held 2,670,000 shares. As a result of the Agreement, Zoompass is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  The Company has amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Zoompass Holdings, Inc. and the appropriate forms were filed with FINRA and the SEC to change its name, address and symbol and complete a 3.5-1 forward split, which was consented to by the majority of shareholders on September 7, 2016 and approved in February 2017, for shareholders of record on September 7, 2016.





	All share figures have been retroactively stated to reflect the stock split approved by shareholders, unless otherwise indicated.  Additionally, the Company's shareholders consented to an increase of the shares authorized to 500,000,000 and a revision of the par value to $0.0001.





	As the former Zoompass shareholders ended up owning the majority of the Company, the transaction does not constitute a business combination and was deemed to be a recapitalization of the Company with Zoompass being the accounting acquirer, accordingly the accounting and disclosure information is that of Zoompass going forward.





	Zoompass Inc., was incorporated under the laws of Ontario on June 8, 2016.  On June 28, 2016, pursuant to an agreement with a shareholder of Zoompass, certain net assets were acquired by Zoompass in exchange for shares of Zoompass (note 3).  The net assets primarily consisted of a virtual payment platform, certain customer contracts, cash held in trust and customer deposits as well as the associated client funds.


	 


	 



	 







	- 16 -




















	There is no certainty that the Company will be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or achieving and maintaining profitable operations in the future to enable it to meet its obligations as they come due and consequently continue as a going concern. The Company will require additional financing this year to fund its operations and it is currently working on securing this funding through corporate collaborations, public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Sales of additional equity securities by the Company would result in the dilution of the interests of existing shareholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available when required.





	The Company expects the forgoing, or a combination thereof, to meet the Company's anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months; however, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.






	Financial information in this filing have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, which presumes that it will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business as they come due. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported expenses and consolidated statement of balance sheet classifications that would be necessary if the Company were unable to realize its assets and settle its liabilities as a going concern in the normal course of operations. Such adjustments could be material.





	Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates





	The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis management reviews our estimates and assumptions. The estimates were based on historical experience and other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions, but management does not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results of operations.

	The Company incurred salaries and full-time consultant expenses of $395,896 for the period ended March 31, 2017.





	Rent for the period ended March 31, 2017, was $35,203 and is related to the Company's corporate office.





	For the period ended March 31, 2017, the Company incurred share-based payment expense of $91,948.  The share-based payment expense relates to certain options and deferred stock units that were granted in December, 2016 and vests over a period of 36 months from the date of grant.





	The Company recognized depreciation expense of $4,810 and relates to the depreciation of computer equipment and furniture acquired.  As the Company, is currently enhancing the payment platform acquired to support its additional pipeline of revenue streams, costs incurred to enhance the platform are capitalized and are not being depreciated.

	As at March 31, 2017, the Company had a positive net working capital balance of $25,733 compared with $359,600 at December 31, 2016.  The decrease was primarily due to a use of cash for operating and investing activities during the period.





	Operations for the period ended March 31, 2017, were primarily funded through cash balances at December 31, 2016, and the cash received from the issuances of shares of the Company's common stock as a result of the exercise of warrants.










	- 19 -























	Subject to the launch of the additional pipeline of revenue streams, there is no certainty that we will be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or achieving and maintaining profitable operations in the future to enable us to meet our obligations as they come due and consequently continue as a going concern. The Company may require additional funds to further develop our expanded business plan.  The Company may require additional financing this year to fund our operations and is examining possible sources of funding beyond the existing cash generated from operations.  Sales of additional equity securities would result in the dilution of the interests of existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available when required. In the event that the necessary additional financing is not obtained, the Company would reduce its discretionary overhead costs substantially, or otherwise curtail operations.





	The Company expects the forgoing, or a combination thereof, to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months; however, these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.





	Net Cash Used in Operating Activities





	During the period ended March 31, 2017, cash used in operations was $501,582.  This was primarily the result of the net loss incurred offset to some extent by changes in non-cash working capital of $24,054.





	Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities





	During the period ended March 31, 2017, the Company invested $20,000 during the period related to its software platform.







	Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities





	Net cash provided by financing activities was $194,198 through the issuance of shares in the common stock of the Company.

	Financial instruments and risk factors





	The Company has exposure to liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.  The Company's risk management objective is to preserve and redeploy the existing treasury as appropriate, ultimately to protect shareholder value.  Risk management strategies, as discussed below, are designed and implemented to ensure the Company's risks and the related exposure are consistent with the business objectives and risk tolerance.





	Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they come due.  The Company manages its liquidity by ensuring that there is sufficient capital to meet short and long-term business requirements, after taking into account cash requirements from operations and the Company's holdings of cash and cash equivalents. The Company also strives to maintain sufficient financial liquidity at all times in order to participate in investment opportunities as they arise, as well as to withstand sudden adverse changes in economic circumstances.





	Management forecasts cash flows for its current and subsequent fiscal years to predict future financing requirements.  Future requirements may be met through a combination of credit and access to capital markets.  The Company's cash requirements are dependent on the level of operating activity, a large portion of which is discretionary.  Should management decide to increase its operating activity, more funds than what is currently in place would be required.  It is not possible to predict whether financing efforts will be successful or sufficient in the future.   At March 31, 2017, the Company had $93,101 (December 31, 2016, $422,385), in cash and cash equivalents.






	Additionally, the Company has commitments as detailed in note 10 to the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.





	Currency risk: The Company's expenditures are incurred in Canadian and US dollars.  The results of the Company's operations are subject to currency transaction risk.  The Company mitigates foreign exchange risk through forecasting its foreign currency denominated expenditures and maintaining an appropriate balance of cash in each currency to meet the expenditures.  As the Company's reporting currency is the US dollar, fluctuations in US dollar will affect the results of the Company. 





	Credit risk:

	 

	Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counterparty's inability to fulfill its payment obligations. As at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company's credit risk is primarily attributable to cash and cash equivalents, cash in trust and customer deposits, and accounts receivable. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, cash held in trust and customer deposits was held with reputable Canadian chartered banks.  At March 31, 2017, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $16,531 (December 31, 2016, - $16,396) as a result of a review of collectability of the amount outstanding and the duration of time it was outstanding.





	Interest rate risk:

	 

	Interest rate risk is the risk borne by an interest-bearing asset or liability as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.  Financial assets and financial liabilities with variable interest rates expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk.  The Company's does not have significant interest rate risk.





	Fair values:  The carrying amounts reported in the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, cash held in trust and customer deposits, accounts receivables, accounts payable and client funds approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization.

	Related Party Transactions





	During 2016, the Company paid an advance on behalf of certain shareholders in the amount of $250,000.  These shareholders also serve as directors and officers of the Company.  $120,000 was returned by December 31, 2016, and $50,000 was returned during the period ended March 31, 2017.  The $80,000 is reflected in prepaids and other current assets as at March 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - $130,000).

	As at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the amounts owing to officers of the Company are recorded in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.





	Newly Adopted and  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements





	Newly Adopted Accounting Standards


	In August 2014, the FASB issued a new financial accounting standard on going concern, ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Sub-Topic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." The standard provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about the organization's ability to continue as a going concern. The amendments in this Update apply to all companies. They become effective in the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. There was no impact on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated balance sheets or the unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss from the adoption of this standard.





	Recently issued accounting pronouncements


	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)". The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. The accounting standard is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The impact on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of adopting ASU 2014-09 will be assessed by management.

	- 22 -























	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes," which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent based on an analysis of each taxpaying component within a jurisdiction. ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for the fiscal year commencing after December 15, 2017. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 will have a material effect on the consolidated balance sheet or the consolidated results of operations.





	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 740): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2016-01 enhances the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-01.





	 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This update requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new guidance will also require additional disclosure about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated results of operations.

	During the period ended March 31, 2017, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.





	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	The Company maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

	segregation of duties as well as lack of administrative and financial personnel and related resources.

Zoompass Holdings: Buyer Beware - Zoompass Holdings, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ZPAS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Zoompass Holdings: Buyer BewareMay.25.17 | About: Zoompass Holdings, (ZPAS) Fraud Research Institute Short onlyFraud Research Institute on TwitterSummaryShares are inflated due in part to an ongoing stock promotion campaign that may end soon.The company's original corporate name appears in an SEC subpoena related to questionable registration statements.OTCMarkets.com has already designated the stock as "Caveat Emptor" aka Buyer Beware.The company's CEO has failed to disclose his relationship with another promoted penny stock.(Editor's Note: This article was updated on 6/30/2017 to include a statement from Creative Direct Marketing Group.) Zoompass Holdings, Inc. (OTCPK:ZPAS) has been one of the top performing and most actively traded micro-cap stocks of 2017. During the past several months, shares of Zoompass have gone from almost complete dormancy to trading millions of shares while increasing in share price by as much as 150%. However, we believe that the recent move in share price is completely unwarranted and is related to an ongoing stock promotion campaign whereby an advertising budget of nearly $2 million is being spent on a promotional newsletter "touting the Company and encouraging investors to purchase the Company's common stock", as described in a recent press release. The company was recently designed as "Caveat Emptor" on OTCMarkets.com and its former name, UVIC, Inc., appears in a subpoena issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to a number of questionable S-1 registration statements issued by prohibited attorney Adam S. Tracy. 

 For all of the reasons outlined in this report, we believe that shares of Zoompass could fall by at least 56% in the short term. Company Profile Zoompass is a financial services company that provides businesses with solutions to help digitize financial transactions. The company offers prepaid debit cards, member reward systems and an electronic payment platform that enables businesses to provide their customers with a white label mobile wallet.
 According to the company's most recent annual report, from the date of incorporation through December 31, 2016, it has generated gross revenues totaling $284,345 and has incurred net losses totaling almost $14 million. Despite the company boasting an increase in net revenues to just $254,683 in the most recent quarter ending March 31, 2017, and announcing an expectation to receive commissions in an undisclosed amount related to a purchase order with an undisclosed third party, it currently trades with a market cap of over $117,000,000, based on 39,680,731 shares outstanding as of April 21, 2017, and a share price of $2.95. Shares of Zoompass have increased from about $1.50 per share to as high as $3.75 per share during the past three months with trading volume increasing significantly. Although difficult to prove, we believe that the main contributor to the stock's recent performance is not the company's recent results but rather an ongoing stock promotion campaign. Recent Company Announcements Below we have listed all of the company's announcements made during the past several months. In our opinion, although these press releases occasionally sound upbeat, they fail to reference any specific material numbers that could justify the recent increase in market cap to nearly $117 million:   Zoompass Virtual Card Program Enables Latin American (LATAM) Consumers Access To US E-Commerce Markets - 5/24/2017   Zoompass Files First Quarter Results - 5/15/2017   Zoompass Issues Statement About Its Common Stock OTC Market Listing - 5/11/2017   Zoompass Issues Statement About Promotional Activity Concerning Its Common Stock - 5/9/2017   Zoompass Announces Corporate Update - 5/8/2017   Zoompass Selects UVend Group of Companies as Self Serve Kiosk and Digital Partner - 4/27/2017   Zoompass Corporate Update - 4/18/2017   Zoompass Provides Operational and Corporate Update - 3/3/2017   In our opinion, the company's press releases above lack substance. For example, in the company's operational and corporate update, it referenced agreements with SYNNEX Canada Limited, SKY Devices LLC and U-Vend Group, but failed to mention specific terms and conditions.
 Volatility Attributed To Stock Promotion To date, we have discovered advertisements on Google and Yahoo Finance that direct visitors to a website promoting Zoompass here. In true promotional form, the website features a glaring report by Editor Rick Currin that is quick to point out industry statistics and million dollar figures relating to "financial technology" while lacking substance relating to the company's internal business operations. However, the most important dollar amount is buried within the legal disclaimer: 

 The website is actually a tout sheet whereby a third party (Sargon Finance SA) paid almost $2 million "to build investor awareness," or in other words to promote shares of the ZPAS stock to unsuspecting buyers. It is our opinion that the recent run-up in Zoompass is primarily attributed to this nearly $2 million stock promotion campaign. As we have described in past reports, shares of heavily promoted stocks like Zoompass are temporarily inflated during the promotional campaign and almost always crash in the short term. We have found the smoking gun evidence linking Zoompass to another heavily promoted stock, Pura Naturals, Inc. (OTCQB:PNAT), and believe that the two stocks will behave similarly. Specifically, we believe that shares of ZPAS will decline by 50-70% from prevailing market prices similar to the way Pura Naturals traded when its stock promotion campaign topped out. Zoompass & Pura Naturals: Nearly Identical Promotional Campaigns Zoompass and Pura Naturals have been the subject to promotional campaigns that are so similar in nature that we believe it is not unreasonable to anticipate the two stocks behaving similarly, at least in the short term. For Zoompass, this could mean a sharp decline of more than 50% in the short term.
 Below we have outlined three of the most brazen similarities between the two stock promotion campaigns: 1. Creative Direct Marketing Group Creative Direct Marketing Group is an advertising and digital marketing agency located in Southern California that appears to be at least partially responsible for the investor awareness ad campaigns targeting both Zoompass Holdings, Inc. and Pura Naturals, Inc. In addition to the similar website layouts and domain names used for both the Zoompass stock promotion (Zoompassinvestor.com) and Pura Naturals stock promotion (Purainvestor.com), you can find direct evidence connecting Creative Direct Marketing Group to both stock promotion advertisements. (UPDATE 6/30/2017 4:35 p.m.: Representatives of Creative Direct Marketing Group have provided Seeking Alpha with the following statement: "The article previously published was inaccurate in its implication and statements. CDMG has never been paid or hired by ZoomPass Holdings or Pura Naturals. These entities have never been clients of CDMG. CDMG is an advertising and marketing agency that specializes in paid subscription newsletters and subscriber acquisition, helping such diverse newsletters as Standard + Poor, Dow theory forecast and Vectorvest. While investment newsletter publisher clients have recommended and written about ZoomPass Holdings and Pura Naturals, CDMG has no control over what they recommend.") When you sign up to receive Rick Currin's email newsletter from the Zoompass promotional website, you will notice the originating sender of Rick Currin's email alerts is "mkt@theinvestmentstrategy": 

 A search of ICANN's WHOIS database reveals that the owner of the "theinvestmentstrategy.com" domain name is Craig Huey, president of the Creative Direct Marketing Group:
 

 Creative Direct Marketing Group actually won an award for "Best Investor Relations Online Campaign" for its work with Pura Naturals, Inc. and the ad agency is referenced in the legal disclaimer of the PNAT promotional website: 

 Coincidentally, both Zoompass Holdings and Pura Naturals were subject to stock promotion campaigns with budgets just shy of $2 million managed at least in part by Creative Direct Marketing Group. 2. The Denial of Involvement On May 9, 2017, Zoompass issued a press release regarding a promotional newsletter touting the company's stock. Compare Zoompass's press release with the one issued by Pura Naturals on January 19, 2017:  Zoompass Issues Statement About Promotional Activity Concerning Its Common Stock Pura Naturals, Inc. Issues Statement About Promotional Activity Concerning Its Common Stock  The two company-issued press releases above have many sections that are almost identical in context with some areas copied verbatim. The two most likely explanations for these similar press releases is either plagiarism or a related party being responsible for the authoring of both companies' press releases. Based on all of our other findings, we believe the likelihood of the latter is very high. 3. The Chart Patterns Below is a historical stock chart for Pura Naturals, Inc. for the relevant time period when its stock was subjected to a promotion campaign. 


 Compare the chart above with the current stock chart for Zoompass and you will notice that to date the charts are nearly identical. Both stocks were dormant for months and traded at approximately $1.50 per share. Then, all of a sudden, each stock's volume spiked right around the time when promotional newsletter campaigns began surfacing on the Internet. After each stock climbed for about 25 trading days, share prices hit $3.75 and $3.64, respectively. Next, both stocks plummeted by more than 50% before bouncing. Pura Naturals shares bounced all the way back to $3.45 but failed to break out to new all-time highs. In the 20 trading days that followed, the stock fell by as much as 56%. Although in the long term each company's stock will be more reflective of the successes or failures of each operating business, in the short term, it is our opinion that the stock chart for Zoompass Holdings is driven more by the current promotional campaign than by internal business operations and company news releases. Since the promotional campaign itself along with the stock chart closely resembles the promotional campaign and stock chart for Pura Naturals, we believe that the two will continue to act similar in the short term. For Zoompass, this could mean an imminent collapse of 56% in the short term. Zoompass & Pura Naturals: More Connections Between The Two In addition to the resemblances between the stock promotion campaigns subjected to Zoompass and Pura Naturals, there are also internal examples that demonstrate how the companies themselves may be connected. Robert "Rob" Lee Robert "Rob" Lee has maintained the position of chief executive officer and director of Zoompass Holdings, Inc. since August 2016. In addition to previously serving as the president and CEO of a company that eventually went into receivership, Lee has "focused on the financing and restructuring of various private entities": 


 One career endeavor apparently missing from Robert Lee's bio involves an obscure reference to Lee within a share exchange agreement related to Pura Naturals, Inc. found in a Form 8-K filed on July 26, 2016: 

 Although we have been unable to reach a representative of Zoompass to clarify Robert Lee's full involvement with Pura Naturals, Inc., a Reuters company profile page lists Robert Lee as being appointed as a director to Pura Naturals in April 2016: 

 In fact, we believe there is a possibility that Robert Lee may in fact also be the chief executive officer of Pura Natural, Inc. under the name Robert Doherty. Obscure Executive Officer Listed In Zoompass's Annual Report Smoking gun evidence connecting Zoompass to Pura Naturals can be seen on page 24 of ZPAS's most recent Annual Report filed on April 24, 2017. In the list of executive officers section, "Robert Doherty" is listed as director and chief executive officer of Zoompass Holdings: 

 Robert Doherty also happens to be listed as the chief executive officer for Pura Naturals, Inc. in the company's most recent Annual Report: 


 Either there was a highly unusual typo in the Zoompass annual report that mistakenly listed Pura Naturals CEO as its own or Robert Lee and Robert Doherty may be the same individual. According to a Bloomberg biography, the chief executive officer for Zoompass Holdings, Inc. is Robert Doherty Lee. If Robert Doherty Lee is serving dual roles as both the chief executive officer of Zoompass Holdings, Inc. and Pura Naturals, Inc., we believe that investors should remain highly suspicious of the failure to disclose this relevant information in the SEC filings. Conclusion Our trading thesis is based on the belief that the recent surge in share price for Zoompass Holdings, Inc. is more heavily attributed to an ongoing stock promotion campaign rather than the company's recent operating results. As we have explained, although the company has recently announced press releases that could be perceived positively, they lack substance and are very unlikely to be responsible for the recent meteoric rise in the Zoompass stock. If the stock's short-term price fluctuation is driven primarily by the stock promotion and if Zoompass and Pura Naturals are related to the extent that we have outlined in this report, we believe that Zoompass shares will trade comparatively to how Pura Naturals traded when its own stock was subject to a very similar promotion. Specifically, this would mean that Zoompass shares could decline by 56% in as little as 20 trading days.

	ITEM 1. BUSINESS





	Overview of Our Business


	Recent Developments


	 


	UVIC, Inc., was incorporated in Nevada on August 21, 2013.





	On May 8, 2015, UVIC, Inc., filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission Form S-1 to register 7,000,000 shares of our common stock at a per share price of $0.01 on behalf of selling shareholders. The SEC file number of the registration statement is 333-203997. The Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC on August 7, 2015.





	Prior to the transaction described below, UVIC., Inc., had limited operating and development activities.





	Effective August 22, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement for the Exchange of Stock (the "Agreement") with Zoompass, Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation ("Zoompass").   Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 8,060,913 shares of its restricted common stock to Zoompass' shareholders ("Zoompass' shareholders") in exchange for all the shares of Zoompass Inc. owned by the Zoompass Inc.'s Shareholders.  At the Closing Date, Rob Lee, a significant shareholder of the Company agreed to cancel 7,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, which shares constituted the control shares of the Company.  Other than this one significant shareholder, shareholders of the Company held 2,670,000 shares. As a result of the Agreement, Zoompass is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  The Company has amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Zoompass Holdings, Inc. and filed the appropriate forms with FINRA and the SEC to change its name, address and symbol and complete a 3.5-1 forward split, which was consented to by the majority of shareholders on September 7, 2016 and were subsequently approved by the applicable regulatory bodies in February 2017, for shareholders of record on September 7, 2016.











	 




	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS





	Global Economic Conditions


	The unprecedented events in global financial markets in the past several years have had a profound impact on the global economy. Many industries, have been impacted by these market conditions. Market events and conditions, including volatility in the international credit markets and other financial systems and the deterioration of global economic conditions, could impede the Company's access to capital or increase the cost of capital and may adversely affect the Company's operations. The Company is also exposed to liquidity risks in meeting its operating and capital expenditure requirements in instances where the Company's cash position is unable to be maintained or appropriate financing is unavailable. These factors may impact the Company's ability to obtain capital on terms favourable to it or at all. Increased market volatility may impact the Company's operations which could adversely affect the trading price of the Common Shares.





	Operating and Capital Requirements


	The Company competes for financing and personnel with other financial technology companies. There can be no assurance that additional capital or other types of financing will be available, when needed, or that, if available, the terms of such financing will be favourable to the Company. The Company may need to make significant expenditures in connection with the development of its platform or other lines of business.  There is no assurance that any such funds will be available for operations and the ability of the Company to raise such capital will depend, in part, upon conditions in the capital markets at the time and its historical business performance. If additional capital is raised by the issuance of shares from the treasury of the Company, shareholders may suffer dilution. Future borrowings by the Company or its subsidiaries may increase the level of financial and interest rate risk to the Company as the Company will be required to service future indebtedness. Further, failure to obtain additional financing on a timely basis could cause the Company to reduce, suspend, or terminate its proposed operations.





	Dependence on Highly Skilled Personnel


	The Company's prospects depend in part on the services of key executives and other highly skilled and experienced personnel focused on managing the Company's interests, in addition to the identification of new opportunities for growth and funding. The loss of these persons or the Company's inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees required for the Company's activities may have a material adverse effect on its business or future operations. The Company does not currently maintain "key person" life insurance on any of its key employees.


	 


	 




	- 1 -




















	Negative Operating Cash Flow


	The Company has negative operating cash flow and may continue to have negative operating cash flow in future periods. To the extent that the Company has negative operating cash flow, the Company will need to continue to deploy a portion of its cash reserves to fund such negative operating cash flow.





	Limited operating history of the Company's new direction; No assurance of profitability; anticipated losses.


	The Company has a limited operating history and, accordingly, has a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business. Our business must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and problems frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets which involve technology. The in development operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. Accordingly, the likelihood of our success must be considered in the light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with the starting and expansion of a business and the relatively competitive environment in which we will operate. Unanticipated delays, expenses and other problems such as setbacks in launch and development, product sourcing manufacturing, and market acceptance are frequently encountered in establishing a new business such as the Company`s. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in addressing such risks, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.


	 


	Because of the Company`s limited operating history, the Company has limited historical financial data on which to base planned operating expenses. Accordingly, our expense levels, which are, to a large extent, variable, will be based in part on our expectations of future revenues. As a result of the variable nature of many of our expenses, we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected delays in the development and marketing of our products or any subsequent revenue shortfall. Any such delays or shortfalls will have an immediate adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.


	 


	The Company has not achieved profitability to date. To the extent that net revenue does not grow at anticipated rates or that increases in its operating expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by commensurate increases in net revenue, or that the Company is unable to adjust operating expense levels accordingly, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. There can be no assurance that the Company's operating losses will not increase in the future or that the Company will ever achieve or sustain profitability.





	Regulatory Risk


	Although the Company follows certain laws and regulations and receives the requisite approvals to operate in the lines of business it currently or intends to operate in there is no guarantee that these laws, regulations and approvals will not be challenged or impugned. Further changing regulatory regimes may subject the Company to new laws and regulations.  Changes in the regulatory environment the Company operates in can have a material adverse affect on operations.





	Demand for our products and services may not develop as expected our projected revenues and profits will be affected.


	Future profits are influenced by many factors, including economics, and will be predicated on a stable and/or growing market and the purchase and consumption of our products and services.  The Company believes, and our growth expectations assume, that the markets for our suite of products and services will continue to grow, that the Company will increase its  penetration of these markets and that our anticipated revenue from selling into this market will continue to increase. If the Company's expectations as to the size of these markets and its ability to sell our products and services in this market are not correct, our revenue may not materialize and our business will be harmed.





	Operating results may fluctuate and may fall below expectations in any fiscal quarter.


	Our operating results are difficult to predict and are expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results or future predictions prepared by the Company as an indication of our future performance. If our revenue or operating results fall in any period, the value of our common stock would likely decline.


	 


	 







	- 2 -




















	Factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate include:


	 




	 



	●




	our ability to arrange potential financing or generate operating cash flows;





	 



	●




	our ability to acquire products to resell to our customers;





	 



	●




	changes in federal, state and local government;





	 



	●




	availability and costs of labor and equipment;





	 



	●




	the addition of new customers or the loss of existing customers;





	 



	●




	our ability to control costs, including operating expenses;





	 



	●




	changes in the mix of our products and services;





	 



	●




	the length of our sales cycle;





	 



	●




	the productivity and growth of our sales force;





	 



	●




	the timing of opening of new offices or making other significant investments in the growth of our business, as the revenue we hope to generate from those expenses often lags several quarters behind those expenses;





	 



	●




	changes in pricing by us or our competitors;





	 



	●




	costs related to the acquisition and integration of companies or assets;





	 



	●




	general economic trends, including changes in geopolitical events such as war or incidents of terrorism; and





	 



	●




	future accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting policies.








	The Company operates in a highly competitive industry and competitors may compete more effectively.


	Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater resources than us, and could focus their substantial financial resources to develop a competing business model, develop products or services that are more attractive to potential customers than what we offer or convince our potential customers that they should require financing arrangements that would be impractical for smaller companies to offer. Our competitors may also offer products and services at prices below cost and/or devote significant sales forces to competing with us or attempt to recruit our key personnel by increasing compensation, any of which could improve their competitive positions. Any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers; cause us to lower our prices in order to compete, and reduce our market share and revenue, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete against our current competitors or additional companies that may enter our markets.


	  


	International operations could expose business to additional risks 


	The Company expects to generate a portion of sales outside of Canada in the future. Operating internationally is one of our growth strategies, and we expect our revenue and operations outside of North America will expand in the future. These operations will be subject to a variety of risks that we do not face currently:


	 




	 



	·




	establishing and managing highly experienced foreign suppliers, distributors and relationships and overseeing and ensuring the performance of foreign subcontractors;





	 



	·




	increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;





	 



	·




	additional withholding taxes or other taxes on our foreign income, and tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade or investment;





	 



	·




	imposition of, or unexpected adverse changes in, foreign laws or regulatory requirements, many of which differ from those which the Company currently operates in;





	 



	·




	increased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk;





	 



	·




	longer payment cycles for sales in some foreign countries and potential difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;





	 



	·




	difficulties in repatriating overseas earnings;





	 



	·




	general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate; and





	 



	·




	political unrest, war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events.





	 







	- 3 -




















	Our overall success in international markets will depend, in part, on our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. We may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies that will be effective in managing these risks in each country where we do business. Our failure to manage these risks successfully could harm our international operations, reduce our international sales and increase our costs, thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results.





	The Company relies on outside consultants, service providers and suppliers 


	We will rely on the experience of consultants, service providers and suppliers . In the event that one or more of these consultants or terminates its relationship with the Company, or becomes unavailable, suitable replacements will need to be obtained and there is no assurance that such consultants, service providers and suppliers  could be obtained under conditions favorable to us.


	 


	We rely on strategic relationships to promote our products


	The Company relies on strategic partnerships with outside companies and individuals to promote and supply certain of our products and services, thus making the future success of our business particularly contingent on the efforts of other parties. An important part of our strategy is to promote acceptance of our products through with certain service providers who we feel could assist us with our promotion strategies. Our dependence, raises potential risks with respect to the future success of our business. Our success is dependent on the successful completion and commercial deployment of our products and services and on the future commitment of our distributors to our products and technology.


	 


	Reliance on our suppliers


	The Company relies vendors and suppliers to provide power, as well as high quality products and services on a consistent basis.  The future success of the Company is contingent on the efforts and performance of these suppliers. The Company may have difficulty in locating or using alternative resources should supply problems arise with the current suppliers. An interruption or reduction in the source of supply of or an unanticipated increase in vendor prices, could materially affect our operating results and damage customer relationships as well as our business. 





	Future growth could strain resources, and if the Company is unable to manage growth, it may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.

	 



	The Company hopes to experience rapid growth in operations, which will place a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our executive officers to manage growth effectively. This will require that we hire and train additional personnel to manage our expanding operations. In addition, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we may be unable to execute upon our business plan.






	Failure to protect intellectual property, our planned business could be adversely affected. 



	Despite efforts to protect and ensure the Company has proprietary rights, parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products, obtain, claim and use information that we regard as proprietary. Unauthorized use of our proprietary technology could harm our business. Litigation to protect our intellectual property rights can be costly and time-consuming to prosecute, and there can be no assurance that we will have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action.





	Unforeseen Liabilities from Past Acquisitions


	There may be liabilities and claims that the Company has failed to discover or has underestimated in connection with previous acquisitions. In addition, there may be expenditure requirements that the Company has failed to discover or underestimated in connection with these acquisitions, which amounts may be material. Any such liabilities or expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or future prospects.


	 


	Conflicts of Interest




	Certain of the directors and officers of the Corporation also serve as directors and/or officers of other companies there exists the possibility for such directors and officers to be in a position of conflict. Any decision made by any of such directors and officers will be made in accordance with their duties and obligations to deal fairly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. In addition, each director is required to declare and refrain from voting on any matter in which such director may have a conflict of interest.


	 


	 


	 







	- 4 -

















	If we issue additional shares in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing stockholders.


	Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 500,000,000 shares of our common stock, with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Our board of directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares to acquire one or more companies or products and to fund our overhead and general operating requirements. The issuance of any such shares will reduce the book value per share and may contribute to a reduction in the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we issue any such additional shares, such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current stockholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change of control of our company.


	 



	Trading of our stock is restricted by the Securities Exchange Commission's penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our common stock.

	 

	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.





	FINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock. 


	In addition to the "penny stock" rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our stock.


	 


	The price of our common stock may be negatively impacted by factors that are unrelated to our operations.


	Although our common stock is currently listed for quotation on the OTC Markets and a market is established and trading has begun, trading through the OTCQB is frequently thin and highly volatile. There is no assurance that a sufficient market will continue in our stock, in which case it could be difficult for stockholders to sell their stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results of our competitors, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our common stock.

	We do not intend to pay dividends on any investment in the shares of stock of our company. 


	We have never paid any cash dividends, and currently do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. Because we do not intend to declare dividends, any gain on an investment in our company will need to come through an increase in the stock's price. This may never happen and investors may lose all of their investment in our company.

	The following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains certain forward-looking information. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" above for certain information concerning those forward looking statements. Our financial statements are prepared in U.S. dollars and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. References in this Report to a particular "fiscal" year are to our fiscal year ended on December 31.






	Nature of Operations








	UVIC. Inc. ("UVIC" or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 21, 2013.  Effective August 22, 2016, UVIC entered into an Agreement for the Exchange of Stock (the "Agreement") with Zoompass, Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation ("Zoompass").   Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 8,060,913 shares of its restricted common stock to Zoompass' shareholders ("Zoompass' shareholders") in exchange for all the shares of Zoompass Inc. owned by the Zoompass Inc.'s Shareholders.  At the Closing Date, a significant shareholder, Rob Lee, of UVIC agreed to cancel 7,000,000 shares of UVIC's common stock, which shares constituted the control shares of the Company.  Other than this one significant shareholder, shareholders of the Company held 2,670,000 shares. As a result of the Agreement, Zoompass is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  The Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Zoompass Holdings, Inc. and filed the appropriate forms with FINRA and the SEC to change its name, address and symbol and complete a 3.5-1 forward split, which was consented to by the majority of shareholders on September 7, 2016 and were subsequently approved by the applicable regulatory bodies in February 2017, for shareholders of record on September 7, 2016.


	 


	All share figures have been retroactively stated to reflect the stock split approved by shareholders, unless otherwise indicated.






	As the former Zoompass shareholders ended up owning the majority of the Company, the transaction does not constitute a business combination and was deemed to be a recapitalization of the Company with Zoompass being the accounting acquirer, accordingly the accounting and disclosure information is that of Zoompass going forward.  Comparative information has not been presented in this Management's Discussion and Analysis as Zoompass Inc., was incorporated in June 2016.





	Zoompass Inc., was incorporated under the laws of Ontario on June 8, 2016.  On June 28, 2016, pursuant to an agreement with a shareholder of Zoompass, certain net assets were acquired by Zoompass in exchange for shares of Zoompass.  The net assets primarily consisted of a virtual payment platform, certain customer contracts, cash held in trust and customer deposits as well as the associated client funds.





	There is no certainty that the Company will be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or achieving and maintaining profitable operations in the future to enable it to meet its obligations as they come due and consequently continue as a going concern. The Company will require additional financing this year to fund its operations and it is currently working on securing this funding through corporate collaborations, public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Sales of additional equity securities by the Company would result in the dilution of the interests of existing shareholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available when required.


	 


	The Company expects the forgoing, or a combination thereof, to meet the Company's anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months; however, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.





	Financial information in this filing have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, which presumes that it will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business as they come due. Financial information in this filing do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported expenses and balance sheet classifications that would be necessary if the Company were unable to realize its assets and settle its liabilities as a going concern in the normal course of operations. Such adjustments could be material.


	 




	From the inception of Zoompass Inc. to December 31, 2016, the Company, inclusive of the results of UVIC Inc., from August 22, 2016, generated a net loss of $13,984,951.  Included in the loss was an amount of $12,915,010 related to share-based payments, a non-cash item.

	General and administrative and other expenses





	For the period ended December 31, 2016,  the Company incurred share-based payment expense of $12,915,010.  Included in share-based payment expense is an amount related to the grant of restricted shares to certain employees and full-time consultants.  Additionally, share-based payments expense was recognized for the value attributed to the grant of warrants to certain individuals as well as the grant of stock options and deferred stock units.



	 



	The Company incurred salaries and full-time consultant expenses of $691,981 for the period ended December 31, 2016. 





	The Company recognized depreciation expense of $9.655 and relates to the depreciation of computer equipment and furniture acquired.  As the Company, is currently enhancing the payment platform acquired to support its additional pipeline of revenue streams, costs incurred to enhance the platform are capitalized and are not being depreciated.



	 


	Telecommunication expense is comprised of telephone and internet expenses.  Included in telecommunication expense is the costs related to regular and ongoing technological support.  For the period ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred telecommunication expense of $42,558.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources


	 


	As part of the acquisition of certain assets, Zoompass acquired $208,723 in cash on June 28, 2016.  For the period ended December 31, 2016, the Company had cash used in operations of $800,018.  As at December 31, 2016, the Company had a positive net working capital balance of $359,600.


	 


	 







	- 11 -

















	Operations for the period ended December 31, 2016, were primarily funded through the cash acquired as part of the acquisition of assets, the exercise of warrants and private placements which generated proceeds of $1,099,748.  At December 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $422.385.  Subsequent, to December 31, 2016, the Company generated approximately C$190,165 in proceeds through the exercise of warrants.


	 


	Subject to the launch of the additional pipeline of revenue streams, there is no certainty that we will be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or achieving and maintaining profitable operations in the future to enable us to meet our obligations as they come due and consequently continue as a going concern. The Company may require additional funds to further develop our expanded business plan.  The Company may require additional financing this year to fund our operations and is examining possible sources of funding beyond the existing cash generated from operations.  Sales of additional equity securities would result in the dilution of the interests of existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available when required. In the event that the necessary additional financing is not obtained, the Company would reduce its discretionary overhead costs substantially, or otherwise curtail operations.


	 


	The Company expects the forgoing, or a combination thereof, to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months; however, these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on recoverability and reclassification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	  


	Net Cash Used in Operating Activities

	Financial instruments and risk factors





	The Company has exposure to liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.  The Company's risk management objective is to preserve and redeploy the existing treasury as appropriate, ultimately to protect shareholder value.  Risk management strategies, as discussed below, are designed and implemented to ensure the Company's risks and the related exposure are consistent with the business objectives and risk tolerance.



	 


	 


	 







	- 12 -

















	Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they come due.  The Company manages its liquidity by ensuring that there is sufficient capital to meet short and long-term business requirements, after taking into account cash requirements from operations and the Company's holdings of cash and cash equivalents. The Company also strives to maintain sufficient financial liquidity at all times in order to participate in investment opportunities as they arise, as well as to withstand sudden adverse changes in economic circumstances.





	Management forecasts cash flows for its current and subsequent fiscal years to predict future financing requirements.  Future requirements may be met through a combination of credit and access to capital markets.  The Company's cash requirements are dependent on the level of operating activity, a large portion of which is discretionary.  Should management decide to increase its operating activity, more funds than what is currently in place would be required.  It is not possible to predict whether financing efforts will be successful or sufficient in the future.   At December 31, 2016, had $422,385, in cash and cash equivalents.





	The following are the maturities, excluding interest payments, reflecting undiscounted future cash disbursements of the Company's financial liabilities based on the year ending December 31, 2016.

	Additionally, the Company has commitments as described above.


	 


	Currency risk: The Company's expenditures are incurred in Canadian and US dollars.  The results of the Company's operations are subject to currency transaction risk.  The Company mitigates foreign exchange risk through forecasting its foreign currency denominated expenditures and maintaining an appropriate balance of cash in each currency to meet the expenditures.  As the Company's reporting currency is the US dollar, fluctuations in US dollar will affect the results of the Company.  A 10% fluctuation would have an impact of $4,772 on the Company's US dollar denominated balances.






	Credit risk:

	 

	Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counterparty's inability to fulfill its payment obligations. As at December 31, 2016, the Company's credit risk is primarily attributable to cash and cash equivalents, cash in trust and customer deposits, and accounts receivable. At December 31, 2016, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, cash held in trust and customer deposits was held with reputable Canadian chartered banks.  At December 31, 2016, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $16,396.  Approximately 68% of net revenue is derived from 3 corporate customers and the underlying cardholders under each program and approximately 51% of accounts receivable is from the same corporate customers





	Substantially all of the Company's cost of goods sold is derived from 3 service providers and one vendor.  As at December 31, 2016, and together they represented 16% of the accounts payable and accrued liabilities.


	 



	Interest rate risk:

	 

	Interest rate risk is the risk borne by an interest-bearing asset or liability as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.  Financial assets and financial liabilities with variable interest rates expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk.  The Company's does not have significant interest rate risk.

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 


	 


	Other than the rent commitments, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our investors.





	Critical Accounting Policies






	Basis of presentation: 

	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP"). The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present a fair statement of the results for the period.  From the date of incorporation on June 8, 2016, until the asset acquisition on June 28, further described in note 3, there was no operating activity, only the issuance of incorporation shares, the operations from June 28, 2016, to June 30, 2016, were immaterial. Accordingly, as a result of the Agreement, as described in Note 1, the Company has presented the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders' equity and cash flows from the date of incorporation until December 31, 2016.






	Basis of consolidation

	:

	 


	The consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of Zoompass Holdings, the legal parent company, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Zoompass and Paymobile Inc., a company incorporated in Florida, USA, after the elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions.






	Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Company, either directly or indirectly, has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Where the group does not directly hold more than one half of the voting rights, significant judgment is used to determine whether control exists. These significant judgments include assessing whether the group can control the operating policies through the group's ability to appoint the majority of directors to the board. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group until the date on which control ceases.





	The accounts of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent entity, using consistent accounting policies. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between the entities are eliminated.


	 


	  

	Translation of foreign currencies:

	The reporting currency of the Company is the US dollar. The Company has determined that the functional currency of its subsidiaries is the Canadian dollar (references to which are denoted "C$").





	Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of the exchange prevailing on dates of transactions. At each balance sheet reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at each reporting date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the historical date of the transaction.  The impact from the translation of foreign currency denominated items are reflected in the statement of operations.



	 


	Translation of Zoompass' assets and liabilities is done using the exchange rates at each balance sheet date; revenue and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the reporting period or at the date of the transaction; shareholders' equity is translated at historical rates. Adjustments resulting from translating the consolidated financial statements into the US Dollar are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the statement of changes in shareholders' equity.

	Revenue recognition:

	The Company recognizes revenue at the time persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, price is


	fixed and determinable, the delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured.





	In addition, the Company applies the following specific revenue recognition policies:








	a)



	The Company's revenues are primarily generated from financial service fees charged to cardholders and merchants accepting the cards for payment. Revenue for prepaid financial services is generated from multiple sources including transaction fees, cardholder fees, load fees and interchange fees. These fees are recognized on the transaction date.  Funds received from customers are held in trust and the corresponding amount of funds available for use are recorded as a liability.












	b)



	Fees charged for card program, website and card design are recognized when services are performed or when the product is transferred to the customer.












	c)



	Other income represents gains realized on de-recognition of clients' funds payable.










	Financial instruments:

	ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Included in the ASC Topic 820 framework is a three level valuation inputs hierarchy with Level 1 being inputs and transactions that can be effectively fully observed by market participants spanning to Level 3 where estimates are unobservable by market participants outside of the Company and must be estimated using assumptions developed by the Company. The Company discloses the lowest level input significant to each category of asset or liability valued within the scope of ASC Topic 820 and the valuation method as exchange, income or use. The Company uses inputs which are as observable as possible and the methods most applicable to the specific situation of each company or valued item.





	The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, cash in trust and customer deposits, accounts receivables, accounts payable and client funds approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization. Per ASC Topic 820 framework these are considered Level 2 inputs where inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.





	The Company's policy is to recognize transfers into and out of Level 3 as of the date of the event or change in the circumstances that caused the transfer. There were no such transfers during the year.






	Basic and diluted loss per share:

	Basic and diluted loss per share has been determined by dividing the net loss available to shareholders for the applicable period by the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding, respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is calculated as if all dilutive options had been exercised or vested at the later of the beginning of the reporting period or date of grant, using the treasury stock method.





	Loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common shares outstanding during the period. Common share equivalents, options and warrants are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share when their effect is anti-dilutive.






	Segment Reporting:


	ASC 280-10, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company does not have any reportable segments and significantly all assets are located in, and all revenues are currently earned in Canada.



	 


	 










	- 15 -


















	Cash and cash equivalents:


	 

	Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits held with banks and highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of ninety days or less at acquisition date.  For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all cash accounts that are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash in trust and customer deposits are amounts held by the Company at various financial institutions for settlement of clients' funds payable.  Client funds are amounts owing on behalf of clients for prepaid debit cards.






	Inventories

	: Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is recorded at standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on the first-in first-out basis.






	Property and equipment:


	 

	Property and equipment is stated at historic cost. The Company has the following sub-categories of property and equipment with useful lives and depreciation methods as follows:








	●



	Computer equipment and furniture  – 30% declining balance per year









	The cost of assets sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.






	Intangibles:

	  The Company has applied the provisions of ASC topic 350 – Intangibles – goodwill and other, in accounting for its intangible assets. Intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized on a straight-line method on the basis over the useful life of the respective intangibles.






	Impairment of non-financial assets:

	The Company follows the ASC Topic 360, which requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets' carrying amounts may not be recoverable, or in the case of intangible assets having an indefinite useful life, assessed for impairment annually.





	In performing the review for recoverability, if future undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest charges) from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets are less than their carrying values, an impairment loss represented by the difference between its fair value and carrying value, is recognized. When properties are classified as held for sale they are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs to sell.


	 


	 

	Income taxes:

	 

	Deferred taxation is recognised using the asset and liability method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. However, the deferred taxation is not recognised if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred taxation is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred taxation asset is realised or the deferred taxation liability is settled.




	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.





	A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.


	 




	Share-based payment expense:

	The Company follows the fair value method of accounting for stock awards granted to employees, directors, officers and consultants. Share-based awards to employees are measured at the fair value of the related share-based awards. Share-based payments to others are valued based on the related services rendered or goods received or if this cannot be reliably measured, on the fair value of the instruments issued. Issuances of shares are valued using the fair value of the shares at the time of grant; issuances of warrants and other share-based awards are valued using the Black-Scholes model with assumptions based on historical experience and future expectations. The Company recognizes such awards over the vesting period, if any, based on the number of awards expected to vest over that period on a straight-line basis.

	Business combinations

	: 

	A business combination is a transaction or other event in which control over one or more businesses is obtained. A business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits. A business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs that provide a return to the Company and its shareholders. A business need not include all of the inputs and processes that were used by the acquiree to produce outputs if the business can be integrated with the inputs and processes of the Company to continue to produce outputs. The Company considers several factors to determine whether the set of activities and assets is a business.






	Business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method whereby acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition with the excess of the purchase consideration over such fair value being recorded as goodwill and allocated to cash generating units ("CGUs"). If the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase consideration, the difference is recognized immediately as a gain in the consolidated statement of operations. Acquisition related costs are expensed during the period in which they are incurred, except for the cost of debt or equity instruments issued in relation to the acquisition which is included in the carrying amount of the related instrument. Certain fair values may be estimated at the acquisition date pending confirmation or completion of the valuation process. Where provisional values are used in accounting for a business combination, they are adjusted retrospectively in subsequent periods. However, the measurement period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date. If the assets acquired are not a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition.



	 




	Use of estimates:


	 

	The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.





	The areas where management has made significant judgments include, but are not limited to:





	Accounting for acquisitions: 

	The accounting for acquisitions requires judgement to determine if an acquisition meets the definition of a business combination under ASC 805.  Further, management is required to use judgement to determine the fair value of the consideration provided and the net assets and liabilities acquired.



	 



	Impairment long-lived assets: 

	The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows or upon an estimate of fair value that may be received in an exchange transaction. As of December 31, 2016, the Company performed a qualitative analysis of events or circumstances and determined that none existed that would require a quantitative analysis. Estimates and assumptions used to assess recoverability of the Company's long-lived assets are subject to risk uncertainty. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of its long-lived assets. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups.



	 


	Deferred taxes:

	The Company recognizes the deferred tax benefit related to deferred income tax assets to the extent recovery is probable.  Assessing the recoverability of deferred income tax assets requires management to make significant estimates of future taxable profit and the income tax rate at which the future tax assets will be realized.  To the extent that future cash flows, taxable profit and income tax rates differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize deferred tax assets could be impacted.  In addition, future changes in tax laws could limit the ability of the Company to obtain tax deductions in future periods from deferred income tax assets.








	Derivative financial instruments

	: The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks.





	The Company reviews the terms of equity instruments and other financing arrangements, if any, to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments, including embedded conversion options that are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as a derivative financial instrument. Also, in connection with the issuance of financing instruments, the Company may issue freestanding options or warrants to employees and non-employees in connection with consulting or other services. These options or warrants may, depending on their terms, be accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities, rather than as equity.





	Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at their fair value. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. To the extent that the initial fair values of the freestanding and/or bifurcated derivative instrument liabilities exceed the total proceeds received an immediate charge to income is recognized in order to initially record the derivative instrument liabilities at their fair value.





	The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. If reclassification is required, the fair value of the derivative instrument, as of the determination date, is reclassified. Any previous charges or credits to income for changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are not reversed. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date.





	Recent Accounting Pronouncements





	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)". The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. The accounting standard is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting ASU 2014-09 will be assessed by management.


	 


	 










	- 17 -




















	In August 2014, the FASB issued a new financial accounting standard on going concern, ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Sub-Topic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." The standard provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about the organization's ability to continue as a going concern. The amendments in this Update apply to all companies. They become effective in the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. There was no impact on the consolidated balance sheets or the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss from this standard.





	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments," which illustrates certain guidance governing adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Such adjustments are required when new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement amounts initially recognized or would have resulted in the recognition of additional assets and liabilities. ASU No. 2015-16 eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for such adjustments. ASU No. 2015-16 is effective for the fiscal year commencing after December 15, 2016. The Company has adopted this ASU No. 2015-16 as at and for the period ended December 31, 2016. There was no impact on the consolidated balance sheets or the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss from this standard.





	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes," which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent based on an analysis of each taxpaying component within a jurisdiction. ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for the fiscal year commencing after December 15, 2017. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 will have a material effect on the consolidated balance sheet or the consolidated results of operations.





	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 740): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2016-01 enhances the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-01.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This update requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new guidance will also require additional disclosure about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated results of operations.






	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting". Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transaction are simplified, including (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated results of operations.







	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments". This ASU provides eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the fiscal year commencing after November 1, 2018. The Company is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on the consolidated statement of cash flows.





	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, "Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash".  The amendments address diversity in practice that exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-18 is effective for the fiscal year commencing after December 15, 2017. The Company is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-18 will have on the consolidated statement of cash flows.

	ITEM 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk





	The follow discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.





	Financial instruments and risk factors





	The Company has exposure to liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.  The Company's risk management objective is to preserve and redeploy the existing treasury as appropriate, ultimately to protect shareholder value.  Risk management strategies, as discussed below, are designed and implemented to ensure the Company's risks and the related exposure are consistent with the business objectives and risk tolerance.





	Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they come due.  The Company manages its liquidity by ensuring that there is sufficient capital to meet short and long-term business requirements, after taking into account cash requirements from operations and the Company's holdings of cash and cash equivalents. The Company also strives to maintain sufficient financial liquidity at all times in order to participate in investment opportunities as they arise, as well as to withstand sudden adverse changes in economic circumstances.





	Management forecasts cash flows for its current and subsequent fiscal years to predict future financing requirements.  Future requirements may be met through a combination of credit and access to capital markets.  The Company's cash requirements are dependent on the level of operating activity, a large portion of which is discretionary.  Should management decide to increase its operating activity, more funds than what is currently in place would be required.  It is not possible to predict whether financing efforts will be successful or sufficient in the future.   At December 31, 2016, had $422,385, in cash and cash equivalents.





	The following are the maturities, excluding interest payments, reflecting undiscounted future cash disbursements of the Company's financial liabilities based on the year ending December 31, 2016.





	 






	 



	 



	2017



	 


	 



	2018 and later

	474,508



	 


	 



	$




	-



	 





	 




	Additionally, the Company has commitments as described above.






	Currency risk: The Company's expenditures are incurred in Canadian and US dollars.  The results of the Company's operations are subject to currency transaction risk.  The Company mitigates foreign exchange risk through forecasting its foreign currency denominated expenditures and maintaining an appropriate balance of cash in each currency to meet the expenditures.  As the Company's reporting currency is the US dollar, fluctuations in US dollar will affect the results of the Company.  A 10% fluctuation would have an impact of $4,776 on the Company's US dollar denominated balances.



	 


	Credit risk:

	 

	Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counterparty's inability to fulfill its payment obligations. As at December 31, 2016, the Company's credit risk is primarily attributable to cash and cash equivalents, cash in trust and customer deposits, and accounts receivable. At December 31, 2016, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, cash held in trust and customer deposits was held with reputable Canadian chartered banks.  At December 31, 2016, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $16,396 as a result of a review of collectability of the amount outstanding and the duration of time it was outstanding.  Approximately 68% of net revenue is derived from 3 corporate customers and the underlying cardholders under each program and approximately 51% of accounts receivable is from the same corporate customers





	Substantially all of the Company's cost of goods sold is derived from 3 service providers and one vendor.  As at December 31, 2016, and together they represented 16% of the accounts payable and accrued liabilities.


	 


	Interest rate risk:

	 

	Interest rate risk is the risk borne by an interest-bearing asset or liability as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.  Financial assets and financial liabilities with variable interest rates expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk.  The Company's does not have significant interest rate risk.

	The financial statements required by this item begin on page F-1 hereof. 

















	ITEM 9 Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants and Accounting and Financial Disclosure





	On November 10, 2016, our board of directors dismissed AJSH & Co LLP ("AJSH"), as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company.





	AJSH's report on the financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle, other than an explanatory paragraph as to a going concern.





	During the fiscal the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and in the subsequent interim period through November 10, 2016, the date of termination of AJSH, (a) there were no disagreements with Anton on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of AJSH, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in its reports on the financial statements for such year and (b) there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.





	On November 10, 2016, our board of directors approved the engagement of MNP, LLP ("MNP"), as the Company's new independent registered public accounting firm.






	During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, and the subsequent interim period prior to the engagement of MNP, the Company has not consulted MNP regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to any specified transaction, either completed or proposed; (ii) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and either a written report was provided to the registrant or oral advice was provided that the new accountant concluded was an important factor considered by the registrant in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (iii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(o)(1)(iv)) or a reportable event (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v)).


















	ITEM 9A Controls and Procedures





	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports it files or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports it files or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, as well as internal control over financial reporting, may not prevent or detect all inaccurate statements or omissions.


	 


	Our management, with the supervision and participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016, were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.


	 


	 


	 




	- 20 -




















	Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls





	Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:


	 


	(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;


	 


	(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the our management and directors; and


	 


	(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


	 


	Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	 


	Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting


	 



	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework). Based on the Company's assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.


	 


	We have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as discussed above. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

	Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of December 31, 2016, and that there was a material weakness due to the following: lack of segregation of duties,  due to limited administrative and financial personnel and related resources and as only one of our directors is independent.




	 


	Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting


	 


	During the year ended December 31, 2016, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to have a materially affect, on our internal control over financial reporting.

	- 22 -








	 


	 


	 


	Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings


	 


	To the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years:


	 





	1.




	had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time;





	  





	2.




	been convicted in a criminal proceeding or is a named subject to a pending criminal (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);





	  





	3.




	been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities or banking activities; or





	  





	4.




	been found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity  Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated.





	 


	Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act


	 



	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our executive officers, directors and beneficial owner of more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission statements of ownership and changes in ownership. The same persons are required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. We believe that, during fiscal 2016, all of our executive officers, directors and beneficial owner of more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities complied with the applicable filing requirements.





	In making these statements, we have relied upon examination of the copies of all Section 16(a) forms provided to us and the written representations of our executive officers, directors and beneficial owner of more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities.






	Code of Business Conduct and Ethics

We are not currently subject to any law, rule or regulation requiring that we adopt a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. However, the Company is in the process of preparing a code of business conduct and ethics policy during 2017.


	 


	Committees of Board of Directors


	 


	There are currently no committees of the Board of Directors. Our board of directors is of the view that it is appropriate for us not to have a standing nominating, audit or compensation committee because the current size of our board of directors does not facilitate the establishment of a separate committee. Our board of directors has performed, and will perform adequately, the functions of any specific committee.


	 


	Board Oversight of Risk


	 


	Our Board of Directors recognizes that, although risk management is a primary responsibility of the Company's management, the Board plays a critical role in oversight of risk. The Board, in order to more specifically carry out this responsibility, has assigned certain task focusing on reviewing different areas including strategic, operational, financial and reporting, compensation, compliance, corporate governance and other risks to the relevant Board Committees as summarized above. Each Committee then reports to the full Board ensuring the Board's full involvement in carrying out its responsibility for risk management.

	ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION


	 




	Persons Covered


	 


	As of December 31, 2016, there were four Named Executive Officers are set forth below: 








	 

	Name





	Position






	Robert Doherty




	Chief Executive Officer, and Director






	Steve Roberts




	President and Director






	Edward (Ted) Yew




	Secretary and Director






	Brian Morales




	Chief Financial Officer





	 


	Compensation Discussion and Analysis


	 


	Overview


	 


	The Company's executive compensation program is generally designed to align the interests of executives with the interests of shareholders and to reward executives for achieving the Company's objectives. The executive compensation program is also designed to attract and retain the services of qualified executives. 


	 


	The Board of Directors shall determine all compensation packages.


	 


	Executive compensation generally consists of base salary or fees, bonuses and long-term incentive equity compensation such as stock grants or additional options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock as well as various health and welfare benefits. The Board has determined that both the base salary or fees and long-term incentive equity compensation should be the principal component of executive compensation. The Board has not adopted a formal bonus plan, and all bonuses are discretionary.


	 


	Elements of Compensation


	 


	The executive compensation for the Named Executive Officers) for the period ended December 31, 2016, primarily consisted of base salary or fees, long term incentive equity compensation, , and other compensation and benefit programs generally available to other employees,


	 




	Base Salary


	. The Board establishes base salaries or fees for the Company's Named Executive Officers based on the scope of their responsibilities, taking into account competitive market compensation paid by other companies in the Company's peer group for similar positions. Generally, the Board believes that executive base salaries or fees should be in-line with similar responsibilities at comparable companies in line with our compensation philosophy.


	 


	Base salaries are reviewed annually, and may be adjusted to realign salaries with market levels after taking into account individual responsibilities, performance and experience.


	 


	 


	 







	- 24 -

















	 




	Bonuses


	. Bonuses are intended to compensate the Named Executive Officers for achieving the Company's financial performance and other objectives established by the Board each year. The Board currently does not adopt a formal bonus plan and all bonuses are discretionary.


	 




	Long-Term Incentive Equity Compensation


	. The Board believes that stock-based awards promote the long-term growth and profitability of the Company by providing executive officers with incentives to improve shareholder value and contribute to the success of the Company and by enabling the Company to attract, retain and reward the best available persons for executive officer positions. The Named Executive Officers were eligible to receive certain number of shares of common stock of the Company. The Company cannot currently determine the number or type of additional awards that may be granted to eligible participants under the long-term incentive equity compensation plan in the future. Such determination will be made from time to time by the Board.


	 




	Change-In-Control and Termination Arrangements


	. The Company is in the process of formalizing Change-In-Control and Termination Arrangements that would be consistent with all officers of the Company.







	Summary Compensation Table

	As required by SEC rules, amounts in the column "Stock Awards" present the aggregate grant date fair value of awards made each year computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification™ 718 Compensation—Stock Compensation ("FASB ASC 718"). The grant date fair value of each of the executives' award is measured based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant.


	These amounts do not reflect whether the recipient has actually realized or will realize a financial benefit from the awards. Under generally accepted accounting principles, compensation expense with respect to stock awards granted to our employees, executives and directors is generally recognized over the requisite services period. The SEC's disclosure rules previously required that we present stock award information based on the amount recognized during the corresponding year for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to these awards. However, the recent changes in the SEC's disclosure rules require that we now present stock award amounts using the grant date fair value of the awards granted during the corresponding year

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


	  


	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of


	Zoompass Holdings, Inc.


	 


	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Zoompass Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the period from the date of incorporation to December 31, 2016. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.


	 


	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. Zoompass Holdings, Inc. is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Zoompass Holdings, Inc., as of December 31, 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from the date of incorporation to December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred losses from operations and is dependent upon future sources of equity or debt financing in order to fund its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	ZOOMPASS HOLDINGS, INC. (FORMERLY UVIC Inc.)



	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Expressed in US dollars)








	NOTE 1 — NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN






	Zoompas Holdings, Inc. formerly known as UVIC. Inc. ("Zoompass Holdings," or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 21, 2013.  Effective August 22, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement for the Exchange of Stock (the "Agreement") with Zoompass, Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation ("Zoompass").   Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 8,060,913 shares of its restricted common stock to Zoompass' shareholders ("Zoompass' shareholders") in exchange for all the shares of Zoompass Inc. owned by the Zoompass Inc.'s Shareholders.  At the Closing Date, Rob Lee, a significant shareholder of the Company agreed to cancel 7,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, which shares constituted the control shares of the Company.  Other than this one significant shareholder, shareholders of the Company held 2,670,000 shares. As a result of the Agreement, Zoompass is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  The Company has amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Zoompass Holdings, Inc. and the appropriate forms were filed with FINRA and the SEC to change its name, address and symbol and complete a 3.5-1 forward split, which was consented to by the majority of shareholders on September 7, 2016 and approved in February 2017, for shareholders of record on September 7, 2016


	 



	All share figures have been retroactively stated to reflect the stock split approved by shareholders, unless otherwise indicated.  Additionally, the Company's shareholders consented to an increase of the shares authorized to 500,000,000 and a revision of the par value to $0.0001.





	As the former Zoompass shareholders ended up owning the majority of the Company, the transaction does not constitute a business combination and was deemed to be a recapitalization of the Company with Zoompass being the accounting acquirer, accordingly the accounting and disclosure information is that of Zoompass going forward.





	Zoompass Inc., was incorporated under the laws of Ontario on June 8, 2016.  On June 28, 2016, pursuant to an agreement with a shareholder of Zoompass, certain net assets were acquired by Zoompass in exchange for shares of Zoompass (note 3).  The net assets primarily consisted of a virtual payment platform, certain customer contracts, cash held in trust and customer deposits as well as the associated client funds.





	There is no certainty that the Company will be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or achieving and maintaining profitable operations in the future to enable it to meet its obligations as they come due and consequently continue as a going concern. The Company will require additional financing this year to fund its operations and it is currently working on securing this funding through corporate collaborations, public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Sales of additional equity securities by the Company would result in the dilution of the interests of existing shareholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available when required.





	The Company expects the forgoing, or a combination thereof, to meet the Company's anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months; however, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.





	 These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue as a going concern, which presumes that it will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business as they come due. These consolidated financial statements do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported expenses and consolidated statement of balance sheet classifications that would be necessary if the Company were unable to realize its assets and settle its liabilities as a going concern in the normal course of operations. Such adjustments could be material.








	NOTE 2 — SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS





	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	Basis of presentation: 


	The consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP"). The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present a fair statement of the results for the period.  From the date of incorporation on June 8, 2016, until the asset acquisition on June 28, further described in note 3, there was no operating activity, only the issuance of incorporation shares, the operations from June 28, 2016, to June 30, 2016, were immaterial. Accordingly, as a result of the Agreement, as described in Note 1, the Company has presented the consolidated statement of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders' equity and cash flows from the date of incorporation until December 31, 2016.

	ZOOMPASS HOLDINGS, INC. (FORMERLY UVIC Inc.)

	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Expressed in US dollars)









	Basis of consolidation

	:

	 


	The consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of Zoompass Holdings, Inc., the legal parent company, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Zoompass and Paymobile Inc., a company incorporated in Florida, USA, after the elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions.






	Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Company, either directly or indirectly, has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Where the group does not directly hold more than one half of the voting rights, significant judgment is used to determine whether control exists. These significant judgments include assessing whether the group can control the operating policies through the group's ability to appoint the majority of directors to the board. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group until the date on which control ceases.





	The accounts of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent entity, using consistent accounting policies. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between the entities are eliminated.






	Translation of foreign currencies:

	The reporting currency of the Company is the US dollar. The Company has determined that the functional currency of its subsidiaries is the Canadian dollar.  (references to which are denoted "C$").





	Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of the exchange prevailing on dates of transactions. At each balance sheet reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at each reporting date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the historical date of the transaction.  The impact from the translation of foreign currency denominated items are reflected in the statement of operations.





	Translation of Zoompass' assets and liabilities is done using the exchange rates at each balance sheet date; revenue and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the reporting period or at the date of the transaction; shareholders' equity is translated at historical rates. Adjustments resulting from translating the consolidated financial statements into the US Dollar are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the statement of changes in shareholders' equity.






	Revenue recognition:

	The Company recognizes revenue at the time persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, price is fixed and determinable, the delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured.





	In addition, the Company applies the following specific revenue recognition policies:









	a)




	The Company's revenues are primarily generated from financial service fees charged to cardholders and merchants accepting the cards for payment. Revenue for prepaid financial services is generated from multiple sources including transaction fees, cardholder fees, load fees and interchange fees. These fees are recognized on the transaction date.  Funds received from customers are held in trust and the corresponding amount of funds available for use are recorded as a liability.





	 


	 





	b)




	Fees charged for card program, website and card design are recognized when services are performed or when the product is transferred to the customer.





	 


	 





	c)




	Other income represents gains realized on de-recognition of clients' funds payable.











	Financial instruments:

	ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Included in the ASC Topic 820 framework is a three level valuation inputs hierarchy with Level 1 being inputs and transactions that can be effectively fully observed by market participants spanning to Level 3 where estimates are unobservable by market participants outside of the Company and must be estimated using assumptions developed by the Company. The Company discloses the lowest level input significant to each category of asset or liability valued within the scope of ASC Topic 820 and the valuation method as exchange, income or use. The Company uses inputs which are as observable as possible and the methods most applicable to the specific situation of each company or valued item.

	ZOOMPASS HOLDINGS, INC. (FORMERLY UVIC Inc.)

	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Expressed in US dollars)








	The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, cash in trust and customer deposits, accounts receivables, net of any allowances for doubtful accounts, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and client funds approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reflected in "Office and Sundry" expenses on the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.  Per ASC Topic 820 framework these are considered Level 2 inputs where inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.





	The Company's policy is to recognize transfers into and out of Level 3 as of the date of the event or change in the circumstances that caused the transfer. There were no such transfers during the year.






	Basic and diluted loss per share:

	Basic and diluted loss per share has been determined by dividing the net loss available to shareholders for the applicable period by the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding, respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is calculated as if all dilutive options had been exercised or vested at the later of the beginning of the reporting period or date of grant, using the treasury stock method.





	Loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common shares outstanding during the period. Common share equivalents, options and warrants are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share when their effect is anti-dilutive.


	 



	Segment Reporting:

	ASC 280-10, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information", establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company does not have any reportable segments and significantly all of the assets are located in, and all revenues are currently earned in Canada.






	Cash and cash equivalents:


	 

	Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits held with banks and highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of ninety days or less at acquisition date.  For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all cash accounts that are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash in trust and customer deposits are amounts held by the Company at various financial institutions for settlement of clients' funds payable.  Client funds are amounts owing on behalf of clients for prepaid debit cards.






	Inventories

	: Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is recorded at standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on the first-in first-out basis.






	Property and equipment:


	 

	Property and equipment is stated at historic cost. The Company has the following sub-categories of property and equipment with useful lives and depreciation methods as follows:








	●



	Computer equipment and furniture  – 30% declining balance per year









	The cost of assets sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.






	Intangibles:

	  The Company has applied the provisions of ASC topic 350 – Intangibles – goodwill and other, in accounting for its intangible assets. Intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized on a straight-line method on the basis over the useful life of the respective intangibles.






	Impairment of non-financial assets:

	The Company follows the ASC Topic 360, which requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets' carrying amounts may not be recoverable, or in the case of intangible assets having an indefinite useful life, assessed for impairment annually.





	In performing the review for recoverability, if future undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest charges) from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets are less than their carrying values, an impairment loss represented by the difference between its fair value and carrying value, is recognized. When properties are classified as held for sale they are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs to sell.

	ZOOMPASS HOLDINGS, INC. (FORMERLY UVIC Inc.)

	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Expressed in US dollars)





	 



	 

	Income taxes:

	  Deferred taxation is recognised using the asset and liability method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. However, the deferred taxation is not recognised if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred taxation is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred taxation asset is realised or the deferred taxation liability is settled.


	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.





	A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.






	Share-based payment expense:


	The Company follows the fair value method of accounting for stock awards granted to employees, directors, officers and consultants. Share-based awards to employees are measured at the fair value of the related share-based awards. Share-based payments to others are valued based on the related services rendered or goods received or if this cannot be reliably measured, on the fair value of the instruments issued. Issuances of shares are valued using the fair value of the shares at the time of grant; issuances of warrants and other share-based awards are valued using the Black-Scholes model with assumptions based on historical experience and future expectations. All issuances of share-based payments have been fully-vested, otherwise the Company recognizes such awards over the vesting period based on expectations of the number of awards expected to vest over that period on a straight-line basis.




	Business combinations


	A business combination is a transaction or other event in which control over one or more businesses is obtained. A business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs or other economic benefits. A business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to create outputs that provide a return to the Company and its shareholders. A business need not include all of the inputs and processes that were used by the acquiree to produce outputs if the business can be integrated with the inputs and processes of the Company to continue to produce outputs. The Company considers several factors to determine whether the set of activities and assets is a business.





	Business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method whereby acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition with the excess of the purchase consideration over such fair value being recorded as goodwill and allocated to cash generating units ("CGUs"). If the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the purchase consideration, the difference is recognized immediately as a gain in the consolidated statement of operations. Acquisition related costs are expensed during the period in which they are incurred, except for the cost of debt or equity instruments issued in relation to the acquisition which is included in the carrying amount of the related instrument. Certain fair values may be estimated at the acquisition date pending confirmation or completion of the valuation process. Where provisional values are used in accounting for a business combination, they are adjusted retrospectively in subsequent periods. However, the measurement period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date. If the assets acquired are not a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition.


	 





	Use of estimates:


	 

	The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.





	The areas where management has made significant judgments include, but are not limited to:





	Accounting for acquisitions


	The accounting for acquisitions requires judgement to determine if an acquisition meets the definition of a business combination under ASC 805.  Further, management is required to use judgement to determine the fair value of the consideration provided and the net assets and liabilities acquired.



	 


	Impairment long-lived assets:


	The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets. An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows or upon an estimate of fair value that may be received in an exchange transaction. As of December 31, 2016, the Company performed a qualitative analysis of events or circumstances and determined that none existed that would require a quantitative analysis. Estimates and assumptions used to assess recoverability of the Company's long-lived assets are subject to risk uncertainty. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of its long-lived assets. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups.



	 


	Deferred taxes




	The Company recognizes the deferred tax benefit related to deferred income tax assets to the extent recovery is probable.  Assessing the recoverability of deferred income tax assets requires management to make significant estimates of future taxable profit and the income tax rate at which the future tax assets will be realized.  To the extent that future cash flows, taxable profit and income tax rates differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize deferred tax assets could be impacted.  In addition, future changes in tax laws could limit the ability of the Company to obtain tax deductions in future periods from deferred income tax assets.






	Derivative financial instruments

	:


	The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks.





	The Company reviews the terms of equity instruments and other financing arrangements, if any, to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments, including embedded conversion options that are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as a derivative financial instrument. Also, in connection with the issuance of financing instruments, the Company may issue freestanding options or warrants to employees and non-employees in connection with consulting or other services. These options or warrants may, depending on their terms, be accounted for as derivative instrument liabilities, rather than as equity.

	ZOOMPASS HOLDINGS, INC. (FORMERLY UVIC Inc.)

	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Expressed in US dollars)








	Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at their fair value. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income. To the extent that the initial fair values of the freestanding and/or bifurcated derivative instrument liabilities exceed the total proceeds received an immediate charge to income is recognized in order to initially record the derivative instrument liabilities at their fair value.





	The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. If reclassification is required, the fair value of the derivative instrument, as of the determination date, is reclassified. Any previous charges or credits to income for changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are not reversed. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within twelve months of the balance sheet date.





	NEWLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS





	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)". The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. The accounting standard is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting ASU 2014-09 will be assessed by management.





	In August 2014, the FASB issued a new financial accounting standard on going concern, ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Sub-Topic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." The standard provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about the organization's ability to continue as a going concern. The amendments in this Update apply to all companies. They become effective in the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. There was no impact on the consolidated balance sheets or the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss from this standard.





	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments," which illustrates certain guidance governing adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Such adjustments are required when new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement amounts initially recognized or would have resulted in the recognition of additional assets and liabilities. ASU No. 2015-16 eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for such adjustments. ASU No. 2015-16 is effective for the fiscal year commencing after December 15, 2016. The Company has adopted this ASU No. 2015-16 as at and for the period ended December 31, 2016. There was no impact on the consolidated balance sheets or the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss from this standard.






	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes," which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as noncurrent based on an analysis of each taxpaying component within a jurisdiction. ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for the fiscal year commencing after December 15, 2017. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 will have a material effect on the consolidated balance sheet or the consolidated results of operations.





	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 740): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2016-01 enhances the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2016-01.





	 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This update requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The new guidance will also require additional disclosure about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated results of operations.

	(Expressed in US dollars)








	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting". Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transaction are simplified, including (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated results of operations.





	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments". This ASU provides eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the fiscal year commencing after November 1, 2018. The Company is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on the consolidated statement of cash flows.





	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, "Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash".  The amendments address diversity in practice that exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-18 is effective for the fiscal year commencing after December 15, 2017. The Company is still assessing the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-18 will have on the consolidated statement of cash flows.








	NOTE 3 – ACQUISTION AND REVERSE TAKEOVER TRANSACTION


	 


	Acquisition





	Zoompass Inc.


	Pursuant to an agreement dated June 28, 2016, certain net assets were acquired by Zoompass in exchange for 8,060,913 shares of Zoompass.  The net assets primarily consisted of a virtual payment platform, certain customer contracts, cash held in trust and deposits and the associated customer liabilities.





	Based on an examination of the net assets acquired, the acquisition of the net assets was determined to be a business as defined under

	ASC 805. 






	The value attributed to the shares given in exchange for the net assets was determined to be C$1.50 based on recent financings.  The following table sets forth the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired, based on preliminary estimates of fair value.  The Company's assessment of fair value is substantially complete in respect of cash and cash equivalents, customer deposits and cash in trust, other current assets, accounts payable and customer liabilities.  Final valuations for the remaining items are not yet complete due to the inherent complexity associated with the valuations.  The below is a preliminary purchase price allocation and therefore subject to adjustment on the completion of the valuation process and analysis of resulting tax effects, if any.

	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Expressed in US dollars)








	Agreement with Zoompass Inc.


	Effective August 22, 2016, UVIC, Inc. ("UVIC") entered into an Agreement for the Exchange of Stock (the "Agreement") with Zoompass, Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation.   Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 8,060,913 shares of its restricted common stock to Zoompass' shareholders ("Zoompass' shareholders") in exchange for all the shares of Zoompass Inc. owned by the Zoompass' Shareholders.  At the Closing Date, Rob Lee, a significant shareholder, of UVIC agreed to cancel 7,000,000 shares of UVIC's common stock, which shares constituted the control shares of the Company.  Other than this one significant shareholder, shareholders of the Company held 2,670,000 shares. As a result of the Agreement, Zoompass is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.






	 As the former Zoompass shareholders ended up owning the majority of the Company, Zoompass is deemed to be the accounting acquirer.  As UVIC was the accounting acquiree the net assets acquired are reflected in the statement of equity.





	As at the effective date of the reverse takeover UVIC Inc. had $nil in net assets.





	Proforma information has not been presented as there was no operating activity in Zoompass Inc. from the date of incorporation to the date of the acquisition of assets, accordingly the results presented reflect all results of Zoompass during the period as well as that of the consolidated entity.

	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(Expressed in US dollars)








	NOTE 6 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT





	The Company has exposure to liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.  The Company's risk management objective is to preserve and redeploy the existing treasury as appropriate, ultimately to protect shareholder value.  Risk management strategies, as discussed below, are designed and implemented to ensure the Company's risks and the related exposure are consistent with the business objectives and risk tolerance.





	Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they come due.  The Company manages its liquidity by ensuring that there is sufficient capital to meet short and long-term business requirements, after taking into account cash requirements from operations and the Company's holdings of cash and cash equivalents. The Company also strives to maintain sufficient financial liquidity at all times in order to participate in investment opportunities as they arise, as well as to withstand sudden adverse changes in economic circumstances.





	Management forecasts cash flows for its current and subsequent fiscal years to predict future financing requirements.  Future requirements may be met through a combination of credit and access to capital markets.  The Company's cash requirements are dependent on the level of operating activity, a large portion of which is discretionary.  Should management decide to increase its operating activity, more funds than what is currently in place would be required.  It is not possible to predict whether financing efforts will be successful or sufficient in the future.   At December 31, 2016, had $422,385, in cash and cash equivalents.






	The following are the maturities, excluding interest payments, reflecting undiscounted future cash disbursements of the Company's financial liabilities based on the period ending December 31, 2016.

	Additionally, the Company has commitments as detailed in note 11.



	Currency risk: The Company's expenditures are incurred in Canadian and US dollars.  The results of the Company's operations are subject to currency transaction risk.  The Company mitigates foreign exchange risk through forecasting its foreign currency denominated expenditures and maintaining an appropriate balance of cash in each currency to meet the expenditures.  As the Company's reporting currency is the US dollar, fluctuations in US dollar will affect the results of the Company.  A 10% fluctuation would have an impact of $4,772 on the Company's US dollar denominated balances.






	Credit risk:

	 

	Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counterparty's inability to fulfill its payment obligations. As at December 31, 2016, the Company's credit risk is primarily attributable to cash and cash equivalents, cash in trust and customer deposits, and accounts receivable. At December 31, 2016, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, cash held in trust and customer deposits was held with reputable Canadian chartered banks.  At December 31, 2016, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $16,396 as a result of a review of collectability of the amount outstanding and the duration of time it was outstanding.  Approximately 68% of net revenue is derived from 3 corporate customers and the underlying cardholders under each program and approximately 51% of accounts receivable is from the same corporate customers.


	 


	Substantially all of the Company's cost of goods sold is derived from 3 service providers and one vendor.  As at December 31, 2016, and together they represented 16% of the accounts payable and accrued liabilities.


	 



	Interest rate risk:

	 

	Interest rate risk is the risk borne by an interest-bearing asset or liability as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.  Financial assets and financial liabilities with variable interest rates expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk.  The Company's does not have significant interest rate risk.





	Fair values:  The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, cash held in trust and customer deposits, accounts receivables, accounts payable and client funds approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization.

	From time to time, the Company may be involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, collections claims, breach of contract claims, labor and employment claims, tax and other matters. Although claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the resolution of current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, balance sheet, results of operations or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

NEW YORK, NY – June 5, 2017 – Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz LLP announces the filing of a securities class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of the securities of Zoompass Holdings, Inc. (OTC:ZPAS) from April 24, 2017 and May 24, 2017, inclusive (“Class Period”), in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. 
Investors who have incurred losses in Zoompass Holdings, Inc. are urged to contact the firm immediately at classmember@whafh.com or (800) 575-0735 or (212) 545-4774. 
If   you   have  purchased  Zoompass Holdings, Inc.   shares and would like to assist with the litigation process as a lead plaintiff, you may, no  later  than July 31, 2017, request that the Court appoint you lead plaintiff of the proposed class.
According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that:

Zoompass unlawfully engaged in a scheme to promote its stock;


discovery of the foregoing conduct would subject Zoompass to heightened regulatory scrutiny and potential criminal sanctions; and


that as a result, Zoompass’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On May 9, 2017, Zoompass disclosed that it had been “made aware of and requested by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. to comment on recent trading and potential promotional activity.” On May 25, 2017, Seeking Alpha published an article alleging that Zoompass had erroneously denied its involvement with a scheme designed to promote Zoompass’ stock and purposely conceal Zoompass’ CEO was involved in a pump-and-dump scheme.
On this news, shares of Zoompass fell $0.70 per share or over 23% to close at $2.25 per share on May 25, 2017, damaging investors.
Wolf Haldenstein has extensive experience in the prosecution of securities class actions and derivative litigation in state and federal trial and appellate courts across the country.  The firm has attorneys in various practice areas; and offices in New York, Chicago and San Diego.  The reputation and expertise of this firm in shareholder and other class litigation has been repeatedly recognized by the courts, which have appointed it to major positions in complex securities multi-district and consolidated litigation.
