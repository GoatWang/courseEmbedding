Frame Size Information
If you look on the inside of the arm of your glasses you find will something that looks like: 52 [] 16 135.
This is information on the size of your glasses: the lens diameter, the bridge width and the arm length, all measured in millimetres.



The Eye Width, or Lens Diameter, is the width of the lens (in mm), measured from the bridge. (In this example, the Eye Width is 52.)
The Bridge Width is the gap above your nose between the lenses. It should be comfortable. Too tight, and the glasses could pinch your nose; too loose and the glasses will not be stable on your face. (In this example, the Bridge Width is 16.)
The Temple Length, or Arm Length, is usually one of three standards ďż˝ 135, 140 or 145mm. The arm should be long enough to sit comfortably over your ears. Glasses with straight arms do not always have this measurement indicated. (In this example, the Temple Length is 135.)

For the day of 07/28/2017 














 Rhady (North Carolina)






 "I ordered Tom Fords Alana sunglasses on a Wednesday afternoon and had them on Friday afternoon! I paid for two-day shipping and the next day emailed the company to upgrade to overnight. Dane replied to my email immediately and made sure that I received them on Friday because I was going away for the weekend and wanted them by then. Not only did they have the glasses in stock, they are 100% authentic! The price was great and the service was great. I was skeptical at first about the authenticity since they were priced so low and were virtually unavailable anywhere else, but I am extremely happy with my purchase and would order from EZContacts again!" 













Marlena (Michigan)






 "These frames are a perfect fit for my face. I love them!" 













 Angela (Ohio)






 "Ordered 4 pair of sunglasses because the price was right. One pair is no longer available.  So far I have received the Gucci--OMG-they are spectacular and $200 less than Nordstroms!"

I was unsure about buying from a new site, but after looking at the testimonials, they appeared genuine. I liked the testimonials in that seller accountability has been highlighted by almost all customers. Some of them even complimented on fast shipping. That works for me.Read more testimonials

Thank you for your help


They advertise as 110% lowest price match guarantee and they really beat others to the punch, I think I made excellent deal buying from them. I exchanged several emails with their customer service before ordering, had a great response, received the product within few days, much quicker then I anticipated, shades were well packaged....couldn't ask for anything more...

How To Read The Sizes for Your Frames

Most of us know that when shopping online for most consumer goods including prescription glasses we expect to pay less than at brick and mortar retailers. 

That's probably why you came to the Frames Emporium website, but you may not be aware that the well known national retailers like Lens Crafters, Pearl Vision and others' markup on eyeglasses frames can routinely be 1000%! Yes that was one-thousand percent.

Surprised? Just head to the mall, ask for some prices, and you'll see that this is the rule rather than the exception.

At discount retailers like Costco, WAL-MART, TARGET you may find slightly lower prices ranging from $150-$300 and upward for a selection of less than acceptable frames with lenses.

Buying glasses online can be an intimidating experience.

When it comes to something as important as your vision we encourage you to be a cautious and informed buyer. By following a few simple steps you are virtually guaranteed to get a pair of great fitting, great looking eyeglasses for a fraction of the price you would pay in stores. Refer to the steps below to ensure a successful online eyeglasses purchase:

Get an eye exam. Getting your eyes checked is important from both prescription strength and an eye health perspective. We recommend you keep a schedule and get this done annually.
Get your full prescription. Be sure to have a copy of your prescription, by law the eye care professional needs to provide you with it. You may either fax or e-mail a scanned copy, or provide FramesEmporium.com with your doctor's name and phone number so we may contact your doctor directly. You may fax a copy of your prescription to 800- 685-6184 or email a scanned copy to cs@framesemporium.com.
Get your Pupil Distance (PD). A PD Measurement or Pupil Distance can be taken at any optical store or from your doctor, and many optical stores will provide this service free of charge. DO NOT measure your own PD.  A PD measurement MUST BE measured by an authorized optical professional only.
Get your frame measurements. You can find this information easily by looking at a pair of frames you may currently own, or by visiting a local optical store. If you're looking for something new, find a pair you like at the store and write down the measurements from the frame. The measurements are typically stamped inside the temple and/or on the bridge as illustrated below:
	 
		                






Eye36
Bridge19
Temple108





	 
		                Frame measurements are in millimeters. The size measurement numbers may appear in reverse order but usually the bridge size is the smallest, and the temple size is the largest.
		                

This is the only information you need when ordering your eyeglass or sunglass frames. If you need assistance identifying your frames, just contact FramesEmporium.com and our opticians will be more than happy to help.

With this information at hand you can purchase eyeglasses online with confidence. Buying eyeglasses online can be as simple as buying a DVD or book online.

Our staff will do everything possible to ensure you are getting a great value and    your online shopping experience at FramesEmporium.com is a great one!





 


We work hard to ensure our customers receive the lowest possible prices. However sometimes we can miss a competitor's lower price. If you find a competitor with a lower delivered price, please let us know below.

Please fill out the form below and we will get back to you within 1 business day. If the price requested is lower than the one provided here we will match the price and give you $20 discount that you can apply to your next purchase with us.

A Unique and Wonderful Neighborhood!!!

                    Indian River Estates is conveniently located just South and East of US 1 and Midway Rd in S. Ft Pierce.  This area is unique in that it has a great variety of styles of homes, contemporary, ranch, A-Frame, two story, New Construction, and more traditional homes.  Homeowners in this area pay only County Taxes, not City taxes.  You are free to keep an RV, boat or commercial vehicle in your yard here.  Many yards are larger than your average quarter acre lot here.  That is very attractive to many home buyers.  It is an easy drive from Indian River Estates to Fort Pierce Center or to Port St Lucie stores like Walmart, BJ's, Sam's Club, and to Jensen Beach Mall and Theatre plus many restaurants.  It can be accessed by the lovely Indian River Drive and Rte 95 can be accessed directly by Midway Road.  It is a short distance to Ft Pierce Center for the Saturday morning Farmer's Market, or Friday Fest.  It is very close to the Savannah's Area for walking trails, picnics and dog park.  WOW!!!!

Everything was done to my liling and they even matched the PMS color I asked for.  Very on time service.

I wasn't too impressed with this product. We ordered it on white paper so that may have an effect on the look of it but we also feel like it was cheaply made. I don't know if the yellow would have been on a different paper but the white wasn't our favorite.

Our organization is using these as a fundraising item to sell when we attend fairs and other fundraising events.  We try to have budget-friendly items for sale, so even our visitors who cannot afford big-dollar items have options to support us.  Our supporters have responded very positively to them, many times purchasing multiples.

Very cute. Could have been a little bit longer to provide more writing space, but it was perfect for our podiatry show.

The imprint on these were a little darker then I thought they would be and hard to right over.  However, they were well received as a safety handout.

We love the foot-shaped notepads!  We have used them as a promotion for our wound care center.  They have been very well received, and of course, with the foot shape, they are memorable as well.
