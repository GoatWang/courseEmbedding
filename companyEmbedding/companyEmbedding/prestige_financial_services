Welcome
"I help  successful families grow and preserve their money with results based strategies  for today's markets"
 My name is  Marc J. Cormier,  President and Owner of “Prestige Financial Services Inc”.

      I've been in  the financial services industry since February, 1998 and I became Mutual Fund  Licensed in Sept 1999.

      I started my  career with Metropolitain Life. Over the next eight years, through a variety of  sales and changes, I was with The Mutual Group, then Clarica, which was then sold  to SunLife Financial.

      In mid-2006,  it became apparent that in order to better serve my clients, it would be better  to work independently.

    That’s when “Prestige Financial Services Inc.” was  created. I affiliated myself with various Life Insurance companies and what is  now “Equity Associates Inc.”. This  enables me to offer a variety of insurance and investment products to help my  clients meet their goals and objectives.    
Why choose me?
What  difference can you expect by working with an independent advisor? 

Most of us  acknowledge that turbulence exists throughout the financial markets.  Your financial objectives may call for  greater security, but who is watching your back?  Financial complacency can be insidious and  the cost of oversight may be high!  Have  you covered all the bases?

What size  nest egg will you need to retire?  What  rate of return is necessary to maintain your desired lifestyle?  What investment strategy has the best opportunity  available to provide you with a comfortable retirement? What distributions will  you take?  What taxes will you pay? What  might happen to changes in your health or increases in the cost of living? 

Meanwhile,  what should you be doing now?  The most  common questions I am asked by my clients are how they can reach their financial  goals and what will be required to do so?   Are you willing to take responsibility for the outcome?  If so, how can you improve?

The  advantage to an advisory relationship is the expertise available from years of  professional experience.  Service is an  important ingredient to those results, along with a commitment to your  financial progress and well-being.

As a client  of mine, you become beneficiary to a powerful alliance between “Prestige Financial Services Inc.” and  various financial tools providers.   Through our strategic relationships, I am able to access a  comprehensive menu of wealth management solutions offered through mutual fund companies,  guaranteed products providers , top rated insurance carriers and group  benefits for small businesses.

As your  consultant, my role is to provide you with quality advice and support. I also  offer advice in terms of “Tax Planning”, “Estate Planning”, “Corporate  Structure”, “Employee Benefits” and more.   To complement my knowledge and experience, I may also work closely with  your CPA or attorney in consideration of your plan.

My firm  serves those who pursue their financial objectives and a lifestyle dictated by  their own terms.  
Are you ready for the  challenge?

                                    It's been a nightmare I regret the day I got this loan for my 2010 Toyota Rav 4. This company should be shut down.

            Prestige is a total fraud and I would be in on any class action lawsuit. They Repo'd the car in 2010 and reported it repo'd in 2012! False and fraudulent company. Still on my credit 8 years after. They out it on my credit as 45 times late. That's a little too much PFS, don't you think? Anyways. What goes around. Will come right back around.

The way  it seems to be set up  is that  even  after a couple  or few years  when you qualify for  a lower interest rate,you  will  be so  upside  down  on the loan no one will  refinance  the...

Company Overview
                                        Prestige Financial Services, Inc. is a premier provider of consumer 
                                        financing solutions for franchised automobile dealerships. Founded in 1994 as an affiliate of 
                                        The Larry H. Miller Group of 
                                        Companies and headquartered in the Rocky Mountains of Utah, Prestige employs best-in-class 
                                        professionals to service a wide range of borrower types, and is recognized throughout the industry for its 
                                        innovative lending programs.

                                        At Prestige, real people–not computers–make loan decisions. And unlike the majority of lenders, 
                                        Prestige requires no minimum credit score of its customers. Instead, it extends credit based on the “whole 
                                        picture,” and tries to consider the stories and reasons behind the numbers presented on an application. 
                                        This flexibility allows dealerships to provide competitive financing on new and near-new vehicles to customers 
                                        who might otherwise qualify only for high down payment loans on inferior inventory, or for no loan at all. 
                                        Furthermore, Prestige’s exclusive Rate Reduction ProgramSM rewards many of its best customers by 
                                        automatically dropping their interest rates periodically as they keep their accounts in good standing.

                                        Throughout its organization and in all of its business dealings, Prestige creates success one partnership at a 
                                        time. The company’s unwavering commitment to customer service and an intense focus on continuous 
                                        improvement have allowed Prestige to enjoy, and to look forward to, strong and steady growth.

Privacy Policy

PRIVACY POLICY
Effective July 28, 2014
NOTICE OF YOUR FINANCIAL PRIVACY RIGHTS
This is our privacy notice for our customers. We, our, and us means Prestige Financial Services, Inc. and/or 888DropMyRate where applicable. When we use the words “you” and “your” we mean consumer customers who have either: (1) submitted an application to Prestige Financial Services, Inc. and/or 888DropMyRate to obtain an extension of credit or (2) secured a loan from Prestige Financial Services, Inc. and maintain a customer account with us. Note that our policy regarding disclosure of nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties is different for each type of customer as discussed in detail below. We will tell you the sources for nonpublic personal information we collect on our customers. We will tell you what measures we take to secure that information. We first define some terms. Nonpublic personal information means information about you that we collect in connection with providing a financial product or service to you. Nonpublic personal information does not include information that is available from public sources, such as telephone directories or government records. An affiliate is a company we own or control, a company that owns or controls us, or a company that is owned or controlled by the same company that owns or controls us. Ownership does not mean complete ownership, but means owning enough to have control. A nonaffiliated third party is a company that is not an affiliate of ours.
The policies and practices described in this disclosure are subject to change, but we will communicate any significant changes to you as required by applicable law. The policies and practices described in this disclosure replace all previous notices or statements regarding this subject.
THE INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT
We collect nonpublic information about you from the following sources:

Information we receive from you on applications or other forms.
Information about your transactions with us.
Information about your transactions with our affiliates.
Information about your transactions with nonaffiliated third parties.
Information from a consumer reporting agency

THE CONFIDENTIALITY, SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF YOUR NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.
We require independent contractors and outside companies who work with us to adhere to strict privacy standards through their contracts with us.
We use technological means (such as backup files, virus detection and eradication software, firewalls, and other computer software and hardware) to protect against unauthorized access or alternations to customer data.

NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION AND AFFILIATES
We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you. Here are the kinds of nonpublic personal information we may disclose to our affiliates:

Transaction and experience information from our account records
Information about your transactions and your experience with us, such as:
Name
Address
Types of accounts
Payments history
Parties to the transactions
Social Security number

Federal law allows us to disclose the information listed above with our affiliates. You do not have a right to instruct us not to disclose this information.
TYPES AND AFFILIATES
We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to the following types of affiliates:

Business offering non financial products services, such as
Affiliated automotive dealerships

Reasons For Disclosures
Here is why we may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to our affiliates:

To provide our customers with information about additional products and services
To evaluate our total relationship with you and our family of companies and give you the best price that relationship deserves

NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION AND NONAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES
Customers Applying For An Extension Of Credit
We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to the following types of nonaffiliated third parties:

Licensed consumer lenders
Automotive dealerships

The nonpublic personal information we may disclose to nonaffiliated third parties:

All information provided by you to us on an application for the extension of credit
    Reasons why we may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to our nonaffiliated third parties:

In order to execute the intent of your having submitted to us an application for the extension of credit.
    You have a right to prevent the disclosure of this information to nonaffiliated third parties by “opting out” of the disclosure. You may exercise your right to “opt-out” of the disclosure of this information to nonaffiliated third parties by selecting “Decline” on this website’s application for an extension of credit, or by failing to sign a physical application for an extension of credit. In the event that you “opt-out” of the disclosure of this information to nonaffiliated third parties, your application for an extension of credit will not be accepted or processed by 888DropMyRate. 
Account Customers
We do not sell customer information to third parties nor do we share customer information with outside parties who may wish to market their products to you. You do not have to take any action to instruct us to keep your information confidential. We will protect your privacy automatically.
NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION AND FORMER CUSTOMERS
We do not disclose nonpublic personal information about former customers, except as permitted by law.

Disclosure and Offer Information:
MONTHLY SAVINGS/ADDITIONAL INTEREST FOR LONGER TERMS AND EXTENDED FIRST PAYMENTS/SIMPLE INTEREST CONTRACTS:
Savings claims based on monthly payment savings alone. If approved, lower monthly payment may result from a lower interest rate, a longer term or both. Remaining term may be extended for additional monthly savings; however, extending the term or the first payment beyond 30 days will increase the total interest paid.
A reduced monthly payment does not mean that you will pay less overall with a new loan. If you choose to extend the new term from your remaining term for more monthly savings, you will pay more in interest and have more monthly payments which will impact any savings from a reduced monthly payment. Savings may vary and your savings may be different.

We will tell you the sources for nonpublic personal information we collect on our customers. We will tell you what measures we take to secure that information. We first define some terms. Nonpublic personal information means information about you that we collect in connection with providing a financial product or service to you. Nonpublic personal information does not include information that is available from public sources, such as telephone directories or government records. An affiliate is a company we own or control, a company that owns or controls us, or a company that is owned or controlled by the same company that owns or controls us. Ownership does not mean complete ownership, but means owning enough to have control. A nonaffiliated third party is a company that is not an affiliate of ours.
The policies and practices described in this disclosure are subject to change, but we will communicate any significant changes to you as required by applicable law. The policies and practices described in this disclosure replace all previous notices or statements regarding this subject.

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.
We require independent contractors and outside companies who work with us to adhere to strict privacy standards through their contracts with us.
We use technological means (such as backup files, virus detection and eradication software, firewalls, and other computer software and hardware) to protect against unauthorized access or alternations to customer data.

When we use the words “you” and “your” we mean consumer customers who have either: (1) submitted an application to Prestige Financial Services, Inc. and/or 888DropMyRate to obtain an extension of credit or (2) secured a loan from Prestige Financial Services, Inc. and maintain a customer account with us. Note that our policy regarding disclosure of nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties is different for each type of customer as discussed in detail below. We will tell you the sources for nonpublic personal information we collect on our customers. We will tell you what measures we take to secure that information. We first define some terms. Nonpublic personal information means information about you that we collect in connection with providing a financial product or service to you. Nonpublic personal information does not include information that is available from public sources, such as telephone directories or government records. An affiliate is a company we own or control, a company that owns or controls us, or a company that is owned or controlled by the same company that owns or controls us. Ownership does not mean complete ownership, but means owning enough to have control. A nonaffiliated third party is a company that is not an affiliate of ours.
The policies and practices described in this disclosure are subject to change, but we will communicate any significant changes to you as required by applicable law. The policies and practices described in this disclosure replace all previous notices or statements regarding this subject.

THE CONFIDENTIALITY, SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF YOUR NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.
We require independent contractors and outside companies who work with us to adhere to strict privacy standards through their contracts with us.
We use technological means (such as backup files, virus detection and eradication software, firewalls, and other computer software and hardware) to protect against unauthorized access or alternations to customer data.

Affiliated automotive dealerships

Reasons For Disclosures

Disclosure and Offer Information:
MONTHLY SAVINGS/ADDITIONAL INTEREST FOR LONGER TERMS AND EXTENDED FIRST PAYMENTS/SIMPLE INTEREST CONTRACTS:
Savings claims based on monthly payment savings alone. If approved, lower monthly payment may result from a lower interest rate, a longer term or both. Remaining term may be extended for additional monthly savings; however, extending the term or the first payment beyond 30 days will increase the total interest paid.
A reduced monthly payment does not mean that you will pay less overall with a new loan. If you choose to extend the new term from your remaining term for more monthly savings, you will pay more in interest and have more monthly payments which will impact any savings from a reduced monthly payment. Savings may vary and your savings may be different.
