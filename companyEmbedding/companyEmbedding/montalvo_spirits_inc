Hires Another Industry Veteran to Be Chief Operating Officer and Help Drive SalesMarketwiredJuly 1, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareMOORPARK, CA--(Marketwired - Jul 1, 2015) - Montalvo Spirits, Inc. (  OTCBB :  TQLA ) ("Montalvo" or, the "Company"), producers of award-winning brand Montalvo Tequila, today announced a partnership with Beacon Beverage Imports, a well respected and recognized name in the beverage industry.In announcing the collaboration, Montalvo named Dave Stringfellow, owner of Beacon Beverage Imports headquartered in Southlake, Texas, as its Chief Operating Officer. An industry veteran, Stringfellow has become a well-respected name in the industry while working for large corporations as well as individual brands. Mr. Stringfellow began his career with the E&J Gallo Winery in California before moving on to Heublein Spirits, (Diageo) serving as the National Sales Manager for a Heublein Spirits Division. Additionally, he held the position of National Sales Manager for Sazerac and also for Sammy Hagar's Tequila label, Cabo Wabo, as it became a multi-million dollar corporation. While a great deal of his career has been spent in sales and working with distributors across the country, Mr. Stringfellow has also held the position of VP/General Manager of the US Control States for Heublein Spirits, IDV and UDV prior to becoming Diageo. It was in this capacity where he gained invaluable experience with industry logistics as well as managing the functions of marketing and finance."Montalvo Tequila's sales and reach continues to grow," said Alex Viecco, Chief Executive Officer of Montalvo Spirits, Inc. "Partnering with Mr. Stringfellow and Beacon Beverage Imports is the right move at the right time for Montalvo. It just makes sense." Mr. Viecco continued, "We look forward to working with someone who has so much experience, credibility and a clear vision of where he wants to help take Montalvo as we rapidly expand."Added Daniel P. Cahill, Director of Sales for Montalvo Spirits, Inc., "As Montalvo continues to grow, we know that Mr. Stringfellow will offer the most effective methods when it comes to launching in, not only new markets, but the right markets. He also knows how to effectively brand products in a cost-effective way. We couldn't be happier to be working with Dave and are certainly excited about our future together."Beacon Beverage Imports represents several brands across several categories including Rums, Bourbons, Tequila, ready to drink cocktails, and a number of highly sought after imported brands. In addition to helping Cabo Wabo become one of the most recognized Tequila's in the industry, Stringfellow himself has worked with notable brands such as Jose Cuervo, 1800, Herradura, El Jimador and Casa 1921."We have long known that Montalvo is one of the best tequilas on the market and are ecstatic to have it join the select brands Beacon Beverage Imports represents," Stringfellow said. "Montalvo is certainly a winner and we will continue to market this great product aggressively. We expect to continue to grow for years to come. I'm really looking forward to being a part of this partnership. It's a win-win for everyone."Montalvo Spirits, Inc. develops, markets and distributes premium alcoholic beverages, with its initial offering being the award-winning Montalvo Tequila. The Company plans to focus on artisanal spirit brands with a tradition of excellence and quality. Montalvo Spirits, Inc. continues to grow rapidly. Earlier this month, it announced a partnership with Fox Sports San Diego, the city's first and only regional sports network.Montalvo Spirits, Inc. now has deep-seated roots in San Diego, teaming with the San Diego Padres in April to bring Montalvo Tequila into Petco Park, with elements including "The Rail presented by Montalvo Tequila" and the Montalvo Tequila Bar on the rooftop of the Western Metal Supply Co. building. The Rail presented by Montalvo Tequila offers fans the opportunity to sit on the rail of the iconic Western Metal Supply co. building in left field, with a view overlooking Petco Park.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price.
