Staples, Inc. Announces Strategic Partnership with Managed by Q
Nov 17 16
Staples, Inc. announced that it has entered into a strategic partnership with Managed by Q to offer Staples’ business customers a one-stop shop for everything an office manager needs, including new services to Staples. Staples will now provide customers in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco access to Managed by Q’s suite of office services. The platform lets users hire, communicate with, pay and review providers of over 100 different services, from cleaners and handymen to IT support and even workplace yoga. In the coming months, Staples and Managed by Q expect to expand the service and create more solutions that make it easy to run the office. With this partnership, Managed by Q will get access to Staples growing customer base of small and medium sized businesses, while Staples customers can now access a significantly expanded suite of office services. Staples is again bringing an innovative offering to market to solve the pain points of the office manager, similar to the recent announcement of a digital “Easy Button“ for ordering and customer service.

Frequently Asked Questions




What we do

How does Q work?
Q provides all of your office management needs—from cleaning and maintenance to office supplies and employee perks—through our easy-to-use online dashboard. All services can be ordered on an ongoing or individual basis and are fulfilled by Q’s highly trained staff and partners. Our robust technology platform enables easy communication with our team and a consolidated invoicing system. All you need is access!


What types of services do you offer?
Q offers a wide range of office management services—you can view the full list here. If you have a project in mind that’s not on our list, contact us and we’ll do our best to make it happen. We love a good challenge.


What kind of supplies do you offer?
We offer basic necessities like toilet paper and paper towels, office stationery, food and beverages for your kitchen, and more. We also have a cleaning and hardware kit that contains all the supplies our Operators need to clean your space efficiently. All supplies are shipped direct to your door and can be inventoried, stocked, and reordered by our Operators.



Our team

What’s an Operator?
Q Operators are the full-time cleaning, maintenance, and assistance staff who work in your space. Sending top talent to your office is important to us, which is why we recruit highly trained and motivated employees. Our Operators are fully employed, bonded, insured, background checked, and go through comprehensive training, as well as receive ongoing feedback and reviews. You can learn more about our team of Operators here.


Who are Q’s Partners?
Q Partners are office service providers who offer more specialized services that require additional equipment and training. We work with the best local businesses in your area and evaluate our Partners based on their pricing, customer feedback, quality of service, and business practices.


What if I really like my current office service providers, but want to use Q? 
We’re always looking for the best Operators and Partners to join Q. If you know of a great individual service provider you’d like to work with through Q, contact our People Operations team and we’ll do our best to accommodate. If you have a business you’d like to work with through our platform, contact our Partners team and we’ll look into adding them to our network. 


Are you insured? 
Absolutely. We carry insurance that covers us in any commercial space in the United States. We also carry workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance, and a third party fidelity bond for all of our employees.


How do I become a Q Operator or Partner? 
If you’d like to become a Q Operator, you can apply online here. If you’re interested in joining our network of partners as a service provider, email our Partners team.



Your building

What if my building offers cleaning or maintenance services, but I want to use Q? 
In many cases, tenants have a choice of which cleaning company they use, although property managers and landlords may not advertise it. 
If you work in an office where you’re required to use building services or your lease requires it, Q can provide supplemental cleaning and daytime services, as well as dozens of other office services your building doesn’t provide. Some examples include catering, coffee and water fulfillment, corporate wellness services, temporary staffing, and more. 
If you’re interested in working with Q, our team can work with your building to get everything set up.


I need a Certificate of Insurance from Q. How do I get that?
No problem. If your building management needs a Certificate of Insurance (COI), just provide us with a sample and we’ll take care of it from there. 


For services provided outside of business hours, how do you access my office?
If Q Operators need to access your space on a recurring basis outside of business hours, we’ll ask for at least three sets of keys. One set will be provided to each of the Operators assigned to your office, one will stay with your account Supervisor who checks in on your Operators for quality assurance, and one pair is stored at our city office with your Account Manager in case of emergency. If any additional security access is required of our Operators, we will work with you to set that up before beginning service.
If a Q Partner needs to access your space when your office is closed, they will coordinate with you directly to ensure a safe and secure entry.



Pricing

How much does Q cost? 
Access to the Q platform is free—there are no subscription fees or membership costs. We just ask that you have a credit card on file to sign up.

Once you’re signed up, you can order the services and subscriptions that make the most sense for your office. Our office management experts will work with you to find the best solution based on your office needs and budget. Our pricing is transparent, so you’ll know exactly what you’re paying for before we begin service. 


Are there service minimums?
That depends on the service. Some services have hourly minimums, while others do not. Any minimums will be shared upfront when discussing the project, so you can make an informed decision.


Are there contracts for any of your services?
Normally, no. You’re welcome to use our ongoing or individual services for as long as they suit your office needs. We only ask that you give us one week notice if you need to pause or stop a recurring service.


What forms of payment do you accept?
We accept both credit card and ACH payment—whichever you prefer.



Getting started

How do I get started?
Just click the Get in Touch button. One of our office management experts will reach out to determine what makes the most sense for your office needs and get you access to the Q platform.


Do you need to see my office before I sign up?
Nope! While some projects will require a walkthrough of your space to better scope out the work and provide a quote, for most services we rely on the data from our customer offices across the country to determine what we need to make running your space as efficient as possible.


What should I expect after signup?
Once you become Managed by Q, you’ll get access to your Q Dashboard—your space’s mission control. From here, you can book services, order supplies, leave feedback, contact your dedicated support team, and more! If you sign up for recurring services, a member of our team may schedule a walk-through of your space or an onboarding call to learn more about your office.


What are your hours?
Q operates 24 hours a day, and our office team is available from 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. local time. If you need to get in touch with a member of the Q team for any urgent matters outside of business hours, you can leave a voicemail on our hotline (212.401.1982) and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible


Have a question we didn’t answer?
