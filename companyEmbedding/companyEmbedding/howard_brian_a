HOWARD DANANBERG


				PODIATRIST
			
A podiatrist who practiced in Manchester, NY, Howard Dananberg was named one of the most influential podiatrists in the U.S. by Podiatry Management magazine.
He has published widely on lower limb biomechanics. Experts know him worldwide for his well-researched understanding of the connection between gait style and chronic lower back pain. He has also pioneered solutions for limited range of motion in the big toe joint (functional hallux limitus)—a frequently overlooked condition.
In addition, Howard has translated his ideas into patented foot products, distributed around the world. Howard’s novel techniques and technologies have successfully helped both men and women relieve a variety of walking-related symptoms throughout the body.
With the help of in-pressure shoe testing, for example, he developed a kinetic wedge to improve the comfort of running shoes. He also helped create a groundbreaking insert for high heels, called Insolia. Designed to lessen foot, leg, and back pain, the insole puts the foot in a more ideal position, making heels feel almost like a pair of flats.




HOWARD’S CONTRIBUTIONS

				
In addition to writing multiple articles on lower limb biomechanics, Howard collaborated with Phillip Vasyli to design a heat-moldable orthotic with removable 1st ray “plugs.”

Howard Hughes' giant Flying Boat, the Spruce Goose, floated out of the hangar it resided inside for thirty-three years into Los Angeles Harbor on October 29, 1980. It took two days to pick it up with Herman the German and place it on land for temporary storage. On February 10, 1982, it was lifted onto a barge for transportation to the geodesic dome where it was displayed to the public for eleven years.
