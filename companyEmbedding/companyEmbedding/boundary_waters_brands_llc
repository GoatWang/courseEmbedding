Our Story


JOIA started over a dinner with great friends and a conversation about blending our favorite fruit juices
with herb and spices.





  

Team + Mixologist
A mixologist joined the team and
before long, a company was launched - Boundary Waters Brands. Long hours were spent tasting and
refining. It had to be natural. It had to be refreshing. It had to be REAL! Not too much fruit juice or
sugar. Distinct. Delicious. Fresh.





  

Friends + Opinions = Joia
Then we enlisted friends to try our craft and provide honest opinions. Without exception everyone
loved them, and the joy of our creations is succinctly expressed in our name - JOIA.
We are committed to delivering exceptionally refreshing, distinctly flavored beverages that bring joy and
celebrate life. Of course, we hope you will 'share the JOIA' with friends. It's where our inspiration
began.






                            From Day-1 JOIA has been about family and friends. It still is. Everyone from the photographers to the models to the makeup artists to the developer has
                            donated significant time and talent and were all drawn from our pool of family and friends. We can't
                            thank them enough.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Welcome to Duane's Canoe Outfitting
The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness of Northern Minnesota offers the visitor some of the finest back-country canoeing in the world.  Combined with Canada's Quetico Provincial Park, the area encompasses over two million acres and contains thousands of lakes rimmed by ancient volcanic rock and towering pine trees.  This vast area is so primitive that canoeists today enjoy a land much like that seen by the Voyageurs as they to pushed westward to trade with Native Americans during the 18th Century.  Ancient Native American paintings, or pictographs, can still be seen on cliffs bordering some lakes and rivers.  Fortunate visitors often see the permanent inhabitants of this wild area in their natural setting.  Black bear, timber wolves, bald eagles, beaver, lynx and otters are among the numerous species of wild creatures native to this northern boreal forest.

Youth Groups

										Organizing a canoe trips for a large group can be a big task. Let us assist you. Each season we outfit large groups from churches, scout troops and schools. Providing exceptional service to youth groups is a trademark of Duane's Canoe Outfitters, we have been doing it for a very long time. We have return customers each year that first visited the BWCAW as part of a youth group outfitted by Duane's. Often, they are bringing their families to experience the wilderness. Our rates for youth groups are extremely attractive, we even offer a leader allowance. We are also in very close proximity to Birch Lake, just outside of the BWCAW. Large groups often choose to use Forest Service Campsites on this wilderness type lake where permits and user fees are not necessary. Contact us today to begin planning your wilderness adventure!
