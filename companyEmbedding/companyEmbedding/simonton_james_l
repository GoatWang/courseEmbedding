 Based on the Simontons' experience with hundreds of patients at their world-famous Cancer Counseling and Research Center, "Getting Well Again" introduces the scientific basis for the "will to live." In this revolutionary book the Simontons profile the typical "cancer personality": how an individual's reactions to stress and other emotional factors can contribute to the onset and progress of cancer -- and how positive expectations, self-awareness, and self-care can contribute to survival. This book offers the same self-help techniques the Simonton's patients have used to successfully to reinforce usual medical treatment -- techniques for learning positive attitudes, relaxation, visualization, goal setting, managing pain, exercise, and building an emotional support system.

He took chemo and radiation concurrently as his "only" chance to live--even so, his prognosis was not good.  He found a copy of this book and an audio cassette tape from the Simontons.  He read the book, then read it again, then read it again, while continuing chemo and radiation!  Each day, three times a day,  he listened to  the audio tape.  He placed as much faith in the book and its suggestions and in the relaxation-visualization tape as he did in the conventional treatment he was receiving.  He lived almost fifteen years after diagnosis and did not die from inoperable lung cancer but from bleeding ulcers.  This book and the visualization tape if it is still available, are MUSTS for people diagnosed with cancer who are willing to use their minds to help their bodies cure themselves.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsDon't hesitate to read this bookByBecky Scotton 13 July 2016Format: PaperbackThere is no doubt in my mind this is a seminal cancer classic from which all the latest findings and awareness about the emotional causes of cancer springs.  Dr Simonten was the pioneer of this science which now has mainstream credibility.  A friend gave me this book when I was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer.  It blew my mind.  I knew I had done everything 'right' when I was diagnosed at 41.  I ate only organic, I kept a chemical free house, I exercised regularly, didn't smoke, or drink (much!), I breastfed 3 children for 12 months each, I volunteered, I was happy, had good relationships and had forgiven my painful past...or so I thought.  ..I was a healthy person both physically and spiritually.  What Dr Simonten did was help me to begin my journey of emotional healing.  I was shocked and horrified to discover I had ticked almost every item on his personality test that indicated I was likely to get cancer. That changed my life.  I sought counseling for buried trauma that on a conscious level I would have sworn I had moved past and forgiven...but no...Dr Simonten gets you to question your emotional state and helps you to understand how vital is the role of the subconscious in your healing journey, and how, when explored, and dealt with compassionately, you expand your awareness to understand how cancer can be the start of your spiritual awakening and a peaceful, contented life.  I always say, sometimes the Universe gives you your greatest gifts, cleverly disguised as your worst nightmare.  Do Simonten gives you the pathway to understand this and turn cancer into your greatest gift.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsGetting Well AgainByJeff Son 21 December 2011Format: Mass Market PaperbackI heard Stephanie Matthews -Simonson speak in Atlanta USA in 1982, during a Business convention. I was very impressed with her presentation & was staggered by the postitive results of her Self Awareness techniques. She spoke at the last morning session with Bob Gilley a cancer patient who was healed by the technique. I actually met Bob Gilley in the Hotel across the road from the convention, during the Lunch hour & I had a long conversation with him. He radiated good health & still practised the technique, although in good health. I bought the book for a client who has been diagnosed with cancer, who is very ill. I am also in the process of reading the book myself. I didn't need convincing about the book, as I have seen first hand the results that can be obtained.Read more0Comment|

Core Molding Technologies Inc. Elects James L. Simonton as New Chairman of the Board

Posted on November 15, 2011 by admin 

COLUMBUS, Ohio – November 15, 2011 – Core Molding Technologies, Inc. (NYSE Amex: CMT) today announced that on November 9, 2011 the Board of Directors elected James L. Simonton as Chairman of the Board.  Mr. Simonton has served as a director of Core since May 2010, and from 2000 through 2006 served as its President and Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Simonton replaces Malcolm (Mac) M. Prine as Chairman, who passed away on September 6, 2011.
“We are very pleased that Jim has agreed to serve as Chairman of the Board.  His in-depth insight and knowledge about our industry will continue to benefit Core in this expanded role,” said Kevin L. Barnett, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Mr. Simonton’s career spans several decades of leadership in the medium and heavy-duty truck industries. “I am honored to serve Core, and look forward to continue working with the Board and our management team as we continue to grow and strengthen Core’s position in the marketplace,” said Simonton.
Core Molding Technologies, Inc. is a compounder of sheet molding composites (SMC) and molder of fiberglass reinforced plastics. Core specializes in large-format moldings and offers a wide range of fiberglass processes, including compression molding of sheet molding compounds (SMC), long fiber thermoplastics (LFTP) and bulk molding compounds (BMC), spray-up, lay-up, resin transfer (RTM) and vacuum resin transfer molding (V-RTM), and vacuum bagging.  Additionally, Core offers liquid molding of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD).  Core serves a wide variety of markets, including the medium and heavy-duty truck, marine, automotive, and other commercial products. Headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, Core operates plants in Columbus and Batavia, Ohio; Gaffney, South Carolina; Warsaw, Kentucky and Matamoros, Mexico.  For further information, visit the company’s website at www.coremt.com.
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  As a general matter, forward-looking statements are those focused upon future plans, objectives or performance as opposed to historical items and include statements of anticipated events or trends and expectations and beliefs relating to matters not historical in nature. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to Core Molding Technologies’ operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Core Molding Technologies’ control. These uncertainties and factors could cause Core Molding Technologies’ actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements.
Core Molding Technologies believes that the following factors, among others, could affect its future performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements made in this press release: business conditions in the plastics, transportation, watercraft and commercial product industries; federal and state regulations (including engine emission regulations); general economic, social and political environments in the countries in which Core Molding Technologies operates; safety and security conditions in Mexico; dependence upon two major customers as the primary source of Core Molding Technologies’ sales revenues; recent efforts of Core Molding Technologies to expand its customer base; failure of Core Molding Technologies’ suppliers to perform their contractual obligations; the availability of raw materials; inflationary pressures; new technologies; competitive and regulatory matters; labor relations; the loss or inability of Core Molding Technologies to attract and retain key personnel; compliance changes to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations; the availability of capital; the ability of Core Molding Technologies to provide on-time delivery to customers, which may require additional shipping expenses to ensure on-time delivery or otherwise result in late fees; risk of cancellation or rescheduling of orders; risks related to the transfer of production from Core Molding Technologies Columbus, Ohio facility to its Matamoros production facility; management’s decision to pursue new products or businesses which involve additional costs, risks or capital expenditures; and other risks identified from time-to-time in Core Molding Technologies’ other public documents on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those described in Item 1A of the 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders on Form 10-K.
