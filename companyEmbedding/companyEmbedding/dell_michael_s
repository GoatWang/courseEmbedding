■ Michael Dell defied conventional wisdom—that consumers would not purchase computer equipment over the telephone—and built a billion-dollar company doing just that. Through his direct method of offering low-cost, custom-configured personal computers direct to customers, Dell changed the competitive dynamic of the computer industry. Notable for a natural business talent coupled with a willingness to share power, Dell carried the company through rapid growth and economic difficulties. He innovated operating processes, took risks, learned through his mistakes, and built Dell Inc. from a college dormitory operation to a global corporation. Along the way Dell became one of the wealthiest Americans and the youngest CEO of a company on the Fortune 500 list of largest American companies.
ENTREPRENEURIAL ABILITIES EMERGE
Dell understood the meaning of "business opportunity" early in life, as his mother's profession, stockbroker, frequently
raised discussions of business and economic affairs at the family dinner table. So when he began to collect stamps at age 12 and noticed prices rising, Dell recognized a business opportunity. He determined the most profitable way to sell stamps would be to bypass the auctioneer and sell direct to collectors. He compiled a 12-page catalog of his and his friends' stamps and advertised in a stamp collectors' magazine. In this first business venture Dell earned $2000.
Dell further developed his business acumen at the age of 16, when he sold newspaper subscriptions for the Houston Post. The inefficiency of cold-calling prompted Dell to find better marketing methods. He determined that the people most likely to subscribe were newly married couples and people who had moved. He obtained lists of marriage license applicants and mortgage applicants then used his Apple II computer to address sales letters to people on these lists. The approach succeeded so well that Dell earned $18,000 the first year and had bought a BMW automobile by the time he went to college. In the back seat of that BMW, Dell carried three personal computers, the seeds of PC's Limited and Dell Computer Corporation.
Dell's fascination with computers began with exposure to a data processor in junior high school then to computers at the local Radio Shack store. After much persuasion, Dell's parents allowed him to use savings to buy an Apple II computer at the age of 15. To the fury of his parents, upon arriving home Dell dismantled the computer to see how it operated. The following year, in 1981, Dell bought an IBM desktop computer and learned how to upgrade and add new components. With insight that IBM-compatible computers would become the choice of business, Dell began to buy, upgrade, and resell personal computers for friends and acquaintances, eventually purchasing components at wholesale rates from distributors. Exposure to the computer industry fostered Dell's desire to start a computer business. In June 1982 he skipped classes for most of a week to attend the National Computer Conference. After saving money to buy a hard disk drive (not standard equipment at the time), Dell communicated with other computer enthusiasts on a bulletin board system and learned how the industry operated. He found dealers sold computers for $3,000 and made $1,000 gross profit, yet he could purchase components for less than $700.
FOUNDING DELL COMPUTER CORPORATION
Dell determined that he could compete with retail computer dealers by selling direct to consumers at a lower price and offering better technical service, but his parents had another idea—that Dell should become a physician. Dell went to the University of Texas at Austin in fall 1983. While he attended to premed studies, Dell continued to upgrade and resell computers, finding customers among students and local business-people through word-of-mouth. By the time his parents made a surprise visit in November to address poor class attendance, Dell knew he wanted to compete with IBM. An attempt to be the good son and study premed lasted approximately three weeks, then Dell returned to upgrading computers. In early 1984 Dell registered PC's Limited with the state of Texas and moved to a two-bedroom condominium. Between word-of-mouth referrals and a small advertisement in the local newspaper, PC's Limited sold between $50,000 and $80,000 per month in computers, add-on components, and upgrade kits. The week before final examinations in May 1983 Dell incorporated the company as Dell Computer Corporation with the state-required minimum of $1,000 capital. He never returned to college.
PC's Limited moved to a 1,000-square-foot office, and Dell hired a few people to take and fill orders and upgrade basic machines. Computer sales increased so rapidly that the company outgrew that facility and two larger ones in one year. When the company moved into a 30,000-square-foot facility in 1985, Dell believed the space would never be used. But that year the company began to design and build computers with purchased components. Dell hired an engineer to develop a 286 microprocessor from chip sets, a strategy that simplified computer design. In spring 1986 Dell introduced the fastest personal computer of the time, a 12-megahertz 286 processor. The price of $1,995 compared favorably with IBM's price of $3,995 for a 6-megahertz 286 processor. The machine caught the attention of the news media and garnered excellent performance reviews and a cover story in PC Week. Sales exploded to $60 million that year.
Despite speculation that consumers would not want to purchase a technologically complex product over the telephone, Dell succeeded. From the start Dell emphasized a customer focus. Another company could compete on price, but quality products and excellent service would make Dell Computer sustainable over the long term. The advantage of custom configuration and a direct relationship with customers meant that Dell did not have to guess what a customer might want then attempt to inventory and sell preconfigured computers, as the competition tended to do. Parts inventory and computer manufacturing processes were designed for rapid configuration and product delivery in a matter of days. Because the direct model did not allow the customer to see or handle the product, however, in 1986 Dell began to offer a 30-day money back guarantee, a first in the industry. When the company began to pursue corporate business, Dell initiated another industry first in 1986, next-day, on-site service for personal computers in the customer's home or office.
BUSINESS AS AN EXPERIENCE IN HANDS-ON LEARNING
Rapid growth challenged Dell's abilities as a businessman. Although he made many mistakes, Dell credited those mistakes with helping him learn quickly. It was ironic that when Dell made big mistakes, those mistakes conflicted with his most cherished ideas: to manage inventory, to focus on the customer, and to sell direct to the customer.


The first major mistake involved excess parts inventory and led to innovation in high-tech production. Growing at a rapid pace, the company bought as many parts as it could. When technology changed in 1989, however, the company was left with memory chips that could not be used or sold. The company had to raise prices to compensate for the loss, slowing growth. Taking an unconventional approach to problem solving, the company implemented supply process in partnership with vendors. This strategy limited parts inventory, so that when technology changed, Dell Computer could adopt the new technology quickly. During the late 1990s Dell refined supply chain management to less than an eight-day lead, whereas competitors maintained inventory of preconfigured computers for more than 60 days. The vendor relationships worked because Dell shared information and helped vendors stay abreast of technological change.
The second major mistake involved development of the Olympic computer, introduced in 1990 with technology that far exceeded anything in the industry. Customers said they did not need that much technology. While certain elements of the new technology were applied elsewhere, Dell realized he had not communicated with his customers before product development. He learned that slow, incremental change served the customer better.
The third problem involved entry into the retail market in 1990. Once profit and loss analysis by business segment was put into place, Dell discovered that the company lost money in retail. Although retail sales accounted for 10 percent of total sales, and retail sales were growing more than 15 percent industrywide, Dell risked an exit from retail in 1994 and refocused on the direct model. Dell launched www.dell.com that year, introduced online pricing in 1995, and initiated online sales in 1996. Internet sales quickly reached $1 million per day and increased to $50 million per day in 2000. Dell Computer entered the market for servers in 1996 and storage products in 1998, passing the cost savings of the direct model to customers. Again, Dell's direct method, selling servers and storage products directly over the telephone and then via the Internet, defied conventional wisdom.
SEEKING COUNSEL AND SHARING POWER
Unlike many entrepreneurs, Dell learned to relinquish responsibility and share power when he could no longer handle responsibilities himself. He sought the wisdom of experienced executives early in the company's history. In 1986 Lee Walker, a venture capitalist and consultant, joined Dell Computer and established a mentoring relationship with Dell. Dell matured as a businessman when he accepted Walker's decision to fire or demote most of the senior management staff, recognizing the need to find people who could grow into positions of increasing responsibility as the company expanded. Walker encouraged Dell to overcome his shyness as well as his reluctance to take a public role. He persuaded Dell to use his name for the company and its computer brand, a change that took place in 1987 in conjunction with the company's first international foray, to the United Kingdom. Walker brought two high-profile executives to the board of directors, George Kozmetsky, the cofounder of Teledyne, and Bobby Ray Inman, the former chairman, president, and chief executive of Westmark Systems. These executives provided Dell executives with sound advice, particularly as the company made its first offerings of stock—a private placement in October 1987 and a public offering in June 1988.
When rapid growth surpassed the company's ability to provide quality products and service and operate profitably in the early 1990s, Dell sought objective perspectives. First he hired Thomas J. Meredith of Sun Microsystems as chief financial officer in November 1992. Rather than simply pursue rapid growth as a goal, Dell adapted to the need to include data about cash liquidity and profitability into daily decision making. When the company failed to launch quality laptop computer products in 1993, Dell hired John Medica, who had led development of the Apple PowerBook computer. Medica focused on a single product, the Latitude XP computer, which gave Dell Computer its first significant share of the laptop market in 1994. Aware that even a CEO-founder can be removed from position in a public company, Dell approached the board of directors in August 1993 with an outline for improving operations and profitability. He hired Bain & Company to assist with profit and loss analysis and to develop measurements that created responsibility and accountability at the level of each business unit.
In May 1994 Dell hired the former Motorola executive Morton L. Topfer as vice chairman. Topfer's experience in product cycles and management restructuring fit well with Dell Computer's needs for executive leadership. Dell handled products, technology, and general strategy and took a more public role, that of customer relations, dealing with the press, and giving speeches. Topfer handled budget, day-to-day operations, sales, and marketing. The change allowed Dell to spend more time with his growing family, and Topfer brought ideas and discipline to a new emphasis on detailed, long-range planning. A three-year goal of achieving $10 billion in revenue by the end of 1997 was exceeded by $2 billion.
Kevin Rollins, a Bain & Company consultant credited with recommending that Dell Computer cease retail operation, joined the company in 1996 and began to work with Dell and Topfer in the office of chairman in 1997. The three men shared the responsibilities until Topfer left in 1999. Afterward, Dell and Rollins shared responsibilities, working from adjoining offices divided by a glass wall and a glass door that never closed. In 2004 Dell relinquished the CEO title to Rollins, a recognition that Rollins was already functioning in that role, rather than of a change in responsibilities.
MAINTAINING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT IN A GLOBAL CORPORATION
During the company's early years of rapid growth, unconventional thinking and new ideas pervaded the decision-making process at Dell. A simple, informal business process was the consequence and the facilitator of rapid expansion. Employees frequently handled any task needed, such as taking orders when the telephone lines were busy. That salespeople had to set up their own computers cultivated customer service through hands-on experience with the product from the point of view of the user.
As sales rose from the millions into the billions, Dell sought to maintain an entrepreneurial company culture while addressing the needs of a publicly owned, global corporation. Involving more facts and data in the decision-making processes constituted a major adjustment to the free-spirited, entrepreneurial culture of the company. A careful approach involved not pursuing every business opportunity but prioritizing, because growth can occur too quickly and threaten the existence of the company. Rather than pursue every idea, Dell chose to examine ideas more closely in relation to the whole of the company and to develop chosen ideas to their full potential.


While he learned to apply facts to intuitive knowledge and an awareness of risk, Dell encouraged all of the attitudes embodied in the company culture from the start. Open communication and exchange of ideas across all levels of the organization contributed to a flexible, nonhierarchal structure that allowed for quick responses in a constantly changing environment. Dell found employees' spontaneous interactions and candid comments more helpful than planned presentations. A learning attitude accepted failure as essential to the process of taking unconventional approaches to problems, and openminded self-criticism provided the foundation for innovation.
One way that Dell strove to maintain the intimacy of a small company involved creating manageable business units, beginning in the mid-1990s. Corporate sales divided into small and large companies, then medium-sized companies. International divisions divided into specific markets as sales increased. In 2003 sales to educational institutions segmented into kindergarten through grade 12 and higher education. Segmentation allowed executives to move into positions of manageable, if fewer, responsibilities. The challenge of segmentation involved sustaining a sense of common goals. To unify a large organization of people with diverse responsibilities, Dell believed that each individual needed to understand his or her role in contributing to overall success. Communication throughout the company via e-mail newsletters and posters as well as compensation incentives furthered this goal.
COMPETITIVENESS EXPANDS MARKET SHARE
Although Dell was known to be friendly and approachable, these qualities belied the competitiveness that helped his company become the leading manufacturer of personal computers worldwide. Although he designed the direct method with the intention of competing on price and service, Dell used that competitive edge whenever necessary. In 1992, when industry consolidation threatened smaller operations, Dell initiated a price war. When he introduced servers in 1996 Dell knew that Compaq used high profit margins in servers to offset low margins in desktop computers. He also knew the direct model gave Dell a price advantage.
When economic downturn negatively affected sales of personal computers, Dell initiated another price war, beginning in January 2001, adding aggressive advertising and cost cutting to the strategy. Dell restructured earlier than the competition, reducing the company's workforce by 1,700 in February 2001 and by another 3,000 jobs later that year. Dell also reduced inventory lead time to several hours. Supply trucks held inventory at the dock until needed on the factory floor when the customer paid for the computer. In 18 months the company rose from number five in worldwide personal computer sales to number one. Dell competed directly with Hewlett Packard (HP) by initiating printer sales in 2001. Taking advantage of the atmosphere of uncertainty surrounding the merger between Compaq and HP, Dell cut prices and captured market share. When HP implied possible price increases to offset low profits in 2003, Dell cut prices again and captured market share.
Dell's entry into any product market or geographical market caused prices to decline, a process referred to as "the Dell effect." Industry observers noted that competition on price hindered innovation, as other companies cut research and development costs to remain profitable while Dell relied on suppliers to innovate technology. For Dell, focusing on the customer meant value at low cost with excellent service. While Dell emphasized a focus on the customer rather than the competition, he and his executive team kept their attention on both.

Dell, Michael
February 23, 1965 • Houston, Texas  
Chairman of Dell, Inc.
In 1984, as a first-year college student in Austin, Texas, Michael Dell borrowed $1,000 from his parents to start a computer accessories business. He began by selling kits to help customers upgrade their personal computers, establishing a business model his company, Dell, Inc., still follows today: sell directly to consumers, eliminating the middle step of a retail store or a distributor, and hold on to far more of the profits. In just two decades, Dell's company grew to massive proportions, with more than 47,000 employees and annual revenues of more than $40 billion. Dell himself was squarely at the top of Forbes magazine's list of the ten wealthiest Americans under the age of forty. He has been praised as a visionary and an innovator, but he has also earned admiration for being a stable, consistent leader. In an industry that changes rapidly, in terms of both technology and personnel, Dell has stood out from his peers by remaining at the helm of his company from its struggling early days to its current status as a major player in the global field of information technology (IT).
A businessman from the beginning
Michael Saul Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, Texas. While he displayed intelligence and ingenuity from an early age, he had little interest in school. At the age of eight, he sent away for information on taking a high school equivalency exam, which, if he passed, would make him a high school graduate without having to endure the remaining years of school. His parents insisted he stay in the classroom, and Dell invested his considerable creative energy in after-school ventures. When he was twelve years old, he operated a mail-order trading business for stamps and baseball cards, earning $2,000. At the age of fourteen, Dell got his first computer, an Apple II and soon realized that he had a knack for taking computers apart and putting them back together. While in high school, Dell took a job delivering newspapers for the Houston Post. His aggressive selling strategies—which included obtaining mailing lists of newly married people, offering them free trial subscriptions, and then following up with phone calls—resulted in earnings of $18,000. Not one to hold on to his spoils, Dell spent the money on a new BMW.
"What people have never understood is that we're not like other companies."
In 1983, when Dell entered his freshman year at the University of Texas at Austin, his parents hoped he would become a doctor, but Dell's skills lay elsewhere. In examining the personal computer, or PC, industry, he noticed an opportunity to sell PCs for less, as he explained to Richard Murphy of Success magazine: "I saw that you'd buy a PC for about $3,000, and inside that PC was about $600 worth of parts. IBM would buy most of these parts from other companies, assemble them, and sell the computer to a dealer for $2,000. Then the dealer, who knew very little about selling or supporting computers, would sell it for $3,000, which was even more outrageous." Dell realized that he could assemble computer parts, skip the step of selling to a dealer, and go directly to the consumer. That way the consumer 



could buy the product for less, and Dell held on to every penny of the profits. Dell thus combined his knowledge of computers with his well-developed business sense and began his own business, assembling upgrade kits for personal computers.
In a 1999 article in Fortune, Dell recalled operating his new business out of his University of Texas dorm room on the twenty-seventh floor: "People would ride up to the 27th floor with their computers. I'd put in some memory or a disk drive, they'd pay me, and I'd send them on their way." His earnings soon reached about $25,000 a month. By the summer of 1984, after one year at the university, Dell had decided that he needed to focus all of his time on his business, and he dropped out of college. His company, then called PCs Unlimited, began building PCs, starting with parts from such established computer companies as IBM and Compaq and adding elements to make the products unique. Dell continued to sell directly to consumers, a strategy that paid off in vast sums: by the end of 1984, his company had earned $6 million. Dell was off and running, leading his company to enormous growth year after year.
The envy of CEOs everywhere
By early 1985, at the age of twenty, Dell had thirty employees working for him. During the summer of that year, the company began producing the Turbo PC, its first computer made entirely from scratch, rather than a customized version of another company's machine. In 1987 Dell changed the name of the company from PCs Unlimited to Dell Computer Corporation. At that time he began a program offered by no one else in the industry: rather than having customers bring broken-down computers to a store for repair, Dell Computer would pay house calls to service its customers' PCs. In Success magazine, Dell pointed out that this offer came out of necessity rather than an ingenious plan to outperform competitors: "That was a pretty important plus because we didn't have any stores," he recalled. During 1988 Dell began offering the public the opportunity to buy stock in his company. Just four years after the company had begun, sales reached 



$159 million. Dell found success in his personal life at that time, too; he married Susan Lieberman in October of 1989. Residing in Austin's hill country, the couple has four children.
A Brief History of Personal Computers
For many people, it is nearly impossible to imagine life without computers, yet it was not long ago that computers were a rare item, seen perhaps by the average citizen only on television. Mainframe computers of the 1950s took up entire rooms; minicomputers were the size of refrigerators; and microcomputers, which eventually became known as personal computers (PCs), could fit on a desktop. Today, many varieties of wireless computers can be held in the palm of a hand.


In the early 1970s, consumer demand for home and business computers began to develop. About that time, Ed Roberts, owner Micro Instrumentation Telemetry Systems (MITS), worked with engineers to develop the MITS Altair 8800. This computer was sold as a kit for $400; it had to be assembled by the consumer, who also had to write the software. In spite of these hurdles, MITS was flooded with orders for the Altair in 1975. Soon after the Altair hit the market, two young programmers approached Roberts to inform him of an existing software program that could be adapted to work on the Altair. These programmers, Paul Allen and Bill Gates, then a first-year student at Harvard University, created a version of the program, called BASIC, for the Altair. Later, MITS went out of business, and Gates and Allen founded Microsoft, the global software giant.
In about 1973 Xerox developed the Alto, a computer featuring a mouse and a point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI). The company never marketed this computer to the public, however, as Xerox management could not envision how consumers would use it. Computers that featured a GUI, including Apple's Lisa and Macintosh models, did not become widespread for another ten years. In 1975 Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, two computer hobbyists, began working together to build their own PC using inexpensive parts. The following year they founded Apple Computers and released the Apple I. In 1977 Apple Computers released the Apple II, considered by many to be the first true personal computer. This PC, which sold for just under $1,300, featured color graphics and a disk drive. Apple's primary competitor was Commodore, which released the Commodore PET in early 1977. The PET had features similar to Apple II but was sold for half the price. Commodore also created the Commodore 64, which featured a good deal of memory and color graphics and used inexpensive floppy disks for storing files. The Commodore 64 became the best-selling PC of all time.
Computers were catching on with a small segment of the population, but it was not until the invention of spreadsheet software in 1979 that many businesses saw the benefits of using PCs. With the development of VisiCalc, a program invented by Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston, businesses calculating their finances could use computer software to perform in a few minutes tasks that had previously taken hours. When a user changed one number in a column, the software automatically calculated the change to every other number on the sheet, changes that otherwise had to be done by hand. During that same year, Wordstar, a groundbreaking word-processing software, was released and became immediately successful. With Wordstar and similar software, users could create, edit, save, and print documents using their computers.
With the release of the IBM PC—the computer credited with popularizing the phrase "personal computer"—in August of 1981, the PC came to be seen as a vital business tool and a machine that could be useful to general consumers as well. The IBM PC was designed with an open architecture, meaning that similar computers built by other companies could use IBM software. Microsoft, first with the development of MS-DOS and later with Windows, became the primary developer of operating systems—the programs that run every other program on a computer—for IBM-type PCs. While Apple had popularized computers with graphical user interfaces, Microsoft became a major GUI player with the release of its first Windows operating system in 1985. Developments in the personal computer since that time have been less dramatic than in the early years, focusing primarily on increasing memory, speed, and portability, decreasing the machine's size, and improving the quality of the GUI.
Dell Computer grew at an astronomical rate, and with that growth came problems. During 1993 the industry as a whole was suffering a slowdown, with consumers buying fewer PCs. Dell Computer was suffering from numerous management problems. The company scrapped plans for a new laptop computer when it realized the product was outmatched by its competitors. An attempt to sell Dell computers through retail outlets like Best Buy and Wal-Mart had failed. Recognizing that his company needed to be overhauled, Dell brought in several new high-level managers with years of experience in high-tech industries. Many of the day-to-day responsibilities were delegated to these trusted executives, leaving Dell to concentrate on the company's 



overall vision and strategy. The reorganization helped the company regain its footing, a triumph marked by the hugely successful release of a new laptop computer, the Latitude XP.
Many business analysts have suggested that one of Dell's secrets to success has been his ability to remain focused on his winning business model: sell directly to consumers, keep prices low and quality high, and offer solid technological support to customers. Within thirty-six hours of a customer ordering a PC by phone or through the company's Web site, a custom-built Dell computer is shipped. To keep its costs down, the company maintains an extremely low inventory of computer parts, at any given time housing only enough components to fulfill a few days' worth of orders. This strategy not only reduces the need for warehouse space but also ensures that, in the rapidly changing computer industry, Dell always has in stock the newest parts its suppliers 



offer. Michael Dell has been able to maintain his company's steady growth rate by selling not just to individual consumers but also to large corporations, educational institutions, and government agencies. The company has expanded its line of products in recent years to include network servers (powerful machines that run computer networks), storage systems, handheld computers, and printers—an expansion signified by its 2003 name change from Dell Computer to Dell, Inc. Dell has extended its customer base throughout the world, most notably into Asia, capturing 7 percent of the PC market in China by 2004.
During the summer of 2004, Dell, who had been chairman and chief executive officer, or CEO, of his company, relinquished the CEO position, passing that title on to Kevin Rollins, his former president and chief operating officer. In a 2004 interview with Fortune magazine, Dell and Rollins stated that the change in their job titles did not signal any major shift in the way the company would be run. Dell declared: "We run the business together, and we're going to continue." Since its beginnings in 1984, the company has set a rapid pace for growth; it took Dell just twenty years to surpass industry leader Hewlett-Packard to hold the largest share of the computer-making market. A 2001 article in The Economist summed up Dell's accomplishment, stating, "There is hardly a more admired boss than Mr. Dell, the man who turned the commodity business of PC making into a goldmine by doing things differently."

Michael Dell
Born: February 23, 1965Houston, TexasFounder, Dell Computer Corporation 
As a teenager, Michael Dell hit upon a new way to sell and manufacture computers. He turned this idea into a working business and started his own company before he even made it to college. For several years, he won national attention because of the great success he enjoyed at such a young age. Over time, however, people began to see that Dell was more than just a "wonder boy," he was a pioneer in the fast-paced world of technology. By 1992, Dell was the youngest chief executive officer (CEO) ever to lead a company in the Fortune 500, a listing of the top U.S. corporations. By 1999, he was the fifth-richest person in the United States.
"We dive headfirst into change. Part of that is because it's all we've ever known, but it's also because today, it's a must.… To thrive on change, you must understand how to give in to it, flow with it, and derive strength from it. There's no other way."
Selling Stamps, Newspapers, and Computers
Michael Dell was born on February 23, 1965, in Houston, Texas. His father Alexander was an orthodontist and his mother Lorraine was a stockbroker. Dell's parents hoped he would follow his father and study medicine. From an early age, however, Dell had an interest in business. Eager to speed up his education, Dell sent for information that would prepare him

for a test that would give him his high school diploma. He was eight years old at the time.
Dell did stay in school, but spent a good deal of his time looking for ways to earn money. At age twelve, he started a business that sold stamps by mail to collectors. He earned $2,000. In high school, Dell sold subscriptions for a local newspaper. He figured that people just married or who had just bought new homes in Houston would be likely customers. So, Dell hired friends to help him check courthouse records for newly married couples, and he scanned the listings of new home purchases. By selling to those two specific groups, Dell made $18,000 in one year. His income amazed his history teacher—she made less that year than Dell did.
Dell was interested in computers, and he soon realized that selling them was a gold mine. The parts inside a typical IBM PC only cost about $700. Retailers bought the machines for $2,000 and sold them for $3,000. Dell figured that someone could make money building their own computers and selling them directly to customers, at a much lower price than the retailers charged. Dell began buying machines, adding new parts, and selling them locally. He continued this business in 1983, when he began taking classes in Austin at the University of Texas.
According to an 1991 article in Forbes, young Michael Dell once said his goal was to "make more money than any other kid in school." By the time he was seventeen years old, he had earned enough money to pay cash for a BMW automobile.
From College to Corporation
At his first apartment in Austin, Dell's business did not sit well with his roommates. They dumped his computer parts against the door and told him to move out. In November 1983, Dell's parents learned about his computer business and that he was skipping classes. His father asked what he wanted to do with his life. Dell's reply, as he recounts in Direct from Dell was: "I want to compete with IBM!" To satisfy his parents, Dell tried to quit the computer business; he lasted only a few weeks. "I knew in my heart," Dell later wrote, "that I was onto a fabulous business opportunity that I could not let pass me by."
Dell officially launched his own computer company, PC's Limited. A few months later, he incorporated as Dell Computer Corporation, investing the $1,000 minimum required by Texas law. Before the end of 1984, he hired a local engineer to build a computer for him, instead of reselling upgraded IBM machines. At the end of the fiscal (financial) year of 1986, sales of Dell-produced machines hit $34 million.


As a new company, DCC had to win customers with more than low prices. To overcome the reluctance to buy a computer by mail, Dell offered a 30-day money-back guarantee. He also made sure the company used the best parts available. And he encouraged his engineers to build faster machines than IBM or other competitors. As Dell computers won more attention from PC magazines, sales continued to rise.
Despite their early success, Dell and his company were not perfect. The company bought more chips than it needed right before prices for these computer "brains" fell. "For the first time," Dell says in Direct from Dell, "I started thinking I might be in over my head." Still, the young CEO survived the crisis and learned from his mistakes. He told Forbes in 1991, "I'm guilty of doing too much, and I'm guilty of not seeing mistakes coming. What I'm not guilty of is making the same mistake twice." During the early 1990s, Dell hired several experienced executives to run his company's day-to-day operations, freeing him to focus on long-term strategy.
During one tough stretch at the company, Dell workers attended a rally wearing army fatigues—a sign of their determination to keep fighting. Dell joked with his employees, telling them his daughter's first words were "Daddy, kill Compaq. Daddy, kill IBM."
A Computer Fortune
By the late 1990s, Dell's shares in his company made him worth $16 billion. Employees and investors who had bought stock early on also became rich; in Texas, they were sometimes called Dellionaires. Dell appeared on the cover of national magazines and spoke often about his direct sales model, which had so successfully cut out the middleman and made DCC a world leader in computers. Dell, however, was

reluctant to discuss his wife, their four children, and their private life. In 1995, the media wanted to talk about the 33,000square-foot home Dell was building outside Austin. He seemed bothered by the attention, telling Fortune, "Fame isn't everything it's cracked up to be."
Mort Topfer: Dell's Right-Hand Man
In 1994, when Michael Dell persuaded Mort Topfer to leave Motorola and come work for him, Topfer only planned to stay a few months. Topfer was fifty-seven, and he and his wife had just built a retirement home in Las Vegas, Nevada. Serving as vice chairman at Dell, however, proved a welcome challenge, and Topfer stayed in that position for five years. He helped Dell realize a prediction he made to PC Week soon after joining the company: "We are going to drive Dell to be the top 2 or 3, and maybe even No. 1 in the business."
Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1936, Topfer earned a degree in physics from Brooklyn College, then took a job at RCA Laboratories, where he worked in both research and management. In 1971, he joined Motorola, where he eventually became president of the company's Land Mobile Products Sector. Dell and Topfer first met in January 1994, and the two men discussed their business philosophies for several months before Topfer came to Dell as vice chairman. In that role, Topfer handled the company's planning and manufacturing. Topfer and Dell worked together to split DCC's market into smaller segments, targeting specific products to meet each segment's unique needs.
Topfer also served as a mentor to Michael Dell, helping him cope with the demands of running a multibillion-dollar company. Even after Topfer stepped down as vice chairman in 1999, he remained one of Dell's closest advisers. He also stayed on the board of directors. In 2000, Topfer founded a new company with his sons Alan and Richard. Castletop Capital manages a $60 million fund to invest in small technology firms, mostly in Texas. Topfer is also active in civic affairs in his adopted hometown of Austin. He and his wife have given millions of dollars to local charities.
For a time, Dell was also questioned about his lack of charitable giving. In 1995, that changed when his company launched a foundation. Four years later, Dell and his wife Susan started their own foundation. The company's charitable giving focuses on children, particularly health and education. Dell's personal donations—numbering in the tens of millions of dollars—have gone to Texas libraries, theaters, and other organizations.
Observers say that Dell has matured since he began his company as a nineteen-year-old college student. Unlike some entrepreneurs, he has been able to manage the huge corporation that grew from simple roots. Part of his skill was hiring the right people. One Dell executive told Texas Monthly in 1999 that Dell has another important trait: "His willingness to listen is unbelievable. He detects insight, mines it, absorbs it all, and immediately puts it to use." Just like earlier great "self-made" business owners, Dell has inspired a new generation of Americans to follow their dream and take risks when they come across a new idea.

DELL, MICHAEL
Michael S. Dell is the founder, CEO, and chairman of Dell Computer Corp., the largest personal computer (PC) vendor in the world and also the leading commercial seller of PCs via the Internet. Dell has served his firm—which boasted sales in excess of $32 billion and employed more than 38,000 individuals in early 2001—as CEO since its inception in 1984. His stint is the lengthiest of any CEO at a leading American computer firm. While PCs, half of which are sold on the Internet, account for roughly 55 percent of sales, Dell has worked to move his firm into the more lucrative Internet-based server and storage markets since the late 1990s. He retains a 12-percent stake in the company.
While a student at the University of Texas, Dell began selling IBM compatible computers from his dorm room. He bought parts at wholesale prices, constructed the machines on his own, and sold them to bargain PC shoppers. The success of his venture prompted Dell to quit school in April of 1984 and establish his own business, Dell Computer Corp., with $1,000 in capital. Dell advertised his low-cost custom built PCs in computer magazines, targeting savvy PCs users. Customers were able to call an 800 number to places orders, and Dell shipped completed PCs directly to customers. What set Dell's firm apart from competitors was his practice of direct selling. The elimination of middlemen allowed Dell to price his computers well below market prices.
To facilitate his firm's rapid growth, Dell hired investment banking executive E. Lee Walker as president in 1986. The following year, he launched an expansion of manufacturing facilities and developed a national customer support center. Dell also began offering on-site services for Dell products. International expansion was initiated by the creation of an office in the United Kingdom. The firm also published a catalog for the first time and expanded its sales force. In 1988 Dell completed a reorganization that was designed to facilitate improved customer service. New PC launches included 100, 200, and 310 models. That year, Dell took his company public, offering 3.5 million shares at $8.50 each. Dell's firm also began offering leasing options to customers and furthered international expansion by establishing units in Canada and West Germany. In 1989, Dell became one of the first firms to license the UNIX trademark from

AT&T Corp. The firm also began selling several new Epson dot matrix printer models and opened a unit in France. Record sales were marred by a 64-percent plunge in earnings, which Dell blamed on higher costs and an inventory glut.
Early in the 1990s, Dell intensified international expansion, overseeing the establishment of various operations in Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic, Belgium, Finland, Spain, Norway, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Mexico. Dell was the first personal computer manufacturer to offer applications software installation as a free standard service option. Copycat competitor Gateway 2000 usurped Dell as the top direct seller of PCs in the U.S. in 1992. To express his determination to reduce expenses at his firm, Dell reduced his pay by five percent.
Sales exceeded $2 billion in the mid-1990s. By then, Dell had grown into the world's sixth-largest desktop PC maker and seventh-largest notebook PC maker. The firm's success was due in large part to its ability to use the Internet to take and fill customers orders quickly and inexpensively. According to a May 2001 BusinessWeek Online article, "Michael Dell was e-business before e-business was cool. During the boom in technology spending, he used the Internet to reach out to customers and sell $50 million worth of computers a day." Dell's business model, which allowed for easy tracking of customer purchases, also allowed the firm to keep inventory at a minimum.
Wanting to reduce his company's reliance on PCs—which were being discounted by many rivals—Dell pushed his firm into the server market in 1996. Within two years, servers accounted for 16 percent of the company's $12 billion revenue, and within three years, Dell was second only to Compaq Computer Corp. in U.S. server sales. In 1999, when competitors began cutting PC prices further, Dell responded with its first PC under $1,000. That year, Business Week listed Dell among its top 25 managers for the third consecutive year. Stock grew roughly 140 percent, a rate it had maintained for the past four years.
As the PC market slowed in 2000, Dell began working to reposition his firm as a provider of Internet technology, focusing on servers and storage systems similar to those offered by Sun Microsystems Inc. The firm also began offering various Internet services such as Web hosting and wireless access to the Internet. Sales growth slowed nearly 10 percent to 38.5 percent, and stock prices began to falter, prompting Dell to reduce his bonus by 36 percent. Despite these troubles, Dell dethroned Compaq Computer as the leader in PC sales in April of 2001. That year, Chief Executive magazine named Dell CEO of the Year, adding to his list of previous awards, which included PC magazine's Man of the Year and Inc. magazine's Entrepreneur of the Year.

DELL, MICHAEL 
Michael Dell (1965–) started Dell Computer from his dormitory room in 1984, when he was a college freshman. In only 14 years, Dell's revenues zoomed to $12 billion and the company became the third-largest computer maker in the world.
Born in 1965, Michael Dell appeared destined to be an entrepreneur from his early youth. When he was only 12 years old, he worked as a water boy and dishwasher at a Chinese restaurant and saved enough money to start a stamp collection. He turned the collection into $2000 via a stamp-trading enterprise he operated through the mail. In high school, while he worked as a newspaper delivery boy for the Houston Post, he expanded his roster of subscription clients by obtaining mailing lists of marriage license applicants. He then mailed personalized letters offering two weeks free service to newlywed couples. The enterprising teenager's paper route made between $18,000 and $20,000, which he used to buy his first BMW.
Dell's parents hoped their son would become a doctor. His father Alexander was an orthodontist. But soon after Dell entered the University of Texas in 1983, he was operating a business adding components to remaindered IBM and IBM-clone computers and selling them for a profit either by mail order or door-to-door on campus.
The summer following his freshman year at Texas, Dell was able to devote his full attention to his rapidly growing computer business. In the final month of his summer vacation he sold $180,000 worth of personal computers and convinced his parents to agree he could quit school. He incorporated his company, PCs Unlimited, and began operating out of a storefront. By the end of 1984, the company's sales reached $6 million.
By early 1985, PCs Unlimited had 30 employees, and in July of that year the company introduced its own computer, the Turbo PC. By the end of its second year of business, company sales reached $34 million. The company was renamed Dell Computer Company in 1987, and went public in 1988. By 1993 sales surpassed $2 billion.
Dell built his business by adhering to a few basic concepts. First, he realized that if he bought parts directly from suppliers and assembled computers himself, he could sell the finished products more cheaply. Dell also eliminated the middleman—the retail dealer—by selling directly to the consumer. This was another way to lower the price of individual units. He advertised in computer trade magazines and established phone numbers that customers could call to order a computer. Competitors scoffed at the idea that prospective buyers would make such a major purchase without first seeing the product. Dell, however, believed that experienced computer users would be comfortable ordering equipment over the phone or through the Internet, and those buyers comprised the market he was seeking to capture. Direct sales also appealed to corporations and government organizations, which comprised 90 percent of Dell's customers.
Dell backed up his direct sales model by guaranteeing that customer service on Dell PCs would be first-rate. He also made a practice of never manufacturing a computer until it had been ordered, thereby eliminating backlogs of unsold merchandise. Finally, because each component ordered indicated a user preference, he used customer orders as an automatic form of market research.
The path of Dell's success was not without its twists and turns. In the early 1990s the company tried to introduce a high-end product, the Olympic, but it proved to have little customer appeal. Dell canceled the line entirely, revamped the way the company approached new products, and used the best of Olympic's new technology in other products. As Dell wrote in his 1999 autobiography, Direct from Dell : "Thanks to our customers, we turned a potentially disastrous mistake into a great opportunity, and pushed the company to the forefront of technological development."
After steady growth over 14 quarters, Dell Computer posted two consecutive quarterly losses in 1993. Dell moved quickly to bring in experienced managers to reorganize the company's operations. The company again began to focus on the bottom line. By the end of 1993 Dell Computer was again turning a hefty profit, and in the next three years its revenues grew 50 percent a year. By the end of 1997 (after 16 consecutive quarters of growth in revenues and earnings) the company expanded into the server business to better compete in the corporate market. Michael Dell led his company in an international expansion during the late 1990s.

Coldplay Biography
From the time of British-bred sensation Coldplay's first major-label release in the summer of 2000, music journalists have written that the band doesn't quite fit in with the current popular-music landscape. Their soulful, haunting, intelligent songs have set them apart from bubblegum pop stars, aggressive rap artists, and what Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly described as "the hordes of thuggish, blustering nu-metal bands or Identikit junior-league punk outfits." Much has been made in Britain's music press of lead singer Chris Martin's clean-living ways and general distaste for alcohol—a far cry from the lifestyle of a stereotypical rock star.

Ellen DeGeneres Biography
Ellen DeGeneres is one of the most popular contemporary comedians and the host of a successful daytime talk show.

Michael Dell Biography
In 1984, as a first-year college student in Austin, Texas, Michael Dell borrowed $1,000 from his parents to start a computer accessories business. He began by selling kits to help customers upgrade their personal computers, establishing a business model his company, Dell, Inc., still follows today: sell directly to consumers, eliminating the middle step of a retail store or a distributor, and hold on to far more of the profits. 
Luisa Diogo Biography
Located in southeastern Africa, the tiny country of Mozambique is one of the poorest in the world, with approximately 70 percent of the population living below the poverty line. It is also a country frequently devastated by drought and floods, and in the early 2000s it was still recovering from a civil war that rocked the nation for nearly seventeen years (1975–92).

Hilary Duff Biography
Young teens everywhere first came to know Hilary Duff as Lizzie McGuire, the title character of the Disney Channel show that aired from 2001 until 2003. As Lizzie, Duff played an awkward, slightly clumsy junior high schooler—a bit of a stretch for the confident, multitalented actress.

Michael Eisner Biography
When Michael Eisner came on board as Disney's chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer, or CEO, in 1984, many observers wondered if he could handle the business end of running an entertainment company. In his previous jobs as an executive at ABC and as president and CEO of Paramount Pictures, a major Hollywood film studio, Eisner had developed a reputation as a creative genius, an idea man. 
Olafur Eliasson Biography
Olafur Eliasson is not a traditional artist. His best-known works cannot be hung on a wall and do not involve paint or a camera or sculpting materials. 
Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott Biography

His works are classified in a number of different genres, from horror to fantasy to science fiction, and often he jumps from one genre to another within a single work. 
Sonia Gandhi Biography
The story should have had a fairy-tale ending: a beautiful young girl meets her handsome Prince Charming, has two children, and lives happily every after. In 1968, however, when Sonia Maino married Rajiv Gandhi of India, the fairy tale was only half realized. 
Frank Gehry Biography
Over the years many adjectives have been used to describe Frank Gehry's creations, including edgy, forward-looking, astonishing, and weird. Anything but ordinary, Gehry challenged the mainstream in the 1970s and 1980s when he used everyday materials such as cardboard to make furniture, and chain-link fencing to construct buildings.

Early life[edit]
Michael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, to a Jewish family whose surname reflects the translation into English of the original German/Yiddish Thal ("valley" or "dale [q.v.]"; modern common-noun spelling Tal) upon the family's immigration to the United States.[9] The son of Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker,[10] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist, Michael Dell attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[11] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight. In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[12]
Dell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[13] He got a job as a dishwasher at age 12 and was quickly promoted to maitre d'.[14]Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the Houston Post in the summer. While making cold calls, he noted that the people most likely to purchase subscriptions were those in the process of establishing permanent geographic and social presence. He then hired some friends who scoured local court records so he could target this demographic group by collecting names from marriage and mortgage applications. He then segmented those leads by the size of mortgage, calling on those with the highest mortgages first. Dell earned $18,000 that year, exceeding the annual income of his history and economics teacher.[15]
Business career[edit]

While a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers[16] in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building. He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[17][18][19]
In January 1984, Dell banked on his conviction that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel. In January 1984, Dell registered his company as "PC's Limited". Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 in upgraded PCs, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as "Dell Computer Corporation" and relocated it to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few order takers, a few more people to fulfill them, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff "consisting of three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[20][21]
In 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in Fortune magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[22] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[23] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, passing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitor's sales were shrinking.[24]
In 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[25] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[26]
In 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders, took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the private company.[27]
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[6][7] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[8]
Penalty[edit]
In July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[28] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each, former CFO James Schneider to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[28]
Accolades[edit]
Accolades for Dell include "Entrepreneur of the Year" (at age 24) from Inc. magazine;[29] "Top CEO in American Business" from Worth magazine; "CEO of the Year" from Financial World, Industry Week and Chief Executive magazines. Dell also received the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[30]
Affiliations[edit]
Dell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council, and the governing board of the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, India. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[31]
Writings[edit]
Dell's 1999 book, Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry (by HarperBusiness), is an account of his early life, his company's founding, growth and missteps, as well as lessons learned. The book was written in collaboration with Catherine Fredman.[32]
Wealth and personal life[edit]
Forbes estimates Dell's net worth as of February 2017 at $20.8 billion.[33] Dell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989 in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.[34][35][36]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to compliment the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.[37] In 2013, the foundation provided an additional $50 million commitment to establish the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin. [38] Since 1999, the MSDF has committed $1.23 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa. [39]
By 2010, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa[40] Today the foundation has over $466 million assets under management.[41]
In 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.[42]
In 2012, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation committed $50 million for medical education. The Dell Medical School began enrolling students in 2016.[43]
In 2014, he donated $1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.[44]

Early life[edit]
Michael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, to a Jewish family whose surname reflects the translation into English of the original German/Yiddish Thal ("valley" or "dale [q.v.]"; modern common-noun spelling Tal) upon the family's immigration to the United States.[9] The son of Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker,[10] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist, Michael Dell attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[11] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight. In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[12]
Dell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[13] He got a job as a dishwasher at age 12 and was quickly promoted to maitre d'.[14]Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the Houston Post in the summer. While making cold calls, he noted that the people most likely to purchase subscriptions were those in the process of establishing permanent geographic and social presence. He then hired some friends who scoured local court records so he could target this demographic group by collecting names from marriage and mortgage applications. He then segmented those leads by the size of mortgage, calling on those with the highest mortgages first. Dell earned $18,000 that year, exceeding the annual income of his history and economics teacher.[15]
Business career[edit]

While a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers[16] in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building. He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[17][18][19]
In January 1984, Dell banked on his conviction that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel. In January 1984, Dell registered his company as "PC's Limited". Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 in upgraded PCs, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as "Dell Computer Corporation" and relocated it to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few order takers, a few more people to fulfill them, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff "consisting of three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[20][21]
In 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in Fortune magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[22] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[23] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, passing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitor's sales were shrinking.[24]
In 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[25] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[26]
In 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders, took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the private company.[27]
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[6][7] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[8]
Penalty[edit]
In July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[28] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each, former CFO James Schneider to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[28]
Accolades[edit]
Accolades for Dell include "Entrepreneur of the Year" (at age 24) from Inc. magazine;[29] "Top CEO in American Business" from Worth magazine; "CEO of the Year" from Financial World, Industry Week and Chief Executive magazines. Dell also received the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[30]
Affiliations[edit]
Dell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council, and the governing board of the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, India. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[31]
Writings[edit]
Dell's 1999 book, Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry (by HarperBusiness), is an account of his early life, his company's founding, growth and missteps, as well as lessons learned. The book was written in collaboration with Catherine Fredman.[32]
Wealth and personal life[edit]
Forbes estimates Dell's net worth as of February 2017 at $20.8 billion.[33] Dell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989 in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.[34][35][36]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to compliment the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.[37] In 2013, the foundation provided an additional $50 million commitment to establish the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin. [38] Since 1999, the MSDF has committed $1.23 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa. [39]
By 2010, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa[40] Today the foundation has over $466 million assets under management.[41]
In 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.[42]
In 2012, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation committed $50 million for medical education. The Dell Medical School began enrolling students in 2016.[43]
In 2014, he donated $1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.[44]

In 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[25] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[26]
In 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders, took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the private company.[27]
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[6][7] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[8]
Penalty[edit]
In July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[28] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each, former CFO James Schneider to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[28]
Accolades[edit]
Accolades for Dell include "Entrepreneur of the Year" (at age 24) from Inc. magazine;[29] "Top CEO in American Business" from Worth magazine; "CEO of the Year" from Financial World, Industry Week and Chief Executive magazines. Dell also received the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[30]

He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[31]

Dell's 1999 book, Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry (by HarperBusiness), is an account of his early life, his company's founding, growth and missteps, as well as lessons learned. The book was written in collaboration with Catherine Fredman.[32]
Wealth and personal life[edit]
Forbes estimates Dell's net worth as of February 2017 at $20.8 billion.[33] Dell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989 in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.[34][35][36]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to compliment the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.[37] In 2013, the foundation provided an additional $50 million commitment to establish the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin. [38] Since 1999, the MSDF has committed $1.23 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa. [39]
By 2010, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa[40] Today the foundation has over $466 million assets under management.[41]
In 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.[42]

Early life[edit]
Michael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, to a Jewish family whose surname reflects the translation into English of the original German/Yiddish Thal ("valley" or "dale [q.v.]"; modern common-noun spelling Tal) upon the family's immigration to the United States.[9] The son of Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker,[10] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist, Michael Dell attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[11] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight. In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[12]
Dell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[13] He got a job as a dishwasher at age 12 and was quickly promoted to maitre d'.[14]Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the Houston Post in the summer. While making cold calls, he noted that the people most likely to purchase subscriptions were those in the process of establishing permanent geographic and social presence. He then hired some friends who scoured local court records so he could target this demographic group by collecting names from marriage and mortgage applications. He then segmented those leads by the size of mortgage, calling on those with the highest mortgages first. Dell earned $18,000 that year, exceeding the annual income of his history and economics teacher.[15]
Business career[edit]

While a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers[16] in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building. He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[17][18][19]
In January 1984, Dell banked on his conviction that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel. In January 1984, Dell registered his company as "PC's Limited". Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 in upgraded PCs, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as "Dell Computer Corporation" and relocated it to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few order takers, a few more people to fulfill them, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff "consisting of three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[20][21]
In 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in Fortune magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[22] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[23] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, passing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitor's sales were shrinking.[24]
In 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[25] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[26]

Dell also received the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[30]

Dell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council, and the governing board of the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, India. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[31]

      In 1984, as a first-year college student in Austin, Texas, Michael Dell
      borrowed $1,000 from his parents to start a computer accessories business.
      He began by selling kits to help customers upgrade their personal
      computers, establishing a business model his company, Dell, Inc., still
      follows today: sell directly to consumers, eliminating the middle step of
      a retail store or a distributor, and hold on to far more of the profits.
      In just two decades, Dell's company grew to massive proportions,
      with more than 47,000 employees and annual revenues of more than $40
      billion. Dell himself was squarely at the top of 
      
        Forbes
      
       magazine's list of the ten wealthiest Americans under the age of
      forty. He has been praised as a visionary and an innovator, but he has
      also earned admiration for being a stable, consistent leader. In an
      industry that changes rapidly, in terms of both technology and personnel,
      Dell has stood out from his peers by remaining at the helm of his company
      from its struggling early days to its current status as a major player in
      the global field of information technology (IT).
    



      A businessman from the beginning
    

      Michael Saul Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, Texas. While he displayed
      intelligence and ingenuity from an early age, he had little interest in
      school. At the age of eight, he sent away for information on taking a high
      school equivalency exam, which, if he passed, would make him a high school
      graduate without having to endure the remaining years of school. His
      parents insisted he stay in the classroom, and Dell invested his
      considerable creative energy in after-school ventures. When he was twelve
      years old, he operated a mail-order trading business for stamps and
      baseball cards, earning $2,000. At the age of fourteen, Dell got his first
      computer, an Apple II and soon realized that he had a knack for taking
      computers apart and putting them back together. While in high school, Dell
      took a job delivering newspapers for the 
      
        Houston Post.
      
       His aggressive selling strategies—which included obtaining mailing
      lists of newly married people, offering them free trial subscriptions, and
      then following up with phone calls—resulted in earnings of $18,000.
      Not one to hold on to his spoils, Dell spent the money on a new BMW.
    


        "What people have never understood is that we're not like
        other companies."
      


      In 1983, when Dell entered his freshman year at the University of Texas at
      Austin, his parents hoped he would become a doctor, but Dell's
      skills lay elsewhere. In examining the personal computer, or PC, industry,
      he noticed an opportunity to sell PCs for less, as he explained to Richard
      Murphy of 
      
        Success
      
       magazine: "I saw that you'd buy a PC for about $3,000, and
      inside that PC was about $600 worth of parts. IBM would buy most of these
      parts from other companies, assemble them, and sell the computer to a
      dealer for $2,000. Then the dealer, who knew very little about selling or
      supporting computers, would sell it for $3,000, which was even more
      outrageous." Dell realized that he could assemble computer parts,
      skip the step of selling to a dealer, and go directly to the consumer.
      That way the consumer 
       could buy the product for less, and Dell held on to every penny of the
      profits. Dell thus combined his knowledge of computers with his
      well-developed business sense and began his own business, assembling
      upgrade kits for personal computers.
    

      In a 1999 article in 
      
        Fortune,
      
       Dell recalled operating his new business out of his University of Texas
      dorm room on the twenty-seventh floor: "People would ride up to the
      27th floor with their computers. I'd put in some memory or a disk
      drive, they'd pay me, and I'd send them on their
      way." His earnings soon reached about $25,000 a month. By the
      summer of 1984, after one year at the university, Dell had decided that he
      needed to focus all of his time on his business, and he dropped out of
      college. His company, then called PCs Unlimited, began building PCs,
      starting with parts from such established computer companies as IBM and
      Compaq and adding elements to make the products unique. Dell continued to
      sell directly to consumers, a strategy that paid off in vast sums: by the
      end of 1984, his company had earned $6 million. Dell was off and running,
      leading his company to enormous growth year after year.

      The envy of CEOs everywhere
    

      By early 1985, at the age of twenty, Dell had thirty employees working for
      him. During the summer of that year, the company began producing the Turbo
      PC, its first computer made entirely from scratch, rather than a
      customized version of another company's machine. In 1987 Dell
      changed the name of the company from PCs Unlimited to Dell Computer
      Corporation. At that time he began a program offered by no one else in the
      industry: rather than having customers bring broken-down computers to a
      store for repair, Dell Computer would pay house calls to service its
      customers' PCs. In 
      
        Success
      
       magazine, Dell pointed out that this offer came out of necessity rather
      than an ingenious plan to outperform competitors: "That was a
      pretty important plus because we didn't have any stores," he
      recalled. During 1988 Dell began offering the public the opportunity to
      buy stock in his company. Just four years after the company had begun,
      sales reached 
       $159 million. Dell found success in his personal life at that time, too;
      he married Susan Lieberman in October of 1989. Residing in Austin's
      hill country, the couple has four children.
    


        A Brief History of Personal Computers
      

        For many people, it is nearly impossible to imagine life without
        computers, yet it was not long ago that computers were a rare item, seen
        perhaps by the average citizen only on television. Mainframe computers
        of the 1950s took up entire rooms; minicomputers were the size of
        refrigerators; and microcomputers, which eventually became known as
        personal computers (PCs), could fit on a desktop. Today, many varieties
        of wireless computers can be held in the palm of a hand.
      

        In the early 1970s, consumer demand for home and business computers
        began to develop. About that time, Ed Roberts, owner Micro
        Instrumentation Telemetry Systems (MITS), worked with engineers to
        develop the MITS Altair 8800. This computer was sold as a kit for $400;
        it had to be assembled by the consumer, who also had to write the
        software. In spite of these hurdles, MITS was flooded with orders for
        the Altair in 1975. Soon after the Altair hit the market, two young
        programmers approached Roberts to inform him of an existing software
        program that could be adapted to work on the Altair. These programmers,
        Paul Allen and Bill Gates, then a first-year student at Harvard
        University, created a version of the program, called BASIC, for the
        Altair. Later, MITS went out of business, and Gates and Allen founded
        Microsoft, the global software giant.
      

        In about 1973 Xerox developed the Alto, a computer featuring a mouse and
        a point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI). The company never
        marketed this computer to the public, however, as Xerox management could
        not envision how consumers would use it. Computers that featured a GUI,
        including Apple's Lisa and Macintosh models, did not become
        widespread for another ten years. In 1975 Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs,
        two computer hobbyists, began working together to build their own PC
        using inexpensive parts. The following year they founded Apple Computers
        and released the Apple I. In 1977 Apple Computers released the Apple II,
        considered by many to be the first true personal computer. This PC,
        which sold for just under $1,300, featured color graphics and a disk
        drive. Apple's primary competitor was Commodore, which released
        the Commodore PET in early 1977. The PET had features similar to Apple
        II but was sold for half the price. Commodore also created the Commodore
        64, which featured a good deal of memory and color graphics and used
        inexpensive floppy disks for storing files. The Commodore 64 became the
        best-selling PC of all time.
      

        Computers were catching on with a small segment of the population, but
        it was not until the invention of spreadsheet software in 1979 that many
        businesses saw the benefits of using PCs. With the development of
        VisiCalc, a program invented by Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston,
        businesses calculating their finances could use computer software to
        perform in a few minutes tasks that had previously taken hours. When a
        user changed one number in a column, the software automatically
        calculated the change to every other number on the sheet, changes that
        otherwise had to be done by hand. During that same year, Wordstar, a
        groundbreaking word-processing software, was released and became
        immediately successful. With Wordstar and similar software, users could
        create, edit, save, and print documents using their computers.
      

        With the release of the IBM PC—the computer credited with
        popularizing the phrase "personal computer"—in
        August of 1981, the PC came to be seen as a vital business tool and a
        machine that could be useful to general consumers as well. The IBM PC
        was designed with an open architecture, meaning that similar computers
        built by other companies could use IBM software. Microsoft, first with
        the development of MS-DOS and later with Windows, became the primary
        developer of operating systems—the programs that run every other
        program on a computer—for IBM-type PCs. While Apple had
        popularized computers with graphical user interfaces, Microsoft became a
        major GUI player with the release of its first Windows operating system
        in 1985. Developments in the personal computer since that time have been
        less dramatic than in the early years, focusing primarily on increasing
        memory, speed, and portability, decreasing the machine's size,
        and improving the quality of the GUI.
      


      Dell Computer grew at an astronomical rate, and with that growth came
      problems. During 1993 the industry as a whole was suffering a slowdown,
      with consumers buying fewer PCs. Dell Computer was suffering from numerous
      management problems. The company scrapped plans for a new laptop computer
      when it realized the product was outmatched by its competitors. An attempt
      to sell Dell computers through retail outlets like Best Buy and Wal-Mart
      had failed. Recognizing that his company needed to be overhauled, Dell
      brought in several new high-level managers with years of experience in
      high-tech industries. Many of the day-to-day responsibilities were
      delegated to these trusted executives, leaving Dell to concentrate on the
      company's 
       overall vision and strategy. The reorganization helped the company regain
      its footing, a triumph marked by the hugely successful release of a new
      laptop computer, the Latitude XP.
    

      Many business analysts have suggested that one of Dell's secrets to
      success has been his ability to remain focused on his winning business
      model: sell directly to consumers, keep prices low and quality high, and
      offer solid technological support to customers. Within thirty-six hours of
      a customer ordering a PC by phone or through the company's Web
      site, a custom-built Dell computer is shipped. To keep its costs down, the
      company maintains an extremely low inventory of computer parts, at any
      given time housing only enough components to fulfill a few days'
      worth of orders. This strategy not only reduces the need for warehouse
      space but also ensures that, in the rapidly changing computer industry,
      Dell always has in stock the newest parts its suppliers 
       offer. Michael Dell has been able to maintain his company's steady
      growth rate by selling not just to individual consumers but also to large
      corporations, educational institutions, and government agencies. The
      company has expanded its line of products in recent years to include
      network servers (powerful machines that run computer networks), storage
      systems, handheld computers, and printers—an expansion signified by
      its 2003 name change from Dell Computer to Dell, Inc. Dell has extended
      its customer base throughout the world, most notably into Asia, capturing
      7 percent of the PC market in China by 2004.
    

      During the summer of 2004, Dell, who had been chairman and chief executive
      officer, or CEO, of his company, relinquished the CEO position, passing
      that title on to Kevin Rollins, his former president and chief operating
      officer. In a 2004 interview with 
      
        Fortune
      
       magazine, Dell and Rollins stated that the change in their job titles did
      not signal any major shift in the way the company would be run. Dell
      declared: "We run the business together, and we're going to
      continue." Since its beginnings in 1984, the company has set a
      rapid pace for growth; it took Dell just twenty years to surpass industry
      leader Hewlett-Packard to hold the largest share of the computer-making
      market. A 2001 article in 
      
        The Economist
      
       summed up Dell's accomplishment, stating, "There is hardly
      a more admired boss than Mr. Dell, the man who turned the commodity
      business of PC making into a goldmine by doing things differently."

Michael Dell, CEO, took his eponymous company private in October 2013.



Leadership>Companies & Executives Michael Dell Talks About the Benefits of Running a Private Company


    Michael Dell shares his opinion about how financial markets impact the running a manufacturing business. Excerpts from Inc. and Forbes.  

Patricia Panchak | Jul 17, 2014



































The man who, to date, led the privatization of one of the largest companies, by revenue, has something to say about how finance influences business decisions. Michael Dell, CEO, took his namesake Round Rock, Tex.-based company private in October 2013, the year it ranked 24 in the IW US 500 with nearly $57 billion in revenue.
Dell shared his opinion in the July/August edition of Inc.
"People see that there is a problem of too much short-term thinking in financial markets; it's a real affliction. That we were able to extract ourselves from that and think much more about the medium and long term, that's an idea people get excited about."


		"We can be on offense all the time as a private company. We're investing aggressively in knowledge and talent and resources... If you are running a public company, you've got to deliver short-term results. You need to deliver this amount of earnings the quarter, so your investment approach is going to be modified."

		"On top of that, there's always the threat of shareholder activism. People saying, 'Oh, you have too much cash on your balance sheet; why don't you give us a dividend? Why don't you do a share repurchase? Why don't you spin off that division or split the company up?' That's a very different approach than I can take as the founder-owner-operator, the ultimate long-term investor."

		"...We can move more quickly as a private company." Describing the  departure of a CFO, Dell writes, "If an officer is going to leave, that's a big deal for a public company. Had we been public, we would have had to plan the timing of the announcement, think about all the questions that might arise, and get all these opinions from different people. We might have waited 90 days to make the decision official. That kind of thing happens all the time, and it's total nonsense. As a private company, though, we knew exactly what to do. We had a successor ready to go, and we announced it almost instantly."

Indeed, being free from shareholder demands is part of what made possible the $25 billion deal to take Dell private, noted a November 18, Forbes article:
"The growth-challenged company will be buried under just less than $20 billion in debt in an industry in secular decline.
"But [Carl] Icahn, [former shareholder and critic of the deal], knows what Dell does: that without dividends and buybacks, he should have enough cash flow to cover the interest payments. And without the public markets to worry about he has the flexibility to pull off the rebalancing act."
Being a private company also will allow Dell to leverage the company's PC business in a way that would be impossible for a public company. Forbes explained:
"Most critically, the world’s third-largest personal computer maker has no plans to abandon the PC, despite that product line’s sinking fortunes. In fact, he plans to sell way more of them and, if the recent past is any guide, he may just sell them at a loss. Selling commodity boxes on the cheap allows him to get Dell in the door to upsell customers on lucrative software and services. Dell has driven down the prices of PCs many times before. But a PC maker selling PCs as a loss leader? That’s the kind of thing you get to do when you take a company private. 'We’ve always viewed [PCs] as a business that’s got a life cycle to it. Growth is in new areas, and it’s a business you’ve got to manage very efficiently from a cost structure. It’s still a great way to get into new customers,' says Dell."

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

This essay has been submitted by a student. This is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers.
The first attribute and most importantly, from the leader is the decision to become a leader. At what point of time and the leaders decide they want to provide others with vision, and guiding the course of events in the future, and inspire others to achieve success. These people have some characteristics that help people identify the leaders of this trust and ethics, discipline and respect. Leadership requires the individual in the exercise of power and responsibility. If someone choose to become a leader, whether in community, workplace or in a state of emergency, and discuss these characteristics will help leaders develop the right mix of qualities, skills and ambition.
One important quality of a good leader is trust. When the leader believes in him, and others follow suit. Leaders cannot expect others to believe them if they doubt themselves or they make decisions. In addition, in order to lead, one must be a strong set of moral values. And a fixed set of values â€‹â€‹is always one reference when faced with a difficult decision-making. People should be able to predict how they would react to their leader some cases because they know what faith in which they live. Leader with the moral values â€‹â€‹gives those who they lead to ensure that the decisions they make will be desirable ones. Another feature that a good leader should have is discipline. Good leaders must be able to discipline themselves first and then those in which they live. With a little effort, and should be a leader be able to put others on the right track. Finally, all leaders need to respect: respect for themselves and respect for others, and most importantly, respect from others. Leader with no respect for any leader at all. People committed only to those who respect and, therefore, that the leader must earn the respect of others through continued and consistent accountability. Any person who has these qualities (trust, ethics and discipline, and respect) has the keys to leadership. It is their choice to be used effectively or not used at all.
This assignment examines the entrepreneurial and leadership skills of Michael Dell, the CEO and Chairman of leading online PC retailer DELL. Michael's interests and business ventures starts during his school days and his entry into the computer business are explored in detail.
Literature Review:
"A leader is a dealer in hope" Napoleon Bonaparte said. Leaders are considered the key people behind organizations' success. How leaders influence people has a great impact in the level of organizations' performance and success. Employees do their work by following instruction of their managers. But whether they willingness follow instruction rather than forced to do it makes a different.
Ralph Stogdill (1950) defined leadership as "an influencing process aimed at goal achievement." Leadership is all about making people follow leaders' goals. People are affected by leaders were the willingness follow them.
There are different leadership styles describes leaders behavior. Leaders are known as autocratic when they are more directives and monopolize decision making. They can also be participative when they put people beside them in taking decisions. Other leaders are democratic were they delegate powers to people and empower them.
Lots of theories have been raised related to leadership. Earlier theories discussed more the leaders as people born with special characteristics which make them leaders. One of the earliest theories defines leadership is the Great Man theory (also called Heroes) by Thomas Carlyle which suggest that leaders born not made. It also suggests that leaders come when there is a great need. Trait theory followed the same base suggesting that leaders inherit special traits and the right combination of traits make them leaders.
Behavioral theories worked against earlier theories suggesting that leadership can be learned and made. These theories look into what leaders do. One of the famous theories is Managerial Grid by Blake and Mouton in the 1960s who described leaders based on their concern for people against their concern for production.
Figure : The Managerial Grid by Mounton & Blake
 
The contingency leadership theory came with an idea that there is no one best way to lead people. It suggests that an effective leadership style in some situations may not be successful in other situations. Least Preferred Co-worker (LPC) theory by Fred Fiedler is based on scoring leader's opinion about their co-worker and their preference to work with again based on positive factors (friendly, helpful, etc.) and negative factors (unfriendly, gloomy, etc.). High LPC leaders tend to be more supportive and have close and positive relationships. Low LPC leaders are task oriented and may turn to relationship only when they are satisfied with how the work is going.
Situational Leadership suggests that leadership style changes based on the situation. According to Hersey and Blanchard, they categorized leadership styles into four types, Telling, Selling, Participating and Delegating.
Telling: clear directions where leader is sort of autocratic. All decision are made by the leader. The roles are clearly defined and tasks procedures are provided. It is a one way communication. This style can be followed when people lack the specific skills and are unwilling or unable to do the task.
Selling: still directions are provided by leaders. Leaders provide socioemotional support. It becomes a two way communication. This style works to people who are willing to do the task but unable to take responsibility for it.
Participating: leaders are more supportive and collaborative. People are involved in decision making and in deciding how the work is done. Leaders follow more relation behavior and less task behavior. This style works when people are experienced but are not confidence enough to take responsibility.
Delegating: leaders plays a monitory role. People become more responsible. Such style works when people are experienced and able to take responsibilities.
Figure : Situational Leadership
When people follow leaders because they inspire them, these leaders are known as transformational leaders. These leaders with vision and passion and can achieve great things. They motivate people to follow them by their charisma which moves peoples' enthusiasm and accelerate their energy. Such leaders have a great big picture and influence followers to see it and work toward achieving their goals. The opposite type of leaders is transactional leaders who motivate people by reward and punishment. They are more work oriented and they put clear work structure for people to follow. This type falls under the leaders who rely on a system of rewards and taxes. When they are choosing the leader of the group must be set to follow the rules and do what is required from the leader without discussion, to get in the end the rewards.
Micheal Dell Biography:
Michael Saul Dell is the founders, the chief executive officer and the chairman of Dell Inc. He was born on 23/02/1965 in Houston, USA. He is married with 4 children living in Austin, Texas in the USA. He is ranked 44 of the richest people in the world with a net worth of around USD 14.6 billion. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dell)
His passion with computers started at age 15 when he disassembled his Apple II, his first computer, and reassembled it to see it working. His bright business idea started in his first year of studies at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984 - when he was just 19 - when he started his own business with only USD 1000 capital. He started building and selling personal computers from his university room with an idea to sell directly to customers rather than selling through third parties which will make his product cheaper than the market. This allowed him to build PCs based on people's requirement. These all allowed him to build customized PCs based on customers need and avoid storage costs.
Mr. Dell did not complete his university as he left University of Texas Austin to focus on his new venture - PC's Limited which grew sharply to be listed as Dell Computer Corporation in 1988 which have been valued around USD 85 million. In 1992, Dell Computer Corporation was listed as one of the largest 500 companies in the world on the Fortune 500 which made Mr. Dell the youngest CEO ever.
His company grew rapidly and become one of the leading computer firms around the globe. He managed it directly being the CEO for almost 20 years till early 2004 when he stepped down from being the CEO and become the chairman of the board of directors of Dell. In 2007, Mr. Dell returned to manage the company as CEO at the request of the board to replace Mr. Kevin Rollins as result of a 9% drop of Dell stock performance.
Mr. Dell spends lots in charity activities as he spend huge amounts for philanthropic activities. He with his wife Susan formed the "Michael and Susan Dell Foundation" which aims to improve the children lives in USA and internationally.
Dell's Achievements
Mr. Dell is a magnate who led his company to be huge to be considered one of the largest companies in the world. It is ranked 41 out of the top American companies as per the Fortune 500 in 201 based on annual revenue.
Since his starting from his room with USD 1000 in 1984, with a small capabilities but a sharp and powerful vision to sell cheap computer with custom features, Mr. Dell moved forward sharply. His company PC's Limited introduced its first own design pc "Turbo PC" in 1985 which generated USD 73 million as gross profit. Three years later, PC's Limited was renamed as "Dell Computer Corporation" and become a public company after offering 3.5 million shares through IPO at a price of USD 8.5. Dell opened its first international branch in UK in 1988.
Dell began an online selling strategy in 1996 which was a revolutionary idea which boosted their revenue. Dell Computers Corporation become Dell Inc in 2003 to reflect their expansion beyond computers as new products introduced by dell such as televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers.
After Michael Dell became the chairman and Kevin Rollins became the CEO in 2004, there was a drop back in dell performance of its computers end product force Michael Dell to wear his hate again as Dell's CEO in 2007.
Dell went through many acquisitions which helped in expanding the business. Their acquisition series started in 1999 by acquiring ConvergeNet Technologies. During Kevin Rollins time heading the company, Dell acquired Alienware in 2006. In 2008, the acquisition of EqualLogic helped to put a foothold in the storage market. Dell also acquired Perot Systems in 2009 and Software-as-a-Service in 2010,
Michael Dell's Leadership style:
When Mr. Dell started his own business, he had limited management experience. As his business started growing sharply, management skills became necessary to drive his company toward success. Vision is not enough at this stage. This is why he brought his Lee Walker who was a venture capitalist who provided him with the required managerial and financial experience. Mr. Walker was Dell's mentor and helped building his confidence to become a polished executive. Mr. Dell turned into a charismatic leader as his knowledge of all parts of the business grew and he motivated people by gaining their loyalty and respect.
Mr. Dell used to hang out with his engineers in the early days of his company. He was known as a shy person. People who worked closely with him described him and "likable young man who was slow to warm up to strangers." (Successful leaders, 1999)
His experience made him a public speaker as he is known to speak in a quiet reflective manner. He motivates people with his charisma and aggressiveness.
His successful leadership is a result of four main strengths:
His goal was clear and he stayed focus on it.
He has a strong innovation sense.
He is a hard worker with a great understanding of his responsibilities. He is known of his good balance between work and life (family).
He has powerful vision for the future with a unique business's philosophy.
Dell's manages his company directly as a CEO for 20 years where he was known as a warm guy with good characters for making his staff feel like part of a team. After he dropped out and Mr. Kevin Rollins become the CEO, Mr. Kevin kept and emotional distance from staff. In 2007, the board of directors of Dell Inc. agreed that Mr. Dell is required to glue the team again. He is back as the CEO and changed his way by introducing a new leadership board. He delegated power and share decision making.
Mr. Dell brought Mr. Kevin on board when the company expanded to have multi product in multi geography locations to help him manage the company. They started a new leadership approach of having two CEO's in one company. Even though there is risk of conflict but fortunately, it worked well with them.
Dell said: "Lots of places. I'm helping set business strategy and providing clear performance objectives for the different parts of the business". He also said "I'm selling Dell all the time to lots of people: customers, investors, employees."
Analyzing Dell's management style showed different ways of leadership. He was autocratic in his early life where he makes decisions. He became participative when he started sharing management, first when he started the two in a box style where two CEO in board leading the company, and second when he introduced the leadership board after he returned to CEO position in 2007.
The way Mr. Dell changed his style to fit the conditions of his organization showed that he is following the situational leadership style. However, his style was more affecting people by his characteristics rather than his way of decision making. People working with Dell have a sense of loyalty to him. He managed the company since its inception and was successful leader where everyone liked him. When he left for 3 years, employees, performance got affected and Mr. Dell came back to gather the team back. Such charisma and effect on people proves that Mr. Dell is a transformational leader who guide people by charisma and inspires them to follow his goals.
Characteristics of Dell make him effective Leaders. Following a transformational leadership style gave him credibility, resulting in the trust and confidence of his people. Keeping the promises and follows through on the commitments was part of Dell's qualities. Dell makes sure that the actions are consistent with the wishes of the people leaded. He has a clear idea of what others value and what they can do.
Michel Dell creates a trusting and open climate, to help others to be successful and to feel empowered. He also tried to encourage members to do more. Michel Dell showed the followers that they aren't just the figurehead or decision maker. Members respect leaders more when they show the willingness to work alongside them. They avoid phrases that cause resentment, reluctance and resistance. For instance, instead of saying you have to do something, effective leaders request or recommend that members do something. Characteristics of a Successful Leadership are the person others choose to follow, provide vision for the future, provide inspiration, make other people feel important and appreciated and last but not least behave ethically. (Leader Skills, 1982)
Conclusion:
The importance of leadership style is evidenced by a long history of educational and managerial theorists who have promoted a variety of concepts to explain leadership expertise. Proponents of transformational leadership theory have claimed that transformational leadership is the most favorable leadership style in any setting.
However, situations may vary between organizations base on culture, type of business, people's behavior, etc. However, Michael Dell case shows as main issues to be a great leader who creates difference. One of the main lessons of this assignment is that successful leaders must have a clear goals and vision. He must have a long seeing vision.
Leaders also must influence others to motivate them to follow their vision and achieve organizational goals. They should transform their goals and vision all followers' practice.
Innovative is one of the critical characteristics of a strong leader. Leaders should develop this sense in the organizational culture. They should be willing to take risk of doing new things and find an opportunity from it.
Other lesson from Dell's case is leaders should have high moral responsibility. How Mr. Dell had a clear distribution of his time between work and life. Moreover, leaders with good relationship behavior become more attached by followers. Such leaders gain people's respect.
Dell has no fear of admitting what he is incapable of. Whenever he misses any skills, he get someone capable to the board to help him managing the business. This made him successful and allowed him to gain experience from those people.

Michael Saul Dell (born February 23, 1965) is an American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, and author. He is the founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, one of the world’s leading providers of information technology infrastructure solutions. He is ranked as the 37th richest person in the world by Forbes, with a net worth of US$20.8 billion as of February 2017.[2]
In 2011, his 243.35 million shares of Dell Inc. stock were worth $3.5 billion, giving him 12% ownership of the company.[3] His remaining wealth of roughly $10 billion is invested in other companies and is managed by a firm whose name, MSD Capital, incorporates Dell's initials.[4] On January 5, 2013 it was announced that Michael Dell had bid to take Dell Inc. private for $24.4 billion in the biggest management buyout since the Great Recession. Dell Inc. officially went private on October 29, 2013.[5]
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[6][7] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[8]

Early life[edit]
Michael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, to a Jewish family whose surname reflects the translation into English of the original German/Yiddish Thal ("valley" or "dale [q.v.]"; modern common-noun spelling Tal) upon the family's immigration to the United States.[9] The son of Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker,[10] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist, Michael Dell attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[11] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight. In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[12]
Dell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[13] He got a job as a dishwasher at age 12 and was quickly promoted to maitre d'.[14]Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the Houston Post in the summer. While making cold calls, he noted that the people most likely to purchase subscriptions were those in the process of establishing permanent geographic and social presence. He then hired some friends who scoured local court records so he could target this demographic group by collecting names from marriage and mortgage applications. He then segmented those leads by the size of mortgage, calling on those with the highest mortgages first. Dell earned $18,000 that year, exceeding the annual income of his history and economics teacher.[15]
Business career[edit]

While a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers[16] in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building. He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[17][18][19]
In January 1984, Dell banked on his conviction that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel. In January 1984, Dell registered his company as "PC's Limited". Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 in upgraded PCs, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as "Dell Computer Corporation" and relocated it to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few order takers, a few more people to fulfill them, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff "consisting of three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[20][21]
In 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in Fortune magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[22] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[23] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, passing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitor's sales were shrinking.[24]
In 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[25] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[26]
In 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders, took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the private company.[27]
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[6][7] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[8]
Penalty[edit]
In July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[28] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each, former CFO James Schneider to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[28]
Accolades[edit]
Accolades for Dell include "Entrepreneur of the Year" (at age 24) from Inc. magazine;[29] "Top CEO in American Business" from Worth magazine; "CEO of the Year" from Financial World, Industry Week and Chief Executive magazines. Dell also received the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[30]

Forbes estimates Dell's net worth as of February 2017 at $20.8 billion.[33] Dell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989 in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.[34][35][36]

[38] Since 1999, the MSDF has committed $1.23 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa. [39]
By 2010, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa[40] Today the foundation has over $466 million assets under management.[41]

Early life[edit]
Michael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, to a Jewish family whose surname reflects the translation into English of the original German/Yiddish Thal ("valley" or "dale [q.v.]"; modern common-noun spelling Tal) upon the family's immigration to the United States.[9] The son of Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker,[10] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist, Michael Dell attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[11] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight. In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[12]
Dell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[13] He got a job as a dishwasher at age 12 and was quickly promoted to maitre d'.[14]Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the Houston Post in the summer. While making cold calls, he noted that the people most likely to purchase subscriptions were those in the process of establishing permanent geographic and social presence. He then hired some friends who scoured local court records so he could target this demographic group by collecting names from marriage and mortgage applications. He then segmented those leads by the size of mortgage, calling on those with the highest mortgages first. Dell earned $18,000 that year, exceeding the annual income of his history and economics teacher.[15]
Business career[edit]

While a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers[16] in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building. He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[17][18][19]
In January 1984, Dell banked on his conviction that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel. In January 1984, Dell registered his company as "PC's Limited". Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 in upgraded PCs, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as "Dell Computer Corporation" and relocated it to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few order takers, a few more people to fulfill them, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff "consisting of three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[20][21]
In 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in Fortune magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[22] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[23] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, passing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitor's sales were shrinking.[24]
In 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[25] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[26]
In 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders, took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the private company.[27]
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[6][7] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[8]

In July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[28] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each, former CFO James Schneider to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[28]
Accolades[edit]
Accolades for Dell include "Entrepreneur of the Year" (at age 24) from Inc. magazine;[29] "Top CEO in American Business" from Worth magazine; "CEO of the Year" from Financial World, Industry Week and Chief Executive magazines. Dell also received the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[30]
Affiliations[edit]
Dell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council, and the governing board of the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, India. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[31]

Wealth and personal life[edit]

Early life[edit]
Michael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, to a Jewish family whose surname reflects the translation into English of the original German/Yiddish Thal ("valley" or "dale [q.v.]"; modern common-noun spelling Tal) upon the family's immigration to the United States.[9] The son of Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker,[10] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist, Michael Dell attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[11] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight. In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[12]
Dell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[13] He got a job as a dishwasher at age 12 and was quickly promoted to maitre d'.[14]Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the Houston Post in the summer. While making cold calls, he noted that the people most likely to purchase subscriptions were those in the process of establishing permanent geographic and social presence. He then hired some friends who scoured local court records so he could target this demographic group by collecting names from marriage and mortgage applications. He then segmented those leads by the size of mortgage, calling on those with the highest mortgages first. Dell earned $18,000 that year, exceeding the annual income of his history and economics teacher.[15]
Business career[edit]

While a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers[16] in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building. He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[17][18][19]
In January 1984, Dell banked on his conviction that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel. In January 1984, Dell registered his company as "PC's Limited". Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 in upgraded PCs, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as "Dell Computer Corporation" and relocated it to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few order takers, a few more people to fulfill them, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff "consisting of three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[20][21]
In 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in Fortune magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[22] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[23] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, passing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitor's sales were shrinking.[24]
In 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[25] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[26]
In 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders, took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the private company.[27]
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[6][7] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[8]
Penalty[edit]
In July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[28] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each, former CFO James Schneider to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[28]
Accolades[edit]
Accolades for Dell include "Entrepreneur of the Year" (at age 24) from Inc. magazine;[29] "Top CEO in American Business" from Worth magazine; "CEO of the Year" from Financial World, Industry Week and Chief Executive magazines. Dell also received the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[30]
Affiliations[edit]
Dell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council, and the governing board of the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, India. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[31]
Writings[edit]
Dell's 1999 book, Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry (by HarperBusiness), is an account of his early life, his company's founding, growth and missteps, as well as lessons learned. The book was written in collaboration with Catherine Fredman.[32]
Wealth and personal life[edit]
Forbes estimates Dell's net worth as of February 2017 at $20.8 billion.[33] Dell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989 in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.[34][35][36]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to compliment the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.[37] In 2013, the foundation provided an additional $50 million commitment to establish the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin. [38] Since 1999, the MSDF has committed $1.23 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa. [39]
By 2010, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa[40] Today the foundation has over $466 million assets under management.[41]
In 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.[42]
In 2012, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation committed $50 million for medical education. The Dell Medical School began enrolling students in 2016.[43]
In 2014, he donated $1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.[44]

Writings[edit]
Dell's 1999 book, Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry (by HarperBusiness), is an account of his early life, his company's founding, growth and missteps, as well as lessons learned. The book was written in collaboration with Catherine Fredman.[32]
Wealth and personal life[edit]
Forbes estimates Dell's net worth as of February 2017 at $20.8 billion.[33] Dell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989 in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.[34][35][36]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to compliment the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.[37] In 2013, the foundation provided an additional $50 million commitment to establish the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin. [38] Since 1999, the MSDF has committed $1.23 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa. [39]
By 2010, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa[40] Today the foundation has over $466 million assets under management.[41]
In 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.[42]
In 2012, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation committed $50 million for medical education. The Dell Medical School began enrolling students in 2016.[43]
In 2014, he donated $1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.[44]

				Taking The Direct Approach
			







Michael Dell Founder of Dell Computer Corp. Founded: 1984








---Shares










"You don't have to be a genius or a visionary or even a college graduate to be successful. You just need a framework and a dream."-Michael DellMichael Dell wasn't the only young entrepreneur to ride the computer boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s from rags to riches. Like Rod Canion of Compaq and Steve Jobs of Apple, Dell turned a fledging start-up into a multibillion-dollar computer empire. But unlike the ill-fated Canion and Jobs, who lost control of their creations as they grew, Dell has managed to hold on to the reins of his maverick venture and achieve the unique distinction of being the computer industry's longest-tenured CEO.Following the simple idea that by selling customized personal computer systems directly to customers he could best understand their needs and provide the most effective computing solutions to meet those needs, Dell has made Dell Computer Corp. the world's leading direct computer systems company.Dell's parents wanted him to be a doctor. But by the time he was in junior high, Dell was hooked on computers. While most of his classmates were tinkering under the hoods of old cars, Dell loved to tinker with his Apple IIe.To please his parents, Dell enrolled as a premed student at the University of Texas in 1983, but by then his only real interest was in computers. During his first semester, Dell spent his spare time buying up remaindered, outmoded PCs from local retailers, then upgrading and selling them from his dorm room. He was so successful, that one day his roommate piled his ever-growing inventory up against the door of their dorm room.Dell took this as a sign it was time to move his burgeoning business off campus. His parents were furious when he told them he wanted to drop out of college, so to appease them, Dell agreed to go back to school if the summer's sales proved disappointing. In his first month in business, Dell sold some $180,000 worth of PCs. He never returned for his sophomore year.While looking for ways to expand his fledgling start-up, Dell concluded computers would soon become a commodity, and with commodities, what matters most is price and delivery. Dell saw that the quickest way to achieve both goals was to cut out the middleman. He realized that he could buy components and assemble the whole PC himself more cheaply. Then he could sell each machine over the phone directly to customers at a 15 percent discount to established brands. This technique, which came to be known as "the direct model of selling," would revolutionize the industry and make Dell a multibillionaire in the process.The 19-year-old Dell dubbed his venture PCs Ltd., and the Austin-based company soon became one of the fastest-growing enterprises in the country. Rather than flooding the market with hundreds of thousands of "plain brown wrapper" computers, the company would focus on what it did best-creating customized machines to order.The strategy worked. During its first year in operation, PCs Limited pulled in more than $6 million in sales, and Dell quickly gained a reputation as a "boy wonder." To cash in on his growing fame, he changed the company's name to Dell Computer Corp. in 1987. Sales continued to soar, topping $159 million by the end of 1988. That same year, Dell made an initial public offering which raised $30 million, about $18 million of which went directly into Dell's pocket.For many start-up entrepreneurs, that would have been a pinnacle signaling it was time to move on to the next promising adventure. But in Dell's mind he was just getting started. He now set his sights on overtaking industry leader IBM, rallying his employees by telling them his newborn daughter's first words were "Daddy, kill IBM." The technique got a response, and Dell's sales leapt to more than $800 million by 1991. In 1992, Dell set a goal of passing the $1.5 billion mark by the end of the year. Always the overachiever, Dell met his goal and then some, as sales rocketed to $2 billion. But in the midst of this success, there were storm clouds gathering on the horizon.The company was growing at a pace that was too fast for the young entrepreneur to handle. By mid-1993, Dell Computer Corp. seemed to be spiraling out of control. Stock prices had plummeted from $49 in January of 1993 to a mere $16 by July. Dell's CFO resigned, leaving a management void. And worst of all, Dell had scrapped all its new lines of notebook computers because of poor production and was forced to sit on the sidelines of the fastest-growing segment of the PC market for more than 12 months.Dell realized he needed to do something-and do it quickly. His solution was to seek out older, more experienced managers to help him regain control of his 9-year-old juggernaut. First he brought in Mort Topfer, a seasoned executive from Motorola, to handle day-to-day operations. Next he tapped the talents of Kevin Rollins, an organizational expert from Bain and Co., to run the American operations. And, perhaps his most important coup, Dell stole Apple Powerbook designer John Medica.Within 12 months the listing company was righted, and the following year profits climbed to $149 million. But even with this amazing turnaround, Dell knew his company's place in the increasingly competitive PC industry was in no way guaranteed. To ensure continued success, Dell and his top executives made a pair of controversial strategic decisions that ran counter to prevailing industry trends. First, instead of initiating a price war in pursuit of greater sales units, Dell chose to focus on high-margin business customers. Second, the company opted to rely exclusively on direct marketing rather than retail.Industry pundits questioned the second move, pointing out that by selling direct Dell was slighting the then sizzling home PC market. But Dell knew better. In an earlier brief foray into retail stores, Dell discovered he could not compete with Compaq's strong brand name and Packard Bell's cutthroat pricing. Selling through retail stores was definitely out. But Dell wasn't about to give up the lucrative consumer market. Instead, he decided to sell fully customized PCs via phone, fax and direct sales to more sophisticated, second-time home computer buyers.Once again, Dell proved his critics wrong. The company's new approach had sales topping $5.5 billion by the end of 1996. But Dell had yet another ace up his sleeve. In July 1996, Dell launched one of the first direct-sale computer Web sites, and in just two months, was averaging Internet sales in excess of $2 million a day (a number that would rise to $6 million a day by 1998). The combination of selling direct via phone and Internet pushed Dell's sales to $7.7 billion by February 1997.Until this time, industry experts and Dell's three main rivals, Compaq, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, were convinced that direct sales would only gain Dell a niche market. But as Dell's direct onslaught began to increasingly cut into their market share, all three competitors adopted the direct model of selling, but unlike Dell, continued to offer their machines through retail stores as well.Whether or not Compaq, IBM and Hewlett-Packard's revamped strategy will eventually recapture the market share lost to Dell remains to be seen. But by being first, Dell definitely has the advantage, as the numbers clearly show. While the PC industry grew by a paltry 5 percent in 1998, Dell grew at an incredible pace of more than 50 percent, achieving sales of $12.3 billion. By January 1999, Dell was outselling both IBM and Hewlett-Packard and was poised to overtake the number-one computer maker, archrival Compaq.While he has yet to completely silence his critics, Michael Dell has proven that he has the flexibility, the stamina and the vision to remain at the top of the country's most competitive business, even through the bumpiest of times. As Internet sales rocket skyward ($30 million a day in July 1999), Dell continues to baffle his competitors, astound analysts and enthrall stockholders.If It Ain't Broke.Fix It AnywayOne of the reasons Dell Computer Corp. has remained so successful is Michael Dell's firm belief in constantly rethinking his company's operations. Case in point: Although the company's computers have always boasted some of the highest quality ratings in the PC industry, in 1997 Dell became obsessed with finding a way to reduce his machines' failure rate. Convinced that the key to achieving this goal lay in reducing the frequency hard drives were handled during assembly, Dell insisted that the number of "touches" be dramatically cut down from the existing level of more than 30. After extensively revamping the company's production lines, the number of touches was trimmed to fewer than 15. The result? The rate of rejected hard drives fell by 40 percent and the overall failure rate for Dell PCs dropped by 20 percent.Business In His BloodMichael Dell has often been quoted as saying, "I always knew I wanted to run a business someday." Indeed, it does appear that Dell was born a businessman. At the age of 12, he was making thousands of dollars in mail order sales to stamp collectors. During his senior year in high school, he made $18,000 selling newspaper subscriptions for the now defunct Houston Post and bought his first BMW-paying in cash, no less. Obviously no ordinary paperboy, Dell had figured out that the most likely subscribers were newlyweds or families who had just moved in. So using sources such as the city marriage license bureau, he put together a targeted mailing list on his first computer-an Apple IIe-and sent out personalized mailings offering special subscription deals. By age 18, Dell was telling people his life's ambition was to compete with IBM. Ironically, today a lot of folks at IBM have the ambition of competing with Dell.

Early life[edit]
Michael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, to a Jewish family whose surname reflects the translation into English of the original German/Yiddish Thal ("valley" or "dale [q.v.]"; modern common-noun spelling Tal) upon the family's immigration to the United States.[9] The son of Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker,[10] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist, Michael Dell attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[11] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight. In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[12]
Dell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[13] He got a job as a dishwasher at age 12 and was quickly promoted to maitre d'.[14]Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the Houston Post in the summer. While making cold calls, he noted that the people most likely to purchase subscriptions were those in the process of establishing permanent geographic and social presence. He then hired some friends who scoured local court records so he could target this demographic group by collecting names from marriage and mortgage applications. He then segmented those leads by the size of mortgage, calling on those with the highest mortgages first. Dell earned $18,000 that year, exceeding the annual income of his history and economics teacher.[15]
Business career[edit]

While a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers[16] in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building. He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[17][18][19]
In January 1984, Dell banked on his conviction that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel. In January 1984, Dell registered his company as "PC's Limited". Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 in upgraded PCs, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as "Dell Computer Corporation" and relocated it to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few order takers, a few more people to fulfill them, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff "consisting of three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[20][21]
In 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in Fortune magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[22] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[23] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, passing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitor's sales were shrinking.[24]
In 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[25] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[26]
In 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders, took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the private company.[27]
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[6][7] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[8]
Penalty[edit]
In July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[28] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each, former CFO James Schneider to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[28]
Accolades[edit]
Accolades for Dell include "Entrepreneur of the Year" (at age 24) from Inc. magazine;[29] "Top CEO in American Business" from Worth magazine; "CEO of the Year" from Financial World, Industry Week and Chief Executive magazines. Dell also received the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[30]
Affiliations[edit]
Dell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council, and the governing board of the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, India. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[31]

In 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to compliment the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.[37] In 2013, the foundation provided an additional $50 million commitment to establish the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin. [38] Since 1999, the MSDF has committed $1.23 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa. [39]
By 2010, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa[40] Today the foundation has over $466 million assets under management.[41]
In 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.[42]
In 2012, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation committed $50 million for medical education. The Dell Medical School began enrolling students in 2016.[43]
In 2014, he donated $1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.[44]

He is the founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, one of the world’s leading providers of information technology infrastructure solutions. He is ranked as the 37th richest person in the world by Forbes, with a net worth of US$20.8 billion as of February 2017.[2]
In 2011, his 243.35 million shares of Dell Inc. stock were worth $3.5 billion, giving him 12% ownership of the company.[3] His remaining wealth of roughly $10 billion is invested in other companies and is managed by a firm whose name, MSD Capital, incorporates Dell's initials.[4] On January 5, 2013 it was announced that Michael Dell had bid to take Dell Inc. private for $24.4 billion in the biggest management buyout since the Great Recession. Dell Inc. officially went private on October 29, 2013.[5]
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[6][7] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[8]

Early life[edit]
Michael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, to a Jewish family whose surname reflects the translation into English of the original German/Yiddish Thal ("valley" or "dale [q.v.]"; modern common-noun spelling Tal) upon the family's immigration to the United States.[9] The son of Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker,[10] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist, Michael Dell attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[11] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight. In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[12]
Dell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[13] He got a job as a dishwasher at age 12 and was quickly promoted to maitre d'.[14]Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the Houston Post in the summer. While making cold calls, he noted that the people most likely to purchase subscriptions were those in the process of establishing permanent geographic and social presence. He then hired some friends who scoured local court records so he could target this demographic group by collecting names from marriage and mortgage applications. He then segmented those leads by the size of mortgage, calling on those with the highest mortgages first. Dell earned $18,000 that year, exceeding the annual income of his history and economics teacher.[15]
Business career[edit]

While a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers[16] in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building. He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[17][18][19]
In January 1984, Dell banked on his conviction that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel. In January 1984, Dell registered his company as "PC's Limited". Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 in upgraded PCs, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as "Dell Computer Corporation" and relocated it to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few order takers, a few more people to fulfill them, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff "consisting of three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[20][21]
In 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in Fortune magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[22] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[23] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, passing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitor's sales were shrinking.[24]
In 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[25] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[26]
In 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders, took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the private company.[27]
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[6][7] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[8]
Penalty[edit]
In July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[28] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each, former CFO James Schneider to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[28]
Accolades[edit]
Accolades for Dell include "Entrepreneur of the Year" (at age 24) from Inc. magazine;[29] "Top CEO in American Business" from Worth magazine; "CEO of the Year" from Financial World, Industry Week and Chief Executive magazines. Dell also received the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[30]
Affiliations[edit]
Dell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council, and the governing board of the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, India. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[31]
Writings[edit]
Dell's 1999 book, Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry (by HarperBusiness), is an account of his early life, his company's founding, growth and missteps, as well as lessons learned. The book was written in collaboration with Catherine Fredman.[32]
Wealth and personal life[edit]
Forbes estimates Dell's net worth as of February 2017 at $20.8 billion.[33] Dell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989 in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.[34][35][36]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to compliment the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.[37] In 2013, the foundation provided an additional $50 million commitment to establish the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.

By 2010, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa[40] Today the foundation has over $466 million assets under management.[41]
In 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.[42]
In 2012, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation committed $50 million for medical education. The Dell Medical School began enrolling students in 2016.[43]
In 2014, he donated $1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.[44]

Michael Saul Dell (born February 23, 1965) is an American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, and author. He is the founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, one of the world’s leading providers of information technology infrastructure solutions. He is ranked as the 37th richest person in the world by Forbes, with a net worth of US$20.8 billion as of February 2017.[2]
In 2011, his 243.35 million shares of Dell Inc. stock were worth $3.5 billion, giving him 12% ownership of the company.[3] His remaining wealth of roughly $10 billion is invested in other companies and is managed by a firm whose name, MSD Capital, incorporates Dell's initials.[4] On January 5, 2013 it was announced that Michael Dell had bid to take Dell Inc. private for $24.4 billion in the biggest management buyout since the Great Recession. Dell Inc. officially went private on October 29, 2013.[5]
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[6][7] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[8]

Early life[edit]
Michael Dell was born in 1965 in Houston, to a Jewish family whose surname reflects the translation into English of the original German/Yiddish Thal ("valley" or "dale [q.v.]"; modern common-noun spelling Tal) upon the family's immigration to the United States.[9] The son of Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker,[10] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist, Michael Dell attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[11] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight. In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[12]
Dell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[13] He got a job as a dishwasher at age 12 and was quickly promoted to maitre d'.[14]Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the Houston Post in the summer. While making cold calls, he noted that the people most likely to purchase subscriptions were those in the process of establishing permanent geographic and social presence. He then hired some friends who scoured local court records so he could target this demographic group by collecting names from marriage and mortgage applications. He then segmented those leads by the size of mortgage, calling on those with the highest mortgages first. Dell earned $18,000 that year, exceeding the annual income of his history and economics teacher.[15]
Business career[edit]

While a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers[16] in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building. He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[17][18][19]
In January 1984, Dell banked on his conviction that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel. In January 1984, Dell registered his company as "PC's Limited". Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 in upgraded PCs, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as "Dell Computer Corporation" and relocated it to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few order takers, a few more people to fulfill them, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff "consisting of three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[20][21]
In 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in Fortune magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[22] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[23] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, passing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitor's sales were shrinking.[24]
In 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[25] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[26]
In 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders, took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the private company.[27]
On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the "highest-valued tech acquisition in history".[6][7] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[8]
Penalty[edit]
In July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[28] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each, former CFO James Schneider to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[28]
Accolades[edit]
Accolades for Dell include "Entrepreneur of the Year" (at age 24) from Inc. magazine;[29] "Top CEO in American Business" from Worth magazine; "CEO of the Year" from Financial World, Industry Week and Chief Executive magazines. Dell also received the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[30]
Affiliations[edit]
Dell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council, and the governing board of the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, India. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[31]
Writings[edit]
Dell's 1999 book, Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry (by HarperBusiness), is an account of his early life, his company's founding, growth and missteps, as well as lessons learned. The book was written in collaboration with Catherine Fredman.[32]
Wealth and personal life[edit]
Forbes estimates Dell's net worth as of February 2017 at $20.8 billion.[33] Dell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989 in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.[34][35][36]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to compliment the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.[37] In 2013, the foundation provided an additional $50 million commitment to establish the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin. [38] Since 1999, the MSDF has committed $1.23 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa. [39]
By 2010, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa[40] Today the foundation has over $466 million assets under management.[41]
In 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.[42]
In 2012, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation committed $50 million for medical education. The Dell Medical School began enrolling students in 2016.[43]
In 2014, he donated $1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.[44]

The interesting thing is when we design and architect a server, we don't design it for Windows or Linux, we design it for both. We don't really care, as long as we're selling the one the customer wants.
Michael Dell


Design,
Care,
Long



















It's through curiosity and looking at opportunities in new ways that we've always mapped our path at Dell. There's always an opportunity to make a difference.
Michael Dell


Path,
Opportunity,
Curiosity



















There are a lot of things that go into creating success. I don't like to do just the things I like to do. I like to do things that cause the company to succeed. I don't spend a lot of time doing my favorite activities.
Michael Dell


Success,
Time,
Favorite



















Twenty years and $40 billion. They seem like good round numbers.
Michael Dell

I always knew I wanted to run a business someday.
Michael Dell


Business,
Run,

The world got enamored with smartphones and tablets, but what's interesting is those devices don't do everything that needs to be done. Three-D printing, virtual-reality computing, robotics are all controlled by PCs.
Michael Dell


World,

Interesting
























Productivity is grounded in the PC. Where does the computing power come from? How would you run 'USA Today' without PCs? Run a hospital without PCs? People don't want products, they want solutions.
Michael Dell


Today,
Power,
People



















I do think a founder has special permission to make sweeping changes across an organization.
Michael Dell


Changes,

Dell's a company that has changed the IT landscape in making PCs and servers more affordable. There's enormous opportunities to make IT more accessible to tens of millions of companies, kind of democratizing the ability for companies to gain access to IT.
Michael Dell


Opportunities,
Landscape



















Real entrepreneurs have what I call the three Ps (and, trust me, none of them stands for 'permission'). Real entrepreneurs have a 'passion' for what they're doing, a 'problem' that needs to be solved, and a 'purpose' that drives them forward.
Michael Dell


Trust,
Passion,
Purpose



















I've been fascinated with technology since I was a boy banging around on my father's adding machine. Back then I'd type in an equation, the device made some cool noises, and out came my answer. I was hooked.
Michael Dell


Technology,
Father,
Cool



















Every breakthrough business idea begins with solving a common problem. The bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity. I discovered a big one when I took apart an IBM PC. I made two interesting discoveries: The components were all manufactured by other companies, and the system that retailed for $3,000 cost about $600 in parts.
Michael Dell


Business,
Opportunity
























Microsoft's an important partner for Dell, an important company in the industry.

Dell will participate in tablets and all sorts of client devices. Our main business is helping our customers secure, protect their data and access it from any device they want to.
Michael Dell

If you think about computing, there isn't just one way to compute, just like there's not just one way to move around. You can have shoes, you can have a car, you can have a bicycle, submarine, rocket, plane, train, glider, whatever. Because you have one doesn't mean you get rid of another one... But PCs continue to be important.
Michael Dell


Car,
Shoes,
Bicycle



















In taking Dell private, we plan to go back to our roots, focusing on the entrepreneurial spirit that made Dell one of the fastest-growing and most successful companies in history.
Michael Dell


History,
Successful,
Plan



















The customer reaction to Dell going private has been a lot more positive than I would have ever imagined. Customers see it as - 'You don't have to be distracted. Now you can totally focus on your business.' So they see it as a positive.
Michael Dell


Positive,
Business,
Focus



















There are many different kinds of PCs. You have fixed, virtual, tablets, notebooks, ultrabooks, desktops, workstations. What you find in commercial PCs, business PCs, is that there's a really long tail of usage on client devices.
Michael Dell


Business,
Long,
You



















Computing shows up in many different ways. You have computing that you wear, computing that you carry. What you think of as the traditional PC market has a long tail of usage, particularly in the commercial world, but also in consumer.
Michael Dell
