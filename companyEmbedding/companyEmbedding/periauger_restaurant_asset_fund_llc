SELECT A FUND








































Fund Details
USCF Restaurant Leaders Fund is an exchange traded fund (ETF) designed to capitalize on restaurant companies, one of the fastest growing
industries in the United States1. According to the National Restaurant Association (NRA), restaurant revenues are forecasted to reach $782.7 Billion in
2016, up about 5% year over year. In an industry that employs over 14.4 million people and serves about 50 million people each day (numbers which
are expected to increase), it is easy to understand how the restaurant industry represents approximately 4% of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Smart Beta Methodology – Uses a four-step selection process that includes two quantitative screens and two dynamic screens. The Restaurant
Leaders INDXX Index is rebalanced quarterly.
Definable Investment Solution – May meet the needs for growth investors, sector rotation strategists, and professionals seeking exposure to the restaurant industry.
Transparent and liquid – Holdings are posted each day on the fund’s website. The ETF structure allows investors to trade throughout the day, and use limit, stop, and stop-limit orders.
Investment Objective
The USCF Restaurant Leaders Fund (NYSE: MENU) seeks to track the price and yield performance
of the Restaurant Leaders INDXX Index (iMENU), before fees and expenses.
The USCF Restaurant Leaders Fund allows investors to access a portfolio of companies in the
restaurant industry, in an easy-to-trade ETF. The Index invests in business franchises that are
leverageable, scalable with high return on capital and which touch millions of people every day.
About the Restaurant Leaders INDXX Index
The Index is composed of the common stock of U.S. and international restaurant companies. By using a proprietary Smart Beta four step selection process, the index seeks to identify Restaurant Companies that are outperforming or expected to outperform their industry peers. The Index may include small-, mid-, and large-capitalization companies that trade on a U.S. Exchange and have both a minimum market capitalization of $300 million and an average daily trading volume of $1.5 million. The Index is generally expected to include between 30 and 40 Restaurant Companies and will be rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly in March, June, September, and December. At the time the Index is rebalanced, an initial target weight of 70% is equally distributed among all securities classified as Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs), and an initial target weight of 30% is equally distributed among all securities classified as Full Service Restaurants (FSRs). Given the number of eligible securities, it may not be possible to achieve these target weights in either category, in which case there would not be an exact 70%/30% initially targeted split as described above. Additionally, the Index uses market signals to eliminate some of the securities with the lowest expected future performance and increase the weighting of the largest companies in the Index.  This process could also cause the Index to vary from the 70%/30% initially targeted split between QSRs and FSRs.

*USCF Advisers LLC (the "Adviser") has contractually agreed to waive or reduce its fees and to reimburse the Fund for its expenses from inception until October 31, 2017, so that the total annual fund operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, expenses related to short sales, other expenses that are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, extraordinary expenses, if any, and payments, if any, under the Fund’s Rule 12b-1 plan) of the Fund are limited to 0.65% of average daily net assets. Prior to such date, the expense limitation may be terminated only by a vote of the Fund's board of trustees (the "Board"). After such date, the expense limitation may be renewed, terminated or revised by the Adviser, but the Adviser must provide the Board with 90 days' notice of any termination. The Adviser is permitted to recoup from the Fund previously waived advisory fees or reimbursed expenses for three years from the date on which fees were waived or expenses reimbursed, as long as such recoupment does not cause the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses to exceed the expense cap that was applicable during the period in which the fees were waived or expenses were reimbursed.



Historical NAV








The performance data quoted above represents past performance. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Investment return and value of the Fund shares will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.


Performance








< Swipe table for more info >
Performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.
The Adviser has agreed to waive or reduce its fees and to reimburse the Fund for its expenses from inception through October 31, 2017, limiting total annual operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, expenses related to short sales, and other expenses) to 0.65% of the Fund’s average daily net assets. 
The Fund's NAV is calculated by dividing the value of the Fund's total assets less total liabilities by the number of shares outstanding. Share price returns are based on closing prices for the Fund and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times.
Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions apply and will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

The values indicate what $10,000 would have grown to over the time period indicated. The hypothetical example does not represent the returns of any particular investment. The performance data quoted above represents past performance. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

The performance data quoted above represents past performance. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Investment return and value of the Fund shares will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.
The above frequency distribution chart presents information about the difference between the daily market price for shares of the Fund and the Fund's reported net asset value. The amount that the fund's market price is above the reported NAV is called the premium. The amount that the fund's market price is below the reported NAV is called the discount. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The horizontal axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed in basis points. The vertical axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated.
* A basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1% and is used to denote the change in a financial instrument.

 List of Assets in a Business | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  List of Assets in a Business  by K.A. Francis        The more assets a business can list on its balance sheet, the healthier the business. balance sheet image by Darko Draskovic from Fotolia.com   Related Articles  1 [Examples] | What Are Specific Examples of Assets & Liabilities? 2 [Assets] | What Are Tangible Assets in Business? 3 [Fixed Assets] | What Items Are Included in Fixed Assets? 4 [Intangible Fixed Assets] | What Are Intangible Fixed Assets?     Assets keep a business afloat. They can be sold during lean times, used as collateral during expansion and help produce a healthy balance sheet. Business assets range from cash on hand, to buildings, to patents and logos. An asset is classified in one of three categories: tangible, intangible and intellectual property. For a business to be successful, it should have a healthy combination of all three.       Tangible Assets Assets, such as buildings, vehicles and office equipment, that are not consumed during the course of doing business are tangible assets. These assets are used in the process of doing business and are depreciated over time. Tangible assets are often listed under Plant, Property and Equipment on the Balance Sheet, and are consider high liquidity assets because they can easily be converted to cash. Intangible Assets Assets with no physical form, such as a business' reputation, company know-how, industry knowledge and name recognition, are referred to as intangible assets. These assets are not listed on the balance sheet, nor are they considered liquid assets, but their intrinsic value adds to the credibility of the business, which can equate to a higher business valuation. A business whose reputation takes a hit can find itself needing to sell off its tangible assets to stay afloat, so these assets should be protected. Intellectual Property A variation of an intangible asset, intellectual property includes trademarks, patents, brand names, logos, formulas, inventions and other creative communications. These properties are generally covered under copyright law to protect them from imitation and infringement. A company that infringes on another company's intellectual property rights can face heavy fines and judgments if a civil suit is filed. Again, like intangible assets, intellectual property is not included on the balance sheet, but without the information intellectual property provides, a business would not be nearly as profitable.

According to the National Restaurant Association, in 2016 the Restaurant Industry accounted for 47% of consumer dollars spent on food.












Periauger Restaurant Asset Fund, LLC 506(c) Offering Platform
INTRODUCTION TO THE FUND

The Periauger Restaurant Asset Fund, LLC (the “Fund”) was formed for the purpose of acquiring and managing ground leased real estate assets with dine-in restaurant tenants.  The Fund will seek to acquire and manage ground leased real estate assets wherein there is an increased likelihood that the improvements are to revert to the leaseholder either through bankruptcy, foreclosure, or the expiration of the lease.  The Fund is managed by Commodore Capital Management, LLC (“CCM” or “Fund Manager”).  CCM is managed by a pair of highly experienced real estate and finance professionals with more than 25 combined years of experience
The Fund’s primary focus is the creation of wealth and preservation of capital through investment in alternative real estate strategies.  Through the combination of investment in stable assets with historically low market price volatility and the opportunity to collect on the collateral in the event of default, the Fund aims to expose investors to an increased upside while maintaining a stabilized market value.  The collective abilities of the management team afford the Fund an advantage over individual investors by allowing the Fund to expeditiously and efficiently address any issues related to the acquisition or management of real estate.  Additionally, the Fund’s ability to employ aggregated capital for investment provides a significant increase in the Fund’s negotiation leverage as acquisitions can close quickly without the typical financing delays faced by investors subject to institutional financing.  By way of direct involvement, the Fund Manager anticipates being able to efficiently place investment funds into select real estate assets while maintaining a more hands-on and active management style when compared with large institutional investors.








“8 in 10 Consumers say dining out with family and friends is a better use of their leisure time than cooking and cleaning up.”
— NRA | 2016 Restaurant Industry Pocket Factbook —








Periauger Restaurant Asset Fund, LLC 506(c) Offering Platform
SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS

In the interest of capital preservation, the Fund will invest in properties ground-leased, or ready to be ground leased, to casual dine-in restaurant tenants in or adjacent to major retail and neighborhood shopping centers.
The Fund Manager will source potential acquisition targets from three main sources.  The first source is to purchase part or entire portfolios of existing ground lease assets from real estate investment trusts and other institutional holders. The Fund Manager will use relationships with developers and property owners and managers as a second source of potential acquisitions. The Fund Manager will also use traditional brokerage networks as a potential source of targets.
Properties must meet criteria on three different levels: the site, the market, and the restaurant brand.  A property may be selected that does not fit every criteria if the Fund Manager determines that the asset’s risk and return profiles meet the Fund’s objective.

LLCs (Limited Liability Companies)










LLC Basics




Limited liability companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations.


By Beth Laurence, J.D.

A limited liability company (LLC) offers protection from personal liability for business debts, just like a corporation. However, unlike a corporation, which must pay its own taxes, an LLC is a pass-through tax entity: The profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners, who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship. Moreover, while setting up an LLC is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship, running one is significantly easier than running a corporation.
Here are the main features of an LLC:
Limited Personal Liability
Like shareholders of a corporation, all LLC owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims. This means that if the business itself can't pay a creditor -- such as a supplier, a lender, or a landlord -- the creditor cannot legally come after an LLC member's house, car, or other personal possessions. Because only LLC assets are used to pay off business debts, LLC owners stand to lose only the money that they've invested in the LLC. This feature is often called "limited liability."
Exceptions to Limited Liability
While LLC owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions, this protection is not absolute. This drawback is not unique to LLCs, however -- the same exceptions apply to corporations. An LLC owner can be held personally liable if he or she:

personally and directly injures someone
personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the LLC defaults
fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees' wages
intentionally does something fraudulent, illegal, or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else, or
treats the LLC as an extension of his or her personal affairs, rather than as a separate legal entity.

This last exception is the most important. If owners don't treat the LLC as a separate business, a court might decide that the LLC doesn't really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts. To keep this from happening, make sure you and your co-owners:

Act fairly and legally. Do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors, creditors, or other outsiders.
Fund your LLC adequately. Invest enough cash in the business so that your LLC can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities.
Keep LLC and personal business separate. Get a federal employer identification number, open up a business-only checking account, and keep your personal finances out of your LLC accounting books.
Create an operating agreement. Having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your LLC's separate existence. For more on this, see Nolo's article The LLC Operating Agreement.

For more information on LLC limited liability protection and the differences in state laws, see  LLCs and Limited  Liability - What Protection Do You Get?.  


Additional Protection: Business Insurance
A good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not. For instance, if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a client's back, your liability insurance policy should cover you. Insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court.
In addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations, insurance can protect the LLC's assets from lawsuits and claims. But your LLC won't be protected if it doesn't pay its bills: Commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts, whether or not they're personally guaranteed.
For more information on insurance, see Nolo's article Obtaining Small Business Insurance.
LLC Taxes
Unlike a corporation, an LLC is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes. Instead, it is what the IRS calls a "pass-through entity," like a partnership or sole proprietorship. This means that business income passes through the business to the LLC members, who report their share of profits -- or losses -- on their individual income tax returns. Each LLC member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS.
While an LLC itself doesn't pay taxes, co-owned LLCs must file Form 1065, an informational return, with the IRS each year. This form, which partnerships also have to file, sets out each LLC member's share of the LLC's profits (or losses), which the IRS reviews to make sure LLC members are correctly reporting their income.
For more information on LLC taxes, see Nolo's article How LLCs Are Taxed.
LLC Management
The owners of most small LLCs participate equally in the management of their business. This arrangement is called "member management."
There is an alternative management structure -- somewhat awkwardly called "manager management" -- in which you designate one or more owners (or even an outsider) to take responsibility for managing the LLC. The nonmanaging owners (sometimes family members who have invested in the company) simply sit back and share in LLC profits.
In a manager-managed LLC, only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the LLC. Choosing manager management sometimes makes sense, but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities. (For more information, see Nolo's Limited Liability Company (LLC) FAQ.)
Forming an LLC
To create an LLC, you file "articles of organization" (in some states called a "certificate of organization" or "certificate of formation") with the LLC division of your state government. This office is often in the same department as the corporations division, which is usually part of the secretary of state's office. Filing fees range from about $100 to $800. Now, in every state, you can  form an LLC with just one person.
Many states supply a blank one-page form for the articles of organization, on which you need only specify a few basic details about your LLC, such as its name and address, and contact information for a person involved with the LLC (usually called a "registered agent") who will receive legal papers on its behalf. Some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the LLC members.
In addition to filing articles of organization, you must create a written LLC operating agreement. You don't have to file your operating agreement with the state, but that doesn't mean you can get by without one. The operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the LLC members' rights and responsibilities, their percentage interests in the business, and their share of the profits.
To learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an LLC, read Nolo's article How to Form an LLC. To form your LLC right now, use Nolo's Online LLC, which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state.
Ending an LLC
Under the laws of many states, unless your operating agreement says otherwise, when one member wants to leave the LLC, the company dissolves. In that case, the LLC members must fulfill any remaining business obligations, pay off all debts, divide any assets and profits among themselves, and then decide whether they want to start a new LLC to continue the business with the remaining members.
Your LLC operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including "buy-sell," or buyout, provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires, dies, becomes disabled, or leaves the LLC to pursue other interests. (For more information, see Nolo's article Plan Ahead for LLC Ownership Changes.)
