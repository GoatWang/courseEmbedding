TORONTO, ONTARIO–(Marketwired – May 9, 2017) – Harvest One Cannabis Inc. (TSXV: HVST) (OTC: HRVOF) (“Harvest One” or the “Company”) through its wholly owned Swiss subsidiary, Satipharm AG (“Satipharm”), is pleased to announce that the first shipment of Satipharm’s Gelpell CBD capsules has been received by the Company’s distribution partner HL Pharma in Australia and is ready for distribution, making the capsules one of the first medicinal cannabis products available to approved prescribers in the country.
The proprietary gastro-resitant microgel capsules are able to be used in the treatment of a variety of medical conditions as approved by prescribing physicians under Australian Federal and State legislation.
Satipharm Gelpell CBD Capsules – Product Overview
Satipharm’s Gelpell CBD capsules have successfully undergone a Phase 1 Clinical Trial for safety and bioavailability and are produced under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) in Switzerland. The capsules’ active ingredient, cannabidiol (CBD), is derived from medical cannabis grown under Good Agricultural and Collection Practices (GACP) in controlled environments. For the Australian market, the capsules are currently available in a 10mg and a 50mg CBD presentation and contain no detectable levels of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Other formulations that include THC are in development and will be introduced to the market in the near future.
Bringing Satipharm’s sophisticated products to international medical cannabis markets as legislations open up is an integral part of the Company’s aggressive growth strategy. The arrival of our capsules in Australia is great news for medical cannabis patients in the country. It also further manisfests our first mover position as a truly global player in the industry.

Description


Flourish® is a comprehensive plant supplement for the natural freshwater aquarium. It contains a rich assortment of important micro elements, trace elements and other nutrients. These include calcium, magnesium, iron and other important elements that have been shown to be beneficial to aquatic plants. For macro element (NPK) fertilization, use Flourish Nitrogen™, Flourish Phosphorus™ or Flourish Potassium™ as needed. Flourish® is safe for invertebrates such as shrimp.
Flourish® is designed to be used in conjunction with other macro and micro-nutrient supplements. Other manufacturers try to include ALL necessary nutrients, leading to overdoses of micro-nutrients in an attempt to raise macro-nutrient levels.
Directions
Use 1 capful (5 mL) for each 250 L (60 US gallons) once or twice a week. For smaller doses, please note that each cap thread is approximately 1 mL. Refrigeration is recommended 3 months after opening.

															Q: I recently purchased my second bottle of Flourish and I noticed that the liquid in the bottle was a yellowish almost apple juice color whereas the original bottle I purchased contained a much darker liquid. Which one of these two colors should Flourish be? and is there anything good/bad for the aquarium as a result of the color of the Flourish?
														




A: It is normal for the color of Flourish to vary from batch to batch as this is dependent on the temperature that this product was blended at. This is of no consequence to the function of the product.







															Q: Is the "guaranteed analysis" on Flourish per dose?
														




A: Per dose, per bottle, per whatever unit of weight you choose; it is expressed as percentage by weight not in absolute weights.







															Q: Can I use Flourish on my garden vegetables?
														




A: Our products are strictly intended for aquarium use and have not been tested on anything intended for human consumption







															Q: I have a question about why you have phosphates in your Flourish? This is the #1 culprit in algae in aquaria.
														




A: I believe if you check the amount of phosphorous content (< 0.01%) you'll see that at our recommended dosing this would only add 0.0005 mg/L (ppm) of phosphate to the water. This is completely negligible and poses absolutely no risk of algae growth. So unless you are planning on a 1,000 fold overdose you don't have to worry about ever getting any measurable phosphate from using Flourish. We don't sell Flourish as a macro element supplement which is why the phosphorous, nitrogen and potassium levels are as low as they are.







															Q: I see that Flourish contains copper.  Is it safe to use with shrimp?
														




A: Yes, Flourish is safe to use with shrimp.  It is true that in large amounts, copper can be toxic to aquatic animals and invertebrates like shrimp and snails can be particularly sensitive.  However, copper is needed in trace amounts by both plants and animals, including shrimp, which is why we include it in Flourish, Flourish Trace, and our other Trace products.  The amount of copper in Flourish is so small that you would have massively overdose before you would begin to approach an amount of copper that is toxic to even the most sensitive animals.  There is usually much more copper in tap water than there is in Flourish.







															Q: Does Flourish affect pH?
														




A: Used as directed, Flourish will not alter pH.
