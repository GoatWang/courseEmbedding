HealthCor Management, L.P.
Fundamental Healthcare Investment ManagerEstablished 2005About UsHealthCor is an experienced value based investor that is dedicated to identifying global healthcare and life science equity securities that are mispriced.HealthCor Management, L.P.'s ("HealthCor") two co-founders, Joe Healey and Art Cohen, have an extensive career of equity investing in the sector through numerous market cycles and have co-invested together for over 15 years as a team.  From its base in New York City, HealthCor launched its long-short equity hedge fund strategy on September 1, 2005.
Since then, HealthCor has leveraged its security selection expertise across a platform of healthcare focused products.  HealthCor became registered with the Securities Exchange Commission as an investment adviser on March 30, 2012 under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.Investment ApproachHealthCor uses a bottom-up fundamental research driven approach to security selection.HealthCor’s investment professionals  leverage their specialized knowledge of key medical, scientific, regulatory and intellectual property data with a bottom-up fundamental research driven approach to security selection.  Idea generation is catalyst driven and every position is judged on its own ability to generate profits consistent with its risk reward profile. The firm is characterized by intensive financial analysis and places a premium on strong balance sheets, cash flow, top line organic growth and earnings revisions as well as management teams that seek to grow shareholder value. HealthCor takes into account industry themes such as utilization, consolidation, and regulatory activity when investing and concentrates in high conviction names which demonstrate margin of safety attributes.The firm invests on a balanced basis across the sector where it organizes itself around the major sub-sectors of:

Pharmaceuticals
Medtech
Biotech
Services

StrategyHealthCor’s investment strategies have different risk reward objectives consistent with their mandates. The long-short equity strategy for example, seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns through investments in equity and equity-related instruments and has demonstrated a proven ability to preserve capital in down markets. The strategy employs a modest amount of leverage and a large short portfolio predominantly consisting of stock specific ideas each intended to generate profits.   All HealthCor strategies benefit from the same rigorous bottom-up fundamental research process focused on generating the best ideas for security selection while employing a disciplined and structured approach to portfolio management. In addition, HealthCor acts as a sub-adviser to several multi-manager mutual funds and a UCITS fund. Separately, HealthCor's affiliate, HealthCor Partners Management, L.P., manages a private equity strategy which is a separately registered entity.Idea generation is catalyst driven and every position is judged on its own ability to generate profits consistent with its risk reward profile.Executive Committee & Senior Management
