Early life and education[edit]
Yeutter was born in Eustis, Nebraska on December 10, 1930,[1] during the Nebraska Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.[2] Despite a successful career in government and politics, Yeutter expressed a continued desire to remain close to his upbringing. As Deputy Trade Representative Yeutter stated, "I once wanted to stay in Nebraska and be a successful farmer. There are days when I get a yearning to return."[3]
Yeutter graduated from Eustis High School in 1948. He then attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and was a member of FarmHouse Fraternity.[4] In 1952 Yeutter graduated with a B.S. "With High Distinction", the highest scholastic honor given by the University of Nebraska. He also ranked first in the College of Agriculture graduating class and was named the "Outstanding Animal Husbandry Graduate" in the United States.[2]
Upon graduation from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which coincided with the Korean War, Yeutter enlisted as a Basic Airman in the United States Air Force. While enlisted he earned credits under the G.I. Bill to attend graduate school.[2] From the completion of his enlistment in 1957 until 1975 Yeutter worked as the operator of a 2,500-care farming enterprise in central Nebraska. He also continued to serve in the active reserve until 1977.
During an overlapping six-year period beginning in January 1960, Yeutter worked as a faculty member within the Department of Agricultural Economics at his alma mater, the University of Nebraska. While working within the Department of Agricultural Economics Yeutter completed extensive graduate work. He completed one semester of graduate studies in agricultural economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1960. After entering the College of Law at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Yeutter served as an editor of the Nebraska Law Review. In 1963 Yeutter graduated Cum Laude with a J.D. and ranked first in his graduating class. While Yeutter continued to work as a faculty member he also completed a Ph.D. in agricultural economics by 1966. While completing his J.D. and Ph.D., Yeutter taught agricultural economics and agricultural law part-time. After completing his J.D. Yeutter taught full-time from 1965 to 1966.
Professional career[edit]
Yeutter began his professional political career as the Chief of Staff to the Governor of Nebraska in January 1967. During the following two years he managed coordination between the Governor's office and the Department of Agriculture and the numerous state educational institutions. Additionally, he was responsible for lobbying Governor Norbert Tiemann's legislative program through the Nebraska legislature. In September 1968 Yeutter left public service to become the Director of the University of Nebraska Mission in Colombia. At the time it was the largest agricultural technical assistance program in the world. The mission involved six Midwestern land-grant universities funded by U.S. AID, the Kellogg Foundation and the Ford Foundation. The participating universities provided agricultural assistance to the National University of Colombia and the Colombian Agricultural Institute, which approximated the United States Department of Agriculture.
After returning from Colombia Yeutter served as Administrator of Consumer and Marketing Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture from October 1970 until December 1971. In January 1972 Yeutter was assigned to two positions in the reelection campaign of President Richard Nixon. He served as the nationwide director of agricultural and as one of ten regional directors. Following Nixon's reelection, Yeutter was appointed to Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Marketing and Consumer Services within the U.S. Department of Agriculture in January 1973. In March 1974 Yeutter was appointed Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs. As Assistant Secretary, Yeutter was in charge of negotiating an end to a trade war between the United States and the European Economic Community over cheese subsidizes.[5]
In June 1975 Yeutter shifted from the Department of Agriculture to the Executive Office of the President, in which he served as Deputy Special Trade Representative. In this position Yeutter worked as an Ambassador in trade negotiations with foreign countries. In February 1977, shortly after Gerald Ford vacated the Presidency, Yeutter exited public service.
In April 1977 Yeutter became a senior partner at the law firm Nelson, Harding, Yeutter & Leonard, which was primarily located in Lincoln, Nebraska. He continued to work at the firm until June 1978.
Yeutter served as President and CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's second largest futures exchange at the time, from July 1978 until June 1985. During that period the trade volume of agricultural, currency and interest rate futures more than tripled. While serving as President, Yeutter negotiated the use of the Tokyo Stock Exchange index for futures and options trading. He also encouraged European investors to invest in currency futures and options at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.[5] More than 400 visits to the Exchange by members of Congress during Yeutter's tenure provided him with political experience that which would become especially valuable when he worked directly with Congress between 1985 and 1993.
United States Trade Representative[edit]
After working for eight years in the private sector Yeutter returned to public office in July 1985. After Reagan's nomination Yeutter was confirmed by the Senate as U.S. Trade Representative on June 28, 1985. He succeeded William E. Brock, who was named Secretary of Labor.[6] While holding the position Yeutter helped pass the 1988 Trade Bill through Congress, completed the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement, managed the initial negotiations regarding the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and used American trade laws to open foreign markets to American goods.[2]
Yeutter was perceived to be an outsider because of his inexperience interacting with Congress to develop legislation and because he was only mildly acquainted with the President. These characteristics contrasted with his 11 predecessors, who possessed greater political credentials and a closer relationship to the President. In fact, Yeutter argued that his independence from Reagan reflected his success in the position.[7]
Along with the Commerce Secretary, Malcolm Baldrige, and Treasury Secretary, James Baker, Yeutter was accredited with the formulation of a comprehensive US trade policy after his first 4 months in office.[7][8] At this point in time the Reagan administration was faced with mounting pressure from the Congress for protectionist policy that would tackle the mounting international trade deficit.[9] Additionally, Yeutter faced tense trade negotiations with Japan. In June 1985 Yeutter initiated an investigation based on Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Japan for unfair barriers to sale of American electronic products.[10] In October Yeutter took similar action against South Korea based on a complaint filed by the MPAA. The unfair trade practices outlined in the complaint were exacerbated by at $4 billion trade deficit with South Korea during the previous year.[11]
On February 3, 1987, while discussing the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement at a Brookings Institution seminar, Yeutter was quoted as saying the agreement would risk the loss of Canadian culture.[12] The statement reflected the Canadian public concern that the free trade agreement would lead to unprecedented American economic and cultural dominance. Although the comment was not notable in the United States, it produced considerable controversy in Canada. In response to the comment Prime Minister Brian Mulroney stated in the Canadian Parliament that "his remarks showed a stunning ignorance of Canada".[2][13]
Secretary of Agriculture[edit]
Yeutter served as Secretary of Agriculture under George H. W. Bush from February 1989 until February 1991. His nomination was approved by the Senate on February 9, 1989.[14] Yeutter was slightly reluctant to take this new position after enduring the fast pace of United States trade policy, but his fondness for agricultural issues overcame that sentiment.[2]
When he took office Yeutter's primary concern was the quinquennial farm bill. The previous bill was passed in 1985 and had focused on providing financial support to American farmers. During the early 1980s a high rate of bankruptcy among farmers prompted the federal government to provide unprecedented subsidies through the Food Security Act of 1985. The development of what was to become the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 was largely influenced by Uruguay Round negotiations, which Yeutter led as USTR.[2] Additionally, the 1990 farm bill removed United States farm subsidies created in the 1985 bill.
Republican National Committee Chairman[edit]
In January 1991 Yeutter took the place of Lee Atwater as Chairman of the Republican National Committee. Yeutter was elected after George H. W. Bush's first choice for chairman, William Bennett, revoked his initial acceptance of the position due to a potential conflict of interest. The protracted and turbulent process of finding a successor to Atwater was used by Democrats to characterize the Republican party as a fractured organization.[15] Yeutter's "substantive" leadership style and belief that "good guys finished first, not last," created doubt among some members of the Republican party who preferred Atwater's more hard-edge political style.[16]
Atwater's illness prevented the Committee from functioning normally. Before Yeutter was selected, fundraising had dropped off substantially and about 25% of staff had been laid off. Once he was elected, Yeutter focused on stabilizing the level of fundraising and winning the nationwide redistricting battles during 1991.
Counselor to the President[edit]

On January 31, 1992, President George H. W. Bush named Yeutter as counselor to the president for domestic policy. Yeutter was replaced by Richard Bond as Chairman of the Republican National Committee.[17] The cabinet-level position was left vacant since Edwin Meese III held the post under Ronald Reagan. Unlike Meese's post, Yeutter had additional control over the Bush administration economic and domestic councils, which formed the cabinet's policy-making apparatus. The additional control was initially opposed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who led the economic policy council.[18][19]
Post public service[edit]
Beginning in February 1993, Yeutter split his time working as a senior advisor at Hogan Lovells (formerly Hogan & Hartson L.L.P.) in Washington D.C. and holding numerous corporate directorships. In March 1997 Yeutter registered to lobby on the farm bill for the American Farmland Trust.[20]
Corporate directorships[edit]
Yeutter's first major corporate directorship was with ConAgra Foods while serving as the President and CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. He resigned from the position in 1985 when he became U.S. Trade Representative. While serving as Chairman of the Republican National Committee Yeutter joined the boards of Caterpillar Inc. and Texas Instruments. He resigned from both positions in 1992 when he became Counselor to the President. Yeutter was reinstated to the boards of ConAgra Foods, Caterpillar Inc. and Texas Instruments in 1993 and served on all three until he hit the maximum age limit for board members.
After leaving public service in 1993 Yeutter served as the director of Danielson Holding Corporation and America First. Additionally, he served as Chairman of the Board of Oppenheimer Funds, Inc. and CropSolutions, Inc.[21] He previously served on the board of directors of Coventa Holding Corp., Chicago Climate Exchange, FMC Corporation, B.A.T. Industries and later American Commercial Lines Inc., Covanta Holding Corporation, and Weyerhaeuser. Yeutter currently serves on the board of directors of Neogen Corporation and Burlington Capital Group.[22] Yeutter is also an owner of the Keating Network LLC, a company designed to help small and medium-sized businesses.[23]
Family and personal life[edit]
After graduating from the University of Nebraska, in 1952, Yeutter married his first wife, Jeanne Vierk, with whom he had four children, Brad Yeutter, Gregg Yeutter, Kim (Yeutter) Bottimore, and Van Yeutter.[2][not in citation given] Vierk served as the informal Chairman of the Cabinet Wives Group during the President George H. W. Bush Administration.
Two years after Jeanne's death, Yeutter married Cristena Bach. Bach had served in several politically appointive positions during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, including a stint on the White House staff under President Reagan. They adopted three daughters, Victoria, Elena, and Olivia.[citation needed]
Yeutter died on March 4, 2017 at his home in Potomac, Maryland from colon cancer. He was 86.[24]
Honors and awards[edit]
Yeutter received honorary doctorate degrees from Clemson University, DePaul University, Georgetown University, Nebraska Wesleyan University, Santa Clara University, University of Arizona, University of Maryland Eastern Shore and the University of Nebraska.
Yeutter was made an Honorary Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2012 New Year Honours, for services to New Zealand–United States relations.[25]
Yeutter received a statue at University of Nebraska – Lincoln in September 2014 for his accomplishment of being Secretary of Agriculture after graduating from the school. It is found in the Jeanne Yeutter Garden (named after his first wife) on the East campus.
Yeutter was named an Honorary Member of the American Society of Agronomy (ASA) in 1990. He also was the E.T. & Vam York ASA Distinguished Keynote lecturer, who in his remarks at the 2002 ASA Annual Meeting stressed links between agricultural science, the world economy, and the global food supply.

Early life and education[edit]
Yeutter was born in Eustis, Nebraska on December 10, 1930,[1] during the Nebraska Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.[2] Despite a successful career in government and politics, Yeutter expressed a continued desire to remain close to his upbringing. As Deputy Trade Representative Yeutter stated, "I once wanted to stay in Nebraska and be a successful farmer. There are days when I get a yearning to return."[3]
Yeutter graduated from Eustis High School in 1948. He then attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and was a member of FarmHouse Fraternity.[4] In 1952 Yeutter graduated with a B.S. "With High Distinction", the highest scholastic honor given by the University of Nebraska. He also ranked first in the College of Agriculture graduating class and was named the "Outstanding Animal Husbandry Graduate" in the United States.[2]
Upon graduation from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which coincided with the Korean War, Yeutter enlisted as a Basic Airman in the United States Air Force. While enlisted he earned credits under the G.I. Bill to attend graduate school.[2] From the completion of his enlistment in 1957 until 1975 Yeutter worked as the operator of a 2,500-care farming enterprise in central Nebraska. He also continued to serve in the active reserve until 1977.
During an overlapping six-year period beginning in January 1960, Yeutter worked as a faculty member within the Department of Agricultural Economics at his alma mater, the University of Nebraska. While working within the Department of Agricultural Economics Yeutter completed extensive graduate work. He completed one semester of graduate studies in agricultural economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1960. After entering the College of Law at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Yeutter served as an editor of the Nebraska Law Review. In 1963 Yeutter graduated Cum Laude with a J.D. and ranked first in his graduating class. While Yeutter continued to work as a faculty member he also completed a Ph.D. in agricultural economics by 1966. While completing his J.D. and Ph.D., Yeutter taught agricultural economics and agricultural law part-time. After completing his J.D. Yeutter taught full-time from 1965 to 1966.
Professional career[edit]
Yeutter began his professional political career as the Chief of Staff to the Governor of Nebraska in January 1967. During the following two years he managed coordination between the Governor's office and the Department of Agriculture and the numerous state educational institutions. Additionally, he was responsible for lobbying Governor Norbert Tiemann's legislative program through the Nebraska legislature. In September 1968 Yeutter left public service to become the Director of the University of Nebraska Mission in Colombia. At the time it was the largest agricultural technical assistance program in the world. The mission involved six Midwestern land-grant universities funded by U.S. AID, the Kellogg Foundation and the Ford Foundation. The participating universities provided agricultural assistance to the National University of Colombia and the Colombian Agricultural Institute, which approximated the United States Department of Agriculture.
After returning from Colombia Yeutter served as Administrator of Consumer and Marketing Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture from October 1970 until December 1971. In January 1972 Yeutter was assigned to two positions in the reelection campaign of President Richard Nixon. He served as the nationwide director of agricultural and as one of ten regional directors. Following Nixon's reelection, Yeutter was appointed to Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Marketing and Consumer Services within the U.S. Department of Agriculture in January 1973. In March 1974 Yeutter was appointed Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs. As Assistant Secretary, Yeutter was in charge of negotiating an end to a trade war between the United States and the European Economic Community over cheese subsidizes.[5]
In June 1975 Yeutter shifted from the Department of Agriculture to the Executive Office of the President, in which he served as Deputy Special Trade Representative. In this position Yeutter worked as an Ambassador in trade negotiations with foreign countries. In February 1977, shortly after Gerald Ford vacated the Presidency, Yeutter exited public service.
In April 1977 Yeutter became a senior partner at the law firm Nelson, Harding, Yeutter & Leonard, which was primarily located in Lincoln, Nebraska. He continued to work at the firm until June 1978.
Yeutter served as President and CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's second largest futures exchange at the time, from July 1978 until June 1985. During that period the trade volume of agricultural, currency and interest rate futures more than tripled. While serving as President, Yeutter negotiated the use of the Tokyo Stock Exchange index for futures and options trading. He also encouraged European investors to invest in currency futures and options at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.[5] More than 400 visits to the Exchange by members of Congress during Yeutter's tenure provided him with political experience that which would become especially valuable when he worked directly with Congress between 1985 and 1993.
United States Trade Representative[edit]
After working for eight years in the private sector Yeutter returned to public office in July 1985. After Reagan's nomination Yeutter was confirmed by the Senate as U.S. Trade Representative on June 28, 1985. He succeeded William E. Brock, who was named Secretary of Labor.[6] While holding the position Yeutter helped pass the 1988 Trade Bill through Congress, completed the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement, managed the initial negotiations regarding the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and used American trade laws to open foreign markets to American goods.[2]
Yeutter was perceived to be an outsider because of his inexperience interacting with Congress to develop legislation and because he was only mildly acquainted with the President. These characteristics contrasted with his 11 predecessors, who possessed greater political credentials and a closer relationship to the President. In fact, Yeutter argued that his independence from Reagan reflected his success in the position.[7]
Along with the Commerce Secretary, Malcolm Baldrige, and Treasury Secretary, James Baker, Yeutter was accredited with the formulation of a comprehensive US trade policy after his first 4 months in office.[7][8] At this point in time the Reagan administration was faced with mounting pressure from the Congress for protectionist policy that would tackle the mounting international trade deficit.[9] Additionally, Yeutter faced tense trade negotiations with Japan. In June 1985 Yeutter initiated an investigation based on Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Japan for unfair barriers to sale of American electronic products.[10] In October Yeutter took similar action against South Korea based on a complaint filed by the MPAA. The unfair trade practices outlined in the complaint were exacerbated by at $4 billion trade deficit with South Korea during the previous year.[11]
On February 3, 1987, while discussing the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement at a Brookings Institution seminar, Yeutter was quoted as saying the agreement would risk the loss of Canadian culture.[12] The statement reflected the Canadian public concern that the free trade agreement would lead to unprecedented American economic and cultural dominance. Although the comment was not notable in the United States, it produced considerable controversy in Canada. In response to the comment Prime Minister Brian Mulroney stated in the Canadian Parliament that "his remarks showed a stunning ignorance of Canada".[2][13]
Secretary of Agriculture[edit]
Yeutter served as Secretary of Agriculture under George H. W. Bush from February 1989 until February 1991. His nomination was approved by the Senate on February 9, 1989.[14] Yeutter was slightly reluctant to take this new position after enduring the fast pace of United States trade policy, but his fondness for agricultural issues overcame that sentiment.[2]
When he took office Yeutter's primary concern was the quinquennial farm bill. The previous bill was passed in 1985 and had focused on providing financial support to American farmers. During the early 1980s a high rate of bankruptcy among farmers prompted the federal government to provide unprecedented subsidies through the Food Security Act of 1985. The development of what was to become the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 was largely influenced by Uruguay Round negotiations, which Yeutter led as USTR.[2] Additionally, the 1990 farm bill removed United States farm subsidies created in the 1985 bill.
Republican National Committee Chairman[edit]
In January 1991 Yeutter took the place of Lee Atwater as Chairman of the Republican National Committee. Yeutter was elected after George H. W. Bush's first choice for chairman, William Bennett, revoked his initial acceptance of the position due to a potential conflict of interest. The protracted and turbulent process of finding a successor to Atwater was used by Democrats to characterize the Republican party as a fractured organization.[15] Yeutter's "substantive" leadership style and belief that "good guys finished first, not last," created doubt among some members of the Republican party who preferred Atwater's more hard-edge political style.[16]
Atwater's illness prevented the Committee from functioning normally. Before Yeutter was selected, fundraising had dropped off substantially and about 25% of staff had been laid off. Once he was elected, Yeutter focused on stabilizing the level of fundraising and winning the nationwide redistricting battles during 1991.
Counselor to the President[edit]

On January 31, 1992, President George H. W. Bush named Yeutter as counselor to the president for domestic policy. Yeutter was replaced by Richard Bond as Chairman of the Republican National Committee.[17] The cabinet-level position was left vacant since Edwin Meese III held the post under Ronald Reagan. Unlike Meese's post, Yeutter had additional control over the Bush administration economic and domestic councils, which formed the cabinet's policy-making apparatus. The additional control was initially opposed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who led the economic policy council.[18][19]
Post public service[edit]
Beginning in February 1993, Yeutter split his time working as a senior advisor at Hogan Lovells (formerly Hogan & Hartson L.L.P.) in Washington D.C. and holding numerous corporate directorships. In March 1997 Yeutter registered to lobby on the farm bill for the American Farmland Trust.[20]
Corporate directorships[edit]
Yeutter's first major corporate directorship was with ConAgra Foods while serving as the President and CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. He resigned from the position in 1985 when he became U.S. Trade Representative. While serving as Chairman of the Republican National Committee Yeutter joined the boards of Caterpillar Inc. and Texas Instruments. He resigned from both positions in 1992 when he became Counselor to the President. Yeutter was reinstated to the boards of ConAgra Foods, Caterpillar Inc. and Texas Instruments in 1993 and served on all three until he hit the maximum age limit for board members.
After leaving public service in 1993 Yeutter served as the director of Danielson Holding Corporation and America First. Additionally, he served as Chairman of the Board of Oppenheimer Funds, Inc. and CropSolutions, Inc.[21] He previously served on the board of directors of Coventa Holding Corp., Chicago Climate Exchange, FMC Corporation, B.A.T. Industries and later American Commercial Lines Inc., Covanta Holding Corporation, and Weyerhaeuser. Yeutter currently serves on the board of directors of Neogen Corporation and Burlington Capital Group.[22] Yeutter is also an owner of the Keating Network LLC, a company designed to help small and medium-sized businesses.[23]
Family and personal life[edit]
After graduating from the University of Nebraska, in 1952, Yeutter married his first wife, Jeanne Vierk, with whom he had four children, Brad Yeutter, Gregg Yeutter, Kim (Yeutter) Bottimore, and Van Yeutter.[2][not in citation given] Vierk served as the informal Chairman of the Cabinet Wives Group during the President George H. W. Bush Administration.
Two years after Jeanne's death, Yeutter married Cristena Bach. Bach had served in several politically appointive positions during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, including a stint on the White House staff under President Reagan. They adopted three daughters, Victoria, Elena, and Olivia.[citation needed]
Yeutter died on March 4, 2017 at his home in Potomac, Maryland from colon cancer. He was 86.[24]
Honors and awards[edit]
Yeutter received honorary doctorate degrees from Clemson University, DePaul University, Georgetown University, Nebraska Wesleyan University, Santa Clara University, University of Arizona, University of Maryland Eastern Shore and the University of Nebraska.
Yeutter was made an Honorary Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2012 New Year Honours, for services to New Zealand–United States relations.[25]
Yeutter received a statue at University of Nebraska – Lincoln in September 2014 for his accomplishment of being Secretary of Agriculture after graduating from the school. It is found in the Jeanne Yeutter Garden (named after his first wife) on the East campus.
Yeutter was named an Honorary Member of the American Society of Agronomy (ASA) in 1990. He also was the E.T. & Vam York ASA Distinguished Keynote lecturer, who in his remarks at the 2002 ASA Annual Meeting stressed links between agricultural science, the world economy, and the global food supply.

Early life and education[edit]
Yeutter was born in Eustis, Nebraska on December 10, 1930,[1] during the Nebraska Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.[2] Despite a successful career in government and politics, Yeutter expressed a continued desire to remain close to his upbringing. As Deputy Trade Representative Yeutter stated, "I once wanted to stay in Nebraska and be a successful farmer. There are days when I get a yearning to return."[3]
Yeutter graduated from Eustis High School in 1948. He then attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and was a member of FarmHouse Fraternity.[4] In 1952 Yeutter graduated with a B.S. "With High Distinction", the highest scholastic honor given by the University of Nebraska. He also ranked first in the College of Agriculture graduating class and was named the "Outstanding Animal Husbandry Graduate" in the United States.[2]
Upon graduation from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which coincided with the Korean War, Yeutter enlisted as a Basic Airman in the United States Air Force. While enlisted he earned credits under the G.I. Bill to attend graduate school.[2] From the completion of his enlistment in 1957 until 1975 Yeutter worked as the operator of a 2,500-care farming enterprise in central Nebraska. He also continued to serve in the active reserve until 1977.
During an overlapping six-year period beginning in January 1960, Yeutter worked as a faculty member within the Department of Agricultural Economics at his alma mater, the University of Nebraska. While working within the Department of Agricultural Economics Yeutter completed extensive graduate work. He completed one semester of graduate studies in agricultural economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1960. After entering the College of Law at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Yeutter served as an editor of the Nebraska Law Review. In 1963 Yeutter graduated Cum Laude with a J.D. and ranked first in his graduating class. While Yeutter continued to work as a faculty member he also completed a Ph.D. in agricultural economics by 1966. While completing his J.D. and Ph.D., Yeutter taught agricultural economics and agricultural law part-time. After completing his J.D. Yeutter taught full-time from 1965 to 1966.
Professional career[edit]
Yeutter began his professional political career as the Chief of Staff to the Governor of Nebraska in January 1967. During the following two years he managed coordination between the Governor's office and the Department of Agriculture and the numerous state educational institutions. Additionally, he was responsible for lobbying Governor Norbert Tiemann's legislative program through the Nebraska legislature. In September 1968 Yeutter left public service to become the Director of the University of Nebraska Mission in Colombia. At the time it was the largest agricultural technical assistance program in the world. The mission involved six Midwestern land-grant universities funded by U.S. AID, the Kellogg Foundation and the Ford Foundation. The participating universities provided agricultural assistance to the National University of Colombia and the Colombian Agricultural Institute, which approximated the United States Department of Agriculture.
After returning from Colombia Yeutter served as Administrator of Consumer and Marketing Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture from October 1970 until December 1971. In January 1972 Yeutter was assigned to two positions in the reelection campaign of President Richard Nixon. He served as the nationwide director of agricultural and as one of ten regional directors. Following Nixon's reelection, Yeutter was appointed to Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Marketing and Consumer Services within the U.S. Department of Agriculture in January 1973. In March 1974 Yeutter was appointed Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs. As Assistant Secretary, Yeutter was in charge of negotiating an end to a trade war between the United States and the European Economic Community over cheese subsidizes.[5]
In June 1975 Yeutter shifted from the Department of Agriculture to the Executive Office of the President, in which he served as Deputy Special Trade Representative. In this position Yeutter worked as an Ambassador in trade negotiations with foreign countries. In February 1977, shortly after Gerald Ford vacated the Presidency, Yeutter exited public service.
In April 1977 Yeutter became a senior partner at the law firm Nelson, Harding, Yeutter & Leonard, which was primarily located in Lincoln, Nebraska. He continued to work at the firm until June 1978.
Yeutter served as President and CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's second largest futures exchange at the time, from July 1978 until June 1985. During that period the trade volume of agricultural, currency and interest rate futures more than tripled. While serving as President, Yeutter negotiated the use of the Tokyo Stock Exchange index for futures and options trading. He also encouraged European investors to invest in currency futures and options at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.[5] More than 400 visits to the Exchange by members of Congress during Yeutter's tenure provided him with political experience that which would become especially valuable when he worked directly with Congress between 1985 and 1993.
United States Trade Representative[edit]
After working for eight years in the private sector Yeutter returned to public office in July 1985. After Reagan's nomination Yeutter was confirmed by the Senate as U.S. Trade Representative on June 28, 1985. He succeeded William E. Brock, who was named Secretary of Labor.[6] While holding the position Yeutter helped pass the 1988 Trade Bill through Congress, completed the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement, managed the initial negotiations regarding the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and used American trade laws to open foreign markets to American goods.[2]
Yeutter was perceived to be an outsider because of his inexperience interacting with Congress to develop legislation and because he was only mildly acquainted with the President. These characteristics contrasted with his 11 predecessors, who possessed greater political credentials and a closer relationship to the President. In fact, Yeutter argued that his independence from Reagan reflected his success in the position.[7]
Along with the Commerce Secretary, Malcolm Baldrige, and Treasury Secretary, James Baker, Yeutter was accredited with the formulation of a comprehensive US trade policy after his first 4 months in office.[7][8] At this point in time the Reagan administration was faced with mounting pressure from the Congress for protectionist policy that would tackle the mounting international trade deficit.[9] Additionally, Yeutter faced tense trade negotiations with Japan. In June 1985 Yeutter initiated an investigation based on Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Japan for unfair barriers to sale of American electronic products.[10] In October Yeutter took similar action against South Korea based on a complaint filed by the MPAA. The unfair trade practices outlined in the complaint were exacerbated by at $4 billion trade deficit with South Korea during the previous year.[11]
On February 3, 1987, while discussing the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement at a Brookings Institution seminar, Yeutter was quoted as saying the agreement would risk the loss of Canadian culture.[12] The statement reflected the Canadian public concern that the free trade agreement would lead to unprecedented American economic and cultural dominance. Although the comment was not notable in the United States, it produced considerable controversy in Canada. In response to the comment Prime Minister Brian Mulroney stated in the Canadian Parliament that "his remarks showed a stunning ignorance of Canada".[2][13]
Secretary of Agriculture[edit]
Yeutter served as Secretary of Agriculture under George H. W. Bush from February 1989 until February 1991. His nomination was approved by the Senate on February 9, 1989.[14] Yeutter was slightly reluctant to take this new position after enduring the fast pace of United States trade policy, but his fondness for agricultural issues overcame that sentiment.[2]
When he took office Yeutter's primary concern was the quinquennial farm bill. The previous bill was passed in 1985 and had focused on providing financial support to American farmers. During the early 1980s a high rate of bankruptcy among farmers prompted the federal government to provide unprecedented subsidies through the Food Security Act of 1985. The development of what was to become the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 was largely influenced by Uruguay Round negotiations, which Yeutter led as USTR.[2] Additionally, the 1990 farm bill removed United States farm subsidies created in the 1985 bill.
Republican National Committee Chairman[edit]
In January 1991 Yeutter took the place of Lee Atwater as Chairman of the Republican National Committee. Yeutter was elected after George H. W. Bush's first choice for chairman, William Bennett, revoked his initial acceptance of the position due to a potential conflict of interest. The protracted and turbulent process of finding a successor to Atwater was used by Democrats to characterize the Republican party as a fractured organization.[15] Yeutter's "substantive" leadership style and belief that "good guys finished first, not last," created doubt among some members of the Republican party who preferred Atwater's more hard-edge political style.[16]
Atwater's illness prevented the Committee from functioning normally. Before Yeutter was selected, fundraising had dropped off substantially and about 25% of staff had been laid off. Once he was elected, Yeutter focused on stabilizing the level of fundraising and winning the nationwide redistricting battles during 1991.
Counselor to the President[edit]

On January 31, 1992, President George H. W. Bush named Yeutter as counselor to the president for domestic policy. Yeutter was replaced by Richard Bond as Chairman of the Republican National Committee.[17] The cabinet-level position was left vacant since Edwin Meese III held the post under Ronald Reagan. Unlike Meese's post, Yeutter had additional control over the Bush administration economic and domestic councils, which formed the cabinet's policy-making apparatus. The additional control was initially opposed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who led the economic policy council.[18][19]
Post public service[edit]
Beginning in February 1993, Yeutter split his time working as a senior advisor at Hogan Lovells (formerly Hogan & Hartson L.L.P.) in Washington D.C. and holding numerous corporate directorships. In March 1997 Yeutter registered to lobby on the farm bill for the American Farmland Trust.[20]
Corporate directorships[edit]
Yeutter's first major corporate directorship was with ConAgra Foods while serving as the President and CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. He resigned from the position in 1985 when he became U.S. Trade Representative. While serving as Chairman of the Republican National Committee Yeutter joined the boards of Caterpillar Inc. and Texas Instruments. He resigned from both positions in 1992 when he became Counselor to the President. Yeutter was reinstated to the boards of ConAgra Foods, Caterpillar Inc. and Texas Instruments in 1993 and served on all three until he hit the maximum age limit for board members.
After leaving public service in 1993 Yeutter served as the director of Danielson Holding Corporation and America First. Additionally, he served as Chairman of the Board of Oppenheimer Funds, Inc. and CropSolutions, Inc.[21] He previously served on the board of directors of Coventa Holding Corp., Chicago Climate Exchange, FMC Corporation, B.A.T. Industries and later American Commercial Lines Inc., Covanta Holding Corporation, and Weyerhaeuser. Yeutter currently serves on the board of directors of Neogen Corporation and Burlington Capital Group.[22] Yeutter is also an owner of the Keating Network LLC, a company designed to help small and medium-sized businesses.[23]
Family and personal life[edit]
After graduating from the University of Nebraska, in 1952, Yeutter married his first wife, Jeanne Vierk, with whom he had four children, Brad Yeutter, Gregg Yeutter, Kim (Yeutter) Bottimore, and Van Yeutter.[2][not in citation given] Vierk served as the informal Chairman of the Cabinet Wives Group during the President George H. W. Bush Administration.
Two years after Jeanne's death, Yeutter married Cristena Bach. Bach had served in several politically appointive positions during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, including a stint on the White House staff under President Reagan. They adopted three daughters, Victoria, Elena, and Olivia.[citation needed]
Yeutter died on March 4, 2017 at his home in Potomac, Maryland from colon cancer. He was 86.[24]
Honors and awards[edit]
Yeutter received honorary doctorate degrees from Clemson University, DePaul University, Georgetown University, Nebraska Wesleyan University, Santa Clara University, University of Arizona, University of Maryland Eastern Shore and the University of Nebraska.
Yeutter was made an Honorary Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2012 New Year Honours, for services to New Zealand–United States relations.[25]
Yeutter received a statue at University of Nebraska – Lincoln in September 2014 for his accomplishment of being Secretary of Agriculture after graduating from the school. It is found in the Jeanne Yeutter Garden (named after his first wife) on the East campus.
Yeutter was named an Honorary Member of the American Society of Agronomy (ASA) in 1990. He also was the E.T. & Vam York ASA Distinguished Keynote lecturer, who in his remarks at the 2002 ASA Annual Meeting stressed links between agricultural science, the world economy, and the global food supply.

Early life and education[edit]
Yeutter was born in Eustis, Nebraska on December 10, 1930,[1] during the Nebraska Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.[2] Despite a successful career in government and politics, Yeutter expressed a continued desire to remain close to his upbringing. As Deputy Trade Representative Yeutter stated, "I once wanted to stay in Nebraska and be a successful farmer. There are days when I get a yearning to return."[3]
Yeutter graduated from Eustis High School in 1948. He then attended the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and was a member of FarmHouse Fraternity.[4] In 1952 Yeutter graduated with a B.S. "With High Distinction", the highest scholastic honor given by the University of Nebraska. He also ranked first in the College of Agriculture graduating class and was named the "Outstanding Animal Husbandry Graduate" in the United States.[2]
Upon graduation from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which coincided with the Korean War, Yeutter enlisted as a Basic Airman in the United States Air Force. While enlisted he earned credits under the G.I. Bill to attend graduate school.[2] From the completion of his enlistment in 1957 until 1975 Yeutter worked as the operator of a 2,500-care farming enterprise in central Nebraska. He also continued to serve in the active reserve until 1977.
During an overlapping six-year period beginning in January 1960, Yeutter worked as a faculty member within the Department of Agricultural Economics at his alma mater, the University of Nebraska. While working within the Department of Agricultural Economics Yeutter completed extensive graduate work. He completed one semester of graduate studies in agricultural economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1960. After entering the College of Law at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Yeutter served as an editor of the Nebraska Law Review. In 1963 Yeutter graduated Cum Laude with a J.D. and ranked first in his graduating class. While Yeutter continued to work as a faculty member he also completed a Ph.D. in agricultural economics by 1966. While completing his J.D. and Ph.D., Yeutter taught agricultural economics and agricultural law part-time. After completing his J.D. Yeutter taught full-time from 1965 to 1966.
Professional career[edit]
Yeutter began his professional political career as the Chief of Staff to the Governor of Nebraska in January 1967. During the following two years he managed coordination between the Governor's office and the Department of Agriculture and the numerous state educational institutions. Additionally, he was responsible for lobbying Governor Norbert Tiemann's legislative program through the Nebraska legislature. In September 1968 Yeutter left public service to become the Director of the University of Nebraska Mission in Colombia. At the time it was the largest agricultural technical assistance program in the world. The mission involved six Midwestern land-grant universities funded by U.S. AID, the Kellogg Foundation and the Ford Foundation. The participating universities provided agricultural assistance to the National University of Colombia and the Colombian Agricultural Institute, which approximated the United States Department of Agriculture.
After returning from Colombia Yeutter served as Administrator of Consumer and Marketing Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture from October 1970 until December 1971. In January 1972 Yeutter was assigned to two positions in the reelection campaign of President Richard Nixon. He served as the nationwide director of agricultural and as one of ten regional directors. Following Nixon's reelection, Yeutter was appointed to Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Marketing and Consumer Services within the U.S. Department of Agriculture in January 1973. In March 1974 Yeutter was appointed Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs. As Assistant Secretary, Yeutter was in charge of negotiating an end to a trade war between the United States and the European Economic Community over cheese subsidizes.[5]
In June 1975 Yeutter shifted from the Department of Agriculture to the Executive Office of the President, in which he served as Deputy Special Trade Representative. In this position Yeutter worked as an Ambassador in trade negotiations with foreign countries. In February 1977, shortly after Gerald Ford vacated the Presidency, Yeutter exited public service.
In April 1977 Yeutter became a senior partner at the law firm Nelson, Harding, Yeutter & Leonard, which was primarily located in Lincoln, Nebraska. He continued to work at the firm until June 1978.
Yeutter served as President and CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's second largest futures exchange at the time, from July 1978 until June 1985. During that period the trade volume of agricultural, currency and interest rate futures more than tripled. While serving as President, Yeutter negotiated the use of the Tokyo Stock Exchange index for futures and options trading. He also encouraged European investors to invest in currency futures and options at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.[5] More than 400 visits to the Exchange by members of Congress during Yeutter's tenure provided him with political experience that which would become especially valuable when he worked directly with Congress between 1985 and 1993.
United States Trade Representative[edit]
After working for eight years in the private sector Yeutter returned to public office in July 1985. After Reagan's nomination Yeutter was confirmed by the Senate as U.S. Trade Representative on June 28, 1985. He succeeded William E. Brock, who was named Secretary of Labor.[6] While holding the position Yeutter helped pass the 1988 Trade Bill through Congress, completed the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement, managed the initial negotiations regarding the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and used American trade laws to open foreign markets to American goods.[2]
Yeutter was perceived to be an outsider because of his inexperience interacting with Congress to develop legislation and because he was only mildly acquainted with the President. These characteristics contrasted with his 11 predecessors, who possessed greater political credentials and a closer relationship to the President. In fact, Yeutter argued that his independence from Reagan reflected his success in the position.[7]
Along with the Commerce Secretary, Malcolm Baldrige, and Treasury Secretary, James Baker, Yeutter was accredited with the formulation of a comprehensive US trade policy after his first 4 months in office.[7][8] At this point in time the Reagan administration was faced with mounting pressure from the Congress for protectionist policy that would tackle the mounting international trade deficit.[9] Additionally, Yeutter faced tense trade negotiations with Japan. In June 1985 Yeutter initiated an investigation based on Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Japan for unfair barriers to sale of American electronic products.[10] In October Yeutter took similar action against South Korea based on a complaint filed by the MPAA. The unfair trade practices outlined in the complaint were exacerbated by at $4 billion trade deficit with South Korea during the previous year.[11]
On February 3, 1987, while discussing the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement at a Brookings Institution seminar, Yeutter was quoted as saying the agreement would risk the loss of Canadian culture.[12] The statement reflected the Canadian public concern that the free trade agreement would lead to unprecedented American economic and cultural dominance. Although the comment was not notable in the United States, it produced considerable controversy in Canada. In response to the comment Prime Minister Brian Mulroney stated in the Canadian Parliament that "his remarks showed a stunning ignorance of Canada".[2][13]
Secretary of Agriculture[edit]
Yeutter served as Secretary of Agriculture under George H. W. Bush from February 1989 until February 1991. His nomination was approved by the Senate on February 9, 1989.[14] Yeutter was slightly reluctant to take this new position after enduring the fast pace of United States trade policy, but his fondness for agricultural issues overcame that sentiment.[2]
When he took office Yeutter's primary concern was the quinquennial farm bill. The previous bill was passed in 1985 and had focused on providing financial support to American farmers. During the early 1980s a high rate of bankruptcy among farmers prompted the federal government to provide unprecedented subsidies through the Food Security Act of 1985. The development of what was to become the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 was largely influenced by Uruguay Round negotiations, which Yeutter led as USTR.[2] Additionally, the 1990 farm bill removed United States farm subsidies created in the 1985 bill.
Republican National Committee Chairman[edit]
In January 1991 Yeutter took the place of Lee Atwater as Chairman of the Republican National Committee. Yeutter was elected after George H. W. Bush's first choice for chairman, William Bennett, revoked his initial acceptance of the position due to a potential conflict of interest. The protracted and turbulent process of finding a successor to Atwater was used by Democrats to characterize the Republican party as a fractured organization.[15] Yeutter's "substantive" leadership style and belief that "good guys finished first, not last," created doubt among some members of the Republican party who preferred Atwater's more hard-edge political style.[16]
Atwater's illness prevented the Committee from functioning normally. Before Yeutter was selected, fundraising had dropped off substantially and about 25% of staff had been laid off. Once he was elected, Yeutter focused on stabilizing the level of fundraising and winning the nationwide redistricting battles during 1991.
Counselor to the President[edit]

On January 31, 1992, President George H. W. Bush named Yeutter as counselor to the president for domestic policy. Yeutter was replaced by Richard Bond as Chairman of the Republican National Committee.[17] The cabinet-level position was left vacant since Edwin Meese III held the post under Ronald Reagan. Unlike Meese's post, Yeutter had additional control over the Bush administration economic and domestic councils, which formed the cabinet's policy-making apparatus. The additional control was initially opposed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who led the economic policy council.[18][19]
Post public service[edit]
Beginning in February 1993, Yeutter split his time working as a senior advisor at Hogan Lovells (formerly Hogan & Hartson L.L.P.) in Washington D.C. and holding numerous corporate directorships. In March 1997 Yeutter registered to lobby on the farm bill for the American Farmland Trust.[20]
Corporate directorships[edit]
Yeutter's first major corporate directorship was with ConAgra Foods while serving as the President and CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Clayton K. YeutterSenior Advisor, International Trade at Hogan & Hartson
 




Clayton K. Yeutter participated in the World Leaders Forum
event, The Uruguay Round and the WTO: What Have We Achieved?, in April 2006.


Ambassador
Yeutter served as U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) from 1985-88, and while
there led the American team in negotiating the historic U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement, the precursor to the North American Free Trade Agreement. He also
helped launch the most ambitious trade negotiation in history, the 100-nation
Uruguay Round, which culminated in the creation of the World Trade
Organization.

While USTR, Ambassador Yeutter broadened the U.S. trade agenda to encompass for
the first time serious global negotiations in services, intellectual property,
and agriculture.

In 1989 Ambassador Yeutter was named Secretary of Agriculture. In that post he
steered the 1990 Farm Bill through Congress, laying the groundwork for a far
more market-oriented policy structure in American agriculture. In 1991 he was
elected Republican National Committee Chairman, and a year later President Bush
persuaded him to return to the administration in a Cabinet-level post as
Counselor to the President.

From 1978-85 Ambassador Yeutter served as President and Chief Executive Officer
of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. His tenure there was marked by innovation
and growth which contributed to its evolution into one of the largest financial
institutions in the world.

Earlier in his career, Ambassador Yeutter held two Assistant Secretary of
Agriculture posts under President Nixon and then served as Deputy Special Trade
Representative under President Ford. He had previously been the Director of one
of the world's largest agriculture technical assistance programs in Colombia, South America,
after having served as Chief of Staff to the Governor of Nebraska.

Ambassador Yeutter presently serves as a Director of several major
corporations, all of which are deeply involved in international commerce or
international finance. He also is a frequent speaker and has written scores
of articles and op eds, primarily on trade policy and agricultural policy.

	as it seeks to generate interest in and financial support for that project. 

	A Central American
	industry, in correcting a significant error by its own government during the

WASHINGTON TALK: WORKING PROFILE: Clayton K. Yeutter; A Trade War Veteran With Tales to Tell


By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH


Published: February 14, 1987









WASHINGTON, Feb. 13— 
                    Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States Trade Representative, told a story about himself the other day.        

                    At a recent conference in San Francisco, he said, he was faced with demonstrators waving a banner reading, ''Save NATO. Dump Yeutter.'' The protest, he explained, signaled the concern in some quarters over aggressive American trade policies and, by implication, concern about the man behind much of that approach.        

                    Just before going to the West Coast, Mr. Yeutter threatened the European Community with 200 percent duties on wine, gin, Cognac, cheese and other products to compensate the United States for $400 million in grain sales lost to Spain as a result of Spain's joining the community last year. The Europeans, in turn, threatened to cut more of their imports from the United States and bring on a trade war that could blow up the 38-year-old Atlantic alliance.        

                    But before a Washington-imposed deadline of Jan. 30, Mr. Yeutter and his Brussels counterpart, Willy de Clercq, signed a pact. The United States received full compensation from the 12-nation bloc.        

                    Mr. Yeutter (rhymes with fighter) told the story about the demonstrators to the House Ways and Means Committee in an effort to illustrate the kind of impact he is having as this country's chief trade spokesman. Wide Grin, Mock Swagger        

                    He related the tale with a wide grin and a bit of mock swagger, and he could not have had a more appreciative audience. Given the strong protectionist pressures in their constituencies, the legislators seem to have a strong affinity for a macho man as the nation's trade representative, especially one who can head off punitive, protectionist legislation through negotiated agreements.        

                    ''I admire the way you handle the job,'' said Representative J. J. Pickle, Democrat of Texas.        

                    ''You're a breath of fresh air in this Administration,'' added Representative Beryl Anthony Jr., Democrat of Arkansas.        

                    Mr. Yeutter goes down less smoothly abroad. Europeans find the deadlines that he is always setting to resolve trade conflicts ''unhelpful,'' said Ella Krucoff, spokeswoman for the European Community in Washington. But, she added, he is ''respected'' by European officials.        

                    Mr. Yeutter, a beefy Nebraskan who speaks rapidly, off the cuff and in a voice that some have compared to a hog-caller's, occasionally puts his foot in his mouth, at least in the judgment of his critics. Last week, for example, he created a firestorm in Canada when he told a Brookings Institution seminar that Canada should be prepared to risk losses of its culture in any free trade pact with the United States. 'Stunningly Ignorant'        

                    The incident caused barely a ripple here, but it filled Canadian newspapers and, in Parliament, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney accused Mr. Yeutter of being ''stunningly ignorant'' of Canadian cultural sensitivities. The Canadians fear being economically and culturally overwhelmed by the United States should a freer trade agreement emerge between the two countries later this year.        

                    In 19 months in office, Mr. Yeutter has managed to become one of the more effective holders of the key Cabinet-level trade office, in spite of, or perhaps because of, his directness.        

                    He does not have a close personal relationship with President Reagan, yet he has especially good rapport with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, the Cabinet's economic spokesman and chairman of the Economic Policy Committee, where the key decisions are taken.        

                    Of more than 100 issues that have come before the policy committee since Mr. Yeutter replaced Bill Brock, now Labor Secretary, in July 1985, only one of Mr. Yeutter's recommendations was rejected. This related to shoes.        

                    Along with most other economic officers of the Cabinet, key legislators and the International Trade Commission, a Federal fact-finding agency, Mr. Yeutter recommended protection for the shoe industry. The President went against the advice in a decision in September 1985.        

                    ''Yeutter's been able to work well within the economic policy framework,'' said I. M. Destler, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics. ''As the guy in the middle, between the Hill on the one hand and the foreign governments on the other, he's doing a good job under difficult circumstances.''        

                    On his watch Mr. Yeutter has seen the trade deficit reach into the stratosphere and protectionist clamor grow. In response, the Administration has shifted from a policy of strictly free trade to a politically more realistic policy of trade enforcement.        

                    Thanks to an initiative of Mr. Yeutter and Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, the Administration is fighting unfair trade for the first time under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. This rarely used provision allows Washington to restrict access to the American market for countries that maintain trade barriers against the United States.        

                    More than a dozen such cases have been brought. As a result, markets in Japan have been opened for tobacco; markets in Taiwan have been opened for beer, wine and tobacco, and markets in South Korea have been opened for insurance.        

                    ''To the extent that Congressmen are convinced that Administration officials will vigorously defend U.S. trade interests, the more likely it is that they will desist from imposing unilateral trade restrictions on their own,'' said Sam Nakagama, a Wall Street economic analyst. Talks on Global Trade        

                    In another key move to deflate protectionism at home, Mr. Yeutter persuaded 92 nations to agree to start discussing ways to ease global trade, and these talks are now moving forward. Here again the idea is that if other countries open their markets, the United States can avoid having to close its own.        

                    Working with Mr. Baker and Mr. Baldrige, he has also altered the Administration's legislative strategy. Last year the President refused to send Congress a trade bill. Next week he will send up nearly 2,000 pages of legislation both to sharpen trade law and improve competitiveness.        

                    ''Last year there was such a thrust toward protectionism that we saw no real possibility of sensible, responsible trade legislation emerging,'' Mr. Yeutter said in an interview. ''It would have been Christmas-treed with protectionism and a veto would have been inevitable. We came to a different conclusion this year. Chances of responsible legislation are substantially higher.''

Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Oregon.
Before GOODWIN, SCHROEDER and NOONAN, Circuit Judges.
SCHROEDER, Circuit Judge:


1
This is an action challenging the constitutionality of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 544-544p which was enacted in 1986.   Its purposes were to protect the economy and enhance the scenic, cultural, recreational and natural resources of the Columbia River Gorge.   The Gorge occupies a uniquely beautiful and rich area in Oregon and Washington bordering the Columbia River.   The Act contemplated interim management of the area by the Secretary of Agriculture and long-term management by the Columbia Gorge Commission, an agency to be established by a compact between the two states.  16 U.S.C. § 544c.   The Act set forth in some detail the manner in which the Commission was to function and conditioned Congress' consent to the Compact upon compliance with those conditions.   The Compact has now been entered into and the Commission is functioning according to the plan outlined in the Act.


2
The plaintiffs in this action, individual property owners, an organization called the "Columbia Gorge United-Protecting People and Property," and members of that organization, claimed they were adversely affected by the operation of the Commission. They sued both the Secretary of Agriculture and the Commission alleging that the Act violated both the Federal and State Constitutions.   Following a hearing on the merits, the district court granted summary judgment in a thoughtful opinion rejecting all of the plaintiffs' claims.   Columbia River Gorge United is the sole appellant in this action, as it is the only party below that listed its name on the notice of appeal, thereby complying with the specificity requirement of Fed.R.App.P. 3(c).   See Benally v. Hodel, 913 F.2d 1464, 1467 (9th Cir.1990).   In this appeal Columbia River Gorge United renews its contentions that the Act violates the United States Constitution, alleging specifically that the Act violates the Tenth Amendment, the Commerce, Property and Compact Clauses and the Fifth Amendment entitlement to equal protection.


3
Underlying all of appellant's contentions is the recurring theme that the Act and the Compact are contrary to the true wishes of the states of Oregon and Washington, and that the states were coerced into accepting conditions laid down by Congress.   The Commission in this case is represented by the Attorneys General of both states who vigorously maintain that both the Act and the Compact were a product of mutual cooperation between federal and state governments to achieve a result satisfactory to both states.   To the extent that appellant's arguments rest upon issues of fact with respect to coercion, they have been resolved against the plaintiffs by the district court in findings which are not clearly erroneous.   We therefore deal only with issues of law.

OPERATION OF THE ACT

4
The Act establishes a "partnership between the Federal Government, the States of Oregon and Washington, and the nearly 50 units of local government within the Columbia River Gorge for the purpose of protecting and enhancing" property and resources within the Gorge.  132 Cong.Rec. 29496 (Oct. 8, 1986) (remarks of Senator Hatfield).   The Act accomplishes this goal by creating the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and ratifying an interstate compact between Washington and Oregon which regulates land use and development activities within the Scenic Area.


5
The Act calls for the creation of a thirteen member Commission composed of three residents appointed by the three Oregon Gorge counties, three residents appointed by the three Washington Gorge counties, three members appointed by each state governor and one non-voting Forest Service employee appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture.  16 U.S.C. § 544c.   Once created, the Commission is charged with the development of a management plan that regulates, through land use ordinances, the development and use of various categories of land within the Scenic Area.   In furtherance of this purpose, the Commission is, within the first year of its establishment, to complete a resource inventory, an economic opportunity study, and a recreational assessment of the Scenic Area.  16 U.S.C. § 544d(a).   Within two years the Commission is to complete land use designations for privately owned land within the Scenic Area.  16 U.S.C. § 544d(b).   The Secretary of Agriculture will, during this same period, take corresponding steps with respect to federally owned land within the Scenic Area.  16 U.S.C. § 544f.


6
Once these tasks are accomplished, the Commission is to develop and adopt a management plan for the Scenic Area.   Under the Act, the Plan must include land use designations, management direction for the use of federal land, and guidelines for adoption of land use ordinances.   After the Plan is approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, counties will be instructed to submit land use ordinances to the Commission for approval.   If a county fails to submit an acceptable plan, the Commission is authorized to develop and implement a county plan that is consistent with the overall management plan.


7
Under the Act, and the resulting Compact, all land use within the Columbia River Gorge Scenic Area, whether private, federal or local, will be consistent with the management plan developed by the Commission.   Congressional consent to this interstate compact is expressly contingent upon inclusion in the Compact of all powers and responsibilities assigned to the Commission under the Act.  16 U.S.C. § 544o(d).


8
The Columbia River Gorge Compact was ratified by Oregon and Washington in 1987.   The Compact incorporated the Gorge Act and established the Commission in accordance with the federal statute.   Or.Rev.Stat. § 196.150 (1987);  Wash.Rev.Code § 43.97.020 (1987).

DISCUSSION

9
We deal first with the appellant's contentions that the Act violates the authority granted to Congress in both the Commerce and Property Clauses of the Constitution and is therefore outside the scope of the legislative power granted to Congress by the United States Constitution.


10
The Commerce Clause, Article I, section 8, of the Constitution provides that Congress "shall have Power ... to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations and among the several States."   The Clause has, of course, been interpreted expansively to authorize regulation not only of channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce but of "activities affecting commerce."   See, e.g., Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Ass'n, 452 U.S. 264, 276-277, 101 S. Ct. 2352, 2360-61, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1981).   Similarly, activity that is seemingly insignificant may be regulated where one individual's "contribution, taken together with that of many others similarly situated, is far from trivial."  Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 127-28, 63 S. Ct. 82, 90-91, 87 L. Ed. 122 (1942).   The district court correctly disposed of appellant's contention that the Act goes beyond this expansive power.


11
The district court found, and appellant does not dispute, that among Congress' concerns was a desire to preserve the beauty of the area for those who would travel to use the rivers and mountains in it for recreation, thus directly causing interstate travel.   Congress also intended to regulate competing economic activities within the scenic area that are activities directly affecting interstate commerce.   These activities include logging and fishing.   Moreover, and perhaps most important, the area itself is unique in that it consists of portions of two states bisected by a navigable waterway.   In such an area, virtually all activities affecting the land, the economy, the environment, or the resources have interstate ramifications.   See United States v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311 U.S. 377, 426, 61 S. Ct. 291, 308, 85 L. Ed. 243 (1940) (Congressional authority to regulate rivers is not limited to control for navigation, but is as broad as the needs of commerce and extends to flood protection, watershed development, and the recovery of cost of improvements).   See also Boone v. U.S., 944 F.2d 1489, 1492-93 (9th Cir.1991) (federal government's authority to regulate navigable waters is coextensive with and parallel to expansive power to regulate commerce generally).   Interstate bodies of water are frequently the subject of interstate compacts.   See, e.g., Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, Pub.L. No. 91-148, 83 Stat. 360 (1969);  Delaware River Basin Compact, Pub.L. No. 87-328, 75 Stat. 688 (1961);  Upper Colorado River Basin Compact, 63 Stat. 31 (1949).   There is thus no merit to the appellant's claim on appeal that by upholding the constitutionality of the Compact, we are upholding the authority of Congress to impose zoning regulations throughout the country.   As the district court noted, Congress found this area to be one of critical national significance.


12
Appellant also contends that the Act goes beyond the grant of authority to Congress under the Property Clause of the Constitution which provides that Congress has power "to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States."   U.S. Const., art. IV, § 3, cl. 2.   Appellant argues that even though some seventeen percent of the land in the affected area is federally owned, Congress may not regulate development in the entire area.   The district court agreed with appellees that development on non-federally owned land has a sufficient effect on federally owned land to justify regulation of such development under the Property Clause.   They relied upon Supreme Court decisions which upheld federal regulation of non-federal land where the regulated activity on the non-federal land affected the activities on the federal land.   See Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529, 538, 96 S. Ct. 2285, 2291, 49 L. Ed. 2d 34 (1976);  Camfield v. United States, 167 U.S. 518, 525-26, 17 S. Ct. 864, 867-67, 42 L. Ed. 260 (1897).   In addition, the United States points out that it is difficult to see how the entire Act could be struck down by an attack on only those portions affecting non-federal land, since the Act has a severability clause.   We need not determine, however, whether all or a portion of the Act would go beyond the reach of Congress' power under the Property Clause.   We have already determined that the Act is within Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.


13
For a similar reason, the Act cannot be a violation of the Tenth Amendment.   Since the Act is within the powers granted to Congress under the Commerce Clause, it cannot constitute an exercise of a power reserved to the states.   We therefore need not address the federal government's position that the appellant lacks standing to assert the rights of the states under the Tenth Amendment.


14
We then turn to the appellant's contention that the regulatory system is a product of a compact that is not valid under the Compact Clause.   Under the Compact Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, § 10, cl. 3, any interstate agreement that increases the political power of states must be approved by Congress.  "The relevant inquiry must be one of impact on [the] federal structure."  United States Steel Corp. v. Multistate Tax Comm'n., 434 U.S. 452, 471, 98 S. Ct. 799, 812, 54 L. Ed. 2d 682 (1978).   All parties to this appeal agree that the Compact between Washington and Oregon, pursuant to which the Commission was established to oversee the Columbia River Gorge Area, is one which requires such congressional consent.   Through the Act, Congress consented in advance to this Compact on the condition that the Compact contain certain specific provisions.   Advance consent with requirements attached is itself perfectly valid, as the Supreme Court has held.  Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U.S. 433, 440-41, 101 S. Ct. 703, 707-08, 66 L. Ed. 2d 641 (1981).   This court has recently reaffirmed that Congress may condition consent upon a compact containing specific terms, including the creation of a compact agency.   See Seattle Master Builders v. Pacific N.W. Elec. Power, 786 F.2d 1359, 1364 (9th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1059, 107 S. Ct. 939, 93 L. Ed. 2d 989 (1987).


15
The only distinction between Seattle Master Builders and this case is the appellant's assertion that this Act specifies in greater detail the provisions of the Compact it authorizes than the Pacific Northwest Power Planning and Conservation Act at issue in Seattle Master Builders.   The fundamental objection to both this Compact and that in Seattle Master Builders, however, is essentially the same.   Moreover, there are distinct benefits from the kind of detailed advance planning between states and the federal government that led to this Compact.   Such planning is fully consistent with the purpose of the Compact Clause.   Regional arrangements may represent a necessary method for handling problems, such as transportation, waste disposal and environmental preservation, which because of their interstate nature cannot be handled by individual states acting alone.   Professors Landis and Frankfurter, in their seminal article on the Compact Clause, strongly recommended the Compact device for "fashioning new instruments adapted to new situations."   Frankfurter & Landis, The Compact Clause of the Constitution--A Study in Interstate Adjustments, 34 Yale L.J. 685, 688 (1925).   Foresighted in their thinking, the authors understood that "imaginative adaptation of the compact idea should add considerably to resources available to statesmen in the solution of problems presented by ... growing interdependence."   Id. at 729.   As we pointed out in Seattle Master Builders, the compact has been used in a variety of unique situations to promote both state and federal interests:  "An unusual feature of a compact does not make it invalid."  Seattle Master Builders, 786 F.2d at 1364.   The Columbia River Gorge Compact is just such an innovative solution to a difficult interstate land preservation problem.


16
The appellant finally contends that the Act violates the Fifth Amendment entitlement to equal protection because Gorge area residents must submit to local land use decisions made by non-elected officials, while state residents outside the Gorge area are subject to land use regulation only by elected officials.   Insofar as the appellant argues that the Act violates electoral rights guaranteed by the state constitutions or local laws, this challenge fails.   When Congress, acting within constitutional limits, creates federal law, state law is nullified to the extent that compliance with both the federal and the state law would be a physical impossibility.  Hillsborough County, Fla. v. Auto Med. Labs., 471 U.S. 707, 713, 105 S. Ct. 2371, 2375, 85 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1985).


17
The equal protection challenge lodged by the appellant is based upon geographic discrimination.   Residents outside the Gorge area get to vote for their land-use planners, while those inside the Gorge area do not.   The equal protection clause, however, is not violated when a geographic area is singled out for different treatment.   The Supreme Court has held that "there is no rule that counties, as counties, must be treated alike;  the Equal Protection Clause relates to equal protection of the laws 'between persons as such rather than between areas.' "  Griffin v. County School Bd. of Prince Edward County, 377 U.S. 218, 230, 84 S. Ct. 1226, 1233, 12 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1964) (quoting Salsburg v. Maryland, 346 U.S. 545, 551, 74 S. Ct. 280, 283, 98 L. Ed. 281 (1954)).   Different treatment of different areas is permissible, provided there are reasons for such treatment that do not reflect unconstitutional motivations.  Griffin, 377 U.S. at 231, 84 S.Ct. at 1233.   Preservation of the Columbia River Gorge Area is a permissible Congressional objective and a valid exercise of the power delegated to Congress under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.

Yeutter: It's Up to Business to Spur Trade - latimes

WASHINGTON — The falling dollar has halted the decline in U.S. competitiveness in world markets, but future improvements in the trade situation are up to American business, a top Reagan Administration official said Monday.Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter said the decline in the value of the dollar in exchange markets had succeeded in making U.S. goods price competitive with foreign-made goods.But he said the question of whether the American-made goods will now sell well around the world would be determined by the service and the quality of the goods offered."If our exports do not begin to accelerate, then it seems to me that the businessmen and exporters of this country must search their souls," Yeutter said in an address to an American Stock Exchange conference here.Citing the recent shift in the dollar's value relative to other key currencies such as the Japanese yen and West German mark, he said: "Those are incredible shifts, which clearly do make our own products much more internationally competitive pricewise."Yeutter said the lower value of the dollar had made U.S. prices competitive on literally hundreds of thousands of products today. "The profit opportunities are surely there with a whole lot of products and services," he said.Yeutter said government measures of trade performance show that the U.S. trade deficit has topped out in recent months and has begun to slowly decline. The question facing U.S. economic policy-makers was how to accelerate that decline.As measured by the Commerce Department, the U.S. trade picture improved slightly during the first quarter of 1987 as the current account deficit narrowed to $37.12 billion from a record $37.97 billion during the fourth quarter of 1986.The current account, which grew every quarter during 1986, is the broadest government measure of American trade performance, including financial transactions with the rest of the world and investment flows as well as trade in goods and services. The improvement in the current account was foreshadowed by earlier reports of declines in the deficit in merchandise trade in March and April.The deficit in merchandise trade, a narrower measure of trade performance, was a record $166.3 billion in 1986.
