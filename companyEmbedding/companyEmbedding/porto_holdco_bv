FAIRFAX, Va. & FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pace Holdings Corp. (“Pace”) (NASDAQ:PACE), a special-purpose 
      acquisition company sponsored by an affiliate of TPG, today announced 
      that shareholders of Pace have approved the previously announced 
      business combination (the "Business Combination") of Pace and Playa 
      Hotels & Resorts (“Playa”), a leading owner, operator, and developer of 
      premier all-inclusive resorts, with over 99% of the voted shares voting 
      in favor of the Business Combination. The transaction will result in an 
      anticipated initial enterprise value of approximately $1.75 billion for 
      the combined company. Pace's board of directors had previously approved 
      the Business Combination and recommended that its shareholders vote in 
      favor of the proposal.
    


      As previously announced, on December 13, 2016, Pace entered into a 
      definitive business combination agreement to provide Playa additional 
      capital and access to the public equity markets to further enable its 
      growth. The transaction will deliver cash proceeds well in excess of the 
      required minimum cash amount and is anticipated to close on March 10, 
      2017 or shortly thereafter. Following closing, the common shares will 
      trade on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol PLYA.
    

      "This very successful transaction will be a transformational event for 
      Playa, allowing us to have a greatly improved balance sheet and 
      available capital to accelerate our ability to execute highly accretive 
      investments," said Bruce Wardinski, Chairman and CEO of Playa. "We will 
      now continue in our strategy to add more all-inclusive resorts under the 
      Hyatt Ziva, Hyatt Zilara, and Panama Jack brands and to further solidify 
      our leading position in the all-inclusive resorts sector. Being the only 
      publicly traded all-inclusive company gives Playa a unique opportunity 
      to be a consolidator in the segment and drive exceptional growth. I am 
      extremely excited to enter this next chapter for Playa and deliver 
      superior returns to our new public shareholders."
    

      “Playa is a great company with tremendous growth potential and a strong 
      pipeline of attractive investment opportunities,” said Karl Peterson, 
      TPG Partner and President and CEO of Pace. “Backed by the support of our 
      shareholders, Playa’s transition to a publicly capitalized company will 
      significantly accelerate its innovation and growth. We are eager to work 
      with Bruce and the team to take the company to the next level.”
    

      At closing, Mr. Peterson will join the Playa Board of Directors, along 
      with Tom Klein whose appointment was announced on December 20, 2016, 
      and TPG’s Paul Hackwell. Mr. Klein is a veteran of the travel and 
      leisure sector and was most recently President, CEO and a member of the 
      Board of Directors of Sabre Corporation. Mr. Hackwell leads TPG’s 
      Travel & Leisure group and also helps lead the firm’s investment 
      activities in the Retail group. He is on the board of Arden Group, AV 
      Homes, Life Time Fitness, and Viking Cruises.
    

      Playa will host a conference call to discuss Playa’s 2016 results on 
      March 15, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. ET.

Experienced industry executive to join board of leading all-inclusive 
      resorts operator


Appointment to build on Playa’s momentum following recent transaction 
      with Pace Holdings Corp






December 20, 2016 09:02 AM Eastern Standard Time



FAIRFAX, Va., & FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Playa Hotels & Resorts B.V. (“Playa”), a leading owner, operator, and 
      developer of premium all-inclusive resorts, and Pace Holdings Corp. 
      (“Pace”) (NASDAQ: PACE), a special-purpose acquisition company sponsored 
      by an affiliate of TPG, announced today that Tom Klein will join Playa’s 
      Board of Directors (the “Playa Board”) upon completion of the recently 
      announced transaction between Playa and Pace. Klein is an industry 
      veteran with more than 20 years of experience in the travel and leisure 
      sector. Most recently, Klein served as President, CEO, and member of the 
      Board of Directors of Sabre Corporation (“Sabre”), a leading technology 
      provider to the global travel and tourism industry. His addition to the 
      Playa Board is expected to represent the first step toward accelerating 
      Playa’s growth strategy and furthering its leading position in an 
      emerging, high-growth sector.
    


      “Throughout my time on Sabre’s board, I have watched Tom lead the 
      company in entering the public markets and enhancing product 
      development, including significant advances on the hospitality side,” 
      said Karl Peterson, TPG Partner and President and CEO of Pace. “This 
      skill set, paired with his deep knowledge of these markets and strong 
      industry relationships, create the perfect value-add partner for Playa.”
    

      “Karl and I are thrilled to have someone of Tom’s caliber join the Playa 
      Board,” said Bruce Wardinski, Chairman and CEO of Playa. “His joining 
      builds on the recent momentum we’ve gained through our business 
      combination with Pace. We look forward to his support and insights as 
      Playa enters its next era of growth as a public entity.”
    

      On December 13, 2016, Playa and Pace entered into a definitive agreement 
      with respect to a business combination involving the two companies. At 
      the completion of the transaction, the combined company will retain the 
      Playa name and will be a publicly listed company. The transaction is 
      expected to serve as a catalyst for future growth by providing Playa 
      with additional capital and access to the public markets to strengthen 
      its balance sheet, pursue acquisitions, and enhance distribution. Klein 
      will join the Playa Board upon completion of the transaction, which is 
      expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.
    

      “I am excited by the opportunity to not only join the board of an 
      industry leading company such as Playa, but to be a part of a team that 
      has an excellent track record of identifying and creating value,” said 
      Klein. “Bruce and his team have built a terrific platform that is well 
      positioned for significant growth. I look forward to working with the 
      rest of the Playa Board as Playa looks to further its leading position 
      and execute on compelling growth opportunities.”
    

      Before serving as CEO and President, Klein held a variety of executive 
      roles at Sabre, including group President of both Sabre Travel Network 
      and Sabre Airline Solutions as well as company President in 2010. Early 
      on in his career at the company, Klein led Sabre’s joint venture in 
      Mexico. Klein earned his BS in business administration from the 
      Villanova School of Business and currently serves on the University’s 
      Board of Trustees. He serves on the Board of Directors of Cedar Fair LP 
      (NYSE: FUN) and the executive committee of World Travel and Tourism 
      Council. Klein was appointed by US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker 
      to both the President’s Advisory Council for Doing Business in Africa 
      and the board of Brand USA where he currently serves as Chairman.

	Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.





	An Extraordinary General Meeting
	of the shareholders of Pace Holdings Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company (Pace) was held on March 1, 2017 (the Meeting). Present at the Meeting were holders of 53,101,981 shares of Paces ordinary shares in
	person or by proxy, representing 94.40% of the voting power of Paces ordinary shares as of February 8, 2017, the record date for the Meeting, and constituting a quorum for the transaction of business.


	The shareholders of Pace voted on the proposals listed below. Each proposal is described in more detail in the proxy statement/prospectus of
	Porto Holdco B.V., a Dutch private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) (Holdco) which the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) declared effective on February 10, 2017
	and is incorporated by reference in this Current Report on Form 8-K.


	1. To adopt the Transaction Agreement, dated December 13, 2016,
	among Pace, Playa Hotels & Resorts B.V., a Dutch private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) (Playa), Holdco, and New PACE Holdings Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company (New
	Pace) (the Transaction Agreement) and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the business combination, the effect of which replicates the economics of a merger of Pace and Playa, and results in Holdco becoming the
	ultimate parent company to New Pace and Playas direct and indirect subsidiaries (the Business Combination) (the Business Combination Proposal).


	2. To approve the merger of Pace with and into New Pace, with New Pace being the surviving company in such merger (the Pace
	Merger) and authorize, approve and confirm the Merger Proposal between Holdco and Playa (the Plan of Merger) (the Pace Merger Proposal).


	3. To consider and vote upon, on a non-binding advisory basis, the approval of certain governance provisions contained in the Holdco Articles
	of Association that are not required by Dutch law and materially affect shareholder rights:


	A. The election of director candidates and
	incumbent directors annually for appointment for a term ending at the end of the annual General Meeting to be held in the year following their appointment (the Holdco Articles of Association Term of Holdco Board of Directors
	Proposal);


	B. The requirement that a notice of a general meeting of shareholders must include items for which a written request has
	been given (no later than 60 days prior to the general meeting) by one or more shareholders representing (individually or collectively) 3% or more of Holdcos issued share capital (the Holdco Articles of Association Ability to Bring
	Matters for Discussion Before a General Meeting of Holdco Proposal);


	C. A provision that certain parties who compete with Holdco
	will be prohibited from beneficially owning ordinary shares exceeding certain percentage thresholds of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Holdco, as reasonably calculated by the board of directors of Holdco (the Holdco Articles of
	Association Shareholding Limits for Certain Shareholders of Holdco Proposal);


	 


	2






	D. The requirement that, subject to certain exceptions, the holders of at least one third of the
	issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Holdcos capital, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at a general meeting of shareholders (the Holdco Articles of Association Quorum Required to Conduct
	Business before a General Meeting of Holdco Proposal).


	4. To approve the adjournment of the Meeting to a later date or dates
	(i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the proxy statement/prospectus is provided to Pace shareholders or, if as of the time for which the Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient Pace ordinary
	shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at the Meeting, (ii) in order to solicit additional proxies from Pace shareholders in favor of the Business Combination Proposal and the Pace
	Merger Proposal, or (iii) if Pace shareholders redeem an amount of class A ordinary shares such that the minimum proceeds condition to each partys obligation to consummate the Business Combination would not be satisfied (the
	Adjournment Proposal).


	The voting results for each of these proposals are set forth below.

	Pace Holdings Corp. Announces Shareholder Approval of Business Combination with Playa Hotels &




	Resorts




	Transaction provides significant capital and complementary capabilities to further enable Playas growth




	FAIRFAX, Va., and FORT WORTH, Texas  March 1, 2017

	 Pace Holdings Corp. (Pace) (NASDAQ:PACE), a
	special-purpose acquisition company sponsored by an affiliate of TPG, today announced that shareholders of Pace have approved the previously announced business combination (the Business Combination) of Pace and Playa Hotels &
	Resorts (Playa), a leading owner, operator, and developer of premier all-inclusive resorts, with over 99% of the voted shares voting in favor of the Business Combination. The transaction will result in an anticipated initial enterprise
	value of approximately $1.75 billion for the combined company. Paces board of directors had previously approved the Business Combination and recommended that its shareholders vote in favor of the proposal.


	As previously announced, on December 13, 2016, Pace entered into a definitive business combination agreement to provide Playa additional capital and
	access to the public equity markets to further enable its growth. The transaction will deliver cash proceeds well in excess of the required minimum cash amount and is anticipated to close on March 10, 2017 or shortly thereafter. Following
	closing, the common shares will trade on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol PLYA.


	This very successful transaction will be a transformational event for
	Playa, allowing us to have a greatly improved balance sheet and available capital to accelerate our ability to execute highly accretive investments, said Bruce Wardinski, Chairman and CEO of Playa. We will now continue in our strategy to
	add more all-inclusive resorts under the Hyatt Ziva, Hyatt Zilara, and Panama Jack brands and to further solidify our leading position in the all-inclusive resorts sector. Being the only publicly traded all-inclusive company gives Playa a unique
	opportunity to be a consolidator in the segment and drive exceptional growth. I am extremely excited to enter this next chapter for Playa and deliver superior returns to our new public shareholders.


	Playa is a great company with tremendous growth potential and a strong pipeline of attractive investment opportunities, said Karl Peterson, TPG
	Partner and President and CEO of Pace. Backed by the support of our shareholders, Playas transition to a publicly capitalized company will significantly accelerate its innovation and growth. We are eager to work with Bruce and the team
	to take the company to the next level.


	At closing, Mr. Peterson will join the Playa Board of Directors, along with Tom
	Klein whose appointment was announced on December 20, 2016, and TPGs Paul Hackwell. Mr. Klein is a veteran of the travel and leisure sector and was most recently President, CEO and a member of the Board of Directors of
	Sabre Corporation. Mr. Hackwell leads TPGs Travel & Leisure group and also helps lead the firms investment activities in the Retail group. He is on the board of Arden Group, AV Homes, Life Time Fitness, and Viking
	Cruises.


	Playa will host a conference call to discuss Playas 2016 results on March 15, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. ET.

FAIRFAX, Va., Dec. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Playa Hotels & Resorts B.V. ("Parent") announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Playa Resorts Holding B.V. ("Playa" or the "Company"), has commenced a consent solicitation with respect to proposed amendments to the indenture governing its 8.00% Senior Notes due 2020 (CUSIP Nos. 72812RAA5 and N70548AA5) (the "Notes"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Consent Solicitation Statement dated December 14, 2016 (the "Statement").








The Company is soliciting consents to certain proposed amendments (the "Proposed Amendments") to the indenture governing the Notes (the "Indenture"), to provide that the Company's obligation to make a COC Offer (as defined below) will not apply to the Business Combination (as defined below). The consent solicitation will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 20, 2016 (such date and time, as the Company may extend from time to time, the "Expiration Time").
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Statement, the Company will pay to the holders who delivered valid and unrevoked consents prior to the Expiration Time a cash payment equal to $2.50 per $1,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes consented (the "Consent Fee").  The Consent Fee will only be payable upon, among other things, both the receipt of Requisite Consents (as defined below) and the closing of the Business Combination (as defined below).  Only holders of record of the Notes as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 13, 2016 (the "Record Date"), are eligible to deliver consents to the Proposed Amendments in the consent solicitation
Playa is seeking the Proposed Amendments in connection with the previously announced transaction agreement entered into by Parent, Pace Holdings Corp, a Cayman Islands exempted company, Porto Holdco B.V., a Dutch private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) ("Holdco"), and New Pace Holdings Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company, providing for a business combination, the effect of which replicates the economics of a merger of Pace and Parent and results in Holdco becoming the ultimate parent company to New Pace and Parent's direct and indirect subsidiaries (the "Business Combination"). If the Business Combination is consummated and the Proposed Amendments do not become operative prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture) may be deemed to have occurred, which would require Playa to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest (the "COC Offer"). 
The consent solicitation is subject to customary conditions, including, among other things, the receipt of valid and unrevoked consents with respect to a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes (the "Requisite Consents") prior to the Expiration Time.  The Proposed Amendments will be effected by a supplemental indenture to the Indenture which will be executed promptly after the receipt of Requisite Consents (the "Consent Time"), as described in more detail in the Statement. Delivered consents may be validly revoked prior to the execution of the supplemental indenture. However, the Proposed Amendments with respect to the Notes will not become operative until immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination and shall not be operative if the Business Combination is not consummated. The Business Combination currently is expected to be consummated in the first quarter of 2017.  Except for amendments relating to the change of control and related provisions, there are no other amendments to the Indenture being sought in connection with the consent solicitation.
No assurance can be given that the Proposed Amendments can or will be completed on terms that are acceptable to Playa, or at all. The consent solicitation is being made solely on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Statement and the accompanying letter of consent, copies of which will be delivered to the holders of the Notes. Playa may, in its sole discretion, terminate, extend or amend the consent solicitation at any time as described in the Statement.
Playa has retained BofA Merrill Lynch to act as solicitation agent in connection with the consent solicitation.  Questions may be directed to BofA Merrill Lynch at (888) 292-0070 (toll free) or (980) 388-3646 (collect).  Playa has retained D.F. King & Co, Inc. to act as the information agent for the consent solicitation.  Questions and requests for additional documents may be directed to D.F. King & Co, Inc. at (877) 536-1559 (toll free) or (212) 269-5550 (collect).
This announcement is for information purposes only and is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any security. This announcement is also not a solicitation of consents with respect to the proposed amendment or any securities. The solicitation of consents is being made only pursuant to the Statement.  No recommendation is being made as to whether holders of the Notes should consent to the Proposed Amendments. The solicitation of consents is not being made in any jurisdiction in which, or to or from any person to or from whom, it is unlawful to make such solicitation under applicable state or foreign securities or "blue sky" laws.About Playa Hotel & ResortsPlaya Hotels & Resorts B.V. ("Parent") is a leading owner, operator and developer of all-inclusive resorts in prime beachfront locations in popular vacation destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean.  Parent owns a portfolio consisting of 13 resorts (6,142-rooms) located in Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica.

(“Playa”), a leading owner, operator, and developer of premium all-inclusive resorts, and Pace Holdings Corp. (“Pace”) (PACE), a special-purpose acquisition company sponsored by an affiliate of TPG, announced today that Tom Klein will join Playa’s Board of Directors (the “Playa Board”) upon completion of the recently announced transaction between Playa and Pace. Klein is an industry veteran with more than 20 years of experience in the travel and leisure sector. Most recently, Klein served as President, CEO, and member of the Board of Directors of Sabre Corporation (“Sabre”), a leading technology provider to the global travel and tourism industry. His addition to the Playa Board is expected to represent the first step toward accelerating Playa’s growth strategy and furthering its leading position in an emerging, high-growth sector.“Throughout my time on Sabre’s board, I have watched Tom lead the company in entering the public markets and enhancing product development, including significant advances on the hospitality side,” said Karl Peterson, TPG Partner and President and CEO of Pace. “This skill set, paired with his deep knowledge of these markets and strong industry relationships, create the perfect value-add partner for Playa.”“Karl and I are thrilled to have someone of Tom’s caliber join the Playa Board,” said Bruce Wardinski, Chairman and CEO of Playa. “His joining builds on the recent momentum we’ve gained through our business combination with Pace. We look forward to his support and insights as Playa enters its next era of growth as a public entity.”On December 13, 2016, Playa and Pace entered into a definitive agreement with respect to a business combination involving the two companies. At the completion of the transaction, the combined company will retain the Playa name and will be a publicly listed company. The transaction is expected to serve as a catalyst for future growth by providing Playa with additional capital and access to the public markets to strengthen its balance sheet, pursue acquisitions, and enhance distribution. Klein will join the Playa Board upon completion of the transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.“I am excited by the opportunity to not only join the board of an industry leading company such as Playa, but to be a part of a team that has an excellent track record of identifying and creating value,” said Klein. “Bruce and his team have built a terrific platform that is well positioned for significant growth. I look forward to working with the rest of the Playa Board as Playa looks to further its leading position and execute on compelling growth opportunities.”Before serving as CEO and President, Klein held a variety of executive roles at Sabre, including group President of both Sabre Travel Network and Sabre Airline Solutions as well as company President in 2010. Early on in his career at the company, Klein led Sabre’s joint venture in Mexico. Klein earned his BS in business administration from the Villanova School of Business and currently serves on the University’s Board of Trustees. He serves on the Board of Directors of Cedar Fair LP (FUN) and the executive committee of World Travel and Tourism Council. Klein was appointed by US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker to both the President’s Advisory Council for Doing Business in Africa and the board of Brand USA where he currently serves as Chairman.Additional Information and Where to Find ItPace has caused Porto Holdco B.V.
