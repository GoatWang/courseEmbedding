					This beautiful collection of Tibetan rugs are hand knotted in Nepal by Tibetan refugees. The knotting technique is different than that in other hand knotted rugs. The technique involved requires that the designs be fairly simple, which is appreciated by people looking for rugs that are not busy. These rugs are made using hand carded Tibetan wool. They're wonderfully dense and luxurious. The quality is hard to appreciate from looking at photos online.

Have fun with wall decor.If your floor space is limited, it’s important to make the most of your walls by using every inch for home decor. If your walls are looking a little barren, spice them up with colorful artwork. Your own photo collage can add a personal touch to any room, while mirrors can make a small space seem larger thanks to their reflective qualities. If storage is an issue, use shelves and stack them with fun trinkets or flowers. Don’t forget about the wall itself! Add some flavor with colorful, patterned wallpaper or go for a brightly painted accent wall. Home decorations make great table toppers.If your living room needs a lift, liven it up by adding a few thoughtful home decor accessories. Photos always make great additions, but keep them interesting by mixing and matching your frames. When lit, candles add a romantic, relaxing feel, and coffee table books about travel, home design, fashion or photography make for great conversation starters. House decorations can cozy up your floor.While floor space may be limited, there’s always room for a well-placed area rug or two. These are a great way to add texture, color and warmth to a hardwood or tile floor. Choose a traditional floral pattern or some funky chevrons to get started, then pair your  pattern with a textured Berber rug or soft shag for ultimate indulgence. Add some vibrancy to neutral-colored furniture. One of the easiest ways to punch up a look is through the fabric you display. Swap out throw pillows and blankets to liven up a dull home decor foundation, and search right here on Houzz for bold or mismatched patterns, comfy throws and cushy pillows. Don’t forget the drapes.Dress up your windows with elegant, bold or even light and airy treatments. Because of their size, floor-length curtains can make a dramatic difference and can transition a room from traditional to contemporary all by themselves.

Because rugs take up a lot of surface space, finding a design that enhances your current design is key.

It's your call, but keep in mind what is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Look to your furniture to determine the size; in a living room,   rugs should offer plenty of coverage from one sofa to the next. After all, if there are too many gaps, its small size will be easy to notice. You should also keep in mind architectural cues. One near the front door is often just large enough to slightly surpass the door frame, while a narrow hallway requires equally narrow runner rugs. In the end, your space and furniture will dictate the size more than anything else.What material should my   rug be made of?Some rugs are more durable than others, so before you pick out your favorite  pattern, determine how much traffic the space is going to get. For a high-traffic entryway, jute rugs and sisal rugs can be good choices, since they tend to hide dirt and show less wear and tear. Cotton, synthetic and wool rugs work well for larger areas in bedrooms and living rooms — they come in fun  colors and offer more cushion. If you love luxury more than practicality, you can always opt for silk or fur options. Regardless, be sure you keep your family in mind as well; silk and fur don't mesh well with little kids or family pets. And don't forget rug pads — these handy additions help you avoid creating an accidental slip and slide.What style   accent rug should I look for?Because it's one of the largest decorative pieces in your space, it should accurately reflect your style. For those with traditional tastes,   Persian rugs and floral patterns are go-to options, while geometric patterns and bright colors are trendier and more contemporary. In the end, it's great to mix and match   rugs and decor, but avoid conflicting patterns and colors.United StatesUnited StatesUnited KingdomAustraliaDeutschlandFranceРоссия日本ItaliaEspañaDanmarkSverigeIrelandSingaporeNew ZealandIndiaCOMPANYAbout HouzzIn the NewsPress InfoCareersContact UsTerms & PrivacyCopyright & TrademarkEXPLORE HOUZZButtons & BadgesMobile AppsAdvertiseFor ProfessionalsSell on HouzzWrite a ReviewFAQsCONNECT WITH USHouzz BlogTwitterFacebookGoogle+YouTubeRSSUnited KingdomAustraliaDeutschlandFranceРоссия日本ItaliaEspañaDanmarkSverigeIrelandSingaporeNew ZealandIndia© 2017 Houzz Inc.

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreWhat materials are best for area rugs?It’s recommended that you don’t skimp when it comes to purchasing a new area rug, as high quality natural fibers like wool and silk are best but tend to be more expensive. Other natural fibers such as jute, grass and sisal can cost less but won’t wear as well. Another quality to look for is how easy it is to clean the materials, especially if you have children or pets. If you’re having trouble gauging how much you’re comfortable spending on a new area rug, take a look at how much other pieces of furniture in the room cost and search for area rugs that are priced similarly. What size area rug should I purchase?As a general rule, it’s recommended you choose area rugs that are two feet shorter than the shortest wall in the room where they’ll be placed. For example, if your bedroom is 11 feet by 13 feet, limit your search to bedroom rugs that are no more than nine feet long. Of course, this rule may not work in certain circumstances, like dining room rugs or living room rugs. For a dining room, look for an area rug that extends at least 18 inches past the edge of your dining table so that your dining chairs will fit on top. A living room rug should help designate conversation areas and should be big enough so that the front third of each piece of furniture sits on top of the rug. If your living room or den is large enough to hold more than one conversation area, you might consider buying two or more living room area rugs.

                    The History of North Port  from North Port County Government

Incorporated in 1959, the City of North Port, Florida occupies 103 square miles of southeast Sarasota County midway between the cities of Sarasota and Fort Myers, near the Gulf of Mexico. North Port is one of the largest Florida cities in land area but is only 10 percent populated. The City began with a population of 178 and was originally known as North Port Charlotte. The name was later shortened to North Port, which helped to create an individual city identity. Since 1980, North Port's population has grown 120%, making it one of the fastest growing cities in Florida. According to the Bureau of Economic and Business Research, as of 2007 the city's population was 53,732. 

Why is North Port, Florida attracting families and business from all over at such an accelerated pace? Its beauty, convenience, economic development, job opportunities, some of the lowest property taxes in the southwest Florida region and a top notch public education infrastructure including a state of the art high school and middle school as well as a community college less than 5 miles away and 3 four-year institutions within a 60-mile radius. 

North Port has an unspoiled natural environment where wildlife flourishes among 95 miles of freshwater canals. It is also the only city in Florida that contains a state forest (Myakka State Forest) within its corporate boundaries. North Port offers a multitude of recreational opportunities such as golfing, fishing, horseback riding, canoeing and more. North Port encompasses fourteen miles of Interstate I-75 within its boundaries. It has two international airports within 45 minutes making, the City accessible to most major markets. Although, North Port is inland, its weather is influenced by the Gulf of Mexico. The average annual temperature of 76 degrees makes year-round living a pleasure, and the City is host to many seasonal residents as well.

Using stable isotopes to understand hydrochemical processes in and around a Prairie Pothole wetland in the Northern Great Plains, USAProduct Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2011Author(s): Mills, C.T., M.B. Goldhaber, C.A. Stricker, J.M. Holloway, J.M. Morrison, K.J. Ellefsen, D.O. Rosenberry, and R.S. ThurstonSuggested Citation: Mills, C.T., M.B. Goldhaber, C.A. Stricker, J.M. Holloway, J.M. Morrison, K.J. Ellefsen, D.O. Rosenberry, and R.S. Thurston. 2011. Using stable isotopes to understand hydrochemical processes in and around a Prairie Pothole wetland in the Northern Great Plains, USA. Applied Geochemistry. 26(S): S97-S100. Millions of internally drained wetland systems in the Prairie Potholes region of the northern Great Plains (USA and Canada) provide indispensable habitat for waterfowl and a host of other ecosystem services. The hydrochemistry of these systems is complex and a crucial control on wetland function, flora and fauna. Wetland waters can have high concentrations of SO2_ 4 due to the oxidation of large amounts of pyrite in glacial till that is in part derived from the Pierre shale. Water chemistry including d18OH2O, d2HH2O, and d34SSO4 values, was determined for groundwater, soil pore water, and wetland surface water in and around a discharge wetland in North Dakota. The isotopic data for the first time trace the interaction of processes that affect wetland chemistry, including open water evaporation, plant transpiration, and microbial SO4 reduction.
