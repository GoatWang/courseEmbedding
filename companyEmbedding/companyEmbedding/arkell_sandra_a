Mastercard Names Sandy Arkell as Corporate Controller | Business Wire
























































Mastercard Names Sandy Arkell as Corporate Controller






March 24, 2017 09:05 AM Eastern Daylight Time



PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mastercard today appointed Sandra (Sandy) Arkell as executive vice 
      president, corporate controller and principal accounting officer, 
      effective May 5, 2017. This move comes as Andrea Forster, the current 
      controller, takes on a new role to expand the company’s shared service 
      center capabilities.
    


      Forster joined Mastercard in 2011 as corporate controller and principal 
      accounting officer, following a 20-year career in the beverage industry. 
      In 2012, she led the creation of the Global Business Service Center, an 
      award-winning shared service center supporting more than 50 markets.
    

      “Andrea has transformed and enhanced our financial operations,” said 
      Martina Hund-Mejean, chief financial officer, Mastercard. “She 
      strengthened our controller organization with an enhanced focus on risk 
      and controls. We look forward to her continued contribution to the 
      business, as she brings a unique skillset and vision that will help 
      further develop our shared service capabilities.
    

      Arkell will join Mastercard on April 3 to lead the company’s accounting, 
      internal controls and financial reporting activities.
    

      For the past two years, she served as vice president, controller for the 
      Dover Corporation, a manufacturer of specialty equipment and components 
      for energy, food and engineering companies. In this role, Arkell led its 
      global finance and accounting organization, responsible for financial 
      reporting, planning and analysis, financial systems and SOX compliance. 
      During her tenure, she supported numerous acquisitions, as well as a 
      public spinoff of one of its largest businesses. She originally joined 
      Dover in 2009 as assistant corporate controller.
    

      “Sandy’s broad range of experience in several finance functions and 
      industries will allow her to contribute to the company in ways beyond 
      just financial matters. We look forward to her perspective on key 
      issues, helping to enhance a strong foundation and a solid team,” said 
      Hund-Mejean.
    

      Prior to Dover, Arkell played an integral role in Arby’s acquisition of 
      Wendy’s, driving the development of a shared services organization. She 
      has also held financial planning, risk management and investor relations 
      roles with Delphi, Kmart, Collins & Aikman, and Pulte Corporation. 
      Arkell began her career with PricewaterhouseCoopers, working with 
      Fortune 500 clients in the manufacturing and consumer packaged goods 
      industries.
    

      Arkell holds a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from The Pennsylvania 
      State University.
