MILWAUKEE, March 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Promentis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of first-in-class therapies to treat central nervous system disorders, today announced it has completed a third round of equity investment totaling $26,000,000.  
The Series C investment is led by OrbiMed, F-Prime Capital Partners (formerly Fidelity Biosciences) and Aisling Capital. Existing investors, including Black Pearl GmbH, the Golden Angel Network and individual investors, also participated in the Series C financing.  








This financing will enable Promentis to advance its lead compound SXC-2023 through Phase 2 clinical proof of concept. SXC-2023 is a novel small molecule designed to engage System Xc-, a CNS target addressing glutamatergic dysfunction and oxidative stress, with a compelling profile across a range of pre-clinical studies.  
The Promentis team is led by Klaus Veitinger, M.D., Ph.D., CEO, Chairman of the Board and OrbiMed Venture Partner. The team also includes Tom Beck, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Board Member and F-Prime Capital Executive Partner; Daniel Lawton, President and Board Member; and Chad Beyer, Ph.D., Senior VP R&D. Patrick Schwarz-Schütte (Black Pearl GmbH) continues his Board role for the Company.
In connection with the Series C financing, Dr. Klaus Veitinger and Dr. Stephen Squinto have joined the Promentis Board as representatives from OrbiMed; Dr. Beck has joined the Board as a representative from F-Prime Capital; and Ms. Stacey Seltzer has joined the Board as a representative from Aisling Capital.
Dr. Veitinger commented, "This Series C funding brings together an exceptional syndicate of investors and expertise and is designed to move the company through Phase 1 clinical trials and to a Phase 2 clinical proof of concept. We are very excited about this program and the further momentum this funding provides." 
With this financing, Promentis has raised a total of more than $31M to date. The company expects this financing should take the company through Phase 2 proof of concept studies.
About Promentis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Promentis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of first-in-class therapies to treat central nervous system disorders. The Company's lead compound is being developed to treat a psychiatric indication that, despite representing a common disorder affecting millions of patients, has no FDA-approved treatment and a high level of unmet patient need. Promentis' drug development program is focused on activating a unique target known to restore glutamatergic neurotransmission and imbalances in oxidative stress. In addition, Promentis has obtained an exclusive license from Marquette University and the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee Research Foundation to certain intellectual property owned by Marquette University and the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee Research Foundation.

Company Summary


Promentis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a pharmaceutical company developing novel compounds for the treatment of schizophrenia and other central nervous system disorders. Promentis' drug development efforts are focused on the neurotransmitter glutamate and its critical role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other diseases.

Impaired cortical function, due at least in part to altered glutamate signaling and oxidative stress, is a key event that likely contributes to a number of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. As a result, molecular mechanisms capable of regulating levels of either glutamate or glutathione (or both) represent novel and potentially promising treatment targets. Promentis believes that its approach takes broader account of the components within the glutamatergic system and possesses the potential to restore imbalances thought to be responsible for many CNS disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, and Parkinson's disease. Thus, Promentis is aggressively embarking on an effort to develop molecules that will redefine what is possible in the treatment of these conditions.

TECHNOLOGY






Technology Overview:





Studies have shown that altered glutamate signaling and oxidative stress are key contributors to impaired cortical function linked to multiple CNS disorders. As a result, Promentis is pioneering the discovery and development of small molecules capable of regulating glutamate and glutathione levels.

http://promentispharma.mhwebstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PromentisVideo-1.m4v




At Promentis, our goal is to leverage our team’s extensive experience in the CNS space to develop new chemical entities for the treatment of CNS and neuropsychiatric disorders.
Promentis is currently focused on advancing small molecules designed to target System XC– , a promising therapeutic target in the brain for a wide variety of psychiatric disorders.
Compounds that act on System XC– work by addressing glutamatergic dysfunction and normalizing oxidative imbalances.
Although Promentis has worked across a broad range of structures and approaches, the company’s portfolio of patent-protected compounds are generally designed to act on System XC-.
Promentis believes that its approach takes broader account of the dysfunction within the glutamatergic system and has the potential to restore imbalances thought to be responsible for many CNS and neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, Promentis is aggressively embarking on an effort to develop molecules that will redefine what is possible in the treatment of such conditions.
Promentis has strong composition-of-matter protection covering its lead compound and a broad patent estate covering a wide variety of different approaches and structures related to the company’s program.
