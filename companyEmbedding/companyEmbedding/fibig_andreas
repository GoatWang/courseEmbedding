      enhance IFF’s ability to create long-term shareholder value.”
    

      “IFF is a company with expansive global reach, a successful culture of 
      innovation, strong financial results, and passionate employees,” said 
      Mr. Fibig. “I am honored to have the opportunity to serve as the 
      Chairman of the Board. I want to thank Doug for his leadership, advice 
      and counsel during the transition. Throughout his tenure as Chairman and 
      CEO, Doug enhanced our Board and strengthened our Company with his 
      leadership, insight and enthusiasm. I look forward to my new role and to 
      guiding IFF towards a promising future.”

I want to thank Doug for his leadership, advice and counsel during the transition. Throughout his tenure as Chairman and CEO, Doug enhanced our Board and strengthened our Company with his leadership, insight and enthusiasm. I look forward to my new role and to guiding IFF towards a promising future.”  Mr. Fibig was appointed Chief Executive Officer of International Flavors & Fragrances on September 1, 2014 and has been a member of the IFF Board of Directors since 2011.

Bayer president Andreas Fibig set to depart
Will become CEO of International Flavors & Fragrances 

Bayer Healthcare's president Andrea Fibig is to leave to become CEO of International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF).Fibig has served as president of Bayer Healthcare since 2008, during which time he has been head of the company's pharmaceuticals division and a member of the executive committee.The appointment at IFF marks a departure for Fibig who has been in the pharma industry since the early 1980s, serving at Schering and Boehringer Ingelheim in his early years.In 2000 he went on to serve as present of Pharmacia & Upjohn's operations in Germany before joining Pfizer as president for its operations in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East and then serving as senior VP and general manager for Pfizer in the US.This experience in the US will benefit Fibig in his first CEO position as he takes over from Doug Tough at New York-based IFF, which develops and creates flavors and fragrances for consumer products.Tough commented that Fibig “brings the right combination of experience and skills”.“He has led businesses with an international footprint similar to ours, has firsthand experience in key emerging markets where we see further opportunity, and understands the critical importance of science-based research in driving innovation and competitiveness,” he added.Tough also remarked that Fibig knows IFF well due to serving as a board member since 2011.As for who will replace Fibig at Bayer, the company stated a successor will be announced “in a few days”.
