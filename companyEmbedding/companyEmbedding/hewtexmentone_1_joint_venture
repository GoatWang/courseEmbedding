A joint venture (JV) is a business entity created by two or more parties, generally characterized by shared ownership, shared returns and risks, and shared governance.
Most joint ventures are incorporated, although some, as in the oil and gas industry, are "unincorporated" joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity. Key elements of a joint venture's design include: 1) the number of parties; 2) the geographic, product, technology and value-chain scope within which the JV will operate; 3) the contributions of the parties; 4) the structural form (each country has specific options, e.g. in the U.S. the main options are a C Corporation or an LLC/partnership structure); 5) the valuation of initial contributions and ownership split among the parties; 6) the economic arrangements, post-deal (e.g. Is the joint venture intended to general profits vs. operate as a cost-sharing or production-sharing venture; if a for-profit entity, will the parties share profits in proportion to equity ownership, or some other way?); 7) governance and control; 8) Talent/HR model (will the Jv have its own staff on own payroll vs. second staff from the parent companies; 9) contractual arrangements with the parent companies for inputs, outputs or services; 10) exit and evolution provisions?
Companies typically pursue joint ventures for one of four reasons: to access a new market, particularly emerging markets; to gain scale efficiencies by combining assets and operations; to share risk for major investments or projects; or to access skills and capabilities.[1]
In European law, the term "joint venture" (or joint undertaking) is an elusive legal concept, better defined under the rules of company law. In France, the term "joint venture" is variously translated "association d'entreprises", "entreprise conjointe", "coentreprise" or "entreprise commune". In Germany, "joint venture" is better represented as a "combination of companies" (Konzern).[2]
With individuals, when two or more persons come together to form a temporary partnership for the purpose of carrying out a particular project, such partnership can also be called a joint venture where the parties are "co-venturers".
The venture can be a business JV (for example, Dow Corning), a project/asset JV intended to pursue one specific project only, or a JV aimed at defining standards or serving as an "industry utility" that provides a narrow set of services to industry participants.
Some major joint ventures include MillerCoors, Sony Ericsson, Penske Truck Leasing, and Owens-Corning - and in the past, Dow Corning.

JV process[edit]
Overall, the JV process has a series of steps:

Defining the business strategy.
Determining whether a JV is the right vehicle. This requires comparing the JV option against acquisition, non-equity partnership, contractual alliance, or go-alone approaches. Generally JVs are most appropriate when 1) they are focused on combining complementary capabilities (e.g. products and market access), sharing risks, or 2) merging businesses where an outright M&A transaction isn't possible or where the premium involved in an acquisition can't be recovered via operating synergies and 3) when go-it-alone is too risky or too slow, and 4) simpler vehicles like contractual agreements aren't sufficient.
Screening partners.
Developing the JV deal concept.
Negotiating detailed terms and conditions.
Planning and launching the JV.
Evolving, or terminating, the JV.

Partner selection[edit]
While the following offers some insight to the process of joining up with a committed partner to form a JV, it is often difficult to determine whether the commitments come from a known and distinguishable party or an intermediary. This is particularly so when the language barrier exists and one is unfamiliar with local customs, especially in approaches to government, often the deciding body for the formation of a JV or dispute settlement.
The ideal process of selecting a JV partner emerges from:

screening of prospective partners
short listing a set of prospective partners and some sort of ranking
due diligence – checking the credentials of the other party
availability of appreciated or depreciated property contributed to the joint venture
the most appropriate structure and invitation/bid
foreign investor buying an interest in a local company

Companies are also called JVs in cases where there are dominant partners together with participation of the public. There may also be cases where the public shareholding is substantial but the founding partners retain their identity. These companies may be "public" or "private" companies. It would be out of place to describe them, except to say there are many in India.
Further consideration relates to starting a new legal entity ground up. Such an enterprise is sometimes called "an incorporated JV", one "packaged" with technology contracts (knowhow, patents, trademarks and copyright), technical services and assisted-supply arrangements.
The consortium JV (also known as a cooperative agreement) is formed where one party seeks technological expertise or technical service arrangements, franchise and brand use agreements, management contracts, rental agreements, for "one-time" contracts, e.g., for construction projects. They dissolve the JV when that goal is reached.
Company incorporation[edit]
A JV can be brought about in the following major ways:

Foreign investor buying an interest in a local company
Local firm acquiring an interest in an existing foreign firm
Both the foreign and local entrepreneurs jointly forming a new enterprise
Together with public capital and/or bank debt

In the UK, India, and in many Common Law countries a joint-venture (or else a company formed by a group of individuals) must file with the appropriate authority the Memorandum of Association. It is a statutory document which informs the outside public of its existence. It may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed. A sample can be seen at wikimedia.org.[3] Together with the Articles of Association, it forms the "constitution" of a company in these countries.
The Articles of Association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to 700,000+ pages. It deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the directors and those withheld by them, requiring the passing of ordinary resolutions, special resolutions and the holding of Extraordinary General Meetings to bring the directors' decision to bear.
A Certificate of Incorporation[4] or the Articles of Incorporation[5] is a document required to form a corporation in the U.S. (in actuality, the state where it is incorporated) and in countries following the practice. In the US, the "constitution" is a single document. The Articles of Incorporation is again a regulation of the directors by the stock-holders in a company.
By its formation the JV becomes a new entity with the implication:

that it is officially separate from its Founders, who might otherwise be giant corporations, even amongst the emerging countries
the JV can contract in its own name, acquire rights (such as the right to buy new companies), and
it has a separate liability from that of its founders, except for invested capital
it can sue (and be sued) in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives.

On the receipt of the Certificate of Incorporation a company can commence its business.
Shareholders' agreement[edit]
This is a legal area and is fraught with difficulty as the laws of countries differ, particularly on the enforceability of "heads of" or shareholder agreements. For some legal reasons it may be called a Memorandum of Understanding. It is done in parallel with other activities in forming a JV. Though dealt with briefly for a shareholders' agreement,[6] some issues must be dealt with here as a preamble to the discussion that follows. There are also many issues which are not in the Articles when a company starts up or never ever present. Also, a JV may elect to stay as a JV alone in a "quasi partnership" to avoid any nonessential disclosure to the government or the public.
Some of the issues in a shareholders' agreement are:

Valuation of intellectual rights, say, the valuations of the IPR of one partner and,say, the real estate of the other
the control of the company either by the number of directors or its "funding"
The number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality.
management decisions - whether the board manages or a founder
transferability of shares - assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company
dividend policy - percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit
winding up - the conditions, notice to members
confidentiality of know-how and founders' agreement and penalties for disclosure
first right of refusal - purchase rights and counter-bid by a founder.

There are many features which have to be incorporated into the shareholders' agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off. Normally, it requires no submission to any authority.
The other basic document which must be articulated is the Articles, which is a published document and known to members. This repeats the shareholders agreement as to the number of directors each founder can appoint to the board of directors; whether the board controls or the founders; the taking of decisions by simple majority (50%+1) of those present or a 51% or 75% majority with all directors present (their alternates/proxy); the deployment of funds of the firm; extent of debt; the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends; etc. Also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved, if one of the partners dies, or if the firm is sold.
Often the most successful JVs are those with 50:50 partnership with each party having the same number of directors but rotating control over the firm, or rights to appoint the Chairperson and Vice-chair of the company. Sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the Founder at board meetings.[7]
Recently, in a major case the Indian Supreme Court has held that Memorandums of Understanding (whose details are not in the Articles of Association) are "unconstitutional" giving more transparency to undertakings.
Chinese law[edit]
According to a report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 2003, China was the recipient of US$53.5 billion in direct foreign investment, making it the world's largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time, to exceed the USA. Also, it approved the establishment of nearly 500,000 foreign-investment enterprises.[8] The US had 45,000 projects (by 2004) with an in-place investment of over 48 billion.[9]
Until recently, no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of China toward foreign investors. Following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied, and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in 1979, while the first Sino-foreign equity venture took place in 2001.[10] The corpus of the law has improved since then.
Companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in China and can sell through their own sales network. Foreign-Sino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly Chinese companies, as China desires to import foreign technology by encouraging JVs and the latest technologies.
Under Chinese law, foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories. Of these, five will be described or mentioned here: three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment. Those 5 categories of Chinese foreign enterprises are: the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures (EJVs), Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs), Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises (WFOE), although they do not strictly belong to Joint Ventures, plus foreign investment companies limited by shares (FICLBS), and Investment Companies through Foreign Investors (ICFI). Each category is described below.
Equity joint ventures[edit]
The EJV Law is between a Chinese partner and a foreign company. It is incorporated in both Chinese (official) and in English (with equal validity), with limited liability. Prior to China's entry into WTO – and thus the WFOEs – EJVs predominated. In the EJV mode, the partners share profits, losses and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the venture's registered capital. These escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital.
The JV contract accompanied by the Articles of Association for the EJV are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project. The Articles mirror many of the provisions of the JV contract. In case of conflict the JV document has precedence These documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report. There are also the ancillary documents (termed "offsets" in the US) covering know-how and trademarks and supply-of-equipment agreements.
The minimum equity is prescribed for investment (truncated),[11][12] where the foreign equity and debt levels are:[13]

less than US$3 million, equity must constitute 70% of the investment;
between US$3 million and US$10 million, minimum equity must be US$2.1 million and at least 50% of the investment;
between US$10 million and US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$5 million and at least 40% of the investment;
more than US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$12 million and at least 1/3 of the investment.

There are also intermediary levels.
The foreign investment in the total project must be at least 25%. No minimum investment is set for the Chinese partner. The timing of investments must be mentioned in the Agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time, draws a penalty.
Cooperative joint ventures[edit]
Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs)[14] are permitted under the Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures. Co-operative enterprises are also called Contractual Operative Enterprises.
The CJVs may have a limited structure or unlimited – therefore, there are two versions. The limited-liability version is similar to the EJVs in status of permissions - the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the Chinese party provides land, buildings, equipment, etc. However, there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder.
The other format of the CJV is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created. In both the cases, the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal Chinese person which can hire labor directly as, for example, a Chinese national contactor. The minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment.
Other differences from the EJV are to be noted:

A Co-operative JV does not have to be a legal entity.
The partners in a CJV are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis, not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution. This proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion.
It may be possible to operate in a CJV in a restricted area
A CJV could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control, as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts. In an EJV management control is through allocation of Board seats.[15]
During the term of the venture, the foreign participant can recover his investment, provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the Chinese participant on termination of the JV.
Foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management, voting, and staffing rights into a CJV's articles; since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes.

Convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment. It is therefore easier to find co-operative partners and to reach an agreement.
With changes in the law, it becomes possible to merge with a Chinese company for a quick start. A foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in China. Instead, the investor uses the Chinese partner's business license, under a contractual arrangement. Under the CJV, however, the land stays in the possession of the Chinese partner.
There is another advantage: the percentage of the CJV owned by each partner can change throughout the JV's life, giving the option to the foreign investor, by holding higher equity, obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the Chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining long-term control.
The parties in any of the ventures, EJV, CJV or WFOE prepare a feasibility study outlined above. It is a non-binding document - the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project. The feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project, before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation. The study should contain details referred to earlier under Feasibility Study[8] (submissions by the Chinese partner).
Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises (WFOEs)[edit]
Main article: Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise
There is basic law of the PRC concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls, WFOEs. China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) around 2001 has had profound effects on foreign investment. Not being a JV, they are considered here only in comparison or contrast.
To implement WTO commitments, China publishes from time to time updated versions of its "Catalogs Investments" (affecting ventures) prohibited, restricted.
The WFOE is a Chinese legal person and has to obey all Chinese laws. As such, it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights, rent buildings, and receive utility services. In this it is more similar to a CJV than an EJV.
WFOEs are expected by PRC to use the most modern technologies and to export at least 50% of their production, with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control.
WFOEs are typically limited liability enterprises[16] (like with EJVs) but the liability of the Directors, Managers, Advisers, and Suppliers depends on the rules which govern the Departments or Ministries which control product liability, worker safety or environmental protection.
An advantage the WFOE enjoys over its alternates is enhanced protection of its know-how but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential Chinese party.

Foreign Investment Companies Limited By Shares (FICLBS)[edit]
These enterprises are formed under the Sino-Foreign Investment Act. The capital is composed of value of stock in exchange for the value of the property given to the enterprise. The liability of the shareholders, including debt, is equal to the amount of shares purchased by each partner.
The registered capital of the company the share of the paid-in capital. The minimum amount of the registered capital of the company should be RMB 30 million. These companies can be listed on the only two PRC Stock Exchanges – the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. Shares of two types are permitted on these Exchanges – Types "A" and Type "B" shares.
Type A are only to be used by Chinese nationals and can be traded only in RMB. Type "B" shares are denominated in Remembi but can be traded in foreign exchange and by Chinese nationals having foreign exchange. Further, State enterprises which have been approved for corporatization can trade in Hong Kong in "H" share and in NYSE exchanges.
"A" shares are issued to and traded by Chinese nationals. They are issued and traded in Renminbi. "B" shares are denominated in Renminbi but are traded in foreign currency. From March 2001, in addition to foreign investors, Chinese nationals with foreign currency can also trade "B" shares.
Investment Companies by Foreign Investors (ICFI)[edit]
Brief coverage is provided.
Investment Companies are those established in China by sole foreign-funded business or jointly with Chinese partners who engage in direct investment. It has to be incorporated as a company with limited liability.
The total amount of the investor's assets during the year preceding the application to do business in China has to be no less than US $400 million within the territory of China. The paid-in capital contribution has to exceed $10 million. Furthermore, more than 3 project proposals of the investor's intended investment projects must have been approved. The shares subscribed and held by foreign Investment Companies by Foreign Investors (ICFI) should be 25%. The investment firm can be established as an EJV
Joint ventures in India[edit]
Suresh Parteti JV companies are the preferred form of corporate investment but there are no separate laws for joint ventures. Companies which are incorporated in India are treated on par as domestic companies.

The above two parties subscribe to the shares of the JV company in agreed proportion, in cash, and start a new business.
Two parties, (individuals or companies), incorporate a company in India. Business of one party is transferred to the company and as consideration for such transfer, shares are issued by the company and subscribed by that party. The other party subscribes for the shares in cash.
Promoter shareholder of an existing Indian company and a third party, who/which may be individual/company, one of them non-resident or both residents, collaborate to jointly carry on the business of that company and its shares are taken by the said third party through payment in cash.

Private companies (only about $2500 is the lower limit of capital, no upper limit) are allowed[17] in India together with and public companies, limited or not, likewise with partnerships. sole proprietorship too are allowed. However, the latter are reserved for NRIs.
Through capital market operations foreign companies can transact on the two exchanges without prior permission of RBI but they cannot own more than 10 percent equity in paid-up capital of Indian enterprises, while aggregate foreign institutional investment (FII) in an enterprise is capped at 24 percent.
The establishment of wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS) and project offices and branch offices, incorporated in India or not. Sometimes, it is understood, that branches are started to test the market and get its flavor. Equity transfer from residents to non-residents in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is usually permitted under the automatic route. However, if the M&As are in sectors and activities requiring prior government permission (Appendix 1 of the Policy) then transfer can proceed only after permission.[18]
Joint ventures with trading companies are allowed together with imports of secondhand plants and machinery.
It is expected that in a JV, the foreign partner supplies technical collaboration and the pricing includes the foreign exchange component, while the Indian partner makes available the factory or building site and locally made machinery and product parts. Many JVs are formed as public limited companies (LLCs) because of the advantages of limited liability.[19]
Joint ventures in Ukraine[edit]
In Ukraine most of joint ventures are operated in the form of Limited liability company,[20] as there is no legal entity form as Joint venture. Protection of the rights of foreign investors is guaranteed by Law of Ukraine "On Foreign Investment". In Ukraine, JV can be established without legal entity formation and act under so called Cooperation Agreement[21] (Dogovir pro spilnu diyalnist; Ukr. Договір про спільну діяльність). Under Ukraine civil code, CA can be established by two or more parties; rights and obligations of the parties are regulated by the agreement. Cooperation agreement has been widely spread in Ukraine, mainly in the field of oil and gas production.
Dissolution[edit]
The JV is not a permanent structure. It can be dissolved when:

Aims of original venture met
Aims of original venture not met
Either or both parties develop new goals
Either or both parties no longer agree with joint venture aims
Time agreed for joint venture has expired
Legal or financial issues
Evolving market conditions mean that joint venture is no longer appropriate or relevant
One party acquires the other

A joint venture (JV) is a business entity created by two or more parties, generally characterized by shared ownership, shared returns and risks, and shared governance.
Most joint ventures are incorporated, although some, as in the oil and gas industry, are "unincorporated" joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity. Key elements of a joint venture's design include: 1) the number of parties; 2) the geographic, product, technology and value-chain scope within which the JV will operate; 3) the contributions of the parties; 4) the structural form (each country has specific options, e.g. in the U.S. the main options are a C Corporation or an LLC/partnership structure); 5) the valuation of initial contributions and ownership split among the parties; 6) the economic arrangements, post-deal (e.g. Is the joint venture intended to general profits vs. operate as a cost-sharing or production-sharing venture; if a for-profit entity, will the parties share profits in proportion to equity ownership, or some other way?); 7) governance and control; 8) Talent/HR model (will the Jv have its own staff on own payroll vs. second staff from the parent companies; 9) contractual arrangements with the parent companies for inputs, outputs or services; 10) exit and evolution provisions?
Companies typically pursue joint ventures for one of four reasons: to access a new market, particularly emerging markets; to gain scale efficiencies by combining assets and operations; to share risk for major investments or projects; or to access skills and capabilities.[1]
In European law, the term "joint venture" (or joint undertaking) is an elusive legal concept, better defined under the rules of company law. In France, the term "joint venture" is variously translated "association d'entreprises", "entreprise conjointe", "coentreprise" or "entreprise commune". In Germany, "joint venture" is better represented as a "combination of companies" (Konzern).[2]
With individuals, when two or more persons come together to form a temporary partnership for the purpose of carrying out a particular project, such partnership can also be called a joint venture where the parties are "co-venturers".
The venture can be a business JV (for example, Dow Corning), a project/asset JV intended to pursue one specific project only, or a JV aimed at defining standards or serving as an "industry utility" that provides a narrow set of services to industry participants.
Some major joint ventures include MillerCoors, Sony Ericsson, Penske Truck Leasing, and Owens-Corning - and in the past, Dow Corning.

JV process[edit]
Overall, the JV process has a series of steps:

Defining the business strategy.
Determining whether a JV is the right vehicle. This requires comparing the JV option against acquisition, non-equity partnership, contractual alliance, or go-alone approaches. Generally JVs are most appropriate when 1) they are focused on combining complementary capabilities (e.g. products and market access), sharing risks, or 2) merging businesses where an outright M&A transaction isn't possible or where the premium involved in an acquisition can't be recovered via operating synergies and 3) when go-it-alone is too risky or too slow, and 4) simpler vehicles like contractual agreements aren't sufficient.
Screening partners.
Developing the JV deal concept.
Negotiating detailed terms and conditions.
Planning and launching the JV.
Evolving, or terminating, the JV.

Partner selection[edit]
While the following offers some insight to the process of joining up with a committed partner to form a JV, it is often difficult to determine whether the commitments come from a known and distinguishable party or an intermediary. This is particularly so when the language barrier exists and one is unfamiliar with local customs, especially in approaches to government, often the deciding body for the formation of a JV or dispute settlement.
The ideal process of selecting a JV partner emerges from:

screening of prospective partners
short listing a set of prospective partners and some sort of ranking
due diligence – checking the credentials of the other party
availability of appreciated or depreciated property contributed to the joint venture
the most appropriate structure and invitation/bid
foreign investor buying an interest in a local company

Companies are also called JVs in cases where there are dominant partners together with participation of the public. There may also be cases where the public shareholding is substantial but the founding partners retain their identity. These companies may be "public" or "private" companies. It would be out of place to describe them, except to say there are many in India.
Further consideration relates to starting a new legal entity ground up. Such an enterprise is sometimes called "an incorporated JV", one "packaged" with technology contracts (knowhow, patents, trademarks and copyright), technical services and assisted-supply arrangements.
The consortium JV (also known as a cooperative agreement) is formed where one party seeks technological expertise or technical service arrangements, franchise and brand use agreements, management contracts, rental agreements, for "one-time" contracts, e.g., for construction projects. They dissolve the JV when that goal is reached.
Company incorporation[edit]
A JV can be brought about in the following major ways:

Foreign investor buying an interest in a local company
Local firm acquiring an interest in an existing foreign firm
Both the foreign and local entrepreneurs jointly forming a new enterprise
Together with public capital and/or bank debt

In the UK, India, and in many Common Law countries a joint-venture (or else a company formed by a group of individuals) must file with the appropriate authority the Memorandum of Association. It is a statutory document which informs the outside public of its existence. It may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed. A sample can be seen at wikimedia.org.[3] Together with the Articles of Association, it forms the "constitution" of a company in these countries.
The Articles of Association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to 700,000+ pages. It deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the directors and those withheld by them, requiring the passing of ordinary resolutions, special resolutions and the holding of Extraordinary General Meetings to bring the directors' decision to bear.
A Certificate of Incorporation[4] or the Articles of Incorporation[5] is a document required to form a corporation in the U.S. (in actuality, the state where it is incorporated) and in countries following the practice. In the US, the "constitution" is a single document. The Articles of Incorporation is again a regulation of the directors by the stock-holders in a company.
By its formation the JV becomes a new entity with the implication:

that it is officially separate from its Founders, who might otherwise be giant corporations, even amongst the emerging countries
the JV can contract in its own name, acquire rights (such as the right to buy new companies), and
it has a separate liability from that of its founders, except for invested capital
it can sue (and be sued) in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives.

On the receipt of the Certificate of Incorporation a company can commence its business.
Shareholders' agreement[edit]
This is a legal area and is fraught with difficulty as the laws of countries differ, particularly on the enforceability of "heads of" or shareholder agreements. For some legal reasons it may be called a Memorandum of Understanding. It is done in parallel with other activities in forming a JV. Though dealt with briefly for a shareholders' agreement,[6] some issues must be dealt with here as a preamble to the discussion that follows. There are also many issues which are not in the Articles when a company starts up or never ever present. Also, a JV may elect to stay as a JV alone in a "quasi partnership" to avoid any nonessential disclosure to the government or the public.
Some of the issues in a shareholders' agreement are:

Valuation of intellectual rights, say, the valuations of the IPR of one partner and,say, the real estate of the other
the control of the company either by the number of directors or its "funding"
The number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality.
management decisions - whether the board manages or a founder
transferability of shares - assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company
dividend policy - percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit
winding up - the conditions, notice to members
confidentiality of know-how and founders' agreement and penalties for disclosure
first right of refusal - purchase rights and counter-bid by a founder.

There are many features which have to be incorporated into the shareholders' agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off. Normally, it requires no submission to any authority.
The other basic document which must be articulated is the Articles, which is a published document and known to members. This repeats the shareholders agreement as to the number of directors each founder can appoint to the board of directors; whether the board controls or the founders; the taking of decisions by simple majority (50%+1) of those present or a 51% or 75% majority with all directors present (their alternates/proxy); the deployment of funds of the firm; extent of debt; the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends; etc. Also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved, if one of the partners dies, or if the firm is sold.
Often the most successful JVs are those with 50:50 partnership with each party having the same number of directors but rotating control over the firm, or rights to appoint the Chairperson and Vice-chair of the company. Sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the Founder at board meetings.[7]
Recently, in a major case the Indian Supreme Court has held that Memorandums of Understanding (whose details are not in the Articles of Association) are "unconstitutional" giving more transparency to undertakings.
Chinese law[edit]
According to a report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 2003, China was the recipient of US$53.5 billion in direct foreign investment, making it the world's largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time, to exceed the USA. Also, it approved the establishment of nearly 500,000 foreign-investment enterprises.[8] The US had 45,000 projects (by 2004) with an in-place investment of over 48 billion.[9]
Until recently, no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of China toward foreign investors. Following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied, and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in 1979, while the first Sino-foreign equity venture took place in 2001.[10] The corpus of the law has improved since then.
Companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in China and can sell through their own sales network. Foreign-Sino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly Chinese companies, as China desires to import foreign technology by encouraging JVs and the latest technologies.
Under Chinese law, foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories. Of these, five will be described or mentioned here: three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment. Those 5 categories of Chinese foreign enterprises are: the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures (EJVs), Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs), Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises (WFOE), although they do not strictly belong to Joint Ventures, plus foreign investment companies limited by shares (FICLBS), and Investment Companies through Foreign Investors (ICFI). Each category is described below.
Equity joint ventures[edit]
The EJV Law is between a Chinese partner and a foreign company. It is incorporated in both Chinese (official) and in English (with equal validity), with limited liability. Prior to China's entry into WTO – and thus the WFOEs – EJVs predominated. In the EJV mode, the partners share profits, losses and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the venture's registered capital. These escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital.
The JV contract accompanied by the Articles of Association for the EJV are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project. The Articles mirror many of the provisions of the JV contract. In case of conflict the JV document has precedence These documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report. There are also the ancillary documents (termed "offsets" in the US) covering know-how and trademarks and supply-of-equipment agreements.
The minimum equity is prescribed for investment (truncated),[11][12] where the foreign equity and debt levels are:[13]

less than US$3 million, equity must constitute 70% of the investment;
between US$3 million and US$10 million, minimum equity must be US$2.1 million and at least 50% of the investment;
between US$10 million and US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$5 million and at least 40% of the investment;
more than US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$12 million and at least 1/3 of the investment.

There are also intermediary levels.
The foreign investment in the total project must be at least 25%. No minimum investment is set for the Chinese partner. The timing of investments must be mentioned in the Agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time, draws a penalty.
Cooperative joint ventures[edit]
Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs)[14] are permitted under the Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures. Co-operative enterprises are also called Contractual Operative Enterprises.
The CJVs may have a limited structure or unlimited – therefore, there are two versions. The limited-liability version is similar to the EJVs in status of permissions - the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the Chinese party provides land, buildings, equipment, etc. However, there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder.
The other format of the CJV is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created. In both the cases, the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal Chinese person which can hire labor directly as, for example, a Chinese national contactor. The minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment.
Other differences from the EJV are to be noted:

A Co-operative JV does not have to be a legal entity.
The partners in a CJV are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis, not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution. This proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion.
It may be possible to operate in a CJV in a restricted area
A CJV could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control, as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts. In an EJV management control is through allocation of Board seats.[15]
During the term of the venture, the foreign participant can recover his investment, provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the Chinese participant on termination of the JV.
Foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management, voting, and staffing rights into a CJV's articles; since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes.

Convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment. It is therefore easier to find co-operative partners and to reach an agreement.
With changes in the law, it becomes possible to merge with a Chinese company for a quick start. A foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in China. Instead, the investor uses the Chinese partner's business license, under a contractual arrangement. Under the CJV, however, the land stays in the possession of the Chinese partner.
There is another advantage: the percentage of the CJV owned by each partner can change throughout the JV's life, giving the option to the foreign investor, by holding higher equity, obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the Chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining long-term control.
The parties in any of the ventures, EJV, CJV or WFOE prepare a feasibility study outlined above. It is a non-binding document - the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project. The feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project, before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation. The study should contain details referred to earlier under Feasibility Study[8] (submissions by the Chinese partner).
Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises (WFOEs)[edit]
Main article: Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise
There is basic law of the PRC concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls, WFOEs. China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) around 2001 has had profound effects on foreign investment. Not being a JV, they are considered here only in comparison or contrast.
To implement WTO commitments, China publishes from time to time updated versions of its "Catalogs Investments" (affecting ventures) prohibited, restricted.
The WFOE is a Chinese legal person and has to obey all Chinese laws. As such, it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights, rent buildings, and receive utility services. In this it is more similar to a CJV than an EJV.
WFOEs are expected by PRC to use the most modern technologies and to export at least 50% of their production, with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control.
WFOEs are typically limited liability enterprises[16] (like with EJVs) but the liability of the Directors, Managers, Advisers, and Suppliers depends on the rules which govern the Departments or Ministries which control product liability, worker safety or environmental protection.
An advantage the WFOE enjoys over its alternates is enhanced protection of its know-how but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential Chinese party.

Foreign Investment Companies Limited By Shares (FICLBS)[edit]
These enterprises are formed under the Sino-Foreign Investment Act. The capital is composed of value of stock in exchange for the value of the property given to the enterprise. The liability of the shareholders, including debt, is equal to the amount of shares purchased by each partner.
The registered capital of the company the share of the paid-in capital. The minimum amount of the registered capital of the company should be RMB 30 million. These companies can be listed on the only two PRC Stock Exchanges – the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. Shares of two types are permitted on these Exchanges – Types "A" and Type "B" shares.
Type A are only to be used by Chinese nationals and can be traded only in RMB. Type "B" shares are denominated in Remembi but can be traded in foreign exchange and by Chinese nationals having foreign exchange. Further, State enterprises which have been approved for corporatization can trade in Hong Kong in "H" share and in NYSE exchanges.
"A" shares are issued to and traded by Chinese nationals. They are issued and traded in Renminbi. "B" shares are denominated in Renminbi but are traded in foreign currency. From March 2001, in addition to foreign investors, Chinese nationals with foreign currency can also trade "B" shares.
Investment Companies by Foreign Investors (ICFI)[edit]
Brief coverage is provided.
Investment Companies are those established in China by sole foreign-funded business or jointly with Chinese partners who engage in direct investment. It has to be incorporated as a company with limited liability.
The total amount of the investor's assets during the year preceding the application to do business in China has to be no less than US $400 million within the territory of China. The paid-in capital contribution has to exceed $10 million. Furthermore, more than 3 project proposals of the investor's intended investment projects must have been approved. The shares subscribed and held by foreign Investment Companies by Foreign Investors (ICFI) should be 25%. The investment firm can be established as an EJV
Joint ventures in India[edit]
Suresh Parteti JV companies are the preferred form of corporate investment but there are no separate laws for joint ventures. Companies which are incorporated in India are treated on par as domestic companies.

The above two parties subscribe to the shares of the JV company in agreed proportion, in cash, and start a new business.
Two parties, (individuals or companies), incorporate a company in India. Business of one party is transferred to the company and as consideration for such transfer, shares are issued by the company and subscribed by that party. The other party subscribes for the shares in cash.
Promoter shareholder of an existing Indian company and a third party, who/which may be individual/company, one of them non-resident or both residents, collaborate to jointly carry on the business of that company and its shares are taken by the said third party through payment in cash.

Private companies (only about $2500 is the lower limit of capital, no upper limit) are allowed[17] in India together with and public companies, limited or not, likewise with partnerships. sole proprietorship too are allowed. However, the latter are reserved for NRIs.
Through capital market operations foreign companies can transact on the two exchanges without prior permission of RBI but they cannot own more than 10 percent equity in paid-up capital of Indian enterprises, while aggregate foreign institutional investment (FII) in an enterprise is capped at 24 percent.
The establishment of wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS) and project offices and branch offices, incorporated in India or not. Sometimes, it is understood, that branches are started to test the market and get its flavor. Equity transfer from residents to non-residents in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is usually permitted under the automatic route. However, if the M&As are in sectors and activities requiring prior government permission (Appendix 1 of the Policy) then transfer can proceed only after permission.[18]
Joint ventures with trading companies are allowed together with imports of secondhand plants and machinery.
It is expected that in a JV, the foreign partner supplies technical collaboration and the pricing includes the foreign exchange component, while the Indian partner makes available the factory or building site and locally made machinery and product parts. Many JVs are formed as public limited companies (LLCs) because of the advantages of limited liability.[19]
Joint ventures in Ukraine[edit]
In Ukraine most of joint ventures are operated in the form of Limited liability company,[20] as there is no legal entity form as Joint venture. Protection of the rights of foreign investors is guaranteed by Law of Ukraine "On Foreign Investment". In Ukraine, JV can be established without legal entity formation and act under so called Cooperation Agreement[21] (Dogovir pro spilnu diyalnist; Ukr. Договір про спільну діяльність). Under Ukraine civil code, CA can be established by two or more parties; rights and obligations of the parties are regulated by the agreement. Cooperation agreement has been widely spread in Ukraine, mainly in the field of oil and gas production.
Dissolution[edit]
The JV is not a permanent structure. It can be dissolved when:

Aims of original venture met
Aims of original venture not met
Either or both parties develop new goals
Either or both parties no longer agree with joint venture aims
Time agreed for joint venture has expired
Legal or financial issues
Evolving market conditions mean that joint venture is no longer appropriate or relevant
One party acquires the other

A joint venture (JV) is a business entity created by two or more parties, generally characterized by shared ownership, shared returns and risks, and shared governance.
Most joint ventures are incorporated, although some, as in the oil and gas industry, are "unincorporated" joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity. Key elements of a joint venture's design include: 1) the number of parties; 2) the geographic, product, technology and value-chain scope within which the JV will operate; 3) the contributions of the parties; 4) the structural form (each country has specific options, e.g. in the U.S. the main options are a C Corporation or an LLC/partnership structure); 5) the valuation of initial contributions and ownership split among the parties; 6) the economic arrangements, post-deal (e.g. Is the joint venture intended to general profits vs. operate as a cost-sharing or production-sharing venture; if a for-profit entity, will the parties share profits in proportion to equity ownership, or some other way?); 7) governance and control; 8) Talent/HR model (will the Jv have its own staff on own payroll vs. second staff from the parent companies; 9) contractual arrangements with the parent companies for inputs, outputs or services; 10) exit and evolution provisions?
Companies typically pursue joint ventures for one of four reasons: to access a new market, particularly emerging markets; to gain scale efficiencies by combining assets and operations; to share risk for major investments or projects; or to access skills and capabilities.[1]
In European law, the term "joint venture" (or joint undertaking) is an elusive legal concept, better defined under the rules of company law. In France, the term "joint venture" is variously translated "association d'entreprises", "entreprise conjointe", "coentreprise" or "entreprise commune". In Germany, "joint venture" is better represented as a "combination of companies" (Konzern).[2]
With individuals, when two or more persons come together to form a temporary partnership for the purpose of carrying out a particular project, such partnership can also be called a joint venture where the parties are "co-venturers".
The venture can be a business JV (for example, Dow Corning), a project/asset JV intended to pursue one specific project only, or a JV aimed at defining standards or serving as an "industry utility" that provides a narrow set of services to industry participants.
Some major joint ventures include MillerCoors, Sony Ericsson, Penske Truck Leasing, and Owens-Corning - and in the past, Dow Corning.

JV process[edit]
Overall, the JV process has a series of steps:

Defining the business strategy.
Determining whether a JV is the right vehicle. This requires comparing the JV option against acquisition, non-equity partnership, contractual alliance, or go-alone approaches. Generally JVs are most appropriate when 1) they are focused on combining complementary capabilities (e.g. products and market access), sharing risks, or 2) merging businesses where an outright M&A transaction isn't possible or where the premium involved in an acquisition can't be recovered via operating synergies and 3) when go-it-alone is too risky or too slow, and 4) simpler vehicles like contractual agreements aren't sufficient.
Screening partners.
Developing the JV deal concept.
Negotiating detailed terms and conditions.
Planning and launching the JV.
Evolving, or terminating, the JV.

Partner selection[edit]
While the following offers some insight to the process of joining up with a committed partner to form a JV, it is often difficult to determine whether the commitments come from a known and distinguishable party or an intermediary. This is particularly so when the language barrier exists and one is unfamiliar with local customs, especially in approaches to government, often the deciding body for the formation of a JV or dispute settlement.
The ideal process of selecting a JV partner emerges from:

screening of prospective partners
short listing a set of prospective partners and some sort of ranking
due diligence – checking the credentials of the other party
availability of appreciated or depreciated property contributed to the joint venture
the most appropriate structure and invitation/bid
foreign investor buying an interest in a local company

Companies are also called JVs in cases where there are dominant partners together with participation of the public. There may also be cases where the public shareholding is substantial but the founding partners retain their identity. These companies may be "public" or "private" companies. It would be out of place to describe them, except to say there are many in India.
Further consideration relates to starting a new legal entity ground up. Such an enterprise is sometimes called "an incorporated JV", one "packaged" with technology contracts (knowhow, patents, trademarks and copyright), technical services and assisted-supply arrangements.
The consortium JV (also known as a cooperative agreement) is formed where one party seeks technological expertise or technical service arrangements, franchise and brand use agreements, management contracts, rental agreements, for "one-time" contracts, e.g., for construction projects. They dissolve the JV when that goal is reached.
Company incorporation[edit]
A JV can be brought about in the following major ways:

Foreign investor buying an interest in a local company
Local firm acquiring an interest in an existing foreign firm
Both the foreign and local entrepreneurs jointly forming a new enterprise
Together with public capital and/or bank debt

In the UK, India, and in many Common Law countries a joint-venture (or else a company formed by a group of individuals) must file with the appropriate authority the Memorandum of Association. It is a statutory document which informs the outside public of its existence. It may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed. A sample can be seen at wikimedia.org.[3] Together with the Articles of Association, it forms the "constitution" of a company in these countries.
The Articles of Association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to 700,000+ pages. It deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the directors and those withheld by them, requiring the passing of ordinary resolutions, special resolutions and the holding of Extraordinary General Meetings to bring the directors' decision to bear.
A Certificate of Incorporation[4] or the Articles of Incorporation[5] is a document required to form a corporation in the U.S. (in actuality, the state where it is incorporated) and in countries following the practice. In the US, the "constitution" is a single document. The Articles of Incorporation is again a regulation of the directors by the stock-holders in a company.
By its formation the JV becomes a new entity with the implication:

that it is officially separate from its Founders, who might otherwise be giant corporations, even amongst the emerging countries
the JV can contract in its own name, acquire rights (such as the right to buy new companies), and
it has a separate liability from that of its founders, except for invested capital
it can sue (and be sued) in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives.

On the receipt of the Certificate of Incorporation a company can commence its business.
Shareholders' agreement[edit]
This is a legal area and is fraught with difficulty as the laws of countries differ, particularly on the enforceability of "heads of" or shareholder agreements. For some legal reasons it may be called a Memorandum of Understanding. It is done in parallel with other activities in forming a JV. Though dealt with briefly for a shareholders' agreement,[6] some issues must be dealt with here as a preamble to the discussion that follows. There are also many issues which are not in the Articles when a company starts up or never ever present. Also, a JV may elect to stay as a JV alone in a "quasi partnership" to avoid any nonessential disclosure to the government or the public.
Some of the issues in a shareholders' agreement are:

Valuation of intellectual rights, say, the valuations of the IPR of one partner and,say, the real estate of the other
the control of the company either by the number of directors or its "funding"
The number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality.
management decisions - whether the board manages or a founder
transferability of shares - assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company
dividend policy - percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit
winding up - the conditions, notice to members
confidentiality of know-how and founders' agreement and penalties for disclosure
first right of refusal - purchase rights and counter-bid by a founder.

There are many features which have to be incorporated into the shareholders' agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off. Normally, it requires no submission to any authority.
The other basic document which must be articulated is the Articles, which is a published document and known to members. This repeats the shareholders agreement as to the number of directors each founder can appoint to the board of directors; whether the board controls or the founders; the taking of decisions by simple majority (50%+1) of those present or a 51% or 75% majority with all directors present (their alternates/proxy); the deployment of funds of the firm; extent of debt; the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends; etc. Also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved, if one of the partners dies, or if the firm is sold.
Often the most successful JVs are those with 50:50 partnership with each party having the same number of directors but rotating control over the firm, or rights to appoint the Chairperson and Vice-chair of the company. Sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the Founder at board meetings.[7]
Recently, in a major case the Indian Supreme Court has held that Memorandums of Understanding (whose details are not in the Articles of Association) are "unconstitutional" giving more transparency to undertakings.
Chinese law[edit]
According to a report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 2003, China was the recipient of US$53.5 billion in direct foreign investment, making it the world's largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time, to exceed the USA. Also, it approved the establishment of nearly 500,000 foreign-investment enterprises.[8] The US had 45,000 projects (by 2004) with an in-place investment of over 48 billion.[9]
Until recently, no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of China toward foreign investors. Following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied, and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in 1979, while the first Sino-foreign equity venture took place in 2001.[10] The corpus of the law has improved since then.
Companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in China and can sell through their own sales network. Foreign-Sino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly Chinese companies, as China desires to import foreign technology by encouraging JVs and the latest technologies.
Under Chinese law, foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories. Of these, five will be described or mentioned here: three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment. Those 5 categories of Chinese foreign enterprises are: the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures (EJVs), Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs), Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises (WFOE), although they do not strictly belong to Joint Ventures, plus foreign investment companies limited by shares (FICLBS), and Investment Companies through Foreign Investors (ICFI). Each category is described below.
Equity joint ventures[edit]
The EJV Law is between a Chinese partner and a foreign company. It is incorporated in both Chinese (official) and in English (with equal validity), with limited liability. Prior to China's entry into WTO – and thus the WFOEs – EJVs predominated. In the EJV mode, the partners share profits, losses and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the venture's registered capital. These escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital.
The JV contract accompanied by the Articles of Association for the EJV are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project. The Articles mirror many of the provisions of the JV contract. In case of conflict the JV document has precedence These documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report. There are also the ancillary documents (termed "offsets" in the US) covering know-how and trademarks and supply-of-equipment agreements.
The minimum equity is prescribed for investment (truncated),[11][12] where the foreign equity and debt levels are:[13]

less than US$3 million, equity must constitute 70% of the investment;
between US$3 million and US$10 million, minimum equity must be US$2.1 million and at least 50% of the investment;
between US$10 million and US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$5 million and at least 40% of the investment;
more than US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$12 million and at least 1/3 of the investment.

There are also intermediary levels.
The foreign investment in the total project must be at least 25%. No minimum investment is set for the Chinese partner. The timing of investments must be mentioned in the Agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time, draws a penalty.
Cooperative joint ventures[edit]
Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs)[14] are permitted under the Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures. Co-operative enterprises are also called Contractual Operative Enterprises.
The CJVs may have a limited structure or unlimited – therefore, there are two versions. The limited-liability version is similar to the EJVs in status of permissions - the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the Chinese party provides land, buildings, equipment, etc. However, there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder.
The other format of the CJV is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created. In both the cases, the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal Chinese person which can hire labor directly as, for example, a Chinese national contactor. The minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment.
Other differences from the EJV are to be noted:

A Co-operative JV does not have to be a legal entity.
The partners in a CJV are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis, not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution. This proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion.
It may be possible to operate in a CJV in a restricted area
A CJV could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control, as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts. In an EJV management control is through allocation of Board seats.[15]
During the term of the venture, the foreign participant can recover his investment, provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the Chinese participant on termination of the JV.
Foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management, voting, and staffing rights into a CJV's articles; since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes.

Convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment. It is therefore easier to find co-operative partners and to reach an agreement.
With changes in the law, it becomes possible to merge with a Chinese company for a quick start. A foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in China. Instead, the investor uses the Chinese partner's business license, under a contractual arrangement. Under the CJV, however, the land stays in the possession of the Chinese partner.
There is another advantage: the percentage of the CJV owned by each partner can change throughout the JV's life, giving the option to the foreign investor, by holding higher equity, obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the Chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining long-term control.
The parties in any of the ventures, EJV, CJV or WFOE prepare a feasibility study outlined above. It is a non-binding document - the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project. The feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project, before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation. The study should contain details referred to earlier under Feasibility Study[8] (submissions by the Chinese partner).
Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises (WFOEs)[edit]
Main article: Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise
There is basic law of the PRC concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls, WFOEs. China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) around 2001 has had profound effects on foreign investment. Not being a JV, they are considered here only in comparison or contrast.
To implement WTO commitments, China publishes from time to time updated versions of its "Catalogs Investments" (affecting ventures) prohibited, restricted.
The WFOE is a Chinese legal person and has to obey all Chinese laws. As such, it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights, rent buildings, and receive utility services. In this it is more similar to a CJV than an EJV.
WFOEs are expected by PRC to use the most modern technologies and to export at least 50% of their production, with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control.
WFOEs are typically limited liability enterprises[16] (like with EJVs) but the liability of the Directors, Managers, Advisers, and Suppliers depends on the rules which govern the Departments or Ministries which control product liability, worker safety or environmental protection.
An advantage the WFOE enjoys over its alternates is enhanced protection of its know-how but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential Chinese party.

Foreign Investment Companies Limited By Shares (FICLBS)[edit]
These enterprises are formed under the Sino-Foreign Investment Act. The capital is composed of value of stock in exchange for the value of the property given to the enterprise. The liability of the shareholders, including debt, is equal to the amount of shares purchased by each partner.
The registered capital of the company the share of the paid-in capital. The minimum amount of the registered capital of the company should be RMB 30 million. These companies can be listed on the only two PRC Stock Exchanges – the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. Shares of two types are permitted on these Exchanges – Types "A" and Type "B" shares.
Type A are only to be used by Chinese nationals and can be traded only in RMB. Type "B" shares are denominated in Remembi but can be traded in foreign exchange and by Chinese nationals having foreign exchange. Further, State enterprises which have been approved for corporatization can trade in Hong Kong in "H" share and in NYSE exchanges.
"A" shares are issued to and traded by Chinese nationals. They are issued and traded in Renminbi. "B" shares are denominated in Renminbi but are traded in foreign currency. From March 2001, in addition to foreign investors, Chinese nationals with foreign currency can also trade "B" shares.
Investment Companies by Foreign Investors (ICFI)[edit]
Brief coverage is provided.
Investment Companies are those established in China by sole foreign-funded business or jointly with Chinese partners who engage in direct investment. It has to be incorporated as a company with limited liability.
The total amount of the investor's assets during the year preceding the application to do business in China has to be no less than US $400 million within the territory of China. The paid-in capital contribution has to exceed $10 million. Furthermore, more than 3 project proposals of the investor's intended investment projects must have been approved. The shares subscribed and held by foreign Investment Companies by Foreign Investors (ICFI) should be 25%. The investment firm can be established as an EJV
Joint ventures in India[edit]
Suresh Parteti JV companies are the preferred form of corporate investment but there are no separate laws for joint ventures. Companies which are incorporated in India are treated on par as domestic companies.

The above two parties subscribe to the shares of the JV company in agreed proportion, in cash, and start a new business.
Two parties, (individuals or companies), incorporate a company in India. Business of one party is transferred to the company and as consideration for such transfer, shares are issued by the company and subscribed by that party. The other party subscribes for the shares in cash.
Promoter shareholder of an existing Indian company and a third party, who/which may be individual/company, one of them non-resident or both residents, collaborate to jointly carry on the business of that company and its shares are taken by the said third party through payment in cash.

Private companies (only about $2500 is the lower limit of capital, no upper limit) are allowed[17] in India together with and public companies, limited or not, likewise with partnerships. sole proprietorship too are allowed. However, the latter are reserved for NRIs.
Through capital market operations foreign companies can transact on the two exchanges without prior permission of RBI but they cannot own more than 10 percent equity in paid-up capital of Indian enterprises, while aggregate foreign institutional investment (FII) in an enterprise is capped at 24 percent.
The establishment of wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS) and project offices and branch offices, incorporated in India or not. Sometimes, it is understood, that branches are started to test the market and get its flavor. Equity transfer from residents to non-residents in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is usually permitted under the automatic route. However, if the M&As are in sectors and activities requiring prior government permission (Appendix 1 of the Policy) then transfer can proceed only after permission.[18]
Joint ventures with trading companies are allowed together with imports of secondhand plants and machinery.
It is expected that in a JV, the foreign partner supplies technical collaboration and the pricing includes the foreign exchange component, while the Indian partner makes available the factory or building site and locally made machinery and product parts. Many JVs are formed as public limited companies (LLCs) because of the advantages of limited liability.[19]
Joint ventures in Ukraine[edit]
In Ukraine most of joint ventures are operated in the form of Limited liability company,[20] as there is no legal entity form as Joint venture. Protection of the rights of foreign investors is guaranteed by Law of Ukraine "On Foreign Investment". In Ukraine, JV can be established without legal entity formation and act under so called Cooperation Agreement[21] (Dogovir pro spilnu diyalnist; Ukr. Договір про спільну діяльність). Under Ukraine civil code, CA can be established by two or more parties; rights and obligations of the parties are regulated by the agreement. Cooperation agreement has been widely spread in Ukraine, mainly in the field of oil and gas production.
Dissolution[edit]
The JV is not a permanent structure. It can be dissolved when:

Aims of original venture met
Aims of original venture not met
Either or both parties develop new goals
Either or both parties no longer agree with joint venture aims
Time agreed for joint venture has expired
Legal or financial issues
Evolving market conditions mean that joint venture is no longer appropriate or relevant
One party acquires the other

A joint venture (JV) is a business entity created by two or more parties, generally characterized by shared ownership, shared returns and risks, and shared governance.
Most joint ventures are incorporated, although some, as in the oil and gas industry, are "unincorporated" joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity. Key elements of a joint venture's design include: 1) the number of parties; 2) the geographic, product, technology and value-chain scope within which the JV will operate; 3) the contributions of the parties; 4) the structural form (each country has specific options, e.g. in the U.S. the main options are a C Corporation or an LLC/partnership structure); 5) the valuation of initial contributions and ownership split among the parties; 6) the economic arrangements, post-deal (e.g. Is the joint venture intended to general profits vs. operate as a cost-sharing or production-sharing venture; if a for-profit entity, will the parties share profits in proportion to equity ownership, or some other way?); 7) governance and control; 8) Talent/HR model (will the Jv have its own staff on own payroll vs. second staff from the parent companies; 9) contractual arrangements with the parent companies for inputs, outputs or services; 10) exit and evolution provisions?
Companies typically pursue joint ventures for one of four reasons: to access a new market, particularly emerging markets; to gain scale efficiencies by combining assets and operations; to share risk for major investments or projects; or to access skills and capabilities.[1]
In European law, the term "joint venture" (or joint undertaking) is an elusive legal concept, better defined under the rules of company law. In France, the term "joint venture" is variously translated "association d'entreprises", "entreprise conjointe", "coentreprise" or "entreprise commune". In Germany, "joint venture" is better represented as a "combination of companies" (Konzern).[2]
With individuals, when two or more persons come together to form a temporary partnership for the purpose of carrying out a particular project, such partnership can also be called a joint venture where the parties are "co-venturers".
The venture can be a business JV (for example, Dow Corning), a project/asset JV intended to pursue one specific project only, or a JV aimed at defining standards or serving as an "industry utility" that provides a narrow set of services to industry participants.
Some major joint ventures include MillerCoors, Sony Ericsson, Penske Truck Leasing, and Owens-Corning - and in the past, Dow Corning.

JV process[edit]
Overall, the JV process has a series of steps:

Defining the business strategy.
Determining whether a JV is the right vehicle. This requires comparing the JV option against acquisition, non-equity partnership, contractual alliance, or go-alone approaches. Generally JVs are most appropriate when 1) they are focused on combining complementary capabilities (e.g. products and market access), sharing risks, or 2) merging businesses where an outright M&A transaction isn't possible or where the premium involved in an acquisition can't be recovered via operating synergies and 3) when go-it-alone is too risky or too slow, and 4) simpler vehicles like contractual agreements aren't sufficient.
Screening partners.
Developing the JV deal concept.
Negotiating detailed terms and conditions.
Planning and launching the JV.
Evolving, or terminating, the JV.

Partner selection[edit]
While the following offers some insight to the process of joining up with a committed partner to form a JV, it is often difficult to determine whether the commitments come from a known and distinguishable party or an intermediary. This is particularly so when the language barrier exists and one is unfamiliar with local customs, especially in approaches to government, often the deciding body for the formation of a JV or dispute settlement.
The ideal process of selecting a JV partner emerges from:

screening of prospective partners
short listing a set of prospective partners and some sort of ranking
due diligence – checking the credentials of the other party
availability of appreciated or depreciated property contributed to the joint venture
the most appropriate structure and invitation/bid
foreign investor buying an interest in a local company

Companies are also called JVs in cases where there are dominant partners together with participation of the public. There may also be cases where the public shareholding is substantial but the founding partners retain their identity. These companies may be "public" or "private" companies. It would be out of place to describe them, except to say there are many in India.
Further consideration relates to starting a new legal entity ground up. Such an enterprise is sometimes called "an incorporated JV", one "packaged" with technology contracts (knowhow, patents, trademarks and copyright), technical services and assisted-supply arrangements.
The consortium JV (also known as a cooperative agreement) is formed where one party seeks technological expertise or technical service arrangements, franchise and brand use agreements, management contracts, rental agreements, for "one-time" contracts, e.g., for construction projects. They dissolve the JV when that goal is reached.
Company incorporation[edit]
A JV can be brought about in the following major ways:

Foreign investor buying an interest in a local company
Local firm acquiring an interest in an existing foreign firm
Both the foreign and local entrepreneurs jointly forming a new enterprise
Together with public capital and/or bank debt

In the UK, India, and in many Common Law countries a joint-venture (or else a company formed by a group of individuals) must file with the appropriate authority the Memorandum of Association. It is a statutory document which informs the outside public of its existence. It may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed. A sample can be seen at wikimedia.org.[3] Together with the Articles of Association, it forms the "constitution" of a company in these countries.
The Articles of Association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to 700,000+ pages. It deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the directors and those withheld by them, requiring the passing of ordinary resolutions, special resolutions and the holding of Extraordinary General Meetings to bring the directors' decision to bear.
A Certificate of Incorporation[4] or the Articles of Incorporation[5] is a document required to form a corporation in the U.S. (in actuality, the state where it is incorporated) and in countries following the practice. In the US, the "constitution" is a single document. The Articles of Incorporation is again a regulation of the directors by the stock-holders in a company.
By its formation the JV becomes a new entity with the implication:

that it is officially separate from its Founders, who might otherwise be giant corporations, even amongst the emerging countries
the JV can contract in its own name, acquire rights (such as the right to buy new companies), and
it has a separate liability from that of its founders, except for invested capital
it can sue (and be sued) in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives.

On the receipt of the Certificate of Incorporation a company can commence its business.
Shareholders' agreement[edit]
This is a legal area and is fraught with difficulty as the laws of countries differ, particularly on the enforceability of "heads of" or shareholder agreements. For some legal reasons it may be called a Memorandum of Understanding. It is done in parallel with other activities in forming a JV. Though dealt with briefly for a shareholders' agreement,[6] some issues must be dealt with here as a preamble to the discussion that follows. There are also many issues which are not in the Articles when a company starts up or never ever present. Also, a JV may elect to stay as a JV alone in a "quasi partnership" to avoid any nonessential disclosure to the government or the public.
Some of the issues in a shareholders' agreement are:

Valuation of intellectual rights, say, the valuations of the IPR of one partner and,say, the real estate of the other
the control of the company either by the number of directors or its "funding"
The number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality.
management decisions - whether the board manages or a founder
transferability of shares - assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company
dividend policy - percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit
winding up - the conditions, notice to members
confidentiality of know-how and founders' agreement and penalties for disclosure
first right of refusal - purchase rights and counter-bid by a founder.

There are many features which have to be incorporated into the shareholders' agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off. Normally, it requires no submission to any authority.
The other basic document which must be articulated is the Articles, which is a published document and known to members. This repeats the shareholders agreement as to the number of directors each founder can appoint to the board of directors; whether the board controls or the founders; the taking of decisions by simple majority (50%+1) of those present or a 51% or 75% majority with all directors present (their alternates/proxy); the deployment of funds of the firm; extent of debt; the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends; etc. Also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved, if one of the partners dies, or if the firm is sold.
Often the most successful JVs are those with 50:50 partnership with each party having the same number of directors but rotating control over the firm, or rights to appoint the Chairperson and Vice-chair of the company. Sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the Founder at board meetings.[7]
Recently, in a major case the Indian Supreme Court has held that Memorandums of Understanding (whose details are not in the Articles of Association) are "unconstitutional" giving more transparency to undertakings.
Chinese law[edit]
According to a report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 2003, China was the recipient of US$53.5 billion in direct foreign investment, making it the world's largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time, to exceed the USA. Also, it approved the establishment of nearly 500,000 foreign-investment enterprises.[8] The US had 45,000 projects (by 2004) with an in-place investment of over 48 billion.[9]
Until recently, no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of China toward foreign investors. Following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied, and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in 1979, while the first Sino-foreign equity venture took place in 2001.[10] The corpus of the law has improved since then.
Companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in China and can sell through their own sales network. Foreign-Sino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly Chinese companies, as China desires to import foreign technology by encouraging JVs and the latest technologies.
Under Chinese law, foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories. Of these, five will be described or mentioned here: three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment. Those 5 categories of Chinese foreign enterprises are: the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures (EJVs), Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs), Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises (WFOE), although they do not strictly belong to Joint Ventures, plus foreign investment companies limited by shares (FICLBS), and Investment Companies through Foreign Investors (ICFI). Each category is described below.
Equity joint ventures[edit]
The EJV Law is between a Chinese partner and a foreign company. It is incorporated in both Chinese (official) and in English (with equal validity), with limited liability. Prior to China's entry into WTO – and thus the WFOEs – EJVs predominated. In the EJV mode, the partners share profits, losses and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the venture's registered capital. These escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital.
The JV contract accompanied by the Articles of Association for the EJV are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project. The Articles mirror many of the provisions of the JV contract. In case of conflict the JV document has precedence These documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report. There are also the ancillary documents (termed "offsets" in the US) covering know-how and trademarks and supply-of-equipment agreements.
The minimum equity is prescribed for investment (truncated),[11][12] where the foreign equity and debt levels are:[13]

less than US$3 million, equity must constitute 70% of the investment;
between US$3 million and US$10 million, minimum equity must be US$2.1 million and at least 50% of the investment;
between US$10 million and US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$5 million and at least 40% of the investment;
more than US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$12 million and at least 1/3 of the investment.

There are also intermediary levels.
The foreign investment in the total project must be at least 25%. No minimum investment is set for the Chinese partner. The timing of investments must be mentioned in the Agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time, draws a penalty.
Cooperative joint ventures[edit]
Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs)[14] are permitted under the Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures. Co-operative enterprises are also called Contractual Operative Enterprises.
The CJVs may have a limited structure or unlimited – therefore, there are two versions. The limited-liability version is similar to the EJVs in status of permissions - the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the Chinese party provides land, buildings, equipment, etc. However, there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder.
The other format of the CJV is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created. In both the cases, the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal Chinese person which can hire labor directly as, for example, a Chinese national contactor. The minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment.
Other differences from the EJV are to be noted:

A Co-operative JV does not have to be a legal entity.
The partners in a CJV are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis, not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution. This proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion.
It may be possible to operate in a CJV in a restricted area
A CJV could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control, as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts. In an EJV management control is through allocation of Board seats.[15]
During the term of the venture, the foreign participant can recover his investment, provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the Chinese participant on termination of the JV.
Foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management, voting, and staffing rights into a CJV's articles; since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes.

Convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment. It is therefore easier to find co-operative partners and to reach an agreement.
With changes in the law, it becomes possible to merge with a Chinese company for a quick start. A foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in China. Instead, the investor uses the Chinese partner's business license, under a contractual arrangement. Under the CJV, however, the land stays in the possession of the Chinese partner.
There is another advantage: the percentage of the CJV owned by each partner can change throughout the JV's life, giving the option to the foreign investor, by holding higher equity, obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the Chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining long-term control.
The parties in any of the ventures, EJV, CJV or WFOE prepare a feasibility study outlined above. It is a non-binding document - the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project. The feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project, before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation. The study should contain details referred to earlier under Feasibility Study[8] (submissions by the Chinese partner).
Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises (WFOEs)[edit]
Main article: Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise
There is basic law of the PRC concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls, WFOEs. China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) around 2001 has had profound effects on foreign investment. Not being a JV, they are considered here only in comparison or contrast.
To implement WTO commitments, China publishes from time to time updated versions of its "Catalogs Investments" (affecting ventures) prohibited, restricted.
The WFOE is a Chinese legal person and has to obey all Chinese laws. As such, it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights, rent buildings, and receive utility services. In this it is more similar to a CJV than an EJV.
WFOEs are expected by PRC to use the most modern technologies and to export at least 50% of their production, with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control.
WFOEs are typically limited liability enterprises[16] (like with EJVs) but the liability of the Directors, Managers, Advisers, and Suppliers depends on the rules which govern the Departments or Ministries which control product liability, worker safety or environmental protection.
An advantage the WFOE enjoys over its alternates is enhanced protection of its know-how but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential Chinese party.

Foreign Investment Companies Limited By Shares (FICLBS)[edit]
These enterprises are formed under the Sino-Foreign Investment Act. The capital is composed of value of stock in exchange for the value of the property given to the enterprise. The liability of the shareholders, including debt, is equal to the amount of shares purchased by each partner.
The registered capital of the company the share of the paid-in capital. The minimum amount of the registered capital of the company should be RMB 30 million. These companies can be listed on the only two PRC Stock Exchanges – the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. Shares of two types are permitted on these Exchanges – Types "A" and Type "B" shares.
Type A are only to be used by Chinese nationals and can be traded only in RMB. Type "B" shares are denominated in Remembi but can be traded in foreign exchange and by Chinese nationals having foreign exchange. Further, State enterprises which have been approved for corporatization can trade in Hong Kong in "H" share and in NYSE exchanges.
"A" shares are issued to and traded by Chinese nationals. They are issued and traded in Renminbi. "B" shares are denominated in Renminbi but are traded in foreign currency. From March 2001, in addition to foreign investors, Chinese nationals with foreign currency can also trade "B" shares.
Investment Companies by Foreign Investors (ICFI)[edit]
Brief coverage is provided.
Investment Companies are those established in China by sole foreign-funded business or jointly with Chinese partners who engage in direct investment. It has to be incorporated as a company with limited liability.
The total amount of the investor's assets during the year preceding the application to do business in China has to be no less than US $400 million within the territory of China. The paid-in capital contribution has to exceed $10 million. Furthermore, more than 3 project proposals of the investor's intended investment projects must have been approved. The shares subscribed and held by foreign Investment Companies by Foreign Investors (ICFI) should be 25%. The investment firm can be established as an EJV
Joint ventures in India[edit]
Suresh Parteti JV companies are the preferred form of corporate investment but there are no separate laws for joint ventures. Companies which are incorporated in India are treated on par as domestic companies.

The above two parties subscribe to the shares of the JV company in agreed proportion, in cash, and start a new business.
Two parties, (individuals or companies), incorporate a company in India. Business of one party is transferred to the company and as consideration for such transfer, shares are issued by the company and subscribed by that party. The other party subscribes for the shares in cash.
Promoter shareholder of an existing Indian company and a third party, who/which may be individual/company, one of them non-resident or both residents, collaborate to jointly carry on the business of that company and its shares are taken by the said third party through payment in cash.

Private companies (only about $2500 is the lower limit of capital, no upper limit) are allowed[17] in India together with and public companies, limited or not, likewise with partnerships. sole proprietorship too are allowed. However, the latter are reserved for NRIs.
Through capital market operations foreign companies can transact on the two exchanges without prior permission of RBI but they cannot own more than 10 percent equity in paid-up capital of Indian enterprises, while aggregate foreign institutional investment (FII) in an enterprise is capped at 24 percent.
The establishment of wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS) and project offices and branch offices, incorporated in India or not. Sometimes, it is understood, that branches are started to test the market and get its flavor. Equity transfer from residents to non-residents in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is usually permitted under the automatic route. However, if the M&As are in sectors and activities requiring prior government permission (Appendix 1 of the Policy) then transfer can proceed only after permission.[18]
Joint ventures with trading companies are allowed together with imports of secondhand plants and machinery.
It is expected that in a JV, the foreign partner supplies technical collaboration and the pricing includes the foreign exchange component, while the Indian partner makes available the factory or building site and locally made machinery and product parts. Many JVs are formed as public limited companies (LLCs) because of the advantages of limited liability.[19]
Joint ventures in Ukraine[edit]
In Ukraine most of joint ventures are operated in the form of Limited liability company,[20] as there is no legal entity form as Joint venture. Protection of the rights of foreign investors is guaranteed by Law of Ukraine "On Foreign Investment". In Ukraine, JV can be established without legal entity formation and act under so called Cooperation Agreement[21] (Dogovir pro spilnu diyalnist; Ukr. Договір про спільну діяльність). Under Ukraine civil code, CA can be established by two or more parties; rights and obligations of the parties are regulated by the agreement. Cooperation agreement has been widely spread in Ukraine, mainly in the field of oil and gas production.
Dissolution[edit]
The JV is not a permanent structure. It can be dissolved when:

Aims of original venture met
Aims of original venture not met
Either or both parties develop new goals
Either or both parties no longer agree with joint venture aims
Time agreed for joint venture has expired
Legal or financial issues
Evolving market conditions mean that joint venture is no longer appropriate or relevant
One party acquires the other

A joint venture (JV) is a business entity created by two or more parties, generally characterized by shared ownership, shared returns and risks, and shared governance.
Most joint ventures are incorporated, although some, as in the oil and gas industry, are "unincorporated" joint ventures that mimic a corporate entity. Key elements of a joint venture's design include: 1) the number of parties; 2) the geographic, product, technology and value-chain scope within which the JV will operate; 3) the contributions of the parties; 4) the structural form (each country has specific options, e.g. in the U.S. the main options are a C Corporation or an LLC/partnership structure); 5) the valuation of initial contributions and ownership split among the parties; 6) the economic arrangements, post-deal (e.g. Is the joint venture intended to general profits vs. operate as a cost-sharing or production-sharing venture; if a for-profit entity, will the parties share profits in proportion to equity ownership, or some other way?); 7) governance and control; 8) Talent/HR model (will the Jv have its own staff on own payroll vs. second staff from the parent companies; 9) contractual arrangements with the parent companies for inputs, outputs or services; 10) exit and evolution provisions?
Companies typically pursue joint ventures for one of four reasons: to access a new market, particularly emerging markets; to gain scale efficiencies by combining assets and operations; to share risk for major investments or projects; or to access skills and capabilities.[1]
In European law, the term "joint venture" (or joint undertaking) is an elusive legal concept, better defined under the rules of company law. In France, the term "joint venture" is variously translated "association d'entreprises", "entreprise conjointe", "coentreprise" or "entreprise commune". In Germany, "joint venture" is better represented as a "combination of companies" (Konzern).[2]
With individuals, when two or more persons come together to form a temporary partnership for the purpose of carrying out a particular project, such partnership can also be called a joint venture where the parties are "co-venturers".
The venture can be a business JV (for example, Dow Corning), a project/asset JV intended to pursue one specific project only, or a JV aimed at defining standards or serving as an "industry utility" that provides a narrow set of services to industry participants.
Some major joint ventures include MillerCoors, Sony Ericsson, Penske Truck Leasing, and Owens-Corning - and in the past, Dow Corning.

JV process[edit]
Overall, the JV process has a series of steps:

Defining the business strategy.
Determining whether a JV is the right vehicle. This requires comparing the JV option against acquisition, non-equity partnership, contractual alliance, or go-alone approaches. Generally JVs are most appropriate when 1) they are focused on combining complementary capabilities (e.g. products and market access), sharing risks, or 2) merging businesses where an outright M&A transaction isn't possible or where the premium involved in an acquisition can't be recovered via operating synergies and 3) when go-it-alone is too risky or too slow, and 4) simpler vehicles like contractual agreements aren't sufficient.
Screening partners.
Developing the JV deal concept.
Negotiating detailed terms and conditions.
Planning and launching the JV.
Evolving, or terminating, the JV.

Partner selection[edit]
While the following offers some insight to the process of joining up with a committed partner to form a JV, it is often difficult to determine whether the commitments come from a known and distinguishable party or an intermediary. This is particularly so when the language barrier exists and one is unfamiliar with local customs, especially in approaches to government, often the deciding body for the formation of a JV or dispute settlement.
The ideal process of selecting a JV partner emerges from:

screening of prospective partners
short listing a set of prospective partners and some sort of ranking
due diligence – checking the credentials of the other party
availability of appreciated or depreciated property contributed to the joint venture
the most appropriate structure and invitation/bid
foreign investor buying an interest in a local company

Companies are also called JVs in cases where there are dominant partners together with participation of the public. There may also be cases where the public shareholding is substantial but the founding partners retain their identity. These companies may be "public" or "private" companies. It would be out of place to describe them, except to say there are many in India.
Further consideration relates to starting a new legal entity ground up. Such an enterprise is sometimes called "an incorporated JV", one "packaged" with technology contracts (knowhow, patents, trademarks and copyright), technical services and assisted-supply arrangements.
The consortium JV (also known as a cooperative agreement) is formed where one party seeks technological expertise or technical service arrangements, franchise and brand use agreements, management contracts, rental agreements, for "one-time" contracts, e.g., for construction projects. They dissolve the JV when that goal is reached.
Company incorporation[edit]
A JV can be brought about in the following major ways:

Foreign investor buying an interest in a local company
Local firm acquiring an interest in an existing foreign firm
Both the foreign and local entrepreneurs jointly forming a new enterprise
Together with public capital and/or bank debt

In the UK, India, and in many Common Law countries a joint-venture (or else a company formed by a group of individuals) must file with the appropriate authority the Memorandum of Association. It is a statutory document which informs the outside public of its existence. It may be viewed by the public at the office in which it is filed. A sample can be seen at wikimedia.org.[3] Together with the Articles of Association, it forms the "constitution" of a company in these countries.
The Articles of Association regulate the interaction between shareholders and the directors of a company and can be a lengthy document of up to 700,000+ pages. It deals with the powers relegated by the stockholders to the directors and those withheld by them, requiring the passing of ordinary resolutions, special resolutions and the holding of Extraordinary General Meetings to bring the directors' decision to bear.
A Certificate of Incorporation[4] or the Articles of Incorporation[5] is a document required to form a corporation in the U.S. (in actuality, the state where it is incorporated) and in countries following the practice. In the US, the "constitution" is a single document. The Articles of Incorporation is again a regulation of the directors by the stock-holders in a company.
By its formation the JV becomes a new entity with the implication:

that it is officially separate from its Founders, who might otherwise be giant corporations, even amongst the emerging countries
the JV can contract in its own name, acquire rights (such as the right to buy new companies), and
it has a separate liability from that of its founders, except for invested capital
it can sue (and be sued) in courts in defense or its pursuance of its objectives.

On the receipt of the Certificate of Incorporation a company can commence its business.
Shareholders' agreement[edit]
This is a legal area and is fraught with difficulty as the laws of countries differ, particularly on the enforceability of "heads of" or shareholder agreements. For some legal reasons it may be called a Memorandum of Understanding. It is done in parallel with other activities in forming a JV. Though dealt with briefly for a shareholders' agreement,[6] some issues must be dealt with here as a preamble to the discussion that follows. There are also many issues which are not in the Articles when a company starts up or never ever present. Also, a JV may elect to stay as a JV alone in a "quasi partnership" to avoid any nonessential disclosure to the government or the public.
Some of the issues in a shareholders' agreement are:

Valuation of intellectual rights, say, the valuations of the IPR of one partner and,say, the real estate of the other
the control of the company either by the number of directors or its "funding"
The number of directors and the rights of the founders to their appoint directors which shows as to whether a shareholder dominates or shares equality.
management decisions - whether the board manages or a founder
transferability of shares - assignment rights of the founders to other members of the company
dividend policy - percentage of profits to be declared when there is profit
winding up - the conditions, notice to members
confidentiality of know-how and founders' agreement and penalties for disclosure
first right of refusal - purchase rights and counter-bid by a founder.

There are many features which have to be incorporated into the shareholders' agreement which is quite private to the parties as they start off. Normally, it requires no submission to any authority.
The other basic document which must be articulated is the Articles, which is a published document and known to members. This repeats the shareholders agreement as to the number of directors each founder can appoint to the board of directors; whether the board controls or the founders; the taking of decisions by simple majority (50%+1) of those present or a 51% or 75% majority with all directors present (their alternates/proxy); the deployment of funds of the firm; extent of debt; the proportion of profit that can be declared as dividends; etc. Also significant is what will happen if the firm is dissolved, if one of the partners dies, or if the firm is sold.
Often the most successful JVs are those with 50:50 partnership with each party having the same number of directors but rotating control over the firm, or rights to appoint the Chairperson and Vice-chair of the company. Sometimes a party may give a separate trusted person to vote in its place proxy vote of the Founder at board meetings.[7]
Recently, in a major case the Indian Supreme Court has held that Memorandums of Understanding (whose details are not in the Articles of Association) are "unconstitutional" giving more transparency to undertakings.
Chinese law[edit]
According to a report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 2003, China was the recipient of US$53.5 billion in direct foreign investment, making it the world's largest recipient of direct foreign investment for the first time, to exceed the USA. Also, it approved the establishment of nearly 500,000 foreign-investment enterprises.[8] The US had 45,000 projects (by 2004) with an in-place investment of over 48 billion.[9]
Until recently, no guidelines existed on how foreign investment was to be handled due to the restrictive nature of China toward foreign investors. Following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, initiatives in foreign trade began to be applied, and law applicable to foreign direct investment was made clear in 1979, while the first Sino-foreign equity venture took place in 2001.[10] The corpus of the law has improved since then.
Companies with foreign partners can carry out manufacturing and sales operations in China and can sell through their own sales network. Foreign-Sino companies have export rights which are not available to wholly Chinese companies, as China desires to import foreign technology by encouraging JVs and the latest technologies.
Under Chinese law, foreign enterprises are divided into several basic categories. Of these, five will be described or mentioned here: three relate to industry and services and two as vehicles for foreign investment. Those 5 categories of Chinese foreign enterprises are: the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures (EJVs), Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs), Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises (WFOE), although they do not strictly belong to Joint Ventures, plus foreign investment companies limited by shares (FICLBS), and Investment Companies through Foreign Investors (ICFI). Each category is described below.
Equity joint ventures[edit]
The EJV Law is between a Chinese partner and a foreign company. It is incorporated in both Chinese (official) and in English (with equal validity), with limited liability. Prior to China's entry into WTO – and thus the WFOEs – EJVs predominated. In the EJV mode, the partners share profits, losses and risk in equal proportion to their respective contributions to the venture's registered capital. These escalate upwardly in the same proportion as the increase in registered capital.
The JV contract accompanied by the Articles of Association for the EJV are the two most fundamental legal documents of the project. The Articles mirror many of the provisions of the JV contract. In case of conflict the JV document has precedence These documents are prepared at the same time as the feasibility report. There are also the ancillary documents (termed "offsets" in the US) covering know-how and trademarks and supply-of-equipment agreements.
The minimum equity is prescribed for investment (truncated),[11][12] where the foreign equity and debt levels are:[13]

less than US$3 million, equity must constitute 70% of the investment;
between US$3 million and US$10 million, minimum equity must be US$2.1 million and at least 50% of the investment;
between US$10 million and US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$5 million and at least 40% of the investment;
more than US$30 million, minimum equity must be US$12 million and at least 1/3 of the investment.

There are also intermediary levels.
The foreign investment in the total project must be at least 25%. No minimum investment is set for the Chinese partner. The timing of investments must be mentioned in the Agreement and failure to invest in the indicated time, draws a penalty.
Cooperative joint ventures[edit]
Co-operative Joint Ventures (CJVs)[14] are permitted under the Sino-Foreign Co-operative Joint Ventures. Co-operative enterprises are also called Contractual Operative Enterprises.
The CJVs may have a limited structure or unlimited – therefore, there are two versions. The limited-liability version is similar to the EJVs in status of permissions - the foreign investor provides the majority of funds and technology and the Chinese party provides land, buildings, equipment, etc. However, there are no minimum limits on the foreign partner which allows him to be a minority shareholder.
The other format of the CJV is similar to a partnership where the parties jointly incur unlimited liability for the debts of the enterprise with no separate legal person being created. In both the cases, the status of the formed enterprise is that of a legal Chinese person which can hire labor directly as, for example, a Chinese national contactor. The minimum of the capital is registered at various levels of investment.
Other differences from the EJV are to be noted:

A Co-operative JV does not have to be a legal entity.
The partners in a CJV are allowed to share profit on an agreed basis, not necessarily in proportion to capital contribution. This proportion also determines the control and the risks of the enterprise in the same proportion.
It may be possible to operate in a CJV in a restricted area
A CJV could allow negotiated levels of management and financial control, as well as methods of recourse associated with equipment leases and service contracts. In an EJV management control is through allocation of Board seats.[15]
During the term of the venture, the foreign participant can recover his investment, provided the contract prescribes that and all fixed assets will become the property of the Chinese participant on termination of the JV.
Foreign partners can often obtain the desired level of control by negotiating management, voting, and staffing rights into a CJV's articles; since control does not have to be allocated according to equity stakes.

Convenience and flexibility are the characteristics of this type of investment. It is therefore easier to find co-operative partners and to reach an agreement.
With changes in the law, it becomes possible to merge with a Chinese company for a quick start. A foreign investor does not need to set up a new corporation in China. Instead, the investor uses the Chinese partner's business license, under a contractual arrangement. Under the CJV, however, the land stays in the possession of the Chinese partner.
There is another advantage: the percentage of the CJV owned by each partner can change throughout the JV's life, giving the option to the foreign investor, by holding higher equity, obtains a faster rate of return with the concurrent wish of the Chinese partner of a later larger role of maintaining long-term control.
The parties in any of the ventures, EJV, CJV or WFOE prepare a feasibility study outlined above. It is a non-binding document - the parties are still free to choose not to proceed with the project. The feasibility study must cover the fundamental technical and commercial aspects of the project, before the parties can proceed to formalize the necessary legal documentation. The study should contain details referred to earlier under Feasibility Study[8] (submissions by the Chinese partner).
Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises (WFOEs)[edit]
Main article: Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise
There is basic law of the PRC concerning enterprises with sole foreign investment controls, WFOEs. China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) around 2001 has had profound effects on foreign investment. Not being a JV, they are considered here only in comparison or contrast.
To implement WTO commitments, China publishes from time to time updated versions of its "Catalogs Investments" (affecting ventures) prohibited, restricted.
The WFOE is a Chinese legal person and has to obey all Chinese laws. As such, it is allowed to enter into contracts with appropriate government authorities to acquire land use rights, rent buildings, and receive utility services. In this it is more similar to a CJV than an EJV.
WFOEs are expected by PRC to use the most modern technologies and to export at least 50% of their production, with all of the investment is to be wholly provided by the foreign investor and the enterprise is within his total control.
WFOEs are typically limited liability enterprises[16] (like with EJVs) but the liability of the Directors, Managers, Advisers, and Suppliers depends on the rules which govern the Departments or Ministries which control product liability, worker safety or environmental protection.
An advantage the WFOE enjoys over its alternates is enhanced protection of its know-how but a principal disadvantage is absence of an interested and influential Chinese party.

Foreign Investment Companies Limited By Shares (FICLBS)[edit]
These enterprises are formed under the Sino-Foreign Investment Act. The capital is composed of value of stock in exchange for the value of the property given to the enterprise. The liability of the shareholders, including debt, is equal to the amount of shares purchased by each partner.
The registered capital of the company the share of the paid-in capital. The minimum amount of the registered capital of the company should be RMB 30 million. These companies can be listed on the only two PRC Stock Exchanges – the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. Shares of two types are permitted on these Exchanges – Types "A" and Type "B" shares.
Type A are only to be used by Chinese nationals and can be traded only in RMB. Type "B" shares are denominated in Remembi but can be traded in foreign exchange and by Chinese nationals having foreign exchange. Further, State enterprises which have been approved for corporatization can trade in Hong Kong in "H" share and in NYSE exchanges.
"A" shares are issued to and traded by Chinese nationals. They are issued and traded in Renminbi. "B" shares are denominated in Renminbi but are traded in foreign currency. From March 2001, in addition to foreign investors, Chinese nationals with foreign currency can also trade "B" shares.
Investment Companies by Foreign Investors (ICFI)[edit]
Brief coverage is provided.
Investment Companies are those established in China by sole foreign-funded business or jointly with Chinese partners who engage in direct investment. It has to be incorporated as a company with limited liability.
The total amount of the investor's assets during the year preceding the application to do business in China has to be no less than US $400 million within the territory of China. The paid-in capital contribution has to exceed $10 million. Furthermore, more than 3 project proposals of the investor's intended investment projects must have been approved. The shares subscribed and held by foreign Investment Companies by Foreign Investors (ICFI) should be 25%. The investment firm can be established as an EJV
Joint ventures in India[edit]
Suresh Parteti JV companies are the preferred form of corporate investment but there are no separate laws for joint ventures. Companies which are incorporated in India are treated on par as domestic companies.

The above two parties subscribe to the shares of the JV company in agreed proportion, in cash, and start a new business.
Two parties, (individuals or companies), incorporate a company in India. Business of one party is transferred to the company and as consideration for such transfer, shares are issued by the company and subscribed by that party. The other party subscribes for the shares in cash.
Promoter shareholder of an existing Indian company and a third party, who/which may be individual/company, one of them non-resident or both residents, collaborate to jointly carry on the business of that company and its shares are taken by the said third party through payment in cash.

Private companies (only about $2500 is the lower limit of capital, no upper limit) are allowed[17] in India together with and public companies, limited or not, likewise with partnerships. sole proprietorship too are allowed. However, the latter are reserved for NRIs.
Through capital market operations foreign companies can transact on the two exchanges without prior permission of RBI but they cannot own more than 10 percent equity in paid-up capital of Indian enterprises, while aggregate foreign institutional investment (FII) in an enterprise is capped at 24 percent.
The establishment of wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS) and project offices and branch offices, incorporated in India or not. Sometimes, it is understood, that branches are started to test the market and get its flavor. Equity transfer from residents to non-residents in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is usually permitted under the automatic route. However, if the M&As are in sectors and activities requiring prior government permission (Appendix 1 of the Policy) then transfer can proceed only after permission.[18]
Joint ventures with trading companies are allowed together with imports of secondhand plants and machinery.
It is expected that in a JV, the foreign partner supplies technical collaboration and the pricing includes the foreign exchange component, while the Indian partner makes available the factory or building site and locally made machinery and product parts. Many JVs are formed as public limited companies (LLCs) because of the advantages of limited liability.[19]
Joint ventures in Ukraine[edit]
In Ukraine most of joint ventures are operated in the form of Limited liability company,[20] as there is no legal entity form as Joint venture. Protection of the rights of foreign investors is guaranteed by Law of Ukraine "On Foreign Investment". In Ukraine, JV can be established without legal entity formation and act under so called Cooperation Agreement[21] (Dogovir pro spilnu diyalnist; Ukr. Договір про спільну діяльність). Under Ukraine civil code, CA can be established by two or more parties; rights and obligations of the parties are regulated by the agreement. Cooperation agreement has been widely spread in Ukraine, mainly in the field of oil and gas production.
Dissolution[edit]
The JV is not a permanent structure. It can be dissolved when:

Aims of original venture met
Aims of original venture not met
Either or both parties develop new goals
Either or both parties no longer agree with joint venture aims
Time agreed for joint venture has expired
Legal or financial issues
Evolving market conditions mean that joint venture is no longer appropriate or relevant
One party acquires the other

		DIGEST

		Protest that agency misevaluated protester’s proposal and applied unstated evaluation criteria is denied where the record shows that the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the evaluation criteria, and where the selection decision tradeoff provided a rational explanation for the agency’s selection of the awardee’s higher-rated proposal at a higher evaluated cost/price. 


			DECISION


		ManTech TSG-1 Joint Venture (MTTJV)[1], of Fairfax, Virginia, protests the award of a contract to Jacobs Technology, Inc., of Tullahoma, Tennessee, by the Department of the Army, Army Materiel Command, under request for proposals (RFP) No. W91RUS-13-R-0008 for scientific and engineering support services for the Army’s electronic proving ground at Fort Huachuca Military Installation and elsewhere in Arizona, as well as contingent support in other locations.  The protester primarily argues that its proposal was misevaluated and that the Army made an unreasonable selection decision. 

		We deny the protest. 

		BACKGROUND

		The RFP, issued on February 6, 2014, sought proposals to provide on-site contractor support for scientific and engineering services at the United States Army Electronic Proving Ground under a hybrid cost-plus-award-fee/fixed-price contract for a 2-month phase-in, a 22-month base period, a 24-month option, and a 12‑month option.  RFP at 3-11, 272.[2]

		The statement of work (SOW) described the general types of services required, ranging from mission command and network systems testing, to cyber security testing, intelligence systems developmental test support, and to electromagnetic environmental effect testing.  RFP at 33-40.  The RFP explained that “[a] majority of the work efforts . . . under this contract will be assigned by the Government in the form of individual Work Assignment Orders (WAOs) . . . .”[3]  RFP at 165 (¶ J.4).  Accordingly, the SOW specified that

		The contractor shall provide personnel as required to meet variable workload demands, as required by work authorization orders (WAO).  Variations in the total number of active test projects and other assigned responsibilities require that the contractor make provisions for accommodating a range in work-force size without adversely affecting performance. 

		RFP at 47 (¶ C-2.14.7). 

As amended during the course of the procurement, the RFP stated that a contract would be awarded to the firm whose proposal provided the best value, considering five evaluation factors:  mission support, management, past performance, small business participation, and cost/price.  Id. at 274-75.  The management factor was slightly more important than the mission support factor.  Each was more important than the individual factors of past performance, small business participation, and cost/price, which were equally important.  Id.  The non-cost/price factors, when combined, were significantly more important than cost/price.  Id. at 274. 

		The RFP identified two equally-weighted subfactors under the mission support factor--technical approach and technical expertise--and three equally-weighted subfactors under the management factor--management structure and corporate experience, phase-in, and financial system capability.  Id.  The mission support and management factors and their subfactors were to be rated adjectivally, using the ratings of outstanding, good, acceptable, marginal, and unacceptable.  Id. at 276‑78.  None of the other factors are at issue here. 

		The Army received proposals from eight offerors, including MTTJV and Jacobs.  AR at 4.  On March 10, 2015, the Army awarded a contract to a third offeror, and four competitors filed protests (three with our Office and one with the contracting officer).  Id.  The Army took corrective action, held discussions, amended the RFP, and received and evaluated revised proposals.  Id.  On December 1, 2015, the Army awarded the contract to Jacobs, and two competitors protested.  Id.  The Army again took corrective action and requested proposal revisions.  Id. at 5.  After evaluating the revised proposals, the Army sent each offeror a summary of its evaluation and allowed them to submit final proposal revisions (FPR) by October 11, 2016.  Id.  As reflected in the contemporaneous record, the relevant results of the final evaluation were:

		AR Tab 22, Source Selection Evaluation Board Report, at 21-41. 

		A Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC) reviewed the evaluation results for each offeror and recommended Jacobs for award.  The SSAC provided a briefing to the source selection authority (SSA) that described the offerors’ strengths, weaknesses, and adjectival ratings under the non-price factors and subfactors.  Tab 61, SSAC Report Briefing Slides, at 17-75.  The SSAC then reviewed the offerors’ evaluated cost/prices from the prior award, and the amount by which each had changed.  Their analysis identified MTTJV as one of two offerors that made significant reductions to its cost/prices when compared to the first source selection decision.  In both cases the SSAC pointed to reduced staffing for the instrumentation and software development requirement.  Id. at 76-77.  The SSAC stated that MTTJV had provided an “unsatisfactory explanation of the effects” of lowering the staffing for that requirement from its earlier proposal.  Id. at 77.  In contrast, the SSAC noted that the total evaluated cost/price for Jacobs was nearly unchanged from its initial proposal.  Id. at 78. 

		After setting forth the detailed strengths and weaknesses of the offerors, the SSAC compared Jacobs to the other offerors in terms of adjectival ratings and evaluated cost/price.  Id. at 79-80.  For each offeror except Jacobs, the SSAC recommended that the offeror be eliminated from further consideration for award based on its lower ratings.[4]  Id.  The SSAC then reviewed specific evaluated strengths for Jacobs’s FPR.  Id. at 81‑82.  The SSAC concluded by noting that Jacobs’s adjectival ratings were superior to other offerors, that its cost/price had been “the most stable and consistent” throughout the procurement, and that it had remained the “[m]ost consistent proposal . . . since inception when considering Mission Support and Management factors.”  Id. at 83. 

		The SSAC’s briefing for the SSA consolidated the evaluation of each offeror’s proposal and the SSAC’s recommendation that all other offerors be eliminated from competition and award made to Jacobs.  See generally, id.  The SSA reviewed the SSAC briefing and the evaluation summary.  She prepared a source selection decision, which reiterated the evaluation summary for each offeror and discussed whether Jacobs’s FPR provided sufficient technical superiority to justify award at its higher price compared to MTTJV and the other remaining competitors.  The SSA concluded that Jacobs’s proposal was the best value, and selected it for award.  AR Tab 21, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD), at 10-11.  On November 14, the Army announced the award to Jacobs and this protest followed. 

		ANALYSIS

		MTTJV challenges the evaluation of its proposal under the mission support and management factors.  The protester argues that the Army unreasonably assigned weaknesses to its proposal based on unstated evaluation criteria, and failed to recognize as strengths several aspects of its proposal that were identified as important strengths in Jacobs’s proposal.  As a result, MTTJV argues that the Army unreasonably assigned MTTJV lower adjectival ratings, and then improperly relied on those adjectival ratings in the source selection decision as the basis to justify awarding the contract to Jacobs at its higher evaluated cost/price. 

		We note at the onset that the evaluation of proposals is largely a matter within the contracting agency’s discretion, so our Office’s role is not to reevaluate proposals but instead to examine the record to determine whether the agency’s judgment was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria and applicable procurement statutes and regulations.  Hi-Way Paving, Inc., B-410662, Jan. 21, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 50 at 3.  In making a best-value tradeoff between non‑price factors and cost/price, a source selection authority has broad discretion, which is subject only to the tests of rationality and consistency with the evaluation criteria.  The propriety of the price/technical tradeoff decision turns on whether the selection official’s judgment concerning the significance of the difference in the technical ratings was reasonable and adequately justified.  Johnson Controls World Servs., Inc., B-289942, B‑289942.2, May 24, 2002, 2002 CPD ¶ 88 at 6.  Nevertheless, systems such as point scoring or adjectival ratings are merely guides to intelligent decisionmaking, but cannot take the place of a reasoned tradeoff decision.  Science Applications Int’l Corp., B‑407105, B‑407105.2, Nov. 1, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 310 at 7; Shumaker Trucking & Excavating Contractors, Inc., B‑290732, Sept. 25, 2002, 2002 CPD ¶ 169 at 6. 

		We address a selection of MTTJV’s evaluation challenges, as examples, and we consider the arguments over the source selection rationale below.  We have also reviewed several other arguments that MTTJV raises, such as contentions that the evaluation reflected unequal treatment, but we do not address in detail here even though we have determined that they also lack merit. 

		Mission Support Factor

		Under the technical approach subfactor, MTTJV argues that the Army unreasonably assigned a weakness to its proposal based on concerns that the firm’s proposed staffing was “[DELETED],” and thus posed a risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  Protest at 16-18.  In this regard, the RFP indicated that the Army would evaluate whether the proposal showed the

		ability to demonstrate how it plans to perform multiple simultaneous technical requirements at different locations while managing personnel and responding to potential problem areas; the extent to which the offeror demonstrates a thorough understanding of the required safety measures necessary to support multiple complex and hazardous tests in remote environments and proposes an effective approach to risk identification and mitigation; the offeror’s ability to manage shifts of workload based on the proposed management structure and the offeror’s approach of managing the work authorization order (WAO) process to include the cross-utilization of personnel, optimizing core experience and expertise across the WAOs . . . . 

		AR at 6 (citing RFP at 275). 

		MTTJV’s initial proposal identified a risk in its staffing, noting that the “biggest issue is [DELETED] contractor support in many capabilities across the facilities.  Specifically, some facility SME [subject matter experts] leads have [DELETED] on station.”  AR Tab 40, MTTJV Mission Support FPR (Redlined Version), at 15 (text shown as deleted from FPR).  The Army expressed concern during discussions with the firm’s solution to [DELETED] staffing for facilities leads.  AR Tab 19, Second Evaluation Summary for MTTJV, at 3.  In response, MTTJV’s FPR added an explanation describing its plans for cross-training and cross-utilization, identifying specific personnel to serve as backups for facility leads, and noting that it had access to [DELETED] testing and evaluation professionals with a “reach-back capability [to] provide[] continuity of effort in the event ‘[DELETED]’ SMEs are not available.”  AR Tab 39, MTTJC Mission Support FPR, at 12.  MTTJV further explained that in 2013, it had “received reach-back support from [an affiliated company] to help design test cases for DCGS-A [Distributed Common Ground System-Army] tests at USAEPG.”  Id. at 45.  MTTJV also stated that it had used its reach-back resources to obtain [DELETED] full-time equivalents for 5 months, at significant cost savings, to support fleet milestones, and had brought in an SME to develop scenarios and to lead panels of senior experts and customers to facilitate a technical exchange of analysis.  Id. at 47. 

		In evaluating the FPR, the Army determined that the weakness should remain.  While the evaluators agreed that the FPR had addressed the concern over facility team lead staffing, they also concluded that MTTJV had not addressed “critical SMEs unique to each facility which may not necessarily be the facility leads . . . or if these positions are [DELETED].”  AR Tab 18, FPR Evaluation Summary for MTTJV, at 2.  MTTJV argues that the assessment of a weakness was unreasonable because it provided an adequate technique to address the potential risk, and showed successful use of that technique on the incumbent contract.  Further, MTTJV argues that the agency’s concern over the staffing of other than facility SME leads constituted the application of unstated evaluation criteria and was based on speculation.  Protest at 18-20. 

		The Army counters that the evaluators properly could not consider information outside of MTTJV’s proposal in determining whether its efforts to mitigate the risk of [DELETED] staffing had been resolved.  AR at 11.  In response to MTTJV’s argument that the evaluation of this weakness was based on unstated evaluation criteria, the Army argues that it properly found that MTTJV had only addressed part of the agency’s concern over the firm’s explanation of the risk to performance of [DELETED] staffing.  Id. at 12. 

		We see no basis to conclude that the evaluation of this weakness was unreasonable.  As explained above, MTTJV identified the risk of [DELETED] staffing “in many capabilities across the facilities” and specifically recognized the risk of a staffing approach that “some facility SME leads have [DELETED] on station.”  AR Tab 40, MTTJV Mission Support FPR (Redlined Version), at 15.  While MTTJV argues that it properly mitigated that risk--principally by identifying a specific person capable of serving as the backup for one position at each facility--that approach did not address contingency planning for other facility SME leads, which was the basis for retaining the weakness.  In our view, the Army reasonably determined that its concerns were not completely addressed in MTTJV’s FPR.  We also disagree that the Army relied on unstated evaluation criteria in assessing a weakness for MTTJV’s planning for backups for other SMEs, beyond the facility leads.  Offerors were required to address their “plans to perform multiple simultaneous technical requirements at different locations while managing personnel and responding to potential problem[s].”  See RFP at 275.  On this record, we regard the agency’s evaluation as both reasonable and consistent with the criteria in the RFP. 

MTTJV next argues that the agency improperly assigned its proposal a weakness for failing to provide an analysis or explanation of the reduction in labor hours it included in its FPR for the base period of the contract.  Protest at 14. 

The Army explains that MTTJV reduced the number of full-time equivalents from [DELETED]in its initial proposal to [DELETED]in its FPR, and that more than half of these reductions came from tasks that the agency characterized as critical.  AR Tab 18, FPR Evaluation Summary for MTTJV, at 3.  The agency found that reducing the number of skilled and experienced positions impeded MTTJV’s ability to perform the mission.  The Army also noted that the proposal’s failure to provide an analysis or explanation of how the reduction benefited the mission increased the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  Id. 

MTTJV argues that it did not provide an explanation in its FPR because its proposal indicated that it used the same process for labor-hour estimating in its FPR as it had in its initial proposal.[5]  Id. at 23.  In our view, this argument actually underscores the reason for the agency’s concern:  MTTJV used the same process to estimate its hours, but arrived at a very different result, with no explanation for the difference.  The protester further argues that over the course of the procurement, from the March 2014 initial proposals until the October 2016 final FPR submission, the firm’s work as the incumbent contractor allowed it to become more experienced and more efficient.  Id.  However, none of this explanation actually appears in the protester’s FPR.  An offeror is responsible for submitting a well-written proposal with adequately detailed information that allows for meaningful review by the procuring agency.  Abacus Tech. Corp.; SMS Data Prods. Group, Inc., B-413421 et al., Oct. 28, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 317 at 19.  As a result, we have no basis to question the reasonableness of the agency’s evaluation. 

The protester also argues that the Army’s final evaluation improperly removed a strength that had been assigned to its proposal during the initial evaluation concerning the firm’s cost reduction efforts.  Protest at 21.  MTTJV argues that the strength was based on its performance as the incumbent and that its successful efforts as the incumbent did not disappear during the corrective action period.  Id. 

The strength assigned to MTTJV’s initial proposal was based on its cost-reduction efforts from the incumbent contract, which were achieved through the use of [DELETED]personnel to supplement and bolster EPG’s core test support work force during peak labor periods.  AR Tab 20, MTTJV Initial Proposal Evaluation Summary, at 4.  The agency explains that, when MTTJV revised its cost proposal the first time, it reduced the number of labor hours for full-time personnel while increasing the proposed number of [DELETED]personnel.  The evaluators found that this change negated the initial strength and increased performance risk because, with the increased number of [DELETED]personnel, there was no longer a potential for cost reductions by using [DELETED].  AR Tab 19, Second Evaluation Summary for MTTJV, at 4; AR Tab 18, MTTJV Final Evaluation Summary, at 4.  The agency explains that the strength assigned to MTTJV’s initial proposal was based on the balance of full-time and [DELETED]personnel in meeting the requirement.  When MTTJV revised its cost proposal, the agency concluded that it had created a performance risk because of its increased reliance on [DELETED]personnel to perform critical functions.  AR at 15. 

MTTJV’s argument that its successful efforts as the incumbent did not disappear during the corrective action period fails to recognize that the strength was forward-looking.[6]  That is, the initial proposal provided a basis for the evaluators to conclude that the government would receive the same benefits in the future as in the past.  However, when MTTJV revised its proposal, the agency concluded that any benefit in cost reduction was now accompanied by a risk, and that the proposal no longer warranted the strength.  MTTJV has given us no basis to find that this conclusion was unreasonable. 

Finally, under the technical expertise subfactor, MTTJV contends that its proposal was evaluated unequally--treated unequally, from that of Jacobs.  Specifically, the protester argues that both firms proposed similar access to SMEs but only Jacobs’s proposal was evaluated as having a strength.  This argument has no merit.

Where a protester alleges that a technical evaluation is the product of unequal treatment, the protester must show that the differences in ratings were, in fact, the result of unequal treatment, rather than differences in the offerors’ proposals.  See Northrop Grumman Sys. Corp., B-406411, B-406411.2, May 25, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 164 at 8.  Here, the RFP required all offerors to propose access to SMEs.  E.g., RFP at 25 (SMEs “serve as technical consultants to project managers”), 32‑33 (SMEs provide input, coordination, and comments on test operating procedures), 46 (SMEs included in tier 3 support for complex hardware and operating system software).  The agency assigned a strength to Jacobs’s proposal not just because it proposed access to SMEs, but because it proposed access to several highly-skilled technical fellows with expertise in specified areas.  The Army concluded that this feature would be beneficial for addressing difficult technical problems.  AR Tab 22, Source Selection Evaluation Board Report, at 25. 

While MTTJV argues that it also proposed access to SMEs, it makes the argument generally, without identifying specific aspects of its proposal to show that it exceeded the RFP requirement to an extent that was equivalent to Jacobs’s FPR.  As a result we have no basis to find unequal treatment in the evaluation. 

		Management Factor

Under the management structure and corporate experience subfactor, MTTJV also argues that the agency evaluated its proposal unequally compared to the Jacobs evaluation.  MTTJV contends that the agency credited Jacobs for its internal quality assurance process for management but made no mention of MTTJV’s quality management system.  Protester’s Comments at 4-5.  As with the firm’s unequal treatment argument above, the protester’s allegation here lacks merit.

The RFP required all offers to address certain elements, as a minimum, concerning quality control.  RFP at 263-64, 277.  The agency states that MTTJV’s quality management system was deemed to have, unlike Jacobs, merely met the requirements.  Supplemental AR at 6.  MTTJV argues that its own quality control procedures were detailed and “top notch,” and disputes that Jacobs’s proposal could have been materially better.  Protester’s Comments at 5; Protester’s Supplemental Comments at 6.  The protester asserts that it used similar terminology (such as having a formalized system, supporting on-site quality control and process improvement, using metrics, and enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of services) to describe its own quality assurance approach as the evaluators used in assigning a strength to Jacobs’s approach.  Id.  We are not persuaded that these superficial similarities are sufficient to call into question the agency’s assignment of a strength for Jacobs’s quality assurance approach.  Northrop Grumman Sys. Corp., supra. 

Under the phase-in factor, MTTJV’s supplemental protest similarly argues that its proposal was evaluated unequally from the Jacobs proposal, reasoning that as the incumbent, MTTJV’s phase-in approach should have been rated at least as highly as that of Jacobs’s approach.  Protester’s Comments at 6.  In its supplemental agency report, the agency responded to the firm’s argument in detail, emphasizing the narrative explanation provided by the evaluators for rating Jacobs’s proposal highly.  Supplemental AR at 6-7.  In its comments on the supplemental report, MTTJV does not meaningfully challenge the agency’s rebuttal.  We will deny a protest where the protester fails to meet its burden of showing that an evaluation was unreasonable, and in that respect, mere disagreement with the agency, without more, does not suffice to show that an evaluation was unreasonable.  Globecomm Sys., Inc., B-405303.2; B‑405303.3, Oct. 31, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 243 at 9; see also 22nd Century Techs., Inc., B-412547 et al., Mar. 18, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 93 at 10 (issues not rebutted in comments are deemed abandoned). 

		Source Selection Decision

		MTTJV argues that the source selection decision was unreasonable because it was based on the evaluation errors discussed above.  The protester also contends that the agency evaluation was unreasonable because, in recommending Jacobs for award, the SSAC emphasized an aspect that is unrelated to the evaluation criteria in the RFP:  that Jacobs’s proposal had been the “most stable and consistent” of all the offerors throughout the procurement.  Supplemental Protest at 7-8.  The protester also argues that the SSA over-relied on SSAC views that focused on strengths of Jacobs’s FPR to recommend award to it, while disregarding advantages of MTTJV’s FPR. 

		In making a source selection decision, the SSA need not review the proposals or complete evaluation documentation, but instead can rely upon a briefing that presents the results of the evaluation.  Sabreliner Corp., B-242023, B-242023.2, Mar. 25, 1991, 91‑1 CPD ¶ 326 at 11.  Furthermore, a source selection decision need not address and discuss every evaluated strength and weakness of the competing proposals; rather, the decision must sufficiently document the rationale for business judgments and tradeoffs made by the SSA, and the benefits associated with additional costs.  E.g., TeleCommunication Sys., Inc., B‑408269.2, Dec. 13, 2013, 2013 CPD ¶ 291 at 4; see also FAR § 15.308. 

		With respect to MTTJV’s alleged evaluation errors, as discussed above, we find no flaw in the evaluation, and thus no related error in the best-value tradeoff.  With respect to the argument that the best-value tradeoff improperly considered the stability and consistency of Jacobs’s FPR, MTTJV acknowledges that the SSA did not include that consideration in explaining the source selection decision rationale, but argues that given the SSA’s reliance on the SSAC’s conclusions in other respects, the allegedly improper consideration of stability and consistency affected the SSA’s judgment. 

		We recognize that, as MTTJV argues, much of the SSA’s stated rationale repeats the SSAC’s evaluation conclusions.  Nevertheless, we cannot adopt MTTJV’s argument that the SSAC’s application of an allegedly unstated and contradictory criterion should be presumed to have affected the SSA’s judgment.  In this regard, the SSA’s source selection decision makes no reference to the issue.  To the contrary, the record here adequately documents the SSA’s independent judgment--including omission of the SSAC’s consideration of proposal stability or consistency--and properly identifies aspects of Jacobs’s proposal that the SSA considered in determining that Jacobs’s proposal offered the best value to the government despite its higher evaluated cost/price.  Accordingly we deny MTTJV’s challenge to the best-value tradeoff. 

		The protest is denied.

[1] The protester states that one of its joint venturers is the incumbent contractor.  Protest at 1. 



[2] Except where specifically indicated, citations to the RFP in this decision are to the conformed RFP provided at Tab 3 of the Agency Report (AR) exhibits.  The RFP also provided an option for up to 6 additional months of services per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.217-8.  RFP at 147. 



[3] The Army explains that WAOs are issued by Army Electronic Proving Ground (EPG) personnel to assign test services work to the contractor, and to track and bill the costs incurred.  However, WAOs are not issued by a contracting officer, and are not task orders.  Id. at 165; Email from Army Counsel to GAO, Feb. 3, 2017, at 1. 



[4] For one of these offerors, the SSAC also identified its higher price as supporting its elimination from consideration.  Id.



[5] MTTJV also argues that neither the RFP nor the agency required a certain level of effort and that the agency is improperly holding the firm to an unstated level of effort.  However, it is readily apparent from the record that the agency’s concern was, in fact, that MTTJV did not explain why its level of effort changed. 



[6] Here, and in other instances, MTTJV has argued that the contemporaneous record lacks a sufficient explanation for the Army’s evaluation judgments, and thus the agency’s offered justifications in support of the evaluation during this protest should be afforded little weight.  However, in these circumstances, our Office will consider post-protest explanations because they provide a detailed rationale for contemporaneous conclusions and simply fill in previously unrecorded details.  Global Integrated Sec.

An approximate capital investment of $60 million will be made in the new facility which will produce liquid nitrogen (LIN), liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid argon (LAR).  The new plant, featuring Air Products' latest technology, will be constructed and operated by Air Products with commercial status targeted for December 2018.   "There are several market reasons why this investment in a new and larger facility, and the formation of the JV make strategic sense for Air Products. The plant will use our latest technology and its capabilities will strengthen Air Products' presence in the Albany, New York area.  The facility will also provide a higher production capacity for all three products to be produced at the location and will put us in a position to better serve our customers and their future growth," said Marie Ffolkes, president, Industrial Gases Americas at Air Products. "This investment is one more in a series to support Linde's growth and reliability plan in North America," said Chris Ebeling, vice president, Merchant & Packaged Gases Sales & Marketing, Linde North America. "This is our second Air Separation Unit joint venture with Air Products and we are confident this will be as successful as the previous one."  The new facility will be built at the site of an existing Air Products plant already located in Glenmont, with industrial gas products to be distributed by Air Products and Linde independently to the market. The products produced will service the New York and New England regions, supplying various market segments including chemicals, food, electronics, primary materials, fabricated metals, health and medical, utilities and glass. The new plant will also significantly increase the amount of liquid argon available to Air Products."This expansion through the JV is consistent with Air Products' efforts to leverage its production capabilities in order to reliably meet the needs of our growing customer base," said John Robinson, vice president and general manager of Air Products' Industrial Gases - Americas North Region. The current Air Products plant at Glenmont was built in 1977, has over 400 tpd of liquid capacity and serves the New York and New England region.  Use of the existing Glenmont land and infrastructure will produce project savings, expedite the on-stream of the new asset, and facilitate uninterrupted supply to the customer base during the construction phase.About Air Products Air Products (NYSE: APD) is a world-leading Industrial Gases company in operation for over 75 years. The Company's core industrial gases business provides atmospheric and process gases and related equipment to manufacturing markets, including refining and petrochemical, metals, electronics, and food and beverage.

The Amazon founder’s net worth soared to $91 billion Thursday morning, but an afternoon pullback in Amazon stock meant he ended the day at $88.5 billion (and back below Bill Gates). Is it just a matter of time before he retakes the top spot? Judging by the size of the empire he’s amassed on his way to the top of the billionaires list, that could be a fair guess. Bezos’s empire encompasses not just e-commerce, but also news organizations, robotics companies and coupon sites. Oh, and ever heard of Google, Airbnb or Uber? Bezos is an investor in those companies, too. Here is a snapshot of his empire, as compiled by Visual Capitalist:LifestyleMarketWatch7 real ways for millennials to save money (not by brownbagging and skipping Starbucks)It seems young people get blamed for everything these days. Millennials have been accused of killing marriage, home ownership, chain restaurants, diamonds, department stores, face-to-face interaction and pretty much every long, boring sporting event imaginable. They’re also being accused of killing their own net worth. Here’s a recent survey from Bankrate.com: “In particular, younger millennials (ages 18 to 26) are falling victim to vices that may feel good in the moment, but are far from worth it in the long run: • 54% of people in our age group eat out at least three times per week. • 30% of millennials say we buy coffee at least three times a week. • 51% typically go to a bar at least onceBusinessBGR NewsIf Comcast buys Verizon, we should all give up and go homeAn industry analyst, Jason Bazinet from Citigroup, has penned an opinion saying that Comcast should pull a blockbuster deal and buy Verizon for around $215 billion. Comcast would finally have access to a wireless network (the nation’s biggest, for that matter!), and it could fulfill the capitalist dream of tying customers into wireless, internet, and cable services.FinanceZacksApple (AAPL) to Report Q3 Earnings: Is a Beat in Store?A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Over the past month, oil prices have rebounded thanks to robust demand, strong draws in U.S. inventories, and drops in U.S. rig counts, Goldman said.Businessbarrons.comBoeing: Capitulation Time AgainYesterday, Boeing (BA) posted its biggest gain since October 2008, pushing it to a new all-time high. Boeing's shares were upgraded by RBC, Credit Suisse, BofA Merrill Lynch, and Goldman Sachs. This was based on our analysis of Boeing historical results that showed it generates its best margins when revenue is weighted towards planes that have been in production for many years, and margins have typically come under pressure when it introduces new models, as we expected with the 737 MAX and, eventually, 777X. While nearly all of the ramp on the MAX is yet to come, Boeing’s smooth transition to the MAX so far shows that this is nothing like the prior derivative programs (737 Classic to 737NG and 747-400 to 747-8) that drove significant operating issues for Boeing in the past.BusinessThe Motley FoolTrump Torpedoes U.S. Steel Stock: What You Need to Know -- The Motley FoolEvery day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and "initiate coverage" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope... It's been a rough year for U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) stockholders. Heck, it's even been a rough week! So far this year, shares of America's eponymous steelmaker have lost 30% of their value. This downward trend almost seemed about to change when a relatively strong performance in Q2 resulted in U.S. Steel beating earnings on Tuesday -- sending the stock up 7% in response. But in the days since, U.S. Steel's stock rally short-circuited.
