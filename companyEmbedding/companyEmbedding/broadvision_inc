CLASS ACTION
COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATION  
OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES 
LAWS 
  
  
  
DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL



SUMMARY OF THE ACTION
1. This is a securities fraud class action on behalf of persons who 
purchased BroadVision, Inc. ("BroadVision" or the "Company") common stock 
between 1/26/01 and 4/2/01 (the "Class Period"), against BroadVision and 
its top officers for violations of the federal securities laws arising 
out of defendants' dissemination of false and misleading statements concerning 
the Company's 4thQ 00 financial results, the release of its new product, 
its business and its prospects for 2001 and beyond. 
2. BroadVision develops, markets and supports application software solutions 
designed for one-to-one relationship management across extended enterprises. 
These solutions are intended to enable businesses to use the Internet as 
a platform to conduct electronic commerce, provide online customer self-service, 
deliver targeted information to constituents, and provide online financial 
services. By late 2000, BroadVision's stock price had declined significantly 
due to reduced demand for its products and slowing sales. By the time BroadVision 
reported its results for the 4thQ 00 on 1/25/01, BroadVision's CEO and 
CFO were aware that the Company was suffering from a horrendous combination 
of declining demand and out of control expenses. They also knew BroadVision's 
new version of its One-to-One Enterprise product (Version 6.0), due to 
be released in the 1stQ 01, did not meet J2EE standards, which would reduce 
demand for this new product and further impact BroadVision's future results. 
Defendants knew these conditions would severely impair BroadVision's future 
revenue growth and impair their ability to make future stock sales and 
extract future bonuses which were tied to the Company's performance. Thus, 
defendants continued to make positive but false statements about BroadVision's 
business and future revenues when reporting BroadVision's 4thQ 00 results. 
As a result, BroadVision's stock traded as high as $15-3/16 during the 
Class Period. 
3. Then, on 4/2/01, after the close of market, BroadVision announced 
its preliminary 1stQ 01 results, the revision of its previously reported 
4thQ 00 results and a one-time charge in the 2ndQ 01: 
BroadVision, Inc., a leading provider of personalized e-business 
applications, today announced that, based on preliminary estimates, it 
expects revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 will be between $85 
million and $90 million, and basic pro-forma loss per share, pending review 
of non-recurring items, will be in the range of $0.14 to $0.16. The Company 
believes these results were adversely affected by uncertainties surrounding 
the current economic and IT spending environments, which caused customers 
to delay purchases of the Company's products. 
As a result of these uncertainties, the Company announced it will implement 
a number of initiatives to substantially reduce its operating expenses, 
including a corporate-wide reorganization and related workforce reduction 
of approximately 325 people, or 15% of the Company's workforce. Based on 
these actions, the Company anticipates that it will record a one-time charge 
in the second quarter. An estimate of this charge will be disclosed when 
the Company reports its first quarter earnings on April 24th, 2001. 
The Company also announced it has revised its previously released, unaudited 
financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2000 to include 
approximately $4 million of additional expenses. These additional expenses 
were identified by the Company subsequent to the press release issued on 
January 25, 2001 and were promptly brought to the attention of the Company's 
independent auditors. These expenses reduced reported fourth quarter diluted 
pro-forma earnings per share to $0.01 from $0.02 and full fiscal year 2000 
pro-forma earnings per share to $0.12 from $0.13 on a fully diluted basis. 
4. This disclosure shocked the market, causing BroadVision's stock to decline 
to $2-13/16 per share before closing at $2-31/32 on 4/3/01, inflicting 
hundreds of millions of dollars of damage on plaintiff and the Class. BroadVision's 
CFO did not fair nearly so poorly, having sold 30,000 shares of his BroadVision 
stock before the bad news was revealed. 

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
5. The claims asserted herein arise under §§10(b) and 20(a) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("1934 Act"), 15 U.S.C. §§78j(b) 
and 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5. Jurisdiction is conferred by §27 of the 
1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. §78aa. 
6. Venue is proper here pursuant to §27 of the 1934 Act. BroadVision 
is located in Redwood City, California and the acts and transactions giving 
rise to the violations of law complained of occurred here. 

THE PARTIES
7. Plaintiff Iris Hsu purchased shares of BroadVision common stock as 
detailed in the attached certification and was damaged thereby. 
8. Defendant BroadVision designs and sells software solutions to permit 
companies to use the Internet as a platform to conduct electronic commerce. 
BroadVision is headquartered in Redwood City, California. BroadVision's 
stock is traded in an efficient market on the Nasdaq National Market System. 
9. (a) Defendant Pehong Chen ("Chen") was, during the Class Period, 
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company. 
(b) Defendant Randall C. Bolten ("Bolten") was, during the Class Period, 
Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-President, Operations of the 
Company. During the Class Period Bolten sold 30,000 shares of his BroadVision 
stock for proceeds of $306,600. 
10. The parties listed in ¶9(a)-(b) are referred to as the "Individual 
Defendants." They are liable for the false statements pleaded herein at 
¶17, as those statements were each "group-published" information for 
which they were collectively responsible. The Individual Defendants, by 
reason of their stock ownership and positions with BroadVision, were controlling 
persons of BroadVision. BroadVision controlled each of the Individual Defendants. 
These controlling persons are liable under §20(a) of the 1934 Act. 

SCIENTER AND SCHEME ALLEGATIONS
11. The Individual Defendants are BroadVision's top executives. They 
ran BroadVision as "hands-on" managers, dealing with important issues facing 
BroadVision's business, i.e., its rising expenses, its new products, 
including One-to-One Enterprise Version 6.0, BroadVision's market share 
position, and its ability to report earnings in 2001 in light of the dramatic 
adverse developments which had been affecting BroadVision's business since 
late 2000. 
12. BroadVision was founded in 1993 and went public in June 1996. The 
stock did not trade above $10 per share(1) 
until late 1999 and early 2000, when the stock price increased dramatically 
to approximately $90 per share in connection with the market's appetite 
for Internet-related companies. In mid-April 2000, the NASDAQ suffered 
a significant decline and BroadVision's stock declined as well. By late 
2000, BroadVision's growth had slowed and its stock price declined even 
further. 
13. By the time BroadVision reported its results for the 4thQ 00 on 
1/25/01, BroadVision's CEO and CFO were aware that the Company was suffering 
from a horrendous combination of declining demand and out of control expenses. 
They also knew BroadVision's new version of its One-To-One Enterprise product 
(Version 6.0), due to be released in the 1stQ 01, did not meet J2EE standards, 
which would reduce demand for this new product and further impact BroadVision's 
future results. Defendants knew these conditions would severely impair 
BroadVision's future revenue growth and impair their ability to make future 
stock sales and extract future bonuses, which were tied to the Company's 
performance. 
14. BroadVision's most important new product in early 2001 was Version 
6.0, which was to be generally available in the 1stQ 01, and the Individual 
Defendants closely monitored its progress and the specifications it met. 
This new product was important to BroadVision because its competitor, Vignette, 
already had a version that was compatible with the latest version of Sun 
Microsystems' Java programming language, known as J2EE, a new language 
that was already familiar to some 2 million developers and is popular because 
it works seamlessly with other software. 
15. Also, at the time BroadVision reported its 4thQ 00 results, defendants 
were aware that expenses were much higher than the market had been led 
to expect. As a result, the Individual Defendants (particularly Bolten) 
closely scrutinized operating expenses. Nonetheless, in order to avoid 
having BroadVision's 4thQ 00 results be a complete disaster, defendants 
deliberately disregarded more than $4 million in additional expenses which 
should have been recorded in the 4thQ 00. 
16. Each of the defendants was personally familiar with BroadVision's 
1stQ 01 revenues, as they monitored BroadVision's sales, closely monitoring 
the performance of BroadVision's operations via reports from BroadVision's 
Finance and Sales Departments which were generated and provided to management 
on a weekly basis. The reports summarized orders, dollar volume and product 
type. As a result of the Individual Defendants' monitoring, each of the 
Individual Defendants was aware that BroadVision would be unable to meet 
its projected results, as its large customers were cutting back on, or 
delaying purchases. However, because the "appearance" of future earnings 
growth was so critical to defendants' plan to inflate the price of BroadVision 
shares, defendants concealed the adverse factors then affecting its business. 

FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS
DURING THE CLASS PERIOD
17. On 1/25/01, after the markets closed, BroadVision reported its 4thQ 
00 and 2000 results in a release which stated in part:

"It was a great year in terms of both revenues and non-financial 
measures. Q4 2000 was BroadVision's eleventh consecutive quarter of profitability, 
on a pro-forma basis. Our aggressive growth and enhanced presence in global 
markets did result in higher than anticipated expense levels in Q4, but 
we feel good about the market and believe that we are well positioned for 
continued success," said Dr. Pehong Chen, president and CEO, BroadVision. 

* * *
This past quarter, 14 leading firms joined BroadVision's expanding network 
of systems integration, consulting and reseller partners to expand its 
distribution channels, broaden product integration, and develop and launch 
new technology and services to further penetrate markets in leading industries 
worldwide. Highlights this quarter include: 

* * *
o A strategic alliance with BEA Systems to embed BEA WebLogic Server� 
within BroadVision One-To-One Enterprise, BroadVision's e-business application 
platform.... 
The announcement of this strategic alliance was included in BroadVision's 
introduction of the next generation of BroadVision's e-business application 
platform, BroadVision One-To-One Enterprise. The partnership with BEA Systems 
will add Java� 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE�) support to BroadVision 
One-To-One Enterprise Version 6. These new Java technology-based features 
will enhance BroadVision's already robust support for open standards including 
JavaScript� technology, C++, COM, CORBA, XML, XSL, LDAP, WML and WAP. BroadVision 
One-To-One Enterprise Version 6 will be one of the only J2EE technology-compatible 
e-business solution suites to also deliver comprehensive e-business applications, 
content management, personalization, analytics and wireless support from 
a single vendor. 
18. On 1/25/01, at 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Time), BroadVision hosted a conference 
for analysts, media representatives and large BroadVision investors in 
which Chen and Bolten made statements and answered questions. During the 
call, Chen and Bolten represented that: 
o Although BroadVision had experienced higher expenses in the 
4thQ 00, it expected expenses to remain flat in the 1stQ 01, such that 
this was not a trend. 
o The Company's management was comfortable with analysts' estimates 
for revenues of $137-$140 million in the 1stQ 01 and $600-$630 million 
in 2001. 
o The higher than expected expenses were more an operational issue and 
did not impact BroadVision's growth drivers, as demand and revenue growth 
continued to be strong. 
o Revenue in the 1stQ 01 would be fueled by the general availability 
of the BroadVision/BEA Systems J2EE-compliant One-to-One Enterprise Version 
6. 
o Management was seeing continued strong demand for BroadVision's InfoExchange 
Portal and MarketMaker products. 
o Average selling price ("ASP") of BroadVision's products continued 
to increase to $470,000 in the 4thQ 00 and was increasing in the 1stQ 01 
as well. 
o BroadVision had the strongest partner relationships in the industry 
with entrenched positions with the Big 5 channel systems integrators. 
o Some of the increase in expenses in the 4thQ 00 was research and development 
costs associated with the roll-out of Version 6.0. 
o BroadVision continued to be on track to report EPS of $0.02 and $0.15+ 
in the 1stQ 01 and 2001, respectively. 
19. Analysts repeated defendants' statements in analyst reports issued 
on 1/26/01 in which analysts recommended purchase of BroadVision stock 
based on defendants' statements and forecast the following revenue and 
EPS for BroadVision:

20. The above analyst reports also stated: 
o Wit SoundView: 
[W]e are still comfortable with BroadVision's revenue growth opportunity 
because there will be an additional 31 sales representatives with three 
to six months of experience that could, in our estimation, add another 
$15 million in license software to our current estimate of $80 million 
in 1Q01. 
o Legg Mason: 
Revenue results were healthy, with strong generation from marquee customers 
and a rejuvenated product pipeline. The product pipeline, in particular, 
appears quite healthy. The company continues to indicate that market health 
is based on large deals to Fortune 1000 customers. Systems integration 
work appears to be flowing back to the Big 5, potentially away from the 
Web integrators. We believe both of those points cater to BroadVision's 
strengths within the industry. 
o USBancorp Piper: 
We believe that customers and channel partners are asking for flexible, 
extensible, and scalable solutions based on open architectures including 
Java, and that in response, BroadVision has laid the road map for a Java 
migration. By the end of the March quarter 2001, we believe that BroadVision 
will have in general availability a Java-enabled solution. We also believe 
that by the first half of 2002, BroadVision will transition to a full Java-based 
architecture. We believe that migrating to Java will provide both a more 
flexible and extensible solution for BroadVision's customers, and increased 
channel support from systems integrators and consultants. Having stated 
the benefits of this transition, we do have an elevated awareness of the 
inherent execution risks associated with this migration. We reiterate our 
Buy rating. 
o Jefferies & Co.: 
While architecture issues may become an issue with future developments, 
BVSN's move to the J2EE standard (scheduled for release at the end of March) 
should resolve any near-term concerns about integration, particularly as 
its WebLogic-compatible version becomes available at the same time. Between 
these two developments, BVSN has effectively resolved the main criticisms 
of its core technology - that it is hard to integrate and doesn't scale 
very well - through its partnerships with BEA Systems and WebMethods. What 
has not been evident, however, is BVSN's very strong position in a space 
that is widely seen to be a critical technology to enable e-business. The 
"buy vs. build" criticism strikes us as a significant advantage as the 
market migrates toward mass adopters. 
o Moors Cabot: 
With respect to BEA Systems, the two companies still need to work out 
a royalty payment that is feasible to both parties, but we understand an 
agreement is imminent. BEA will integrate its WebLogic application server 
into BroadVision's v6.0 application platform, offering BroadVision's customers 
Java functionality and J2EE compliance. 
As for version 6.0, management assured us that the Company is on track 
to deliver the product by the end of this quarter. 
o Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: 
The most significant new product, and potentially company defining, 
will be the upcoming release of Version 6. This release will embed BEA's 
WebLogic Server and provide the Java support that BVSN has been lacking. 
The few beta customers have experienced no difficulties migrating from 
previous releases, according to management. 
o Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown: 
-- Management stood firm with its 2001 revenue guidance in spite of 
only beating 4Q guidance by a hair and slightly missing our estimate. 
o J.P. Morgan: 
Management is clearly aware of the problems, and is taking a number 
of actions to address the issues, including implementing a new global accounting 
and HR system, eliminating facility, equipment and personnel redundancies, 
trimming underperforming staff and strengthening management infrastructure. 
Q1 expenses are expected to be flat to slightly improved, with the goal 
of reaching 15% operating margins by Q4, up from 3.4% this quarter. 
21. On or about 3/8/01, analyst David Hilal of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey 
& Co. met with BroadVision management (Chen) regarding the 1stQ 01 
progress. Based on this meeting, Friedman, Billings, Ramsey issued a report 
on 3/9/01 which lowered its rating on BroadVision to accumulate, but continued 
to forecast 1stQ 01 and 2001 EPS of $0.02 and $0.16, respectively, and 
stated: 
Mid-quarter update. Yesterday, we had a mid-quarter update 
with CEO Pehong Chen. We believe the company has a strong product cycle 
for this year, but that it could be overshadowed in the near-term by a 
difficult IT spending environment. 

* * *
Version 6.0 update. Management indicated that Version 6.0 is on track 
to be GA by the end of the month. This release will embed BEA's WebLogic 
Server and provide the Java support that BVSN has been lacking. Current 
beta customers have experienced no difficulties migrating from previous 
releases, according to management. Management expects that 50% of current 
customers will migrate to the new version within the first six months, 
with the balance switching over during the following six months. 
22. On 3/8/01, analyst Tim Getz of Prudential Securities also visited with 
BroadVision management. Based on this meeting, on 3/9/01, Prudential Securities 
issued a report in BroadVision which stated: 
o We visited with management of BroadVision yesterday and left 
with the several takeaways 
1) J2EE Version 6.0 is on track for commercial release by March 31, 
2001 with a majority of the horizontal and vertical 6.0 applications shipping 
by March 31 as well. IEP product remains strong. 
2) Linearity of orders in the quarter of 2001 is at or slightly below 
historical rates, 
i.e., slightly more back-end loaded. 
3) Expense controls put into place this quarter have been effective. 
4) Given the current macro economic environment, we believe it is unlikely 
that the Company will make its guidance for this quarter in this environment. 
Our estimates for the quarter are $125.2 million in revenue and ($0.01) 
in loss per share, below the Company's guidance of $137-$140 million in 
revenue and $0.02 in EPS. 
23. In early 2000, BroadVision had hired a new external auditor, Arthur 
Andersen, LLP. Arthur Andersen signed its audit report as to BroadVision's 
financial statements for 2000 on Friday, 3/30/01. Defendants knew these 
results were worse than the Company had reported on 1/25/01 due to more 
than $4 million in additional expenses BroadVision had not reported at 
that time. The Form 10-K for 2000 was signed and dated 3/30/01. Thus, by 
3/30/01 at the latest, defendants knew the truth about BroadVision's 4thQ 
earnings would have to be revealed. Nevertheless, despite having the entire 
weekend to issue a press release announcing that its previously issued 
results for the 4thQ 00 and year ended 2000 were false, defendants waited 
until after the close of the market on Monday, 4/2/01. On 4/2/01, 5.2 million 
shares of BroadVision were traded at prices between $4.34 and $5.46. 
24. Then, on 4/2/01, after the market closed, BroadVision issued a press 
release which stated: 
BroadVision, Inc., a leading provider of personalized e-business 
applications, today announced that, based on preliminary estimates, it 
expects revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 will be between $85 
million and $90 million, and basic pro-forma loss per share, pending review 
of non-recurring items, will be in the range of $0.14 to $0.16. The Company 
believes these results were adversely affected by uncertainties surrounding 
the current economic and IT spending environments, which caused customers 
to delay purchases of the Company's products. 
As a result of these uncertainties, the Company announced it will implement 
a number of initiatives to substantially reduce its operating expenses, 
including a corporate-wide reorganization and related workforce reduction 
of approximately 325 people, or 15% of the Company's workforce. Based on 
these actions, the Company anticipates that it will record a one-time charge 
in the second quarter. An estimate of this charge will be disclosed when 
the Company reports its first quarter earnings on April 24th, 2001. 
The Company also announced it has revised its previously released, unaudited 
financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2000 to include 
approximately $4 million of additional expenses. These additional expenses 
were identified by the Company subsequent to the press release issued on 
January 25, 2001 and were promptly brought to the attention of the Company's 
independent auditors. These expenses reduced reported fourth quarter diluted 
pro-forma earnings per share to $0.01 from $0.02 and full fiscal year 2000 
pro-forma earnings per share to $0.12 from $0.13 on a fully diluted basis. 
25. This disclosure shocked the market, causing BroadVision's stock to 
decline to $2-13/16 per share before closing at $2-31/32 on 4/3/01, inflicting 
hundreds of millions of dollars of damage on plaintiff and the Class. BroadVision's 
CFO did not fair nearly so poorly, having sold 30,000 shares of his BroadVision 
stock before the bad news was revealed. 
26. Analysts were shocked by the extent to which BroadVision's actual 
results will miss the defendants' prior statements: 
o License revenues for the 1stQ 01 are roughly half what they 
had been led to believe just two months before. 
o Total revenues for the 1stQ 01 will be at least 35% lower than defendants' 
prior representations. 
o Instead of the $0.02 profit per share forecast for 1stQ 01, BroadVision 
will report a loss of $0.14-$0.16 per share. 
o Instead of the profit of $0.16-$0.19 forecast for 2001, analysts now 
expect BroadVision to report a loss of $0.35 to $0.54 per share. 
27. As to Version 6.0, USBancorp Piper wrote the following: 
BroadVision One-To-One Enterprise 6.0 Release - Recently Shipped 
The J2EE standard has 12 specifications that must be met in order to 
be fully compliant. BroadVision's product currently meets 2 of the 12 specifications 
and the other 10 requirements can only be met if its customers purchase 
the WebLogic application server from BEA. Because of the failure of the 
OEM agreement, after buying the 6.0 product, customers must separately 
purchase BEA's WebLogic server for a list price of $17,000 per CPU in order 
to have a fully J2EE compliant product. This may fall short of meeting 
some customer's expectations of a completely free upgrade to a J2EE compliant 
product. 
28. Each of the statements disseminated between 1/25/01 and 4/2/01 were 
false or misleading when issued. The true but concealed facts were: 
(a) BroadVision's 4thQ 00 earnings were overstated by $0.01 and were 
actually half of what BroadVision had reported, such that BroadVision had 
not met earnings estimates for the quarter. 
(b) BroadVision's 4thQ 00 operating expenses, though higher than market 
expectations, had actually been understated by $4 million, including a 
$3.3 million understatement of IT and marketing expenses and $750,000 of 
royalty payments. 
(c) BroadVision's Version 6.0 only met 2 of 12 specifications of the 
J2EE standards. Consequently, customers wishing to have a fully J2EE-compliant 
product were required to separately purchase a WebLogic server at a cost 
of $17,000 for each Version 6.0 purchased, making Version 6.0 not J2EE 
compliant and not likely to lead to the sales growth represented by defendants. 
(d) Demand for the Company's products was deteriorating rapidly and 
as a result, BroadVision's sales, particularly its license sales, were 
not on track to achieve 1stQ 01 revenues of $137 to $140 million. 
(e) Due to the above factors, defendants actually knew that there was 
virtually no way BroadVision would achieve the 1stQ 01 and 2001 revenues 
and earnings forecast by and for the Company. 

CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS
29. This is a class action on behalf of purchasers of BroadVision common 
stock during the Class Period, excluding defendants (the "Class"). Excluded 
from the Class are officers and directors of the Company, as well as their 
families and the families of the defendants. Class members are so numerous 
that joinder of them is impracticable. 
30. Common questions of law and fact predominate and include whether 
defendants: (i) violated the 1934 Act; (ii) omitted and/or misrepresented 
material facts; (iii) knew or recklessly disregarded that their statements 
were false; and (iv) artificially inflated BroadVision's stock price and 
the extent of and appropriate measure of damages. 
31. Plaintiff's claims are typical of those of the Class. Prosecution 
of individual actions would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications. 
Plaintiff will adequately protect the interests of the Class. A class action 
is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication 
of this controversy. 

CLAIM FOR RELIEF
32. Defendants violated §10(b) and Rule 10b-5 by: 
(a) Employing devices, schemes and artifices to defraud; 
(b) Making untrue statements of material facts and omitting to state 
material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in light 
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and 
(c) Engaging in acts, practices and a course of business that operated 
as a fraud or deceit upon the Class in connection with their purchases 
of BroadVision stock. 
33. Class members were damaged, as they paid artificially inflated prices 
for BroadVision common stock in reliance on the integrity of the market. 

PRAYER
WHEREFORE, plaintiff, on behalf of herself and the Class, prays for 
judgment as follows: 
A. Declaring this action to be a class action properly maintained pursuant 
to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; 
B. Awarding plaintiff and other members of the Class damages together 
with interest thereon; 
C. Awarding plaintiff and other members of the Class costs and expenses 
of this litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees, accountants' 
fees and experts' fees and other costs and disbursements; and 
D. Awarding plaintiff and other members of the Class such equitable/injunctive 
or other and further relief as may be just and proper under the circumstances. 

JURY DEMAND
Plaintiff demands a trial by jury.

	BroadVision Announces First Quarter 2017 Results




	REDWOOD CITY, CA — May 10,


	2017


	—


	BroadVision, Inc. (


	NASDAQ


	: BVSN),


	a leading provider of e-business and engagement management solutions


	, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 20


	17


	. Revenues for the first


	 


	quarter were $1.8 million, compared with revenues of $2.1 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 201


	6,


	and $2.0 million for the comparable quarter of 20


	16


	. 




	 




	License revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $0.9 million, compared to $1.1 million for the prior quarter and $1.0 million for the comparable quarter of 20


	16


	. The majority of the first quarter license and subscription revenue was generated from the Company's BroadVision® Business Agility Suite™, Commerce Agility Suite™, QuickSilver™, and Clearvale® solutions. Revenue during the quarter was generated from sales to both new and existing customers


	.




	﻿




	In the first quarter of 2017, BroadVision posted a net loss on a U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) basis of $2.6 million, or $0.52 per basic and diluted share, as compared with a GAAP net loss of $2.4 million, or $0.48 per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016 and a GAAP net loss of $2.1 million, or $0.42 per basic and diluted share, for the comparable quarter of 2016. 




	﻿




	As of March 31, 2017


	,


	the Company had $17.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, compared to a combined balance of $19.7 million as of December 31, 201

	“It's increasingly clear to us that companies around the world are now recognizing the importance of managing and protecting their corporate knowledge,” said Dr. Pehong Chen, President and CEO of BroadVision.
