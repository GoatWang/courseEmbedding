Description

    The combined weight of Dutch twins Liesbeth and Angelique Raeven (born 1971) equates to that of a single adult woman. Recalling the work of their mentor Orlan, the controversial duo--who operates as the single entity L.A. Raeven--protests conventional notions of the healthy body. In videos and performances, L.A. Raeven interviews specialists in the fields of eating disorders, gender studies and consumer research.
