 NetREIT




















































Finding opportunities in overlooked markets
Focus. Execution. Value.







Properties
Our goal is to acquire high-quality office buildings located in strong, stable secondary and tertiary markets throughout the West and Midwest.

WHY NETREIT



Contrarian
We pursue opportunities others may dismiss. We avoid acquiring properties in overheated demand, which often results in unrealistic pricing and performance expectations.






Experience
Management’s substantial institutional experience and knowledge enables NetREIT to add value in ways our local competitors often don’t recognize.






Vision
Businesses desire high-quality work environments, in both big cities and small towns. NetREIT brings unique business environments to underserved locales.






CASE STUDY
Dakota Center
Dakota Center is a six-story, 119,000 s.f. office building in Downtown Fargo, North Dakota.  The building is located in the heart of the Downtown area surrounded by numerous walkable amenities and restored properties.


VALUE INCREASE SINCE ACQUISITION TO 2016
