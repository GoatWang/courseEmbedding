Walgreens promotes Jan Stern Reed to general counsel 


October 15, 2014 | By Michael Johnsen 


‌​











	DEERFIELD, Ill.— Walgreens on Wednesday promoted Jan Stern Reed to general counsel for the company, effective immediately. In her new role, Reed will assume responsibility for the legal division at Walgreens. 

	 

	Reed will continue reporting to Thomas Sabatino, who assumes the role of Walgreens chief legal and administrative officer and continues his role as corporate secretary. Reed joined Walgreens in 2013 as corporate VP and deputy general counsel. Previously, she was EVP human resources, general counsel and corporate secretary for Solo Cup Company. Prior to Solo, Reed served as associate general counsel, chief governance officer and corporate secretary for Baxter International. She started her legal career at the law firm of Bell, Boyd and Lloyd in Chicago before moving to an in-house position at Waste Management. She received her J.D. from Northwestern University and her B.A. from the University of Michigan.

	 

	“As our strategic transaction with Alliance Boots moves forward and we begin to integrate our two companies, Jan will provide valuable expertise and strength of character specifically focused on Walgreens legal strategy and leading our team of attorneys,” Sabatino said. “She has worked closely with me, our business partners and our legal team on a variety of important issues with Alliance Boots, our pharmacy team, e-commerce and many others. She has proved again and again to be a sound and expert counselor, as well as a supportive legal partner.”

	 

	In August, Walgreens exercised its option to complete the second step of its strategic transaction with Alliance Boots. The transaction, subject to shareholder and various regulatory approvals, would fully combine the two companies to form the first global pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise. In addition to his current responsibilities, Sabatino will oversee Walgreens integration work with Alliance Boots.

	 

	Walgreens president and CEO Greg Wasson said, “I congratulate Jan on her new role and look forward to working closely with Tom as he helps lead the integration efforts that will establish the new Walgreens Boots Alliance.”

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Jan Stern Reed
It’s Her Dedication that Makes the Difference
 
Jan Stern Reed joined Walgreens in 2013 as deputy general counsel and was appointed general counsel in October 2014. She assumed her role as senior vice president, general counsel, and corporate secretary with Walgreens Boots Alliance, the world’s first global, pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise, in February 2015.
Before joining Walgreens, Jan served as executive vice president of human resources, general counsel, and corporate secretary at Solo Cup Company in Lake Forest, Illinois. She came to Solo from Baxter International Inc., where she was associate general counsel, chief governance officer, and corporate secretary. Jan began her legal career in the corporate group at Bell, Boyd and Lloyd in Chicago, before moving to an in-house position at Waste Management.
“They encouraged us to come to conclusions on our own ….
“If you ask me what has best served me in my career it would be my mom Dale Stern, a therapist, and my dad Bud Stern, an attorney,” said Jan. “They were balanced and sane in their approach to raising my brother and me. They encouraged us to come to conclusions on our own, always within the guardrails of ethical decision-making.“
Jan holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of Michigan and a JD from Northwestern University. She is a member of the Illinois Bar Association and serves on the boards of directors of Meals on Wheels in Chicago and Umoja Student Development Corporation.
