Investment Process
The Small Cap Growth Equity strategy is driven by a consistent process and is implemented across all portfolios. Stock ideas typically emanate from one of three sources - company interaction (e.g. meetings, conversations with management, etc.), industry contacts, and database screens. We are seeking stocks between $150 million and $3 billion in market cap at the time of purchase. Regardless of the idea sources, a series of extremely rigorous, proprietary growth and earnings revision screens are applied to narrow the investment universe from approximately 2,000 companies to a more manageable 200 investment candidate list.From this investment candidate list, bottom-up research is conducted on each stock by the investment team to determine the sustainability of the growth rate, likelihood of exceeding expectations, and market sentiment. Each of these factors is further explored by the investment team. For instance, in assessing the sustainability of the growth, traditional research is conducted on the competitive landscape, the firm’s financial ability to fund its growth, and a thorough review of its product pipeline. To determine the likelihood of exceeding expectations, we compare current fundamental trends with existing expectations and overlay management’s execution history. In addition, we seek situations where potential investments have expanding operating margins.Finding fundamentally sound companies is not enough. To improve the timeliness of the investment, it is critical that the market embraces a stock’s fundamental attributes. Thus, we analyze the market sentiment toward each stock, seeking situations where the sentiment is neutral to positive.If these strict criteria are met, the stock is a candidate for the portfolio. The investment team works cooperatively to research securities while Mr. Nelson makes the final investment decisions and constructs the model portfolio.

Investment Philosophy
At Timpani, we believe that earnings drive stock price performance. By combining fundamental research with an analysis of estimate revisions, we firmly believe we can identify and purchase underestimated growth that exists between a company's business strength and the market's expectation of that strength. We add exposure to stocks where growth is being underestimated, or where there is a positive perception gap and we reduce exposure to stocks where growth is being overestimated, or where there is a negative perception gap. This phenomenon exist because the market is slow to react to incremental, relevant changes in a company’s fundamentals.

Using growth gaps to guide our decisions causes us to minimize two behavioral mistakes of growth investing: selling winners too early, and not selling losers quickly enough.

The investment team believes that outstanding companies with superior earnings and revenue growth will outperform the market over the long term. Analysis of economic conditions and secular trends provides exploitable investment opportunities, specifically in the small capitalization sector.

The name of our firm, Timpani Capital Management, combines two passions of its co-founder, Brandon Nelson – drumming and stock-picking. Brandon started his drumming career in the 5th grade and began picking stocks only a few years later. He continued his drumming throughout high school and college, playing snare drum with the University of Wisconsin Marching Band in the early 1990s (final performance was at the 1994 Rose Bowl!!). Today, he still finds time to beat the drums after a hard day at work.
