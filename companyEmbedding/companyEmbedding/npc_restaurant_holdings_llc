	NPC International, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results









	Overland Park, Kansas, (March 20, 2017)


	 - NPC International, Inc. (the “Company” or “NPC”), today reported results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended December 27, 2016.









	FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS:


















	•






	Pizza Hut comparable store sales were -5.8% rolling over an increase of +3.2% last year.
















	•






	Wendy’s comparable store sales were +0.8% rolling over an increase of +5.8% last year.
















	•






	The Company generated net income of $4.3MM compared to $3.8MM last year.
















	*






	Adjusted EBITDA (reconciliation attached) was $35.8MM; an increase of $4.2MM or 13.3% from the prior year.
















	*






	Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 12.2% from 10.8% last year.












	FULL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS:


















	•






	Pizza Hut comparable store sales were -1.2% rolling over flat comparable store sales last year.
















	•






	Wendy’s comparable store sales were +1.1% rolling over an increase of +2.8%.
















	•






	Net income was $8.7MM, an increase of $2.0MM from last year.
















	•






	Adjusted EBITDA (reconciliation attached) was $127.6MM; an increase of $12.3MM or 10.7% from the prior year.
















	•






	Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 10.8% from 9.9% last year.
















	•






	Cash balances were $13.6MM a decrease of $19.1MM from prior fiscal year end due to acquisition activities.
















	•






	Our leverage ratio improved to 4.32X Consolidated EBITDA, net of allowable cash balances (as defined in our Credit Agreement) from 4.75X at the prior fiscal year end.

















	NPC’s President and CEO Jim Schwartz said, “Despite ongoing challenges in our Pizza Hut business, we were able to execute with financial intensity delivering an increase of almost 11% in Adjusted EBITDA for the full fiscal year. For the fourth fiscal quarter, we were quite pleased with the results of our Wendy’s business, which posted comparable store sales growth of almost 1% and grew comps 6.6% on a two-year basis. The top-line sales momentum combined with favorable commodities and solid execution from our operators resulted in significant margin improvement and profit growth. Our Pizza Hut operations generated disappointing comparable store sales with a decline of 5.8% rolling over growth of 3.2% last year driven by the successful launch of the Triple Treat Box. Despite the sales decline, lower ingredient prices and favorable insurance adjustments related to improved loss trends served to maintain restaurant margins consistent with the prior year.









	Our Pizza Hut business has continued to struggle to consistently activate the consumer and drive the top-line in an otherwise thriving category. As previously communicated, the Brand and the Franchise Association have completed independent brand related research which will significantly inform the go-forward strategy. Concurrently, Pizza Hut and its franchisees are formulating a transformational plan to deliver upon a strategy to modernize the brand and to continue on our mission to make it easier for consumers to get a better pizza.









	Our Wendy’s business leveraged innovation and core product offerings again this quarter and successfully drove profitable sales growth while rolling over the very successful launch of the 4 for $4 value bundle deal. Wendy’s continues to expand the 4 for $4 offering and the incremental variety has continued to meet the needs of the consumer while bringing new news to the category. Most recently, the Double Stack has been added to this offering providing the consumer more value and more choice when ordering the 4 for $4 deal.









	We continued to execute upon our Delco relocation efforts in our Pizza Hut business and Image Activation efforts in our Wendy’s operations this quarter and fully delivered upon our targets for fiscal 2016. As we move into 2017, we will continue with these investments as we contemporize our restaurants to better meet the needs of today’s consumer and provide a best on block image.

















	We are pleased to have deleveraged our business by almost a half of a turn of leverage during fiscal 2016 due to an increase of almost 11% in Adjusted EBITDA and the benefit of our accretive acquisition of 39 Wendy’s units in Raleigh, North Carolina in July 2016. In addition, we ended the year with ample liquidity which we will tap to fund our recently announced pending acquisition of 62 Wendy’s restaurants in Pennsylvania.









	Looking to 2017, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunity to continue to diversify our restaurant portfolio through the acquisition of additional Wendy’s restaurants and we will remain active in this pursuit as we work to increase our ownership of this great brand. We are also increasingly optimistic and enthusiastic about the future direction of Pizza Hut as we continue to work with brand leadership on future strategy and direction. We look forward to continuing to update you on the execution of key brand strategies and our performance into 2017.”









	The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NPC Restaurant Holdings, LLC ("Parent"), which has guaranteed the Company's 10.50% Senior Notes due 2020. As a result of its guaranty, Parent is required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission which include consolidated financial statements of Parent and its subsidiaries (including the Company). Parent's only material asset is all of the stock of the Company. The quarterly financial statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for Parent and the Company on a consolidated basis are set forth in Parent's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 27, 2016 which can be accessed at

	CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION:









	The Company will not be conducting an earnings call for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended December 27, 2016, because the Company will be holding lender meetings later today to discuss the proposed refinancing of the Company's funded debt. The proposed refinancing is currently expected to include refinancing of the Company's senior secured credit facilities and redemption of the Company's 10.50% Senior Notes due 2020 in accordance with the Indenture for the Senior Notes. The terms and consummation of the proposed refinancing are subject to market and other customary conditions, and there is no assurance that the proposed refinancing will be completed in whole or in part.

	Net product sales increased 0.2% as a result of growth in our Wendy’s business due to the sales contribution from acquisitions and an increase in comparable store sales of 0.8%. This increase was largely offset by a comparable store sales decline of -5.8% in our Pizza Hut operations and a decrease in Pizza Hut equivalent units.

















	(2)

	 






	Fees and other income increased 1.4% due to increased delivery fees in our Pizza Hut operations.

















	(3)

	 






	Cost of sales, as a percentage of net product sales, decreased primarily due to lower ingredient costs.

















	(4)

	 






	Direct labor, as a percentage of net product sales, increased due to sales deleveraging in our Pizza Hut operations, partially offset by productivity gains and sales leveraging in our Wendy’s operations.

















	(5)

	 






	Other restaurant operating expenses, as a percentage of net product sales, decreased primarily due to favorable insurance reserve adjustments, which were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense and sales deleveraging in our Pizza Hut operations.

















	(6)

	 






	General and administrative expenses increased due to increased field personnel and support costs, largely attributable to our Wendy’s acquisition in July 2016 and higher credit card processing fees. These increases were partially offset by the timing of prior year incentive accruals recorded in full during the fourth quarter of 2015.

















	(7)

	 






	Net facility impairment and closure costs decreased due to a reduction in impairment charges which were partially offset by increased closure charges in our Pizza Hut operations largely associated with our Delco relocation efforts.

















	(8)

	 






	Interest expense increased due to the increase in our average borrowing rate as a result of the term loan amendment in December 2015, which was partially offset by a decline in our average outstanding debt balance.

	 The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income plus interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening expenses, net facility impairment and closure costs and certain other items that are non-operational in nature. Management believes the elimination of these items, as well as certain other items of a non-operational nature, as may be noted in the table above, give investors and management useful information to compare the performance of our core operations over different periods and to compare our operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, the Company’s financial information reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, may not be similar to EBITDA measures of other companies.

	 Calculated as a percentage of net product sales.

	 The Company defines Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures. Management believes that the free cash flow measure is important to investors to provide a measure of how much cash flow is available, after current changes in working capital and acquisition of property and equipment, to be used for working capital needs or for strategic opportunities, including servicing debt, making acquisitions, and making investments in the business. It should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures.
