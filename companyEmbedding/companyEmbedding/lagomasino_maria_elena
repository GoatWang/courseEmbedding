It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View Maria Elena’s Full ProfileMaria Elena’s ActivityWhen the CEO Doesn't Live for the CustomerMaria Elena likedSummaryTwo core values were instilled in me early in life when my family left Cuba: the value of family, and the value of private capital. I witnessed first-hand how families with deep-rooted connections to their culture, principles and each other were able to thrive and succeed in the most challenging of times. I also witnessed great pain in friends and loved ones when everything they owned was taken from them.  These core values have been integral parts of each and every decision I’ve made throughout my career and personal life. In my career I have been honored to help the families I work with navigate their own challenges of life with wealth, and my life’s work has been dedicated to nurturing family dynamics and economic empowerment.Working with financially successful families for more than three decades, I know that their key concern is who to trust with their significant wealth.  I’ve learned that trust can only be established when advisors empower their clients with totally independent information and advice – not by selling them products and services for commissions and fees. As a founding partner of WE Family Offices, a completely independent global advisory firm offering family office solutions to ultra high net worth families, I am thrilled to implement the best practices that my partners and I have accumulated in our decades of experience, and to provide independent advice to families. WE Family Offices, a Florida limited liability company, helps families build their wealth enterprises. We work with their existing providers, making sure they know what they need to know. We focus on what they need – whether it’s investments, planning, reporting, financial administration, family education and governance, or tax and estate planning. We view our clients’ private capital as something to be respected, nurtured and protected, not exploited for fees and profits – and we believe it can be a force for good, whether in their own lives, or in the world at large.ExperienceCEO and Managing PartnerWE Family OfficesMarch 2013  –  Present (4 years 5 months)Managing family wealth can seem complicated and overwhelming, but we supply clients with the tools and support they need to operate their wealth as they would any business enterprise. By treating their family wealth as they would an enterprise – that is, establishing a mission statement, creating financial statements, creating a succession plan - they greatly enhance their odds of success.  WE Family Offices helps them to tap into the same talents and resources used to create the wealth in the first place.  WE supports and serves families with substantial net worth, focusing on a broad set of needs including investments, financial and wealth planning, reporting, financial administration, and family education & governance – managing these activities in the way that benefits the family the most.CEOGenSpring Family OfficesNovember 2005  –  October 2012 (7 years)In this independent advisory firm, I continued with the same family wealth ideals that have motivated me for decades, advising families on how to create a living legacy, and believing that there is no one-size-fits-all when working with the power of both human and financial capital.Chairman & CEO Private BankingJPMorgan ChaseAugust 1983  –  March 2005 (21 years 8 months)During my tenure at The JPMorgan Private Bank, I worked with UHNW global clients and held roles of ever-increasing responsibility, eventually rising to chairman and CEO.  At that time, the private bank managed a total of $300 billion in assets.  At least a third of my time was spent meeting with the client families I served.Vice President, South American Private BankingCitiJanuary 1977  –  January 1983 (6 years 1 month)As a relationship manager working with Chilean and Peruvian clients, I found what was to be my calling: preserving and protecting family assets.

Financial services executive Maria Elena Lagomasino has been appointed to the board of the Walt Disney Company as an independent director, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced Tuesday.
Lagomasino will join the board of the world’s dominant entertainment conglomerate on Dec. 1 and will then stand for election, with other directors, at the company’s next annual meeting.
Lagomasino is the CEO and managing partner of the financial advisory firm she founded, WE Family Offices. Before creating the wealth management concern, she served as chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Private Bank. She started at Citibank in 1977, moved to Chase Manhattan in 1983 and was named  head of Chase’s worldwide private banking business in 1997. She took the CEO post at JP Morgan when the investment bank merged with Chase.







In announcing the appointment, Iger called Lagomasino “a respected leader in the finance and investment field,” while also citing her “keen understanding of global consumer brands.”
“Disney is a brand that embodies the values I believe in, with its unwavering commitment to creating high-quality entertainment, exceeding consumer expectations and delivering outstanding financial performance for its shareholders,” Lagomasino said.
Lagomasino also sits on the boards of the Coca-Cola Company, Avon Products, Inc., and the Americas Society. She is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Private Asset Management named Lagomasino in August one of the 50 most influential women in wealth management.
She earned her B.A. at Manhattanville College, an M.S. at Columbia University and an M.B.A. at Fordham University.

An individual who sits on that many boards can not do a respectable job to any of them. This is either just a symbolic position, or any one person who sits on a board of a major corporation or corporations are full of hot air.

It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View Maria Elena’s Full ProfileMaria Elena’s ActivityWhen the CEO Doesn't Live for the CustomerMaria Elena likedSummaryTwo core values were instilled in me early in life when my family left Cuba: the value of family, and the value of private capital. I witnessed first-hand how families with deep-rooted connections to their culture, principles and each other were able to thrive and succeed in the most challenging of times. I also witnessed great pain in friends and loved ones when everything they owned was taken from them.  These core values have been integral parts of each and every decision I’ve made throughout my career and personal life. In my career I have been honored to help the families I work with navigate their own challenges of life with wealth, and my life’s work has been dedicated to nurturing family dynamics and economic empowerment.Working with financially successful families for more than three decades, I know that their key concern is who to trust with their significant wealth.  I’ve learned that trust can only be established when advisors empower their clients with totally independent information and advice – not by selling them products and services for commissions and fees. As a founding partner of WE Family Offices, a completely independent global advisory firm offering family office solutions to ultra high net worth families, I am thrilled to implement the best practices that my partners and I have accumulated in our decades of experience, and to provide independent advice to families. WE Family Offices, a Florida limited liability company, helps families build their wealth enterprises. We work with their existing providers, making sure they know what they need to know. We focus on what they need – whether it’s investments, planning, reporting, financial administration, family education and governance, or tax and estate planning. We view our clients’ private capital as something to be respected, nurtured and protected, not exploited for fees and profits – and we believe it can be a force for good, whether in their own lives, or in the world at large.ExperienceCEO and Managing PartnerWE Family OfficesMarch 2013  –  Present (4 years 5 months)Managing family wealth can seem complicated and overwhelming, but we supply clients with the tools and support they need to operate their wealth as they would any business enterprise. By treating their family wealth as they would an enterprise – that is, establishing a mission statement, creating financial statements, creating a succession plan - they greatly enhance their odds of success.  WE Family Offices helps them to tap into the same talents and resources used to create the wealth in the first place.  WE supports and serves families with substantial net worth, focusing on a broad set of needs including investments, financial and wealth planning, reporting, financial administration, and family education & governance – managing these activities in the way that benefits the family the most.CEOGenSpring Family OfficesNovember 2005  –  October 2012 (7 years)In this independent advisory firm, I continued with the same family wealth ideals that have motivated me for decades, advising families on how to create a living legacy, and believing that there is no one-size-fits-all when working with the power of both human and financial capital.Chairman & CEO Private BankingJPMorgan ChaseAugust 1983  –  March 2005 (21 years 8 months)During my tenure at The JPMorgan Private Bank, I worked with UHNW global clients and held roles of ever-increasing responsibility, eventually rising to chairman and CEO.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
