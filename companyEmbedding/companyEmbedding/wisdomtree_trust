	WisdomTree launched its first Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in June of 2006, and is currently the tenth largest Exchange Traded Product (ETP) sponsor globally. WisdomTree offers ETPs covering domestic, international and global equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities and alternative strategies. WisdomTree pioneered the concept of fundamentally weighted ETFs and active ETFs and is currently an industry leader in both categories (as measured by assets under management). WisdomTree is the only publicly traded asset manager exclusively focused on the ETP industry.

	WisdomTree is headquartered in New York and its common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (symbol: WETF).

About WisdomTree

 
ABOUT WisdomTree
 
WisdomTree launched its first ETFs in June of 2006, and is currently the industry's seventh largest (by AUM) ETF provider. WisdomTree sponsors distinct ETFs that span asset classes and countries around the world. Categories include: U.S. and International Equity, Currency, Fixed Income and Alternatives. WisdomTree pioneered the concept of fundamentally weighted ETFs and active ETFs and is currently an industry leader in both categories. WisdomTree is the only publicly traded asset manager exclusively focused on the ETF industry.

WisdomTree is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the ticker: WETF.

                                    OUR APPROACH
                                








At WisdomTree we do things differently. Our ETFs are built with proprietary methodologies, smart structures or uncommon access to provide investors with the potential for income, performance, diversification and more. 



 





THOUGHTFUL INNOVATION




Each of our ETFs is exclusive to WisdomTree and each is designed to redefine how an investment is built or how a country or asset class is accessed.


 





SMART ENGINEERING





Each ETF is uniquely structured to offer the potential for performance, risk management— or both.



 





REDEFINED INVESTING





We combine what we believe are the best elements of active and passive investing to provide low-cost1, risk-managed investments.

EQUITIES


 
Stock prices can—and do—deviate from their underlying value for many reasons. WisdomTree believes fundamentals such as dividends or earnings offer more objective measures of a company’s health, value and profitability than stock price alone. The majority of ETFs are market cap weighted—meaning they give more weight to companies selling at higher prices than those offering stronger fundamentals. WisdomTree uses proprietary weighting methodologies designed to help magnify the effect fundamentals—such as dividends or earnings—have on risk and return characteristics.

CURRENCY HEDGED EQUITY


 
International investing provides many exciting opportunities to investors. But these opportunities can come with additional risks—one of which is currency fluctuations. WisdomTree's Hedged Equity family of Funds enables investors to access the growth potential of numerous markets around the world while mitigating the risks of currency exposure.

DOLLAR SENSITIVE EQUITY


Given today's increased focus on the global economy, investors are likely aware of how foreign currency movements can impact their international investments. But changes in the U.S. dollar can impact domestic investments as well.  Consider that many U.S. companies generate a large portion of their revenue outside the United States. For these companies, a strong dollar can hurt their competitiveness as their goods and services become more expensive to their international clients. By the same token, there are domestically oriented companies that may perform better when the dollar is strong.

CURRENCY


WisdomTree believes that investors should consider the benefits of diversifying their cash holdings on a global basis. Diversifying currency holdings offers investors the potential to earn higher yields while lowering the risk inherent to holding assets in only one currency.

FIXED INCOME


How diversified are your fixed income holdings? If you're only holding U.S. fixed income instruments, such as bonds, the answer may be, not enough. Through the dynamic combination of foreign interest rates and local currencies, WisdomTree's international fixed income ETFs offer investors income potential, diversification potential—and much more. In fact, they may enable you to obtain more complete asset allocation.

ALTERNATIVE


WisdomTree believes alternative investments provide a smart way to achieve diversification and performance potential in almost any market. However, these types of strategies have traditionally only been available to institutional investors. Through WisdomTree, these sophisticated strategies are available to all investors—in the desirable ETF structure.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

WisdomTree Investments, Inc. (NASDAQ: WETF) is a New York-based exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) and exchange-traded product ("ETP") sponsor and asset manager. WisdomTree launched its first ETFs in June 2006, and is currently the industry’s fifth largest ETF provider in the United States.[4][5] WisdomTree sponsors 92 distinct ETFs that span asset classes and countries around the world. Categories include: U.S. and International Equity, Currency, Fixed Income and Alternatives. WisdomTree's largest ETF in terms of AUM is the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund NYSE: HEDJ, which had over $20.39 billion on December 28, 2015. The ETFs invests in European equities but hedges out currency risks due to the changing exchange rates between the US Dollar and the euro.[6][7] WisdomTree was one of the pioneers for the concept of fundamentally weighted ETFs and active ETFs and is currently an industry leader in both categories.[4][8] WisdomTree is the only publicly traded asset manager exclusively focused on the ETP industry. WisdomTree manages approximately $44.5 billion in ETF assets under management, as of February 23, 2016.[2]
The WisdomTree common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker: NASDAQ: WETF.[4][9] In 2014, WisdomTree acquired a majority stake (75%) in London-based Boost ETP. WisdomTree will invest $20 million in Boost to give it working capital to build out its European business.[10]

Company information[edit]
WisdomTree believes that its differentiated approach, employing a distinctive index-based methodology, delivers better risk adjusted returns over the long term.[11] The company’s index-based funds employ a fundamental weighted investment methodology, which weights securities on the basis of factors such as dividends or earnings, whereas most other ETF indexes use a capitalization weighted methodology.[12]
WisdomTree offers 14 different actively managed ETFs, which are ETFs that are not based on a particular index but rather are actively managed with complete transparency into the ETF’s portfolio on a daily basis.[13] WisdomTree's exemptive relief enables the company to use its own indexes for certain ETFs, actively manage other ETFs and incorporate the use of derivatives in certain products, thereby allowing the company to develop certain ETFs not yet offered by other sponsors.[12]
History[edit]
WisdomTree Investments, Inc. was incorporated by its Chief Executive Officer and founder, Jonathan Steinberg, in Delaware as Financial Data Systems, Inc., on September 19, 1985, but was inactive until October 1988 when it acquired the assets relating to what would become Individual Investor magazine, a monthly personal finance magazine.[1]
In December 1991, it completed an initial public offering and commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In 1993, the company’s name was changed to Individual Investor Group, Inc. and throughout the 1990s it was a financial media company that published several magazines, including Individual Investor and Ticker, newsletters, as well as maintained several online financial related websites. In addition, the company also began developing stock indexes.[1]
Due to the economic downturn in the financial media industry in 2000 and 2001, the company sold its media properties in order to preserve its capital while it pursued a new business plan focusing on developing and licensing its stock indexes. The company’s common stock was de-listed from Nasdaq and began quotation on the over-the-counter market.[1]
In 2002, the company’s name was changed to Index Development Partners, Inc., and Jonathan Steinberg, along with Luciano Siracusano, currently Executive Vice President – Head of Sales & Chief Investment Strategist, continued development of the concepts for the company’s fundamentally weighted index methodology. While this concept was being developed, the company sought to obtain financing to recapitalize and become an ETF sponsor.[1][4]
Between 2004 and 2005, the company obtained financing from a core group of investors including former hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, Professor Jeremy Siegel of The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and James D Robinson IV with venture capital firm of RRE Ventures. Michael Steinhardt became Chairman and Professor Jeremy Siegel became the senior investment strategy advisor for the company.[1]
On September 21, 2005, the company’s name was changed to WisdomTree Investments, Inc.[14] WisdomTree Investments, Inc. launched its first 20 ETFs in June 2006.[5] On July 26, 2011, WisdomTree listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker: WETF.[4][9]

WisdomTree's largest ETF in terms of AUM is the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund NYSE: HEDJ, which had over $20.39 billion on December 28, 2015. The ETFs invests in European equities but hedges out currency risks due to the changing exchange rates between the US Dollar and the euro.[6][7] WisdomTree was one of the pioneers for the concept of fundamentally weighted ETFs and active ETFs and is currently an industry leader in both categories.[4][8] WisdomTree is the only publicly traded asset manager exclusively focused on the ETP industry. WisdomTree manages approximately $44.5 billion in ETF assets under management, as of February 23, 2016.[2]

Company information[edit]
WisdomTree believes that its differentiated approach, employing a distinctive index-based methodology, delivers better risk adjusted returns over the long term.[11] The company’s index-based funds employ a fundamental weighted investment methodology, which weights securities on the basis of factors such as dividends or earnings, whereas most other ETF indexes use a capitalization weighted methodology.[12]
WisdomTree offers 14 different actively managed ETFs, which are ETFs that are not based on a particular index but rather are actively managed with complete transparency into the ETF’s portfolio on a daily basis.[13] WisdomTree's exemptive relief enables the company to use its own indexes for certain ETFs, actively manage other ETFs and incorporate the use of derivatives in certain products, thereby allowing the company to develop certain ETFs not yet offered by other sponsors.[12]
History[edit]
WisdomTree Investments, Inc. was incorporated by its Chief Executive Officer and founder, Jonathan Steinberg, in Delaware as Financial Data Systems, Inc., on September 19, 1985, but was inactive until October 1988 when it acquired the assets relating to what would become Individual Investor magazine, a monthly personal finance magazine.[1]
In December 1991, it completed an initial public offering and commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In 1993, the company’s name was changed to Individual Investor Group, Inc. and throughout the 1990s it was a financial media company that published several magazines, including Individual Investor and Ticker, newsletters, as well as maintained several online financial related websites. In addition, the company also began developing stock indexes.[1]
Due to the economic downturn in the financial media industry in 2000 and 2001, the company sold its media properties in order to preserve its capital while it pursued a new business plan focusing on developing and licensing its stock indexes. The company’s common stock was de-listed from Nasdaq and began quotation on the over-the-counter market.[1]
In 2002, the company’s name was changed to Index Development Partners, Inc., and Jonathan Steinberg, along with Luciano Siracusano, currently Executive Vice President – Head of Sales & Chief Investment Strategist, continued development of the concepts for the company’s fundamentally weighted index methodology. While this concept was being developed, the company sought to obtain financing to recapitalize and become an ETF sponsor.[1][4]
Between 2004 and 2005, the company obtained financing from a core group of investors including former hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt, Professor Jeremy Siegel of The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and James D Robinson IV with venture capital firm of RRE Ventures. Michael Steinhardt became Chairman and Professor Jeremy Siegel became the senior investment strategy advisor for the company.[1]
On September 21, 2005, the company’s name was changed to WisdomTree Investments, Inc.[14] WisdomTree Investments, Inc. launched its first 20 ETFs in June 2006.[5] On July 26, 2011, WisdomTree listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker: WETF.[4][9]

The WisdomTree CBOE S&P 500 PutWrite Strategy Fund seeks to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the CBOE S&P 500 PutWrite Index (PUT), a collateralized put write strategy on the S&P 500 Index. The strategy is designed to receive a premium from the option buyer by selling a sequence of one-month, at-the-money, S&P 500 Index puts (SPX puts). If, however, the value of the S&P 500 Index falls below the SPX Put’s strike price, the option finishes in-the-money and the Fund pays the buyer the difference between the strike price and the value of the S&P 500 Index. The Fund’s strategy of selling cash-secured SPX Puts serves to partially offset a decline in the value of the S&P 500 Index to the extent of the premiums received.
Why PUTW?

Gain access to an institutional option overlay strategy in a low cost* 40 Act vehicle.
Use to complement exposure to S&P 500 Index with potential for higher risk-adjusted returns.
Use to help lower portfolio beta and reduce downside risk.

Performance is historical and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance data for the most recent month-end is available above.
 
WisdomTree shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Total Returns are calculated using the daily 4:00pm net asset value (NAV). Market price returns reflect the midpoint of the bid/ask spread as of the close of trading on the exchange where Fund shares are listed. Market price returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

WisdomTree shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Total Returns are calculated using the daily 4:00pm net asset value (NAV). Market price returns reflect the midpoint of the bid/ask spread as of the close of trading on the exchange where Fund shares are listed. Market price returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.
 
After-Tax Held Returns represent return on Fund shares after taxes on distributions and assumes Fund shares have not been sold. After-Tax Sold Returns represent returns on Fund shares after taxes on distributions and the sale of the Fund shares.
 
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's individual tax rates and may differ from those shown.
 
In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of fund shares at the end of the measurement period.

This information must be preceded or accompanied by a prospectus, click here to view or download prospectus. We advise you to consider the fund's objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the fund. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.
There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. The Fund will invest in derivatives, including S&P 500 Index put options (“SPX Puts”). Investments in derivative investments can be volatile, may be less liquid than securities and may be more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. The value of the SPX Puts in which the Fund invests is partly based on the volatility used by market participants to price such options (i.e., implied volatility). The options values are partly based on the volatility used by dealers to price such options, so increases in the implied volatility of such options will cause the value of such options to increase, which will result in a corresponding increase in the liabilities of the Fund and a decrease the Fund’s NAV. Options may be subject to volatile swings in price influenced by changes in the value of the underlying instrument. The potential return to the Fund is limited to the amount of option premiums it receives; however, the Fund can potentially lose up to the entire strike price of each option it sells. Due to the investment strategy of the Fund, it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs. Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

Weighted Average Coupon - The mean of the coupon rate of the underlying bonds in a portfolio.
Fund Distribution Yield - Fund Distribution Yield is calculated by annualizing the most recent Fund distribution and dividing by the current Fund NAV. The yield represents a single distribution from the Fund and does not represent the total returns of the Fund.
SEC 30–day Yield - The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. This is also referred to as the "standardized yield."
IOPV – IOPV, or Indicative Optimized Portfolio Value, is a calculation disseminated by the stock exchange that approximates the Fund's NAV every fifteen seconds throughout the trading day.

* Fund Inception Date 06/16/2006






Performance is historical and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance data for the most recent month-end is available above.
 
WisdomTree shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Total Returns are calculated using the daily 4:00pm net asset value (NAV). Market price returns reflect the midpoint of the bid/ask spread as of the close of trading on the exchange where Fund shares are listed. Market price returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

WisdomTree shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Total Returns are calculated using the daily 4:00pm net asset value (NAV). Market price returns reflect the midpoint of the bid/ask spread as of the close of trading on the exchange where Fund shares are listed. Market price returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.
 
After-Tax Held Returns represent return on Fund shares after taxes on distributions and assumes Fund shares have not been sold. After-Tax Sold Returns represent returns on Fund shares after taxes on distributions and the sale of the Fund shares.
 
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's individual tax rates and may differ from those shown.
 
In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of fund shares at the end of the measurement period.
