Manufacture With Confidence.







Empower your shop floor to make smarter decisions




































Machine Monitoring Software for Lean Manufacturing & OEE
MachineMetrics has simplified Industrial IoT for the factory floor - the new standard in machine monitoring. We help manufacturers make faster, more informed decisions from real-time machine data made intelligent with context from operators. Instant notifications, real-time dashboards and detailed analytics drive manufacturing efficiency by more than 20%.



























“There was VSS pre-MachineMetrics and VSS post-MachineMetrics. We can’t imagine what life would be like if you took it away - it’s that ingrained in our day to day operations.”







- Steve Capshaw, President, VSS CNC, INC.















HOW OUR MACHINE MONITORING WORKS


EasyIntegration
It all starts with a network connection
to your machines - either via ethernet
or through hardware kits that can be
shipped to you. You choose to
self-integrate, or have MachineMetrics
come on-site.


SecureData Transfer
Data flows from
each machine to an onsite IoT Gateway
that isolates the machine network
from the public internet. Machine
data is encrypted before being securely
relayed to the MachineMetrics cloud.


Big DataAnalytics
Machine and Operator data is stored,
aggregated, and analyzed in the cloud,
giving factory workers actionable 
insights with real-time dashboards,
reports, and notifications.


Adds HumanContext toMachine Data
Tablets mounted to individual
machines display job performance and
provide operators a simple interface
to make the machine data smarter:
Categorize downtime, track setup,
reject parts, and indicate tool changes.


Real-TimeDashboards
TV Monitors on the shop floor display
the performance of jobs against their
goals. Each tile represents one machine
and are color-coded so staff can
identify machines that are
underperforming and quickly correct
any problems.


HistoricalReporting
Plant managers can use
MachineMetrics
robust OEE reporting and analytics
capabilities to measure and improve
machine utilization and productivity. 
View factory data
on the go with mobile views for all
reports and dashboards.


IncreaseProductionBy at Least 10%
With new data transparency you can
improve quoting by knowing actual
cycle times and increase machine capacity
by better understanding downtime
due to inspection, maintenance, and
setup. Ensure on-time delivery by
knowing when a work order is likely to
be completed.


















"MachineMetrics enabled CPM to increase capacity by $1.5 million in 2016 with no additional machines!"







-Gary Bruner, President of Carolina Precision Manufacturing






























Simple Machine Monitoring Software
MachineMetrics is a real-time manufacturing analytic platform that makes monitoring your CNC machines simple. Our machine monitoring software system helps manufacturers make faster, more informed decisions based on real-time data.

MachineMetrics, Inc. closes investment round to accelerate growth



Share Article


















Long River Ventures leads the round








We’re excited to participate in a software company addressing the world’s largest installed base of connected devices—manufacturing. -Tripp Peake, General Partner, Long River Ventures


Northampton, Massachusetts (PRWEB)
June 29, 2015
 MachineMetrics, Inc. announced today it has secured capital in an early investment round. This initial round was led by Long River Ventures, a Massachusetts early stage venture capital fund, and includes additional funding from local, private investors.
The company, led by successful software entrepreneur William Bither, develops production monitoring software for the manufacturing industry. MachineMetrics sought funding after their first year of operation, fueled by participation in the Valley Venture Mentors Accelerator program. 
MachineMetrics was developed to address the need for manufacturing companies to improve on-time delivery and gain greater visibility into their production processes. The funding will help MachineMetrics further accelerate its rapid development and growth trajectory. Manufacturing customers are facing increasing pressure to be more productive. Until MachineMetrics, there has not been an effective and easy to use system to make sense of the data available from many modern machine tools and manufacturing systems. MachineMetrics expects to deliver tremendous value not only to manufacturers in Massachusetts and across the United States, but globally.
Initial customers include VSS, Inc. in Greenfield, Massachusetts, a precision machine shop with over 40 years in business. VSS owner Steve Capshaw says that utilizing MachineMetrics will save his company over $1 million in capital expenditures during the next 3 years and allow a production increase of 20% based on increased efficiency.
MachineMetrics CEO Bill Bither said, “This funding will accelerate our momentum and help us support our growing customer base of small to mid-sized manufacturers, helping them deliver on-time products with better efficiency.” 
The team has doubled in size since the funding and plans to remain in Northampton, Massachusetts. Terms of the investment have not been disclosed. 
Tripp Peake, General Partner of Long River Ventures, said, “As a firm we are particularly focused on enterprise software. We have admired the MachineMetrics team for a while and have been impressed with the urgency of the problem they’re solving. We’re excited to participate in a software company addressing the world’s largest installed base of connected devices—manufacturing equipment.”
About MachineMetrics, Inc.
MachineMetrics, Inc. develops real-time production monitoring software for manufacturing companies. Headquartered in Northampton, Massachusetts, the company was founded by William Bither, Eric Fogg, and Jacob Lauzier in 2014. More information can be found on the company’s website, http://www.machinemetrics.com. 
About Long River Ventures
Long River Ventures invests in early growth stage IT and healthcare companies throughout the northeast United States. Formed by a group of experienced entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, Long River is designed and structured to invest smaller amounts of capital with typical initial investments of $500,000 to $1 million. Long River Ventures has offices in Boston and Amherst, Massachusetts and is currently investing from its third fund.
