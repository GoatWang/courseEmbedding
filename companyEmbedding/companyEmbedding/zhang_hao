                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type
                            

                                Individual
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name.

Bio

            I am currently a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. My advisor is Prof. Eric Xing.
            I received the M.S. degree from Computer Science and Engineer Department in Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2014, under the supervision of Prof. Liqing Zhang.
            Before that, I completed my Bachelor's degree from 2008 to 2011 at South China University of Technology, majoring in Computer Science.
My research interest is in scalable and structured machine learning, deep learning, and their applications in computer vision and natural lauguage processing. 
            I (co-)design models, algorithms and systems to enable machine learning to be applied/delopyed on larger-scale problems and applications. I also briefly worked on machine learning for medical brain computer interface.

Entrepreneurship: I am one of the core members of Petuum Inc., a startup that's building an enterprise software development platform to serve the full spectrum of artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. I currently lead the Poseidon team, where we build scalable and robust deep learning solutions. 
              We are hiring! Drop me an email if you are intereted in joining us.

Software
        I build or contribute to many projects for large-scale machine learning, some of them are open sourced.
          

Poseidon v2.0: An Efficient Communication Architecture for Distributed Deep Learning on GPU Clusters (code comming soon)
We have significatnly improved Poseidon to v2.0, a general-purpose communication architecture for distributed deep learning. Poseidon v2.0 supports both TensorFlow and Caffe programs. It delivers linear scalability with addtional GPU nodes on up to 32 nodes, even under limited Ethernet bandwidth.


DyNet: The Dynamic Neural Network Toolkit
DyNet is a neural network library developed by Carnegie Mellon University and many others. It is written in C++ (with bindings in Python) and is designed to be efficient when run on either CPU or GPU, and to work well with networks that have dynamic structures that change for every training instance.


GeePS: a GPU-specialized Parameter Server
GeePS is a new parameter server for data-parallel deep learning on GPUs. GeePS addresses the problem of limited GPU memory: GeePS's explicit GPU memory management support enables
                GPU-based training of neural networks that are much larger than the GPU memory.


Poseidon v1.0: Distributed Deep Learning on CPU/GPU Clusters
Poseidon is a system architecture for distributed deep learning on GPU clusters. Poseidon v1.0 includes a Bosen-based implementation to provide distributed acceleartion for Caffe.
