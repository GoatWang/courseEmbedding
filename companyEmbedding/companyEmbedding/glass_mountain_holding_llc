SERVICES
OVERVIEW

  We offer creditors the opportunity to partner with an agency that has extensive expertise  managing  accounts receivables. We are able to accept performing accounts for monitoring, early stage delinquencies, regular contingency collection accounts and accounts requiring litigation.  
Account Management:

  Our dedicated collector groups can represent you on a first party basis. We can communicate with your customers without them ever knowing that we are outside the walls of your facility. Friendly reminders that accounts are about to become past due, customer appreciation calls, and sales promotions are just a few of the programs that we can tailor to suit your needs.
  
Pre-Collect/Early Out:

  Operating on a first or third party basis, we can telephone or correspond via mail with your customers on your behalf. GMC pre-collection representatives are trained to employ the most successful "soft sell" techniques to motivate your customers to bring their accounts current, without jeopardizing the goodwill you share.  
Contingency Collections:

  We may accept primary, secondary or tertiary accounts for collection on a contingency fee basis. Like our pre-collection account representatives, our dedicated collector groups conduct themselves in a manner to reflect that your reputation is more important than collecting any one account, although our approach on these types of accounts is firmer. We seek to secure balance in full payments or at a minimum arrange suitable payment agreements. We will tailor a program specific to your company.
  
Skip Tracing:

  We realize that people's life situations change quickly today, and as such we have available to our collection representatives the most powerful skip tracing tools. We attempt to locate persons and property using the credit bureaus, electronic directories, on-line search resources, public records and nearby searches. Our expertise in skip-tracing people and assets contributes to our recovery success.
  
Litigation:

  Customers are more sophisticated today than ever. In spite of credit policies that are set to reduce fraud and delinquency, there are those unworthy customers to whom you have granted credit who will not pay willingly. Our staff is prepared to manage your portfolio of accounts that require litigation on a nationwide basis.

Insulated Glass Units Argon Gas Filled IG Units Types Of Glass Custom Laminating Glazing Services

Insulated Glass Units
There are two basic types of insulated glass units which are fabricated at Green Mountain Glass, LLC.  The first is the dual seal-silicone/PIB unit which has a much greater longevity than IG units fabricated with other types of sealants used with metal spacers.  GMG routinely stocks many choices in clear and colored anodized spacers as well as mill finish and white painted spacers.  Different color spacers are sometimes not available in all sizes, but GMG will consider stocking any size for substantial orders. 
The second type is a reverse dual seal IG unit made with warm edge Superspacer.  This spacer product is made of a type of foam and promotes less conductivity of cold through the spacer.  GMG routinely stocks gray, white and black in several different sizes of each.  
Green Mountain Glass exceeds common practices and quality in the careful construction of our IG units.  GMG uses high strength butyl (which outlasts other more commonly used PIB and hot melts), the highest quality silicone secondary seal, the highest quality of tempered glass, and washes both surfaces of the glass in the unit before assembly.  Our glass is always cut precisely to size and correctly aligned for a proper fit into the glazing cavity.  GMG sightlines are always straight and true.  Careful application of PIB onto metal spacers maintains tight sightlines for quality work.
