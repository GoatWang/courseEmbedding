1 The net asset value per share is shown as of the close of business on the date specified. The purchase and redemption prices for our shares will be determined at the end of each business day based upon the NAV for such class and will not be based on any established trading price. Each accepted purchase order and redemption request will be executed at a price equal to our NAV per share for the class of shares being purchased or redeemed, next determined after the purchase order or redemption request is received in good order and processed (subject to commissions for the purchase of Class A shares and, subject to limited exceptions, a 2% discount for the redemption of shares held less than 365 days). As a result, you will not know the purchase or redemption price at the time you submit your purchase order or redemption request. The price at which your purchase is executed could be higher than our NAV per share at the time you submit your purchase order, and the price at which your redemption is executed could be lower than our NAV per share at the time you submit your redemption request. See the prospectus for additional information.

Dividend Capital Diversified Property Fund (ZDPFEX)
Risk Factors

To Continue — 
Below are important risk factors regarding Dividend Capital Diversified Property Fund (DPF). Use the button to continue on to the website.













Continue to the Dividend Capital Diversified Property Fund Website



An investment in DPF is subject to significant risks. Some of the more important risks are summarized below. A more detailed description of the risks associated with this offering is found in the section of the prospectus entitled “Risk Factors.” Investors should read and understand all of the risk factors before making a decision to invest in shares of DPF's common stock.
An investment in shares of DPF's common stock involves significant risks, including among others:

There is no public trading market for shares of DPF’s common stock, and DPF does not expect that there will ever be a public trading market for its shares, so redemption of shares by them will likely be the only way to dispose of your shares. 
DPF’s Class A, Class W and Class I share redemption program generally imposes a quarterly cap on aggregate net redemptions of its Class A, Class W and Class I share classes equal to the amount of such share classes with a value of up to 5% of the aggregate net asset value (NAV) of the outstanding shares of such classes as of the last day of the previous quarter. DPF may also amend, suspend or terminate its share redemption program at any time. As a result, DPF’s shares have only limited liquidity and may become illiquid.
A portion of the proceeds received in the public offering of Class A, Class W and Class I shares is intended to be used to redeem Class E shares, which will reduce the net proceeds available to retire debt or acquire additional properties, which may reduce its liquidity and profitability.
The purchase and redemption price for shares of DPF’s common stock will be based on the NAV of each class of common stock and will not be based on any public trading market. DPF’s NAV will not represent DPF’s enterprise value and may not accurately reflect the actual prices at which DPF’s assets could be liquidated on any given day, the value a third party would pay for all or substantially all of DPF’s shares, or the price that DPF’s shares would trade at on a national stock exchange. The board of directors may amend DPF’s NAV procedures from time to time.
Some of DPF’s executive officers and directors and other key personnel are also officers, directors, managers, key personnel and / or holders of an ownership interest in its advisor, its dealer manager, its property manager and / or other entities related to its advisor. As a result, they face conflicts of interest, including but not limited to conflicts arising from time constraints, allocation of investment opportunities and the fact that the fees its advisor will receive for services rendered to DPF will be based on DPF’s NAV, the procedures for which its advisor will assist its board of directors in developing, overseeing, implementing and coordinating.
If DPF fails to maintain its status as a REIT, it would adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders.
DPF's use of leverage increases the risk of loss on its investments.
The amount of distributions DPF may make is uncertain, are not guaranteed and may be modified at the program’s discretion. DPF may pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations including, without limitation, the sale of assets, borrowings or offering proceeds (including the return of principal amounts invested). The use of these sources for distributions would decrease the amount of cash DPF has available for new investments, repayment of debt, share redemptions and other corporate purposes, and could potentially reduce your overall return and dilute the value of your investment in shares of DPF common stock. Because borrowed funds were used to pay distributions, the distribution rate may not be sustainable. Prior to 2012, DPF’s distributions have historically exceeded its cash flow from operations. However, for each year from 2012 through 2015 and for the quarters ended June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016, December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017, distributions were funded solely from cash flow from operations. The distributions for the three months ended March 31, 2016 were funded 95.3% from cash flow from operations and 4.7% from other sources.
The payment of fees by DPF to its advisor, its property manager and its dealer manager will reduce the cash available for distribution and will increase the likelihood that investors are unable to recover the amount of their investment in DPF.
In connection with DPF’s offering, it incurs fees and expenses. In particular, DPF expects to incur a dealer manager and distribution fee which are expected to reduce the amount of distributions received by certain investors and as a result will lower the overall return to such investors. Also, DPF has and expects to continue to incur organizational and offering related expenses which reduce the overall cash flow of DPF and negatively impact its NAV and could negatively impact your overall return.

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.
Investing in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk.

You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements.
