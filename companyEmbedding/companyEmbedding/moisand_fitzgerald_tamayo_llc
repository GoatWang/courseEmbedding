Q&As for MarketWatch
















General
Daniel Moisand is a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional and member of the Financial Planning Association. Serving clients at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo, LLC in Melbourne, FL and the surrounding communities.




Financial Advisor Overview

You have a right to engage a trusted advisor, directly and completely independent of any financial services company. In a world where conflicts of interest, poor strategies, and thousands of products abound, your family’s interests can be best served by such an advocate.
You deserve a sanctuary from the noise. In a world where the 24/7 media spews a deluge of information about the chaotic economic, financial, and political environments, you are more likely to make sound decisions about your money in a setting of calm and reason.
You need experts. In a world where personal financial issues become increasingly complex, we can help discern the true from the false, the practical from the useless, the probable from the merely possible, and the applicable from the merely interesting. Your family’s unique circumstances can be better served with such expertise.
Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo, LLC is a truly independent financial advisory firm. When we say we work for you, it is not a slogan but a literal fact.  We are paid only by clients, not financial services firms.  Because of this, you can have confidence that all products, strategies, and tactics we recommend are made with only your interests in mind and  stand on their own merit.
You may love working with us if you want:
+ Friendly experts working only for you, never for a commission or a kickback

+ Advisors who believe eliminating conflicts of interest is superior to merely disclosing those conflicts

+ To minimize the amount of time and attention you spend on business and financial news, preferring instead to let experts discern the newsworthy from the noise

+ A team that can sift through the deluge of rules, regulations, product pitches, and financial information to identify what is relevant to you
Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo, LLC is a registered investment advisor regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Fee-Only & Fiduciary

The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) is the country's leading association of fee-only and fiduciary financial planners.










What is Fee-Only Financial Planning and Why Does it Matter when Choosing an Advisor?
Every financial advisor gets paid for doing their job, however they don't all get paid the same way. A fee-only financial planner (all NAPFA advisors are fee-only) is paid directly by the client on a transparent and pre-arranged payment plan.  This can be an hourly or project rate, monthly retainer, or percentage of the investments managed.
Other financial advisors are paid through other sources including by the companies they recommend. For example, if the planner sells you a specific investment, mutual fund, insurance or other products, they receive a commission or partial commission directly from the company.
When working with a NAPFA Registered Financial Advisor, there are no hidden fees, commissions, third-party payments, or product sales.
If you are not sure how your financial advisor gets paid, just ask them. It is not something that is easy to tell.
How a planner is paid is quite important because it can affect the advice that they offer to their clients. Professional financial planners need to make a living like everyone else, and they are likely to be most loyal to the person who pays them. If that person is you, the client, then pleasing you will bring them long-term business. They will consistently offer you the best financial advice that they have. A commission-based financial planner may be focusing on the companies they work for before the client's best interest. That situation may not be beneficial for all of their clients.
Ultimately, you want to pick a planner who will be loyal to you and your interests. That planner is the fee-only planner.

Retirees and those approaching retirement will have a hard time finding a firm better equipped to serve them and their families than Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo and Dan is part of why that is the case. You can get glimpses of his expertise and thought processes by reading some of his writings. For the general public, he currently produces a monthly Q&A for Florida Today and the weekly Q&A as a “Retirementor” for MarketWatch, a personal finance site of the Wall Street Journal. You may access all of his MarketWatch columns through his author page.
The press and the financial planning profession rely on him for answers as well. He is a frequent source to a variety of publications and media and has appeared in Smart Money, NY Times, Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and USA Today among others. He has produced dozens of columns for the Journal of Financial Planning and Financial Advisor magaine. He has also produced several pieces for Financial Planning, Investment Advisor, and Space Coast Business. He has even been published in Niewuwsbrief financiele planning (Netherlands) and on Network FP (India). He is the only two time winner of the Journal of Financial Planning‘s Call for Papers competition.
He is tapped for his expertise and opinions so often because of the career he has had.
Dan has over 22 years of experience but recognition began in 2002 when he was dubbed a “Future Star” by Financial Advisor magazine and made Worth magazine’s list of the top 250 Advisors in America. In subsequent years, he was named one of the most influential professionals in financial planning in a ”Movers and Shakers” issue of Financial Planning and twice more received similar honors from Investment Advisor and Accounting Today. He has been lauded as one of America’s top financial planners in Financial Advisor, Florida Today, Investment News, Journal of Financial Planning, Research, Solutions, Wealth Manager, and the Wall Street Journal Online.
More recently, for its 15th anniversary issue in June of 2013, Investment News named Dan one of the 15 people that “transformed the business of financial advice”.  He was the subject of a “10 Questions” interview in the April 2013 issue of the Journal of Financial Planning and a profile in the November 2012 issue of Financial Planning magazine. The pieces touch on a few of his career highlights, travels, advocacy for the financial planning profession, and expertise in retirement planning.
Moisand’s record as a financial planner and a leader within the financial planning profession made him the subject of a two-page profile in The History of Financial Planning (Wiley & Sons, 2009) and at just 44 years of age, he was mentioned as a notable in the Lifetime Achievement category of Financial Planning magazine’s 2011 Influencer Awards.
All of these accolades stem from the work he has done to increase professionalism among financial planners and the respect peers show him for how he works with clients. From 1999-2001, he served on the CFP Board of Practice Standards, helping to write the standards that apply to CFP licensees in the United States. In 2007, Dan completed five years of service on the national Board of Directors of the Financial Planning Association (FPA), including serving as its President and Chairman. In 2008, he was Chairman of the Discipline and Ethics Commission of the CFP Board, hearing misconduct cases involving CFP licensees and the standards he helped establish.
In May of 2013, he Chaired the task force organizing FPA Retreat in Palm Springs, CA. Retreat is one of Dan’s favorite conferences at which to speak or to attend and is FPA’s premiere meeting for the best and brightest thought leaders in the profession. Dan shares freely with his peers. His friendly style has garnered him speaking engagements to planner groups on five continents. On behalf of FPA, he has led delegations of financial planners to Russia (2008), China (2011), and India (2013).
Through 2015, he will be serve the financial planning profession as a Trustee of the Foundation for Financial Planning which supports pro bono planning programs throughout the US, many of which serve military families.
Dan received his Bachelor of Science in Finance from Florida State University in 1989.

We can’t know what the future holds, but preparing a sound financial plan can help to ensure you will be ready for whatever lies ahead. Uncertainty in the financial markets makes having an advocate for your family’s unique interests even more essential.  In a world where conflicts of interest and poor strategies abound, we have created a sanctuary offering stability and a reliable source of truly independent, objective advice for families.

We are caring.  While we work on portfolios and other financial matters, we work for individuals and families.
We are independent fiduciaries. We work for no one but our clients, and our legal obligations are to our clients’ interests first and foremost. We never “switch hats” to become sales people.
We are objective.  We may recommend, or not recommend, any investment from any source. We receive no compensation based upon the sale or purchase of any particular products.  All products are evaluated based solely upon their merits or lack thereof and not on any compensation incentives.
We are disciplined. We evaluate financial products, investment opportunities, and strategies with a healthy dose of skepticism that has often helped our clients improve their prospects for success by avoiding overlooked risks and unnecessary costs.
We are investors, not speculators.  We manage our clients’ investment portfolios but we do not “play the market,” try to time the market or otherwise gamble with our client’s money.
We are proactive.  We scour the economic, tax, and market environments to identify opportunities to shore up financial weaknesses without lessening strengths.
We are realistic.  We do not believe in following investment gurus. We consider the mainstream financial media as mostly a source of entertainment and not a meaningful aid to sound decision-making.
We are well-qualified.  Our team has six CFP® professionals working for you, and the resumes of our principals speak for themselves.  Ron Tamayo is a member of the Editorial Review Board for the Journal of Financial Planning.  Charles Fitzgerald, III served as President of the FPA of Florida and Dan Moisand recently was national President and Chairman of the Financial Planning Association (FPA).
We are experienced.  We have guided our clients through bubbles and busts, bull markets and bear markets, hype and hysteria, all while helping them make sound decisions regarding their retirement plans, taxes, education expenses, estate plans, trust management, risk management, stock options, health care needs and whatever else has arisen.

Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo Review



Review of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo LLC



Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo LLC was founded in 1998 and is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor (RIA). All services are provided to clients in the capacity of fiduciaries, which means client interests trump all other considerations – including any potential for third-party compensation to the firm. 


High-net-worth individuals and families form the majority of the firm’s clients; however, the firm also manages investments for trusts and provides investment advice and pension plan design consulting for small business retirement plans. 


The minimum required portfolio for new clients at the firm is $750,000; exceptions can be made at the discretion of the firm for new clients referred by existing clients or other industry professionals.


As of December 31, 2014, the company managed $370 million for 393 households on a discretionary basis while also managing a further $3 million on a non-discretionary basis for 7 households.








Background – How Did Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo LLC Start?


Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo LLC was founded in 1998, under a different name, and came about through a series of strategic mergers with other like-minded firms, including the 2002 merger with Optimum Financial Group.

Individually and collectively, the firm and its key staff have received a number of accolades and acknowledgements from peers, industry regulatory bodies, and media, including:



Holding leadership roles with leading financial institutions


Being named as top advisors by independent industry publications


Serving as speakers and panelists for various industry-related and consumer groups


Contributing articles and commentaries for leading media outlets


Being ranked amongst the top independent wealth management firms in the country


Having financial advisory publications featuring the firm’s support staff for their effectiveness



Owned by four partners, Ronald Tamayo, Charles Fitzgerald III, Daniel Moisand, and Derrick Chandler, the firm is an Orlando, FL-based, independent, SEC Registered Investment Advisor, with a second office in Melbourne, Florida.

What We Like About Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo LLC



Exceptional value proposition



Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo LLC offers its clients a great value proposition by delivering the best of two worlds: exceptional access to tools, technology, and research from large-sized custodians, like Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, and establishing the kind of personal relationships with its clients that are only possible with a firm the size of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo.



Independent fiduciaries



The firm acts as fiduciaries to clients, delivering unbiased, independent advice in return for compensation that comes directly from clients – and no other third party. This ensures that clients’ interests are always placed ahead of all other considerations.



Objectivity



The company does not sell any investment products, nor does it receive commissions or fees from third parties for referrals. All advice for specific investment products is based on the merits of those products/services for each client and never based on potential compensation or other soft benefits to the firm.



Non-speculation



Advisors at the firm take a disciplined approach when managing client funds. They do not speculate or attempt to “play the market.” Decisions are made taking into account the risks and costs of the investment and potential benefits that can be accrued by clients’ portfolios.









Qualified and experienced team



The Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo LLC team comprises six highly experienced CFP® professionals and ably supported by a team of 5 qualified and experienced support staff members. The firm sets a high minimum educational and experience standard for its professionals, which includes having a bachelor’s degree in accounting or finance, five years of experience in investment or finance, a Certified Financial Planner (CFP®) Practitioner license, and membership of the Financial Planning Association (Nationwide and Central Florida).



Advice based on sound academic research



Advisors at the firm base their investment decisions on sound academic research. As a result, the company favors investments that are low-cost, transparent, offer significant risk protection, well-diversified, fairly liquid in nature, and not linked to individual trading strategies. The firm, therefore, favors the use of investment vehicles such as exchange traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds.








Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo LLC Review – Team Members


Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo LLC has six CFP® professionals advising clients and principals and executives with accomplishments that speak for themselves, including serving on the Editorial Review Board for the Journal of Financial Planning, former president of the FPA of Florida, membership on the Board of Directors of the CFP Board, and former president and chairman of the Financial Planning Association (FPA).


Professionals at the firm have a range of certifications and accreditations that include CFP®, EA, and CDFA.
