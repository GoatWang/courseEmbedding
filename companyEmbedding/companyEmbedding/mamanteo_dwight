About GlyEco
GlyEco is a green chemistry company with a patent-pending technology for transforming a hazardous waste into green products. GlyEco Technology™ has the unique ability to clean the polluted glycols from all five waste-producing industries:  HVAC, Textiles, Automotive, Airline and Medical.  This technology recycles waste glycol to meet ASTM Type 1 specifications – the same level of purity expected of refinery-grade glycols.
This patent-pending technology enables our clients to handle the removal of their waste glycol in a responsible and environmentally safe manner.  Our clients can treat glycols as a more sustainable resource, recycling and re-using waste glycols repeatedly.
