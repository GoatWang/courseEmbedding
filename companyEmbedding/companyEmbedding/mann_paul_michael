Our Story

Recognizing a shift in the marketplace, the decline of the American dollar, as well as the need to recycle; the Paul Michael Company began its’ biggest endeavor to date by manufacturing its’ own line of accessories and furniture that Paul designs. He felt that the only way the company would be able to separate itself from the market would be to create its’ own line of exclusive items that Paul feels will be the antiques of tomorrow. Today we refer to these original designs as Paul’s World ~reclaim, reuse, recycle, redecorate~ everything is 100% American made and the majority of items are constructed of architectural salvage and reclaimed wood that Paul has been collecting for years.  In Dermott, AR the Paul Michael Company now has a woodshop buzzing 7 days a week, developing, manufacturing and designing amazing pieces for your home.
We take pride in offering Paul Michael Company Exclusives, pieces designed by our founder and handcrafted at our Dermott, AR woodshop, to our customers looking for one-of-a-kind offerings to adorn their homes.
