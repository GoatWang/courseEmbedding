Melco Crown to buy EGT products worth US$29 mln

 Dec 19, 2014
 Newsdesk
 Latest News, Macau, Philippines, Top of the deck
&nbsp



Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd, which runs casinos in Macau and the Philippines, said it would purchase gaming products from Dolphin Products Ltd, a unit of Entertainment Gaming Asia Inc (EGT), for a term of three years commencing January 1, 2015.
The annual caps for each of the three financial years ending December 31, 2017 are US$18 million, US$6 million and US$5 million, respectively, the casino operator said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
“In light of the expected opening of new casino resorts in the future, the company expects the purchases of gaming products from the Dolphin Products group would increase in the coming years,” it said.
The deals will be done via Melco Crown (Macau) Ltd, which operates the Altira and City of Dreams casinos in Macau, and MCE Leisure (Philippines) Corp, which runs the City of Dreams Manila, a property that had a soft opening on December 14.
The companies have spent US$4.6 million in Dolphin gaming products in the calendar year to November 30, 2014.
Nasdaq-listed EGT operates slot machines on a participation basis and manufactures and distributes gaming chips, gaming plaques and related products to casinos in Asia and Australia under the Dolphin brand. The company became a subsidiary of Melco International Development Ltd following a share sale last month.
Melco International, chaired by Lawrence Ho Yau Lung, is one of the two controlling shareholders of casino operator Melco Crown. The other is Australia’s Crown Resorts Ltd. Mr Ho is also co-chairman and chief executive of Melco Crown.
Under the agreement now announced, Melco Crown Macau will buy Dolphin gaming products worth US$12 million next year. The company is developing its second large-scale casino resort in Cotai, Studio City, expected to open in mid-2015.
MCE Leisure will spend US$6 million in gaming products from Dolphin Products next year. City of Dreams Manila’s grand opening is scheduled for before Chinese New Year in 2015.

                Gaming company to open $1 billion hotel in Macau in 2018
            



                Chairman Lawrence Ho plans resorts, hotels outside gaming hub
            













Melco Crown Plans Hotel Expansion




Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd.’s billionaire chairman said he wants to be the first resort operator to use Macau as the launchpad for a global hotel brand, beginning with a $1 billion project in the the world’s biggest gambling center with ambitions to expand to Japan and other Asian countries.Casino tycoon Lawrence Ho plans to debut the company’s first Morpheus hotel, a futuristic high-rise designed by late architect Zaha Hadid, on Macau’s Cotai strip in the first half of 2018, he said in an interview in Macau Tuesday. Ho intends “to build something special in big jurisdictions like Japan or other parts of Asia” to expand the lodging brand aimed at “the most sophisticated international travelers,” he said.Along with developing a global hotel brand, Melco Crown is mapping a global expansion beyond its Macau flagships with casino projects in Cyprus, Russia and other Asian countries. The company is looking to branch out internationally as the fight for market share against rivals Las Vegas Sands Corp. and Wynn Resorts Ltd. heats up in the former Portuguese colony after a two-year gaming slump.




“It’s a global footprint that we are developing,” said Ho, the 39-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of Melco Crown. “We have done well in Macau and we want to see how we can do even better internationally.”The expansion plan comes as the casino industry has been rocked by the Chinese government’s detentions in October of 18 employees of Crown Resorts Ltd., which owns a 27 percent stake in U.S-listed Melco Crown. A group of them were formally arrested last week on alleged gambling crimes. Ho said the arrests haven’t had a direct effect on Melco Crown as it operates independently of Crown, and operators in the Chinese city of Macau could see a boost if the government clamps down on foreign operators luring its citizens to gamble overseas.Ho earlier this month took on a more direct role at Melco after complaining he was dissatisfied with the performance at the $3.2 billion Hollywood-themed Studio City resort that opened in Macau last year. The resort has “ramped up,” and performed well over the last quarter, Ho said Tuesday, adding that there’s “more potential for Studio City to grow.” The company posted third-quarter profit that topped estimates.Melco shares rose 1.6 percent to $19.43 at 10:10 a.m. in New York. While the stock has bounced back from a one-year low in July, it lags behind peers on Bloomberg Intelligence’s index of Macau gaming stocks, which has surged about 45 percent this year.The company’s overseas growth strategy got a boost earlier this month when its plan to develop a casino resort in the eastern Mediterranean country of Cyprus won government approval. Its first major expansion outside of Macau is the City of Dreams Manila, which opened in the Philippines in early 2015. Ho is also the chairman of a holding company that opened a casino in Russia last year, according to exchange filings.




“In terms of getting the name out there and growing the customer database, it does make sense to pursue non-gaming opportunities globally,” said Grant Govertsen, a Macau-based gaming analyst at Union Gaming Group LLC. There’s little land available for gaming development in Macau, he added. “New development that can move the needle for most Macau’s casino operators effectively has to come from overseas development at this point.”While Ho wants to expand overseas to Japan and Vietnam, he said he’s confident about the company’s prospects in Macau, where new resort openings are contributing to a rebound from a two-year gaming slump.“We are in a recovery. That recovery is not going to be the same as the recovery during the global financial crisis,” Ho said. “This time around, it’s different. It’s going to be more of a natural recovery.”Casino operators in Macau, the only place in China where casinos are legal, may actually benefit from a Chinese government crackdown on foreign casinos that woo its citizens to gamble overseas, said Ho.“The view in Macau right now is China is trying to crack down on the foreign casinos trying to poach their players to go overseas,” said Ho, who added that his company has always been in compliance. “At the end of the day, Macau is a part of China. The reason for Macau’s success is China. Our hope is that for home-grown Macau operators, we would be safe.”Melco has said it’s also re-examining the way it runs its business in the wake of the detentions of more than a dozen employees of stakeholder Crown.Australia’s Crown, controlled by Melco’s former co-chairman James Packer, had been warned by Chinese authorities last year to halt its efforts to attract high rollers from the mainland to gamble overseas, a person familiar with the government’s action said in October.Macau’s operators have opened new billion-dollar resorts that target casual gamblers instead of the high rollers that the industry relied upon for the bulk of its revenue in previous years. The city reported a third straight month of revenue gains in October, regaining ground after a being dragged down by China’s slowing economy and anti-corruption measures.Melco Crown’s market share rose to 15.7 percent in the third quarter, from 14 percent the same period a year earlier, before Studio City opened, according to data compiled by CLSA Ltd. But Melco Crown is battling competition -- as Sands China Ltd. and Wynn Macau Ltd. opened new resorts in the last quarter, Melco saw its market share drop from its second-quarter level, according to the CLSA data.While Studio City has attracted most of the spotlight with its Batman ride and figure-eight Ferris wheel, Melco’s top-performing property remains its 500-table City of Dreams in Macau. Studio City has about half that many gambling tables. The operator also owns two other smaller casino properties in Macau.

Ho’s father is gambling legend Stanley Ho, the 95-year-old chairman of rival SJM Holdings Ltd. In rare, candid comments about his father Tuesday, the younger Ho said he has “no idea” whether there is a succession plan in place for his father’s “big and complicated family.” The elder Ho has 17 children from relationships with four women. One of his daughters, Pansy Ho, is a major shareholder in MGM China Holdings Ltd., another Macau operator.The younger Ho said he has no involvement in the operations at SJM -- and has no plans to participate in the future. “I’m not interested in that,” he said. “Because, look, what I have built on my own is so much more exciting.”

Melco PBL Entertainment (Macau) Ltd











Melco PBL Entertainment (Macau) Ltd. ��MPEL 
 
We
are a developer, owner and operator of casino gaming and entertainment resort
facilities focused exclusively on the rapidly expanding Macau market. Our subsidiary Melco PBL Gaming (Macau) Limited, or MPBL Gaming, is one of
six companies authorized by the Macau government to operate casinos in Macau. We have two current casino gaming and
entertainment projects under development: the Crown Macau Hotel Casino targeted
to open in the second quarter of 2007 and the City of Dreams
integrated casino complex, phase one of which is targeted to open in late 2008.
MPBL Gaming currently operates six Mocha Clubs featuring a total of
approximately 1,000 gaming machines, or slot machines. We have also entered
into a conditional agreement to acquire a third development site that is
located on the shoreline of the Macau
peninsula. We are a 50/50 joint venture between Melco
International Development Limited, or Melco, and
Publishing and Broadcasting Limited, or PBL. We are the exclusive vehicle of Melco and PBL to carry on casino, gaming machine and casino
hotel operations in Macau.

We
have chosen to focus on the Macau gaming market because we believe that Macau is well positioned to be one of the
largest gaming destinations in the world. In 2005 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2006, Macau generated approximately US$5.7 billion and US$4.9
billion of gaming revenue, respectively, compared to the US$5.9 billion and
US$4.8 billion of gaming revenue (excluding sports book and race book),
respectively, generated on the Las Vegas Strip and exceeding the US$5.0 billion
and US$4.0 billion (excluding sports book and race book), respectively,
generated in Atlantic City, according to the Direc�āo
de Inspec�āo e Coordena�āo
de Jogos (Gaming Inspection and Coordination
Bureau of the Macau government), or the DICJ, the Nevada Gaming Control Board
and the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. Gaming revenue in Macau has increased
at a five-year compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, from 2000 to 2005 of
23.0% compared to CAGRs of 4.9% and 3.1% for the Las
Vegas Strip and Atlantic City (excluding
sports book and race book). Macau benefits from its proximity to one of the world�s
largest pools of existing and potential gaming patrons and is currently the
only market in Greater China, and one of only several in Asia, to offer
legalized casino gaming. 
Through
our existing operations and projects currently under development, we will cater
to a broad spectrum of potential gaming patrons, including wealthy high-end
patrons, who seek the excitement of high stakes gaming, as well as mass market
patrons, who wager lower stakes and may be more casual gaming patrons seeking a
broader entertainment experience. We will seek to attract these patrons from
throughout Asia
and in particular from Greater China. 
Our
existing operations and development projects consist of: 
 




  


� 


  


The Crown Macau. We began construction of the Crown Macau Hotel Casino, or Crown
  Macau, in December 2004 and target its opening in the second quarter of 2007.
  We completed the topping out of 



  
 



  


the Crown Macau
  in November 2006. The Crown Macau is being developed to offer a luxurious
  premium hotel and casino resort experience by offering premium entertainment,
  elegant facilities, high quality service and rich d�cor, and is being
  designed with the aim of exceeding the average five-star hotel in Macau
  catering primarily to the high-end gaming market. Gaming venues traditionally
  available to high stakes patrons in Macau have not offered the luxurious
  accommodations and facilities we aim to offer at the Crown Macau, instead
  focusing primarily on intensive gaming during day trips and short visits to Macau. The total project costs to build and
  commence operation of the Crown Macau are currently budgeted at approximately
  US$512.6 million, which includes the value of land for the project site both
  contributed to us in kind and partly paid for by us, land premium costs,
  anticipated construction costs, furniture, fixtures and equipment expenses,
  or FF&E, pre-opening expenses, capitalized fees and finance costs, cage
  cash and initial working capital requirements. As of September 30, 2006, we
  had paid approximately US$260.3 million of our US$512.6 million of budgeted
  project costs, most of which represented payments due to our contractors as
  well as the payment of land costs and land premium. The property will feature
  a 36-story tower including approximately 183,000 square feet of gaming space
  with approximately 220 gaming tables and more than 500 gaming machines and a
  luxury premium hotel with approximately 216 deluxe hotel rooms, including 24
  suites and eight villas. 



 




  


� 


  


The City of Dreams. We began
  site preparation of the City of Dreams
  integrated casino resort complex, or City of Dreams,
  in the second quarter of 2006 and we have commenced substantial piling work at
  the site. We target opening the initial phase of the complex in late 2008,
  which is currently expected to include substantial completion of the casino,
  retail space, two of the four hotels planned for the City of Dreams and the
  performance hall, which is targeted to be completed in the second half of
  2008 and ready to host performances in the second quarter of 2009. The second
  phase of the complex is targeted to open in the second half of 2009, mainly
  comprising the remaining two hotels. Total project costs for the City of Dreams
  project are currently budgeted at approximately US$2.1 billion, which
  includes anticipated land and construction costs, land premium costs,
  FF&E, pre-opening expenses, capitalized fees and finance costs, cage cash
  and initial working capital requirements. As of September 30, 2006, we had
  paid approximately US$166.0 million of our US$2.1 billion of budgeted project
  costs, primarily for land costs and land premium, construction costs and
  design and consultation fees. We are developing the City of Dreams
  to be a �must-see� integrated casino and entertainment resort primarily for
  mass market patrons. The City of Dreams
  will be located on the Cotai Strip, an area that
  has been master planned to feature a series of major new developments in the
  style of the Las Vegas Strip. The City of Dreams is planned to feature an
  underwater-themed casino with approximately 450 gaming tables and 2,500
  gaming machines, and four luxurious hotels with a total of approximately
  1,600 rooms, consisting of: (1) a luxury premium hotel designed with the aim
  of exceeding the average five-star hotel in Macau to be operated under the
  Crown Towers brand by us with approximately 260 rooms, suites and villas;
  (2) two hotels to be operated under the Grand Hyatt and Hyatt Regency
  brands with approximately a total of 970 rooms and suites; and (3) a themed
  hotel to be operated under the Hard Rock brand with approximately 380 rooms
  and suites. The complex will also feature a performance hall that will be
  designed and built to the specifications of Dragone
  Entertainment GmbH, or Dragone, and which is
  expected to offer world-class performance shows. The complex will also
  feature an upscale shopping mall and a wide variety of mid- and high-end food
  and beverage outlets. We also plan to develop one block of luxury serviced
  apartment units, for both long and short-term occupancy in phase two of the
  project, and, depending on the market conditions, may develop a second block
  thereafter. The development of the serviced apartment units may be subject to
  Macau
  government approval and approval of our lenders under our debt facilities.
  The cost of a second block of apartments has not been included in the US$2.1
  billion total budgeted project cost for development of the City of Dreams.
  



 




  


� 


  


Mocha Clubs. The Mocha Clubs feature a total of approximately
  1,000 gaming machines in six locations, and comprise the largest
  non-casino-based operations of electronic gaming machines in Macau. By combining machine-based gaming
  with an upscale d�cor and cafe ambiance, we aim to 



  
 



  


improve on Macau�s historically limited service to mass
  market and casual gaming patrons outside the conventional casino setting and
  to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities for machine-based
  gaming in Macau.
  



 




  


� 


  


Macau Peninsula Site. We
  have entered into an agreement to acquire a third development site, which is
  located on the shoreline of the Macau peninsula near the current Macau Ferry
  Terminal, or Macau Peninsula
  site, for HK$1.5 billion (US$192.3 million). If the purchase is completed, we
  expect to pay a land premium of HK$150 million (US$19.2 million) to the Macau government. Completion of the purchase
  remains subject to significant conditions in the control of third parties
  unrelated to us and the seller. We are currently considering plans to develop
  the Macau Peninsula
  site into a mixed-use casino and hotel facility targeted
  primarily at day-trip gaming patrons, and target its opening in the
  middle of 2009 if we are able to acquire the site. We may also include
  high-end residential apartments as part of the Macau Peninsula
  site. Based on preliminary estimates and conceptual designs, the total
  project costs for the Macau Peninsula
  project are currently budgeted at a range of approximately US$650 million to
  US$700 million, which includes anticipated land and construction costs, land
  premium costs, FF&E, pre-opening expenses, capitalized fees and finance
  costs, cage cash and initial working capital requirements. As of September
  30, 2006, we had paid approximately US$12.9 million of our budgeted project
  costs, which related to the deposit for the acquisition of the land. 



The
Mocha Clubs have been and will continue to be our sole source of revenue until
the targeted opening of the Crown Macau in the second quarter of 2007. In 2005,
the Mocha Clubs generated total revenue of US$17.3 million, while our
consolidated operating costs and expenses totaled US$21.1 million in 2005,
including amortization of land use rights of US$3.5 million for the Crown Macau
site. For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, the Mocha Clubs
generated total revenue of US$18.2 million, while our consolidated operating
costs and expenses totaled US$45.1 million, including a one-time impairment
loss of US$7.6 million in connection with the termination of our services
agreements with Sociedade Jogos
de Macau, S.A., or SJM, and amortization of land use rights of US$8.1 million
for the Crown Macau and City of Dreams sites. For 2005 and the nine months
ended September 30, 2006, the Mocha Clubs generated Operating EBITDA of US$7.4
million and US$6.6 million, respectively. Operating EBITDA is presented for the
results of the Mocha Clubs only as they currently comprise our sole operating
business and is reconciled to consolidated net income as described in the notes
to our consolidated financial statements. Prior to MPBL Gaming obtaining a
Macau gaming subconcession in September 2006, our
subsidiary Mocha Slot Management Limited, or Mocha Slot, provided management
services to the Mocha Clubs under service agreements with SJM, pursuant to
which Mocha Slot provided all of the gaming machines at the Mocha Clubs and
auxiliary services to SJM and received service fees of 31% of gaming machine
win. After obtaining a subconcession through MPBL
Gaming and terminating these service agreements, we now reflect as our revenue
all of the gaming machine win at the Mocha Clubs but are subject to Macau taxes and other government dues
currently totaling approximately 39%. 
The
current budgeted project costs for the Crown Macau, City of Dreams and the
Macau Peninsula projects total approximately US$3.3 billion, including the
approximately US$650 million to US$700 million budgeted project costs for the
Macau Peninsula project based on preliminary estimates and conceptual designs.
We expect, based on current budgets and estimates, to incur secured long term
debt to pay for a portion of our construction and development costs as follows:
(1) approximately HK$1.28 billion (US$164.1 million) to finance construction of
the Crown Macau; and (2) approximately US$1.6 billion to finance construction
of the City of Dreams. As of September 30, 2006, we had not drawn down on our
existing credit facilities and did not have any outstanding debt. However,
since we obtained a controlling interest in MPBL Gaming, the holder of the subconcession, in October 2006, our consolidated
indebtedness has included the US$500 million loan drawn by MPBL Gaming under
the US$500 million term loan facility, or the Subconcession
Facility, used to finance part of the US$900 million payment made to Wynn
Resorts (Macau) S.A., or Wynn Macau, upon the granting of the subconcession. All amounts outstanding under the Subconcession Facility will be repaid from the net proceeds
of this offering. 
  
 
Our
Shareholders 
We
believe one of our greatest strengths is the combined resources of our
shareholders, Melco and PBL. 
Melco is
a long-established company listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange. Its major business is the leisure, gaming and entertainment business
in Macau
carried on by us. Among the listed companies in Hong Kong, Melco
was one of the first to tap the rapidly growing leisure and entertainment
market in Macau.
In June 2004, Melco established Macau gaming as a
principal activity with the acquisition of interests in Mocha Slot Group
Limited, or Mocha, and in September of the same year, Melco
announced its participation in a hotel development project in Taipa, Macau
which subsequently evolved to become our existing Crown Macau project. 
Through
the leadership and reputation of Mr. Lawrence Ho, our Co-Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Melco, Melco has a broad network
of business relationships in Macau, Hong Kong and elsewhere in Greater China.
We believe these relationships have been and will be important to the
successful development and operation of our gaming business in Macau. Melco is the
originator of most of our existing projects in Macau and its local
relationships helped it to initially secure our interests in Mocha and the
Crown Macau and City of Dreams
projects. In addition, Melco�s relationships
have helped us to identify sites for Mocha Club venues on attractive economic
terms and helped expand the Mocha Clubs into the largest non-casino based
operations of gaming machines in Macau, with an approximately 30% market share
by gross gaming machine revenue for the nine months ended September 30,
2006, based in part on the figures from the DICJ. Dr. Stanley Ho, Mr. Lawrence
Ho�s father, controls the entities that were the monopoly operators of casino
gaming in Macau
from 1962 to 2002 and was a director and the Chairman of Melco
until he resigned from those positions in March 2006. 
In
connection with forming the joint venture between Melco
and PBL in March 2005 and in exchange for its ownership interest in us, Melco contributed to our then 80% owned subsidiary Melco PBL Entertainment (Greater China) Limited, or MPBL
(Greater China) (in which Melco held the remaining
20% interest) an 80% interest in Mocha, which was then the holding company for
the Mocha Clubs. Melco also contributed to MPBL
(Greater China) a 50.8% interest in the City of Dreams
project, and a 70% interest in the Crown Macau project. We later acquired the
remaining 20% interest in Mocha from Dr. Stanley Ho, the remaining 30% interest
in the Crown Macau project from Sociedade de Turismo e Divers�es de Macau, or
STDM, and the remaining 49.2% interest in the City of Dreams project from a
company controlled by a discretionary trust formed for the benefit of members
of the Ho family. In October 2006 after the subconcession
was granted to MPBL Gaming and we obtained a controlling interest in MPBL
Gaming, all the interests in the Mocha Clubs, the Crown Macau and the City of Dreams
projects were transferred to MPBL Gaming. 
Melco
also has extensive experience in the restaurant business, operating the
well-known Jumbo
Kingdom
floating restaurants in Hong Kong and the Chua Lam Gourmet Kitchen in Macau. In addition, Melco
provides gaming IT infrastructure and solutions as well as online financial trading
and related systems and services to its customers through its subsidiaries,
Elixir Group (Macau) Limited and iAsia Online Systems
Limited, and carries on investment banking and financial services businesses
through its Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed subsidiary, Value Convergence
Holdings Limited. 
PBL is
Australia�s
largest listed diversified media and entertainment company. PBL owns and
operates the Crown Entertainment Complex, or Crown Casino Melbourne, in Melbourne, Australia
and the Burswood Entertainment Complex, or Burswood Casino, in Perth, Australia, which brings us significant
experience in developing and operating casino resorts and in branding and
marketing as well as providing access to its international high-end gaming
clientele, particularly in the Asia region. In
addition to its entertainment and casino complexes, PBL currently owns and
operates the high audience-rated free-to-air television network in Australia, Nine Network, and
Australia�s
largest magazine publisher, ACP Magazines. However, it recently announced plans
to sell 50% of its television and magazine business and expects to complete
this sale in early 2007. 
  
 
Through the successful operation of the Crown Casino
Melbourne and the Burswood Casino, we believe that
PBL has a proven track record in both high-end and mass market gaming
operations as well as in providing other leisure services and facilities. PBL
successfully operates a total of more than 400 high-end and mass market table
games and more than 4,000 electronic gaming machines at these two casinos. In
addition to gaming, these properties feature a total of approximately 1,650
luxury hotel rooms, more than 100,000 square feet of conference and event
facilities at the Burswood Conventions &
Events Center and the Crown Conference Center, over 50 dining facilities
offering a variety of global cuisines, highly acclaimed entertainment venues
with total seating capacity for more than 26,000 and a host of resort and
recreational facilities, including an exclusive championship 18-hole golf
course. Crown operates its successful �Crown Club� gaming loyalty program. We
intend to leverage PBL�s operating skills, its
international experience and its high standards and reputation to strengthen
our operations in Macau.
For example, we expect PBL will assist us in: 
 




  


� 


  


implementing customer
  relationship management systems to facilitate our loyalty programs; 



 




  


� 


  


adapting our gaming product
  analytics systems to maximize revenue potential; 



 




  


� 


  


implementing management
  reporting practices and operating procedures to ensure accuracy and
  consistency in our internal control; 



 




  


� 


  


training staff in high
  quality customer service; and 



 




  


� 


  


adopting a community and government relations framework to
  promote efficient working relationships with government authorities and
  compliance with rules and regulations. 



We expect PBL will do
this by recommending candidates for employment and seconding employees to us or
our subsidiaries from time to time, providing management information systems
and policy and procedure guidelines, facilitating training and by appointing
directors to our board of directors. 
Melco and
PBL have agreed with us under an amended and restated shareholders� deed that
we will be the exclusive vehicle of Melco and PBL to
carry on casino, gaming machine and casino hotel operations in Macau. We have entered into a license
agreement with Crown Limited, a subsidiary of PBL, and obtained an exclusive
and non-transferable license to use the Crown brand in Macau. In connection with certain of our loan
facilities, Melco and PBL have agreed to provide
corporate and bank guarantees to support our payment obligations. In addition,
as our founding shareholders, PBL and Melco have
provided us with administrative support and technical expertise in connection
with the development of the Crown Macau, City of Dreams and Macau Peninsula
projects and the operation of the Mocha Clubs business, although we do not have
contractual rights to have such services provided to us. We pay PBL and Melco for reasonable costs, determined on an arm�s length
basis, in connection with this support and expertise. 
Industry
Background 
Macau
is located in the Pearl River Delta region of China and is approximately
an hour away from approximately 6.9 million people in Hong Kong via a 24-hour hydrofoil ferry
system. All of the main population centers of China, as well as Taiwan, Japan,
Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines lie within
an approximately 2,500 mile radius of Macau. According to the Economist
Intelligence Unit, these countries had a total population of almost two billion
people in 2005, with China
alone representing approximately 1.3 billion people. Like Hong Kong, Macau is a
Special Administrative Region of the People�s Republic of China.

Between
2000 and 2005, visitation to Macau
increased at a CAGR of 15.4% to approximately 18.7 million visitors
according to the Macau Statistics and Census Services. We believe that
visitation and gaming revenue growth for the Macau market have been driven by and will
continue to be driven by a combination of factors, including: 
 




  


� 


  


proximity to major Asian
  population centers; 



 




  


� 


  


liberalization of travel
  restrictions in China under China�s �Facilitated Individual Travel Scheme�,
  enabling greater numbers of Chinese citizens from more provinces to visit
  Macau individually without being in a tour group (as was required
  previously), and liberalization of currency restrictions to permit Chinese
  citizens to take significantly larger sums of foreign currency out of China
  when they travel; 



 




  


� 


  


increasing regional wealth,
  leading to a large and growing middle class with more disposable income; and 



 




  


� 


  


planned infrastructure improvements such as an expanded and
  upgraded airport, new roads, tunnels and bridges, a light rail system and
  additional ferry access, which are expected to facilitate more convenient
  access to and travel within Macau.
