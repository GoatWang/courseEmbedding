Michael J. Curran

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Michael J. Curran was an Irish priest who served as Rector of the Pontifical Irish College, Rome. Curran studied for the priesthood at Clonliffe College, Dublin before going to the Irish College in Rome, where he served as Vice Rector from 1919 before being appointed Rector serving from 1930 until 1939. He returned to the Dublin Diocese. Fr. Curran served as secretary to Archbishop William Walsh of Dublin during the 1913 Lockout and 1916 Easter Rising, prior to taking up his post in Rome.[1] During his time in Clonliffe he would have correspondence and dealings with many significant figures at the time, including helping hide Eamon De Valera on the college grounds in 1919.[2]
Monsignor Michael Curran was elected President of the Oliver Plunkett Union in 1955.[3] His brother was Constantine Peter Curran the Lawyer, socialite and writer, and friend of Tom Kettle and James Joyce (who names him once in Ulysses).[4]
Papers from Monsignor Curran are held in the archive of the Irish College Rome, some in Clonliffe College from his time as Diocesan Secretary[5] and some in the Military Archives in Cathal Brugha Barracks in Dublin from his statements on the Rising and war of Independence.
He died 9 February 1960[6]

Michael J Curran | Builder Resources - Products and Programs - Wells Fargo

















































			    BSM Script Anchor
			

Products and ProgramsPrint     Wells Fargo offers one of the most extensive sets of financing options in the industry, including a variety of special loans and programs to help you meet more homebuyer needs. Our position of leadership and our strategic relationships allow us to provide special benefits to eligible members of qualifying groups. From low-down-payment options to Wells Fargo exclusive programs, such as the Union Plus® Mortgage program, you can be confident that your buyers have options that meet their needs.     Builder focused programs    Mortgage products    Consumer benefit programs      Builder Best® Extended Rate Lock program Give your buyers the ultimate interest rate security Our Builder Best Extended Rate Lock program protects your buyers against interest rate changes while their home is being built, regardless of market fluctuations. A non-refundable extended rate lock fee is required. As a builder, this provides you the security that a rising rate environment will not negatively impact your pipelines and customers' abilities to finance. Your buyers may be able to:  Lock in interest rates from 5 months up to 12 months on conforming mortgages. Lock in interest rates from 5 months up to 24 months on jumbo mortgages. If interest rates decline, buyers may seek to exercise a one-time float down to the current interest rate, or switch to another eligible product, subject to credit approval, within 60 days of actual loan closing.     Builder Lock Options   Our Builder Lock OptionsSM help you advertise rate protection, even in a volatile market.          New construction financing With one of the most extensive product offerings in the industry, along with construction-friendly programs, we can consistently meet more of your buyers' needs. Our local home mortgage consultants and dedicated support teams stand ready to work with you and your buyers every step of the way. Our popular Builder Lock OptionsSM allow homebuyers to lock in interest rates on new homes.  Our Builder Best® Extended Rate Lock program provides new construction buyers protection against rising interest rates. A non-refundable extended rate lock fee is required.     Condominium financing Condominium financing can be a confusing topic for developers, sales professionals, and borrowers alike. We stand committed to helping all navigate the complexities of condominium financing.    Jumbo loan options We are the nation's #1 jumbo mortgage lender with lending capability in all 50 states. Jumbo loans allow qualified buyers to finance loan amounts above maximum conforming limits, helping them take advantage of today's home prices and low interest rates. Consider our jumbo loans for your homebuyers in higher-priced housing markets, including those who have a goal of purchasing a second home, resort condo, or rental property. Jumbo loan amounts are typically available with a variety of terms, options, and benefits:  Fixed- and adjustable-rate loans and short-term loans at very competitive interest rates. Loan amounts up to $2 million; higher amounts may be available through Private Mortgage Banking. 10.01% down payment financing option with no mortgage insurance requirement. After making a lump-sum principal reduction of $20,000 or more 90 days after closing, buyers may be eligible to reduce their monthly mortgage payments by recasting, or re-amortizing, the loan. Buyers will have a lower monthly mortgage payment, but they may pay more interest over the full mortgage term than they would by making a principal reduction without using the recast option. Buyers can purchase with cash up-front and may be eligible to apply for a mortgage within 90 days of purchase. Expanded credit, debt, and loan-to-value guidelines for qualified customers. Relationship-based pricing, interest-only options, and portfolio lending services.  Contact your local home mortgage consultant to learn more.

Low down payment options Wells Fargo Home Mortgage provides a variety of programs that allow for low-and-no-down payments, and other features to help more homebuyers achieve homeownership.

Plus, there are no area median income requirements and they can use gift funds and down payment assistance programs.

VA loans VA loans offer low- and no-down payment options for veterans and other borrowers who meet the eligibility requirements of the VA program.  Learn more    Fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages Fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages are two of the most popular loan types. Both options are available for conventional conforming loan amounts, jumbo (non-conforming) loan amounts, and FHA or VA programs. Fixed-rate mortgage A fixed-rate mortgage carries the same interest rate and monthly principal and interest payments for the life of the loan, which protects your homebuyers from rising interest rates and allows them to budget their monthly mortgage payments more easily. This loan type may be a good choice for your buyers who plan to stay in their homes for a long time. Adjustable-rate mortgage An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) has the same interest rate and principal and interest payments a defined initial period, then adjusts annually when that initial period is over. Typically, ARMs have a lower initial interest rate than fixed-rate mortgages. After the initial fixed period, your buyer's rates and payments may increase. This loan type may be a good option for your buyers who plan to move or refinance within a few years.       Union Plus® Mortgage program Home financing for union families Active and retired members of participating labor unions, their parents, and their children may be able to take advantage of special benefits through the Union Plus® Mortgage program, with financing provided by Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.
