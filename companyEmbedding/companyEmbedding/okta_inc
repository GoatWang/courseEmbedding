Rethink Security: A Massive Paradigm Shift in the Age of Access


 


 








 


Today's security is not secure.
It’s time for a massive rethink in security. In 2016 over $75B was spent on cyber security, and yet the number of breaches skyrocketed to 4.2 billion incidents. Minimizing an organization’s attack surface as its network continues to expand requires a paradigm shift in security strategy. The traditional approach to cyber security is not secure against breaches.
To protect organizations from data breaches and financial ruin, a massive rethink of security strategy is required. Read this eBook, "Rethink Security: A Massive Paradigm Shift in the Age of Access," to understand the changing cyber security landscape and, more importantly, how to keep your company’s information safe in the face of it.

2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant for IDaaS

















































 


Gartner’s 2016 Magic Quadrant for Identity and Access Management as a Service (IDaaS)


Understand Vendor Strengths, Cautions, and Trends Shaping the IDaaS Market


 


 








 


Today’s identity and access market is fragmented, poorly integrated, and focused too narrowly on single parts. With identity at the center of most cyber attacks, traditional network security fails to fully protect the expanded security perimeter for today's modern enterprise.
This Magic Quadrant rates vendors on their ability to be global, general-purpose identity and access management (IAM) service providers for multiple use cases. The vendors in this Magic Quadrant must provide some level of functionality in all of the following IAM functional areas: Identity Governance and Administration, Access, and Identity log monitoring and reporting.1
Get the full complementary report and learn why Centrify is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant.

Forrester™


 








 


Reduce the Likelihood of an Attack Through an IAM Maturity Model
Forrester estimates that 80% of security breaches involve privileged credentials.1 
In December 2016, Centrify commissioned Forrester Consulting to evaluate identity and access management (IAM) practices and technology among large enterprises. Their report found that:

Two-thirds of organizations have experienced a breach in the last two years.
Increased adoption of IAM best practices correlates to a reduced likelihood of an organization experiencing a breach.
Mature organizations realize higher end-user productivity, improved transparency, and reduced findings from compliance audits.
Companies that experience fewer breaches gravitate towards an integrated platform solution for IAM technology.

This study serves as a practical guide on how enterprise companies can stop breaches in this new “threatscape” and save an average of $5 million.

The Okta Identity Cloud
We believe that organizations want choice and flexibility in defining what tools they use, and how they use them. We enable this with one integrated service, born and built in the cloud.







 


  Products for ITOur IAM products simplify and secure the way your employees connect to enterprise technology.
 
Learn more   Products for DevelopersUse our APIs and developer tools to build custom or commercial apps that are enterprise­ ready on day one.
Learn more   Product ArchitectureEvery product we offer, and every product you build on Okta is better because it is built to be highly reliable and secure.
Learn more 


 



 
Why we're better
 
The Okta Identity Cloud connects thousands of companies to thousands of pre-integrated apps and millions of devices every day. When people can securely connect to the tools they need to do their most important work – anywhere, on any device – companies are empowered to re-invent themselves and their industries.










  
Born and built in the cloud

Your employees do a lot more than sit behind a firewall. As a company that was built 100% on cloud-based technology, we’re well-suited to understand the new state of identity and to help your business securely connect anyone to anything.





                         
Connect Everything

Our ambition is to connect every person, to every application, and every device on the planet. We take care of the complex connections to technologies so that you don’t have to. Learn more ›



   
Preserve Choice

Use the best tools for your business. We're committed to remaining a neutral identity provider so you can use the collection of tools that will be most productive for your business.









   
Future Proof

We know that your business will change. We connect to everything you want to use today, but we also see it as our responsibility to connect to everything you want to use in the future. 






 
Secure

Every connection we establish and every product we offer is about making you more secure. We go to great lengths to ensure our service is inherently secure as well. Learn more ›



 

Created with Sketch.          
Centralized Reporting

Detect potential security threats and generate reports that let you know "who has access to what" that you need for compliance and to pass audits.  Learn more ›









   
Always On

Customers rely on our product, and we take that seriously. We’ve built Okta to be always available. Our Zero Downtime Architecture is 100% multitenant, stateless, and extremely redundant. Learn more ›

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Okta, Inc. IPO: What Investors Need to Know
The company recently made a successful public debut. Here’s what interested parties need to know. 











                Billy Duberstein
            

                (Dubs82)



            
            Apr 14, 2017 at 9:22PM
            
            





Investors interested in technology have had a nice surprise this year -- initial public offerings. As the trough of 2016 moves further into memory, companies such as Snap and MuleSoft have made their market debuts. On April 7, another tech unicorn went public: Okta, Inc (NASDAQ:OKTA).
The company sold 11 million shares at $17, above the projected range of $13-15,  for a market cap of 1.52 billion. The stock shot up to $23 when the market opened, and today trades above $24 -- almost double the initial projected range.  
While I'm wary of buying a stock immediately after it goes public (see: Facebook), I believe investors looking for disruptive growth should become familiar with companies early in their public life, as tech investments can often lead to big future gains (see also: Facebook).

What is Okta?
Okta was founded in 2009 to help companies to secure their businesses as corporate infrastructures increasingly move toward software, cloud, and mobile environments.
Okta's product is the Okta Identity Cloud. It allows organizations to secure company interactions even as they become more decentralized; Okta describes this phenomenon as the "dissolving of the corporate firewall." While moving from hardware-based, on-premises infrastructures to cloud, software, and mobile-based infrastructures allows companies to drive costs down and increase flexibility, it also presents security risks.
Okta solves that problem, allowing companies to secure interactions with employees, customers, and suppliers, wherever they are, in a simple, intuitive interface, without being locked in to a single application vendor. Okta's identification-as-a-service (IDaaS) is fully integrated with over 5,000 cloud, mobile, and web applications.
The company's founders, CEO Todd McKinnon and COO Freddy Kerrest, were former Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) employees. The company was also the first cloud investment by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.
Who are its customers?
Okta's S-1 filing boasts of over 3,100 customers in 185 countries. High-profile customers include Twenty-First Century Fox, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) LinkedIn, MGM Resorts, and Twilio; Okta also integrates with all the leading cloud and enterprise software vendors. The company serves businesses of all sizes, however. Okta has offices in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Australia.





How big is its market?
Okta believes its market is "at least $18 billion." This is far larger than its current revenue, which totaled $111.5 million for the nine months ended Oct. 31, 2016. The company's growth rate for the nine months ended Oct. 31 was 90%, is impressive, and non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) gross margin increased from 58% to 66%.
Still, the company remains unprofitable, as it's aggressively reinvesting in sales and technology. Net loss for the nine-month period was $65.2 million, bigger than 2015's $54.9 million loss. This is due to a doubling of research and development costs, and a 140% increase in sales and marketing expenses in the year-over-year period.
Does it have competitive advantages?
Okta touts three competitive advantages: product, ecosystem, and data network effects. For product, the company believes that as it integrates with more applications, and these applications are available to all users, Okta's platform will attain greater value. For ecosystem advantages, the company points to the number of system integrators and software vendors that have built ecosystems around Okta's security products. For data, the company notes that it collects vast amounts of information about how and where users access applications, and where security attacks originate; Okta says these proprietary insights drive future product innovation.
Okta is the only company to be named a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant IDaaS category in all three years it has existed. Dollar-based retention was also strong, at 124% for the nine months ended Oct. 31, 2016.
The combination of network effects and switching costs seems powerful, but I'm unsure exactly how resilient these advantages are. Business Insider notes that Salesforce launched a rival product called Salesforce Identity, and that CEO Marc Benioff seems to have a contentious relationship with Okta's founders. Microsoft, meanwhile, is both a customer and a competitor. A Techcrunch article asks: What if Microsoft develops its own solution, and then pulls the ubiquitous Office 365 from Okta's platform? Moreover, Okta's S-1 states that more large tech companies have made acquisitions in authentication and security products.
That being said, Okta was built from the ground up for the cloud, and is not tied to a "bundle" of other offerings, so it may be attractive for customers looking to avoid getting tied down to a single large vendor.





Investor takeaway
Today's valuation at almost $2.7 billion is roughly 15-18 times sales; that's way too expensive for me. While there is no doubt that cloud computing and cybersecurity are secular growth trends, I'm sitting on the sidelines for Okta, though watching the cloud security race with interest.

I have the pleasure of working with some of the most motivated, intelligent, and engaged team members that anyone could ask for.- There is never a sense of "working alone" or unwillingness to assist from any coworker. Truly a great team to be in!- The new employees are consistently coming in better than their predecessors. Continuing this trend will make sure the team always is the best team to work in.- The work continues to grow in complexity and for those that like to continually learn and be challenged, there is no better environment than Okta!- Salary and benefits are great, and annual reviews to keep compensation competitive are better than any other place I have worked.- Kitchens are now rotating stock with new food to keep things feeling fresh.- Growth opportunities continue to expand, with new roles and positions opening up on an increasing pace.Cons- If you aren't ready for a challenge, this may not be the place for you.- The company is growing fast. This leads to plenty of growing pains and problems, which the company is working hard to scale at the current level.- Some of the team members have a personal problem against management that they won't let go due to issues that have primarily passed before I joined the team. When prompted about issues that could be fixed, more often than not, complaints that are shared are based on a personal view that doesn't consider other coworkers or the team as a whole. Luckily, you'll find that these tend to be a small minority of the group, and the newer employees are both very satisfied and engaged in their roles, actively working towards creating a better work environment.Advice to Management- You are doing a great job growing at this speed!- Make sure that you keep a close eye on manager to employee ratio, as the US team is headed towards a situation where employees may not be able to get enough one-on-one time because the managers are too overloaded.- Support team has lost some fantastic talent due to feeling slighted or unfairly treated. Some people see the management as unwilling to change or make things fair for all employees. Make sure these individual problems are addressed and that each employee feels that their concerns are understood, and continue to work with them towards amicable solutions. Not everyone feels this way, but the fact that there are some that do should be an indicator that more attention is needed in this area.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Okta Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Okta 2017-07-12 08:10 PDT Jul 14, 2017"This is the place you WANT to work"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Senior Technical Support Engineer in San Francisco, CACurrent Employee - Senior Technical Support Engineer in San Francisco, CARecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Okta full-time (More than a year)ProsNearly unlimited advancement potentialGroup works together as a unitManagement pays attention and caresConsWorkload.

Expectations are not laid out and communicated clearly by management and are therefore unreachable by anything other than sheer accident. Annual reviews are based on 2 month periods. Assistance is never given regardless of how many times it's asked for, in fact asking for help can be detrimental to your work experience. Lack of communication and ownership means senior staff are often having to work multiple positions. Promotions are cosmetic and the job never, ever changes - they just add more stuff on until you leave.Advice to ManagementNothing.

Working hard here is not rewarded but having connections and kissing up to people is. There is a huge clique mentality going on and if you don't belong to any cliques expect to not be recognized or rewarded for any hard work you do. The executive team is too busy trying to make sure we look "cool" so I am not really sure where this company is heading. I really regret letting them talk me into joining Okta and leaving my previous company which I actually enjoyed working for.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Okta Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Okta 2017-07-26 21:23 PDT Showing 247 of 254 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious12345NextReviews > Okta RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountReviews by Job TitleSales (20) Account Executive (9) Software Engineer (8) Senior Technical Support Engineer (6) Sales Development Representative (5) Senior Software Engineer (5) Senior Customer Success Manager (4) Regional Sales Manager (4) Marketing (3) Director (3) Technical Engagement Manager (2) Software Engineering Intern (2) Professional Services (2) Senior Technical Instructor (2) Sales Engineer (2) Show MoreShow LessCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompanies to ExploreOkta PhotosSee All PhotosSee AllView Allnum of numClose (Esc) Company BenefitsWork From HomeHealth InsuranceVacation & Paid Time Off401K PlanJob TrainingAdd BenefitsSee AllSee All Job Seekers Also ViewedOneLogin ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 86 ReviewsSalesforce ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 3,174 ReviewsMuleSoft ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 162 ReviewsTwilio ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 79 ReviewsFitbit ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 167 ReviewsZendesk ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 270 ReviewsSquare ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 354 ReviewsPing Identity ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 79 ReviewsAmazon ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 15,886 ReviewsAppDynamics ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 216 ReviewsWorkday ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 735 ReviewsZenefits ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 426 Reviews Related Job SearchSoftware Engineer jobsSoftware Engineer salaries ($84k)Senior Software Engineer jobsSenior Software Engineer salaries ($110k)Sales Development Representative jobsSales Development Representative salaries ($41k)Account Executive jobsAccount Executive salaries ($47k)Sales jobsSales salaries ($52k)Intern jobsIntern salaries ($33k)Software Engineer Intern jobsSoftware Engineer Intern salaries ($91k)Software Engineer New Grad jobsSoftware Engineer New Grad salaries ($110k)Marketing jobsMarketing salaries ($60k)Product Manager jobsProduct Manager salaries ($103k)Director jobsDirector salaries ($137k)Customer Success Manager jobsCustomer Success Manager salaries ($67k)Senior Technical Support Engineer jobsSenior Technical Support Engineer salaries ($90k)Software Engineering Intern jobsSoftware Engineering Intern salaries ($94k)Senior Software Engineer In Test jobsSenior Software Engineer In Test salaries ($135k)Executive Assistant jobsExecutive Assistant salaries ($55k)Interested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.

Rethink Security: A Massive Paradigm Shift in the Age of Access


 


 








 


Today's security is not secure.
It’s time for a massive rethink in security. In 2016 over $75B was spent on cyber security, and yet the number of breaches skyrocketed to 4.2 billion incidents. Minimizing an organization’s attack surface as its network continues to expand requires a paradigm shift in security strategy. The traditional approach to cyber security is not secure against breaches.
To protect organizations from data breaches and financial ruin, a massive rethink of security strategy is required. Read this eBook, "Rethink Security: A Massive Paradigm Shift in the Age of Access," to understand the changing cyber security landscape and, more importantly, how to keep your company’s information safe in the face of it.

2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant for IDaaS

















































 


Gartner’s 2016 Magic Quadrant for Identity and Access Management as a Service (IDaaS)


Understand Vendor Strengths, Cautions, and Trends Shaping the IDaaS Market


 


 








 


Today’s identity and access market is fragmented, poorly integrated, and focused too narrowly on single parts. With identity at the center of most cyber attacks, traditional network security fails to fully protect the expanded security perimeter for today's modern enterprise.
This Magic Quadrant rates vendors on their ability to be global, general-purpose identity and access management (IAM) service providers for multiple use cases. The vendors in this Magic Quadrant must provide some level of functionality in all of the following IAM functional areas: Identity Governance and Administration, Access, and Identity log monitoring and reporting.1
Get the full complementary report and learn why Centrify is a Leader in this Magic Quadrant.

                        STOP THE BREACH
                    

 


Forrester™


 








 


Reduce the Likelihood of an Attack Through an IAM Maturity Model
Forrester estimates that 80% of security breaches involve privileged credentials.1 
In December 2016, Centrify commissioned Forrester Consulting to evaluate identity and access management (IAM) practices and technology among large enterprises. Their report found that:

Two-thirds of organizations have experienced a breach in the last two years.
Increased adoption of IAM best practices correlates to a reduced likelihood of an organization experiencing a breach.
Mature organizations realize higher end-user productivity, improved transparency, and reduced findings from compliance audits.
Companies that experience fewer breaches gravitate towards an integrated platform solution for IAM technology.

This study serves as a practical guide on how enterprise companies can stop breaches in this new “threatscape” and save an average of $5 million.

Rethink Security: A Massive Paradigm Shift in the Age of Access


 


 








 


Today's security is not secure.
It’s time for a massive rethink in security. In 2016 over $75B was spent on cyber security, and yet the number of breaches skyrocketed to 4.2 billion incidents. Minimizing an organization’s attack surface as its network continues to expand requires a paradigm shift in security strategy. The traditional approach to cyber security is not secure against breaches.
To protect organizations from data breaches and financial ruin, a massive rethink of security strategy is required. Read this eBook, "Rethink Security: A Massive Paradigm Shift in the Age of Access," to understand the changing cyber security landscape and, more importantly, how to keep your company’s information safe in the face of it.
