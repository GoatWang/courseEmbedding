Home / Why Homrich Berg / Firm Profile 






Firm Profile


History
Homrich Berg was founded in 1989 in Atlanta by Andy Berg and David Homrich to fill an emerging need in the financial services industry — individualized and unbiased wealth management services for families, individuals and not-for-profit organizations.  With a core belief that investors deserve unbiased advice (and a loan from Andy’s father), HB was formed to provide comprehensive financial planning and investment advisory services on an independent, fee-only basis. Understanding that trust, integrity and confidentiality are essential in providing clear counsel to people, HB has worked diligently to create and maintain excellent client service for its clients.  In spring 2008, HB opened its second office in Atlanta to accommodate its growing presence in northern Atlanta communities, and in 2013 HB expanded again with the addition of its Northcreek office.
Values
We are Objective. Our clients’ interests guide everything we do.  We are of high Integrity and are passionate about our firm and profession.  We strive for Excellence.  Nothing short of this is acceptable.  Diligence is key in our complex and evolving profession.  We rely upon Teamwork. We work together to accomplish a shared mission for our clients, our firm and one another.  We build relationships on a foundation of Trust.  Trust is built by living these values.
Clients
Homrich Berg serves more than 1000 diverse family relationships nationwide in 40 states, managing over $4 billion in assets. Our client base is primarily made up of corporate executives, entrepreneurs, families, family trusts and foundations, and not-for-profit institutions.  Our client retention rate is 98%.  Our clients come to us at various stages in their life – marriage, divorce, inheritance, retirement, sale of a business, becoming a partner, having children, losing a spouse, deciding not to “do it themselves” anymore, you name it – we have a wide range of client relationships and have experience dealing with the unique situations each new client brings to HB.
Team
To best serve each relationship, Homrich Berg pulls from the strengths of each of its more than 80 employees. Each client service team typically includes three to four team members: a principal, a director or senior associate, an associate and a client care coordinator. Tied to our commitment to providing both planning and investments expertise, most of our client service professionals are either CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER  certificants and/or Chartered Financial Analyst charterholders, and we also have a number of Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) on our team.  All of the members of the team have experience serving families and bring a wealth of expertise from handling a wide variety of situations.
Custodians
Homrich Berg uses independent third-party custodians to hold client assets. This allows clients to always have another source for verifying their assets outside of HB reports. Our primary custodian relationships are with Charles Schwab and Fidelity. We routinely work with new clients to transfer assets seamlessly from other custodians or advisors and handle all of the paperwork to ensure a smooth transition.

What We Do For You





Homrich Berg brings a comprehensive approach to wealth management, combining our expertise in investment management and financial planning to answer key financial questions facing our clients as they seek to achieve their unique goals.
Investment Management How should my assets be invested?  How much risk should I take?  What returns do I really need to achieve my goals?  What about alternative investments?  Are active managers worth it?
How should my assets be invested?  How much risk should I take?  What returns do I really need to achieve my goals?  What about alternative investments?  Are active managers worth it?
We work with you to translate your financial planning goals and long-term cash flow analysis into an investment plan designed to put you on the track toward your unique goals. The Homrich Berg Investment Committee, with over 150 years of combined wealth management experience, debates key investment strategy issues and recommends changes for investment strategies.  The conversation starts with asset allocation and then moves to active vs. passive, manager selection, and monitoring.  These biweekly meetings are the culmination of the ongoing processes that drive the investment policies of the firm.
HB has a dedicated internal investments team (not outsourced) led by our Chief Investment Officer that focuses on providing updates to the firm and clients on each asset class and the key issues affecting portfolios.  The firm also provides commentaries and updates on portfolio allocation movements to clients.
In addition to traditional investments in each asset class, many families utilize alternative investments (funds and strategies generally not always available to the average retail investor) to pursue additional diversification and potentially superior returns.  HB has staff dedicated to sourcing, analyzing, and performing due diligence related to traditional and alternative investments.  Our status as a firm managing over $4 billion in assets helps us gain access to offerings from the institutional brand names as well as smaller niche players.  We often push down the fees and/or minimum investment levels for these investments, and in some cases create pooled access fund vehicles to allow investors access to a diversified portfolio of alternative investments with, of course, no additional fee paid to HB.
So what does this mean for your portfolio and how we manage risks for you?  Your HB client service team will translate the firm’s investment perspectives to provide an investment strategy that can be aligned with your goals, your tolerance for risk, and our outlook for the financial markets.  Over time we will discuss the portfolio performance with you and discuss how your changing financial situation and plan goals may lead to potential changes in your investment strategy.
We always emphasize diversification as a critical part of managing risk.  From our experience we believe that wealth is often created or lost by being highly concentrated – and preserved by being diversified.  Correlations between asset types and individual investments are evaluated as part of the overall portfolio strategy in order to manage volatility risk via diversification.  We measure performance against benchmarks both on total return and volatility, with a goal of providing higher returns and less volatility.  HB has a long history of using a wide range of investments beyond basic stocks and bonds in order to achieve client goals. Rebalancing is also a key risk management tool, and rebalancing of portfolios is managed on an ongoing basis with the aid of our internal software that monitors each allocation weight.Financial Planning How much money do I need to retire?  How much risk do I need to take to potentially reach my goals?  How do I maximize my income and minimize my taxes?  How do I figure out how to pass wealth down to future generations?  As you read through the details of our services you will likely have many questions, and the good news is that we are ready to help you with the answers to your financial questions.
How much money do I need to retire?  How much risk do I need to take to potentially reach my goals?  How do I maximize my income and minimize my taxes?  How do I figure out how to pass wealth down to future generations?  As you read through the details of our services you will likely have many questions, and the good news is that we are ready to help you with the answers to your financial questions.
We believe in the importance of starting with financial planning.  This planning may incorporate lifetime cash flow analysis, investment planning, tax planning, risk management, and estate planning elements.  We combine this information into an overall cash flow analysis that can then be used to test different investment approaches initially, and will also be updated over time as your situation and the investment environment changes.
In the simplest view, a family can do four things with its money now and in the future:

Spend it on their lifestyle
Give it away to people and charities
Leave it to future generations
Let the government have a large portion of it as tax revenue

Our objective is to understand and develop your family’s goals around the first three options and then minimize the fourth option as much as possible.
It is important to remember that success is not always defined by maximizing your investment returns. Your family financial plan involves complex choices related to risk tolerance, time horizons, liquidity needs, tax implications, generational transfer desires, cash flow needs, and philanthropy goals. Homrich Berg works with you to construct the financial plan customized to fit your goals and needs.Consolidated Online Reporting How much have my investments grown this year?  Which managers are doing well vs. their benchmarks?  What does my overall asset allocation look like?  How much income has my portfolio produced this year?  Homrich Berg offers the ability to answer all of these questions and more via HB Online, our consolidated interactive reporting system available to clients 24/7 without having to wait for a quarterly report or monthly statement.How much have my investments grown this year?  Which managers are doing well vs. their benchmarks?  What does my overall asset allocation look like?  How much income has my portfolio produced this year?  Homrich Berg offers the ability to answer all of these questions and more via HB Online, our consolidated interactive reporting system available to clients 24/7 without having to wait for a quarterly report or monthly statement.
Access is available via the Internet or an iPad application.  Standard consolidated reports combine information from all advisors and sources, including liquid and illiquid investments and performance and indices for comparison. Clients can view their current balances, historical performance, asset allocation, and comparison to relevant benchmarks all in one place.  Additional more detailed reports can also be provided to clients outside of the online system. Traditional printed quarterly reports are also available for clients who choose to receive them, and are also posted to the home page for the client to be reviewed any time.Tax Planning What is my marginal tax rate?  What is the best way to set up my investments in my taxable and tax-exempt accounts in order to minimize the tax impact?  How much can I avoid future estate taxes?What is my marginal tax rate?  What is the best way to set up my investments in my taxable and tax-exempt accounts in order to minimize the tax impact?  How much can I avoid future estate taxes?
Navigating the world of tax strategies and compliance is an important part of your overall financial plan. Income and estate tax considerations impact the planning process. Homrich Berg develops investment and estate planning strategies that factor both investment and non-investment income sources and their tax implications. We coordinate closely with your CPA to implement strategies and provide important information for the timely preparation of your tax returns.Insurance Planning If something bad happens to be me tomorrow, will my family be okay?  What if I get sick and cannot work?  This insurance agent I know keeps pitching me a lot of ideas – which of these things do I really need, and how much? How else can I protect my assets?If something bad happens to be me tomorrow, will my family be okay?  What if I get sick and cannot work?  This insurance agent I know keeps pitching me a lot of ideas – which of these things do I really need, and how much? How else can I protect my assets?
Managing risk for your family and your property is a necessary part of the overall financial plan.  Our team has experience and expertise working with various insurance providers to seek the best solution for you, including the first step of discussing whether you feel your insurance is already sufficient.  As always, our advice is completely objective and independent with no financial incentives involved in choosing providers or solutions, because as a fee only advisor we do not sell insurance or accept referral fees.  We can help you sort out the different options and decide what approaches make the most sense for you and your family. We can also help you explore other asset protection strategies as appropriate.Estate Planning What is the best way to achieve my long term goals for passing wealth to my spouse and/or future generations?  How can we most effectively meet our philanthropic goals?  We did some estate planning a long time ago – is it still set up the right way to achieve our goals now that our assets have grown and the laws have changed?  What are the different ways I can try to avoid estate taxes?What is the best way to achieve my long term goals for passing wealth to my spouse and/or future generations?  How can we most effectively meet our philanthropic goals?  We did some estate planning a long time ago – is it still set up the right way to achieve our goals now that our assets have grown and the laws have changed?  What are the different ways I can try to avoid estate taxes?
We work with your attorneys or recommend specialists to work with you as we assess your current situation and create new approaches to meet changing needs and regulatory requirements.  We have the expertise to help you wade through all of the acronyms and strategies in order to understand the approach best suited for your family. If appropriate, we can also assist you with managing the appropriate trustee services related to the entities created or already in place.Retirement Planning How much money do I need to retire?  How long will my current investment capital last given the forecast for market returns and my risk tolerance?  How do I decide when to start Social Security benefits?  Should I be using a regular IRA or a Roth IRA?  What are my options for setting up a retirement plan at my new company?How much money do I need to retire?  How long will my current investment capital last given the forecast for market returns and my risk tolerance?  How do I decide when to start Social Security benefits?  Should I be using a regular IRA or a Roth IRA?  What are my options for setting up a retirement plan at my new company?
There are many unique questions that we help clients deal with when it comes preparing for retirement.  We act as the guide for the family, whether it is helping a younger client set the right goals for their future or helping an older client adjust to the beginning of retirement from their career.Education Planning How do I plan for the future college costs of my children?

For our clients with younger children or grandchildren these are all critical questions where having an advisor is a wonderful benefit.  We help you figure out these answers and ensure that your financial plan includes the steps needed to reach your goals.Foundations We want to maximize the returns of our foundation assets, but worry about a one size fits all foundation consultant pushing us into a standard model – do we have any other options?  We want access to some alternative investments for our foundation, but worry about someone pitching us products – is there a firm with institutional quality access but an unbiased approach?We want to maximize the returns of our foundation assets, but worry about a one size fits all foundation consultant pushing us into a standard model – do we have any other options?  We want access to some alternative investments for our foundation, but worry about someone pitching us products – is there a firm with institutional quality access but an unbiased approach?
Homrich Berg can apply the investments expertise and access of a firm managing over $4 billion in assets for your foundation, customizing a portfolio strategy to align with your goals.  We can help translate the jargon and complexities of the investment world for the staff and board of your foundation as you work to be good stewards of the foundation assets.Family Office Some families need additional services beyond what Homrich Berg normally provides to most of our clients.  These family office services can go beyond our regular comprehensive wealth management offerings in order to include bill pay services, management of multiple houses and boats and aircraft, and unique family governance and family education services.Some families need additional services beyond what Homrich Berg normally provides to most of our clients.  These family office services can go beyond our regular comprehensive wealth management offerings in order to include bill pay services, management of multiple houses and boats and aircraft, and unique family governance and family education services.
Many firms claim to be a “multi-family office” firm but may not have the true experience serving families at this depth of assistance.  The key is not a certain level of assets, but an appreciation for this extra level of service.  Some professional athletes value our ability to help them manage their lives administratively while they are out living on the road.  Some families with multiple houses across the country value our ability to help manage the details and bills so that they can enjoy their life without worry.  Some families with younger children want assistance with family meetings and education for their children to prepare them for the day in the future when they will inherit significant wealth.  For some families our Homrich Berg Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (CIO) approach is the best fit, where HB can help by advising the family regarding all of their various managers and strategies inside and outside of HB. Every family office story is unique.  We encourage you to learn more about our family office services by reading our Family Office brochure and visiting our HB Family Office website.

How to Select an Advisor


Selecting a financial advisor is a very important decision.  Every client has a unique situation and needs, but there are some good basic questions that you should consider when talking to potential advisors.  We have provided our answers to these questions here, and we encourage you to talk more with us about these questions, or any others you may have.
COMPENSATION AND CONFLICTS
Will you manage my assets using the fiduciary or suitability standard? Homrich Berg operates under the fiduciary standard, meaning that we must put your interests first, period.
Homrich Berg operates under the fiduciary standard, meaning that we must put your interests first, period.  Many brokers only operate under the suitability standard, meaning that they can recommend an investment and accept financial incentives for that investment from the manager as long as the recommendation they are making is “suitable” for you (not necessarily in your best interest, but suitable). This is a huge distinction that many people do not realize, and we believe this is one key reason many longtime clients of brokerage firms and banks consider moving to a fiduciary independent advisor.
Are you ''fee only'' or just ''fee based''? What about commissions or other payments? Homrich Berg is fee only, not fee based.  We are only paid by our clients.
Homrich Berg is fee only, not fee based.  We are only paid by our clients.  Most clients pay a fee calculated as a percentage of the assets we manage.  Some firms charge fees in a similar way…but then also collect commissions, mutual fund fees, incentive fees, or other side payments from other business services, leading them to call themselves “fee-based.”  Some brokerage firms will try to tell you that their service “is not as expensive as those independent firms where you have to pay a fee” but they do not tell you that can often end up paying even more in commissions and mutual fund fees and hidden incentive payments – but you may not see that number anywhere on your monthly statements.
Does your firm sell products or services besides wealth management? Some firms sell insurance, mortgages, accounting services, estate planning legal services, and/or investment banking services.
Some firms sell insurance, mortgages, accounting services, estate planning legal services, and/or investment banking services.  Homrich Berg does none of the above. We believe this makes it easier for us to be your unbiased advisor across all parts of your financial life.

BASIC FIRM INFORMATION
Does your firm offer investment management AND financial planning expertise? Some firms focus mostly on planning as their true focus area, while other firms are mostly asset managers focused on investments but not really helping their clients with their entire financial life.
Some firms focus mostly on planning as their true focus area, while other firms are mostly asset managers focused on investments but not really helping their clients with their entire financial life.  Homrich Berg believes in the importance of combining both into one complete level of service for our clients, and invests in building our expertise in both areas.
What credentials do your people have? In our view the two most critical certifications are the CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER TM certification and Chartered Financial Analyst® certification.
In our view the two most critical certifications are the CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER  certification and Chartered Financial Analyst® certification.  CFP  certificants have completed university level financial planning courses and have passed a lengthy exam covering over 80 planning-related topics.  You can learn more at www.cfp.net.  CFA charterholders must pass three separate full day exams focused on a wide range of investment related topics, each of which demands a minimum of 250 hours of study per the CFA Institute.  Learn more at www.cfainstitute.org.  We also have many Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) on our staff  who bring the rigor and focus of their background to their client work.
Do you provide a disclosure annually to the SEC? Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) like Homrich Berg must file a Form ADV with the SEC each year. 
Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) like Homrich Berg must file a Form ADV with the SEC each year.  You can search for the ADV of an advisor at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov.  Form ADV Part 1 online describes the firm’s services, how many financial assets they manage, their compensation, disciplinary history, and other operations details.  Form ADV Part 2 is what the advisor is required to give you as a prospect (we include one in every set of brochure materials for a potential new client meeting).  Part 2 provides more information about the services, investment strategies, fees, and potential conflicts for the firm.
How long has your firm existed? Are you going to be there for me and my family in the future? Homrich Berg has been helping clients for 25+ years and has a strong succession plan in place with a large staff that ensures continuity over time for your family.
Homrich Berg has been helping clients for 25+ years and has a strong succession plan in place with a large staff that ensures continuity over time for your family.  Some firms have only been around a few years, or have teams of people who have jumped around from firm to firm over time.  We believe our long-term financial strength and growth through many ups and downs of the financial markets should give you comfort in our ability to work with your family for many years to come.
Who owns your firm? HB is owned by its principals. We feel this independence allows us to focus on you as clients with our long-term strategy and investments.
HB is owned by its principals. We feel this independence allows us to focus on you as clients with our long-term strategy and investments.

INVESTMENTS APPROACH
What is your approach to investing? This is a lengthy discussion, and we have a brochure solely focused on this topic.
This is a lengthy discussion, and we have a brochure solely focused on this topic.  Key areas you should discuss with your potential advisor should include their thoughts on diversification, asset allocation, manager selection, active vs. passive strategies, manager monitoring, rebalancing, and risk management.  Who is making the investment decisions and how often do they meet?  How do they define investment success?  How do they handle the ups and downs of financial markets?  How do they judge whether they are successful or not?  Do they focus on tax implications and estate implications when building your plan?  This is a good topic to spend some time reviewing in detail with your potential advisor.
Does your firm have a dedicated investments staff? Many firms have their principals also doing the investment strategy.
Many firms have their principals also doing the investment strategy.  At HB we have a dedicated investment staff focused solely on investments research every day, not on serving clients.  But we mix in the client perspective and the experience of our partners by having both groups on our Investment Committee that makes our investment decisions.
Do you use a third party custodian? This is a critical question that should always be asked.  Most independent firms like Homrich Berg will use a third party custodian like Charles Schwab or Fidelity.
This is a critical question that should always be asked.  Most independent firms like Homrich Berg will use a third party custodian like Charles Schwab or Fidelity.  This provides you as the client an independent way to verify your assets outside of reports from your advisor.

THE CLIENT RELATIONSHIP
Can you show me a consolidated performance report for all my investments? Some firms will send you monthly or quarterly account balance information, but not true total return performance data.
Some firms will send you monthly or quarterly account balance information, but not true total return performance data.  Other firms may give you an overall portfolio view, but no details on how individual managers or funds are performing vs. benchmarks or what is driving your overall performance.  HB gives you online access to your entire portfolio at any time with updated values net of fees and expenses.
Who will work with me? How big will my client service team be? At HB you will typically have 3-4 people on your client service team, and the culture of our firm is for the entire firm to serve you as a client.
At HB you will typically have 3-4 people on your client service team, and the culture of our firm is for the entire firm to serve you as a client.  Some firms with sales oriented cultures do not really share ideas between teams and may be financially motivated not to get more people involved in serving you as a client.  That is not our approach – we believe in a team approach.
Will I feel comfortable with your team? Personal fit is important to us and we try to align our new clients with the best potential fit for their personality and needs among our HB team members.
Personal fit is important to us and we try to align our new clients with the best potential fit for their personality and needs among our HB team members.  We feel our 98% retention rate speaks to the success of our focus on service and fit.
Will you work well with my other advisors? As an independent firm not offering other services, we are comfortable working with your existing attorneys, accountants, insurance advisors, and other key members of your overall advisory team.
As an independent firm not offering other services, we are comfortable working with your existing attorneys, accountants, insurance advisors, and other key members of your overall advisory team.  When appropriate we can help you find a new advisor if you are not pleased with their service, but we have no financial incentive to steer you to a particular firm or individual.  We serve as the leader of your financial team and work to keep everyone informed to help achieve your goals.
Can your firm grow with me over time? Some firms specialize only in small clients or large clients.
Some firms specialize only in small clients or large clients.  HB serves clients from under $500,000 in assets to over $100 million.  We have the ability to handle the complexity of your financial life no matter where you end up on that spectrum.

                Shoestring start: David Homrich, left, and Andy Berg turned a $100,000 loan into a wealth… more 

                JOANN VITELLI            








 



Introduced to each other in 1985, Andy Berg and David Homrich formed an alliance that ultimately led to creation of a successful wealth management firm, now one of Atlanta’s leading names in the business.
Homrich Berg (HB) started on a shoestring in 1989, with Berg’s father providing a $100,000 loan. The founders worked out of boxes at first, developing a client base and working on paying back the loan and earning their own livings. Much to their surprise, HB exceeded its business goals year-over-year and attracted clients by tailoring financial plans and strategies to their specific needs. Today, HB’s clients include some of Atlanta’s wealthiest and most private families.

“The exception here is the high quality and the general rule is that this industry is pretty rogue and pretty loud,” said W. Cliff Oxford, founder and CEO of entrepreneurial education company Entrepreneur Advisors Inc. Homrich Berg sponsors EA’s educational events. “Both Andy and David were CPAs that transitioned to wealth managers, so you see that discipline of a CPA firm, but you see the innovation of an entrepreneurial company.”
Built on the ideal that clients’ needs come first, Homrich Berg’s (HB) corporate culture and stable values have helped it continue to thrive over the past two decades — despite changes along the way. That foundation has also helped them earn the trust of some of Atlanta’s most important business leaders such as The Home Depot Inc. co-founder and Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank. Blank became a client of the firm in 1989 while serving as president and chief operating officer of Home Depot.
“They earned my trust,” Blank said. “I like the quality of their services and the fact that they are always reliable — I can count on them. In addition, they provide thoughtful analysis. They understand me and my goals.”




Today, HB has grown from managing less than $10 million assets in its early years to approximately $2.1 billion. The company ranks first on Atlanta Business Chronicle’s 2010-2011 list of the top 10 National Association of Personal Financial Advisors fee-only investment advisers, and 11th on the top 25 list of financial planning and advisory firms. With clients in 36 states, the firm has stayed true to its founding mission of providing objective, fee-only financial planning and investment management services without relying on the sale of financial products for commissions.

“There were plenty of firms out there that were offering financial planning and investment advice, but it was all tied to the sale of financial products and therefore there was an inherent conflict of interest,” Homrich said. “We felt that there would be an opportunity to build a successful company where we sat on the same side of the table as the client.”
Because HB works with clients on a fee-only basis and doesn’t generate com-missions through product sales, its success “really depends on the increase of value of assets of clients and making sure they are well taken care of,” said William “Bill” Rich, an estate planning attorney and partner with Holland and Knight, who has been referring clients to HB since the mid-’90s.
Blank was so satisfied with HB’s service, that when he left The Home Depot in 2001 and established his family office, he asked Homrich to join him and preside over his finance and investment matters.
“As we were building AMB Group — our investment management and support services company and now the parent company of our operating businesses — I wanted the company’s foundation to be built with the ‘best.’ David is that,” Blank said. “Beyond his expertise and talents, our relationship while he was at Homrich Berg was built on trust and understanding.”
In the summer of 2001, in one of the most difficult decisions Homrich said he’s ever made, he decided to leave the company he and Berg founded, just as it was beginning to flourish.




 


“We’d just gotten about $500 million under management, we were building the business nicely and the future looked very bright,” Homrich said. “In the end I was very much attracted to the idea of joining forces with Arthur and seeing what I could help the Blank family build.”
Today, five partners, including Berg, own HB. Despite the exit of his business partner, Berg credits much of the company’s success to the foundation laid by Homrich in the early years.
“I think the heavy lifting was done in those early years and we just kind of took it from there,” Berg said. “It was a very friendly parting and [Homrich] and I are still close friends and we still do work for not only Arthur, but for many members of Arthur’s family.”
Maintaining strong relationships, whether it’s with clients or former partners, is part of HB’s corporate culture. With clients, these relationships involve assisting them with financial planning and investment needs throughout their life. HB works in tandem with clients’ accountants, estate attorneys, mortgage brokers or bankers to ensure a client’s financial goals are fulfilled.

Hirsch, of counsel in the Atlanta office of Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz P.C., whose practice focuses on real estate investment trusts, securities law and commercial transactions, has referred people to Homrich Berg. “All their clients feel that they are getting one-on-one attention,” Hirsch said.
Individual, customized service is important to high-net-worth clients interested in preserving and growing wealth, said Michael Smith, shareholder in Baker Donelson’s Atlanta office, who concentrates on tax and corporate law.
“For this firm, and some other ones, the source of the income is either from wealthy families that have multi-generations of wealth they are trying to preserve and invest and other sources are from people that have become successful in business,” Smith said. “They get a large sum of money when they sell their business and they like to diversify.”
As a client since 2005, businessman Charlie Yates sits on HB’s client advisory board. While HB does a good job managing client requests, Yates said the strategic framework and support for clients is HB’s ultimate strength.
“They are very good on the investment side, but they are even better at making sure they understand your situation and customizing your investment program based on your personal needs, your personal risk profile and they give great service to help manage affairs,” Yates said.
Despite its strength, HB, like many others, felt the pain of the recession. Rather than altering its business strategy during tough times, however, HB stayed the course and focused on being even more communicative with clients during the downturn. In the end, Berg said the recession helped strengthen the firm’s client relationships.
“We had conviction in our asset allocation and were committed not to change course. In the end, that strategy benefited our clients,” Berg said.
HB should be able to continue to grow through client referrals, Homrich said.
“I think they are in a very good spot and I think they will continue to do well as long as they continue to remain focused on taking care of the client and client’s needs ahead of their own,” he said.
