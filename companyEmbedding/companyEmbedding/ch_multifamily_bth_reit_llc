Ella Shaw Neyland, of Steadfast Income REIT
Fresh off the success of its first multi-family REIT, Steadfast REIT Investments L.L.C. is launching its second, Steadfast Apartment REIT, Inc., and beginning an initial public offering of $1.1 billion in common stock for the new REIT.
Steadfast Apartment REIT, Inc., is offering up to $1 billion in shares of its common stock for sale at $15 per share and up to an additional $100 million in shares of its common stock under its distribution reinvestment plan at $14.25 per share, according to a news release.
The Irvine, Calif.,-based REIT intends to use the proceeds from the continuous IPO to acquire and operate “a diverse portfolio of well-positioned, institutional-quality apartment communities in targeted markets throughout the United States that have demonstrated high occupancy and income levels across market cycles,” according to the REIT’s release.
An affiliate of the Steadfast Cos., Steadfast REIT Investments is the sponsor of Steadfast Apartment REIT and the first multi-family REIT – Steadfast Income REIT, Inc. Steadfast Capital Markets Group, the securities and financial services division of Steadfast Companies, is the deal manager and will distribute the product through retail broker-dealers and investment advisors.
Steadfast Income REIT closed to new investors on Dec. 20, 2013. As of Dec. 31, the REIT’s portfolio included 63 properties acquired for more than $1.5 billion, a Steadfast spokesperson told Commercial Property Executive. The REIT had nearly 16,000 units in 11 Midwestern and Southern states, the spokesperson added.
The REIT had been active in Texas, Alabama, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, Ohio and Tennessee.
In November, Steadfast Income REIT acquired a six-property portfolio in Houston that consisted of 1,692 units. The price was not disclosed for those assets but the REIT had paid $97 million for apartment communities in Houston, Dallas and Nashville in October.
Ella Shaw Neyland, president of Steadfast Income REIT, told CPE in a recent interview the firm preferred to focus on the central corridor of the United States rather than go after assets in higher-priced coastal communities or urban infill locations. Neyland said the REIT seeks multi-family communities in locations that have above-average job growth, limited new construction, good quality of life, and a strong local and diversified economy.
The new Steadfast Apartment REIT intends to follow a similar strategy, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC document also noted that Steadfast Apartment REIT plans to execute a “value-enhancement” strategy with about 30 to 40 percent of its portfolio. Those properties would be under-managed assets in high-demand neighborhoods that Steadfast would invest capital and reposition for better rents and resale values, the SEC filing stated.
“Although our primary focus will be the acquisition of multi-family properties, we may also selectively acquire debt collaterized by multi-family properties and securities of other companies owning multi-family properties, which we collectively refer to as real estate-related assets,” the REIT added in the SEC document.

Multifamily Investment Property 
						Classifications




						Crefcoa provides multifamily housing and apartment loans 
						where the building is classified as “A”, “B”, and “C” as 
						long as they are acceptable to Lender in both physical 
						condition and market attributes. The building 
						classifications are as follow and may vary from market 
						to market.
























						Multifamily Property 
						Classifications Overview






Class A 
								Multifamily



Generally, garden product built within 
									the last 10 years
Properties with a physical age greater 
									than 10 years but have been substantially 
									renovated
High-rise product in select Central 
									Business District may be over 20 years old
Commands rents within the range of Class 
									“A” rents in the submarket
Well merchandised with landscaping, 
									attractive rental office and/or club 
									building
High-end exterior and interior amenities 
									as dictated by other Class “A” products in 
									the market
High quality construction with highest 
									quality materials




Class B Multifamily



Generally, product built within the last 
									20 years
Exterior and interior amenity package is 
									dated and less than what is offered by 
									properties in the high end of the market
Good quality construction with little 
									deferred maintenance
Commands rents within the range of Class 
									“B” rents in the submarket




Class C Multifamily




Generally, product built within the last 
									30 years
Limited, dated exterior and interior 
									amenity package
Improvements show some age and deferred 
									maintenance
Commands rents below Class “B” rents in 
									submarket
Majority of appliances are “original"




Class D Multifamily




Generally, product over 30 years old, 
									worn properties, operationally more 
									transient, situated in fringe or mediocre 
									locations
Shorter remaining economic lives for the 
									system components
No amenity package offered
Marginal construction quality and 
									condition
Lower side of the market unit rent 
									range, coupled with intensive use of the 
									property (turnover and density of use) 
									combine to constrain budget for operations



























What You Need to Know



Class A assets -- and Class B 
						assets located in major markets -- typically command 
						more interest from lenders. Life companies, pensions, 
						REITs, agency lenders and conduits aggressively pursue 
						Class A assets. As a result, you can expect:
More financing options
Lower rates
Longer fixed rate terms and amortizations
Higher leverage (up to 80% with options for 
							mezzanine debt or equity)
Asset is primary source of collateral with no 
							personal guarantees (non-recourse)
Lower debt service coverage requirements (as low 
							as 1.15:1)
Depending on the market, CAP rates in the 4%-6% 
							range

 
Class B and C assets lose some interest 
						from institutional investors and borrowers typically 
						obtain financing from banks, agency lenders and specific 
						purpose REITs. As a result, you can expect:

Fewer financing options
Slightly higher rates
Fixed rate with balloon terms or 5 year resets
75% leverage with no option for secondary debt
Non-recourse for assets located in major markets
Recourse for assets located in secondary and 
							tertiary markets
Depending on the market, CAP rates in the 6%-8% 
							range

 
Class C and D assets tend to be 
						financed by local banks with little to no interest from 
						secondary market lenders. As a result, you can expect:

Limited financing options
Rates 100-200 bps higher than higher quality 
							assets
Shorter fixed or floating rate terms
65% (75% for strong sponsors in major markets) 
							leverage with no option for secondary debt
Personal recourse
Depending on the market, CAP rates north of 8%
