				PCB Materials			






Advanced technologies implemented in the PCB industry demand highest quality and efficiency. Improving both yield and quality of parts and products are essential in this highly technological industry.   EVS brings to the PCB industry the world’s leading technology of Automated Optical Inspection (AOI). Our inspection and monitoring solutions can help PCB manufacturers to achieve products of the highest quality while reducing their production costs.




The Inspection Process
EVS AOI quality inspection systems for PCB materials can be implemented at various stages and processes:

Weaving to finish process of the glass fabric production, including:

Beam preparation of the warp (vertical) yarn before weaving
Sizing: coating the warp yarn with organic material for protection during the weaving process
Weaving process, with On Loom Inspection
De-sizing, removal of the organic material
Finishing process


Prepreg - coating the glass fabric with epoxy resin for lamination and isolation
Production of copper foil, to be used as the conductive layer in the PCB
CCL (Copper Clad Lamination), in addition to the Prepreg and copper foil

Inspection Process Produce

Inspect while processing
Detect surface defects
Detect broken filaments (for the glass fabric)
Display in real time defect maps & images
Display in real time defects data
Display in real time broken filament trends
Provide real time warning
Review inspection file on the production floor
Ship good quality rolls immediately
Quarantine defective rolls for Q.A. review

				Automotive			






The automotive industry today is far more complex and demanding than ever before. Impeccable materials and components are required for safety, performance and appearance. Short manufacturing lead times and cost effectiveness are essential for meeting and surpassing competition standards.   EVS provides the automotive industry with Automatic Optical Inspection (AOI) systems for the detection of spinning, weaving and finishing defects. Our systems increase quality, accuracy, safety, traceability and production efficiency, while decreasing labor and costs.   EVS AOI systems automatically perform quality inspection and monitoring in the production of:

Tire Cord
Air bags
Upholstery
Safety Belts
Carpets

 Inspection Process Example - Tire Cord   EVS AOI systems can be applied in the following processes in the production of tire cords:

Weaving process - on loom inspection. Detecting defects and preventing repetitive defects, by stopping or alarming the loom. Most defects are detected at this stage.
Dipping process – inspection of the rubber coating stage. Detecting defects on the end product, for cutting the fabric and ensuring that only grade A material is shipped.
Steel yarn layer preparation.  

Detectable Defects:

High or low warp yarn density
Broken picks
Distorted picks
Loose picks
Missing picks
Contamination
Knots
Air splices
Broken ends

Photonics.comJun 2017Elbit Vision Systems Ltd. (EVS)Request Info 
        

            HAIFA, Israel, June 20, 2017 — The SkEye WAPS airborne wide-area persistent surveillance solution from Elbit Systems Ltd. is designed for homeland security and defense applications.


SkEye WAPS provides advanced capabilities in the field of imagery intelligence gathering, providing a complete high-resolution picture and up to 80-sq-km coverage of the area of interest to a large number of users. While looking over a large area of interest, operators can zoom into multiple regions of interest simultaneously and understand the connection between them without neglecting the rest of the area, which is still being recorded and constantly analyzed.


The system consists of an airborne segment consisting of the EO sensor unit, an advanced image processing unit, a large mass storage unit and analysis applications.  SkEye WAPS features a fully programmable alerting system that allows commanders to be notified of specific or unusual events through a customized alert mechanism.Visit company websitehttp://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/company/elbit-systems-ltdAbout this supplier/Company.aspx?CompanyID=20200
