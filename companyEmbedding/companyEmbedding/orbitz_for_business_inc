Background[edit]
Originally established through a partnership of major airlines, and subsequently owned by various entities, Orbitz.com – the flagship brand of Orbitz Worldwide – has been in operation since 2001. Other Orbitz Worldwide online travel companies include CheapTickets in the Americas; ebookers in Europe; and HotelClub and RatestoGo, based in Sydney. Orbitz Worldwide also owns and operates Orbitz for Business, a corporate travel company.
Orbitz was the airline industry's response to the rise of online travel agencies such as Expedia and Travelocity, as well as a solution to lower airline distribution costs. Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, and United Airlines, subsequently joined by American Airlines, invested a combined $145 million to start the project in November 1999. It was code-named T2 — some claimed, meaning "Travelocity Terminator" - but adopted the brand name Orbitz when it commenced corporate operations as DUNC, LLC (the initials of its first four founding airlines) in February 2000. The company began Beta testing early the next year, and Orbitz.com officially launched in June 2001.[3][1]
Pre-launch government review[edit]





This section relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (August 2015)


Even before the site began operating, the company faced intense antitrust scrutiny because five of the six "major" airlines were collaborating on the project. Collectively, they controlled 80 percent of the US air travel market. Several consumer organizations, as well as Orbitz's primary competitors at the time (Expedia, Sabre, Travelocity, Galileo) spent significant amounts of money lobbying the United States Department of Transportation to block the project from the outset, and some 23 state attorneys general also voiced concerns due to the complaints of local competitors. When the DOT permitted the company to move ahead in April 2001, the competitive lobbying effort was switched to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.[citation needed]
Among the concerns raised were these:

above all, the so-called Most Favored Nation provision, by which the airlines agreed not to cut deals with competing sites under more favorable terms than with Orbitz
the airlines' agreement to release certain discount fares only to Orbitz or other entities at Orbitz low distribution cost, at the expense of its online and offline competitors
that Computer Reservation System fee discounts extended to partner airlines would undermine competitors and damage the fledgling online travel industry
that the airlines would coordinate efforts secretly to reduce discounts
Orbitz was breaking out the service fee from the ticket price, not making the total price clear

In July 2003, two years after the Orbitz launch, the Department of Justice ruled that Orbitz was not a cartel and did not pose a threat to competition. Orbitz's rapid growth had not impeded its online competitors' businesses which had continued to grow apace, and no evidence was found of price fixing. Additionally, changes in the marketplace had eroded both the advantages of the Most Favored Nation clause and the webfares that Orbitz had due to its low supplier cost. The efforts by its competitors to generate government scrutiny and the corresponding media attention only heightened consumer interest in Orbitz and the new ways it would allow travelers to shop. Nielsen's Net Ratings division reported in July 2001 that the Orbitz launch in June 2001 was the biggest e-commerce launch ever.[4]
Ownership history[edit]
In November 2003, Orbitz filed paperwork to sell shares at between $22 and $24 each in an initial public offering.[5] The company went public on December 18, 2003 at a price per share of $26. After the IPO, the airlines held 70% of the outstanding stock and over 90% of the voting power.[6]
On September 29, 2004, Orbitz was acquired for $1.25 billion by New York City-based Cendant Corporation. Cendant paid $27.50 per share.[7]
In 2006, The Blackstone Group acquired Travelport, the travel distribution services business of Cendant, for $4.3 billion in cash. At the time, Travelport included the Orbitz travel reservation website used by consumers, the Galileo computer reservations system used by airlines and thousands of travel agents, Gulliver's Travels and Associates wholesale travel business, and other travel related software brands and solutions.[8]
Travelport announced in May 2007 that it had filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell a portion of Orbitz Worldwide in an initial public offering (IPO). Travelport said it planned to use a portion of the proceeds to pay down its debt. Trading began on July 20, 2007, and the IPO transaction closed on July 25, 2007. Travelport owned approximately 48 percent of Orbitz Worldwide following the IPO.[9]
In February 2015, Expedia announced that it would acquire Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash, to better compete with Priceline.com. The deal was announced a few days after Expedia agreed to purchase Travelocity.[10][11]
Technologies[edit]
Orbitz runs on a mixed Red Hat Linux[12] and Solaris based platform and was an early adopter of Sun Microsystems' Jini[13] platform in a clustered Java environment. JBoss is used as application servers within their environment along with various other proprietary and open source software.[14] Orbitz licenses ITA Software's Lisp-powered QPX software to power their site. Orbitz Worldwide brands have been migrated to a common technology platform, which enables the same platform to service multiple travel brands in multiple languages in different markets and currencies as well. Orbitz has released parts of its Complex Event Processing infrastructure as Open Source.[15]
Controversies[edit]
Southwest Airlines[edit]
Southwest Airlines filed a lawsuit against Orbitz for trademark infringement and false advertising in May 2001. Southwest, which had opposed the project from the outset,[clarification needed] claimed Orbitz misrepresented its prices and used its trademarks without permission. In July, it withdrew its fares from Airline Tariff Publishing Company, the entity that distributes fare information to Orbitz and others, and dropped its case against Orbitz. Southwest went on to remove themselves from every other online outlet except their own. In June 2008, Orbitz For Business became one of the first Online Travel Agents to offer Southwest flights on the Orbitz For Business website.[16]
WebLoyalty[edit]
In July 2009, CNET revealed that Orbitz, along with other popular consumer websites Buy.com and Fandango, have been routinely giving post-transaction marketers access to their customers' credit cards. The Senate Commerce Committee investigating these companies has described their services as a "scam".[17] The scam works by charging a monthly fee (many users report a $12 charge from Reservation Rewards or Webloyalty showing up on their credit card statements) that is piggybacked[clarification needed] with the Orbitz sale (as it stands, Orbitz Terms of Service agreement currently allows them to share customers' credit card information with third parties for their own uses). Orbitz ended its affiliation with the controversial marketer and does not share consumer credit card information with third parties.[citation needed]
Milgram v. Orbitz[edit]
In 2009, the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit against the company alleging violation of their Consumer Fraud Act surrounding events with a Bruce Springsteen concert, where tickets were allegedly offered for sale on their website which did not actually exist. The court in Milgram v. Orbitz granted summary judgment for Orbitz, finding that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act preempted the state law consumer fraud claims.[18]
American Airlines[edit]
In December 2010, American Airlines temporarily ceased offering fares through Orbitz following pressure from American to convince Orbitz to use its AA Direct Connect electronic transaction system.[19] AA tried to establish that Direct Connect would have full control over the distribution of its products and reduce GDS segment fees. Furthermore, Direct Connect enables AA to sell ancillary services to its customers.[20] American was later ordered by an Illinois Court to resume offering fares and flight schedules.[21] The court order came only days after American released a video jabbing Orbitz on YouTube.[22]
Media Matters' "War on Fox"[edit]
Media Matters runs a website called DropFox.com, aiming to get advertisers to boycott Fox News. Orbitz initially referred to Media Matters' efforts as a "smear campaign",[23] but agreed, on June 9, 2011, following a three-week campaign by prominent LGBT organizations, to "review the policies and process used to evaluate where advertising is placed".[24]
Skiplagged lawsuit[edit]
In 2014, Orbitz and United Airlines initiated a Federal lawsuit against 22-year-old skiplagged.com founder Aktarer Zaman.[25][26][27] The complaint alleges that Zaman "intentionally and maliciously" interfered with airline industry business relationships “by promoting prohibited forms of travel.”[28] The complaint is centered on airline policies against "hidden city tickets." Although the hidden-city practice itself is not illegal,[29] the complaint alleges that Zaman's website is disruptive to their business.

Additionally, changes in the marketplace had eroded both the advantages of the Most Favored Nation clause and the webfares that Orbitz had due to its low supplier cost. The efforts by its competitors to generate government scrutiny and the corresponding media attention only heightened consumer interest in Orbitz and the new ways it would allow travelers to shop. Nielsen's Net Ratings division reported in July 2001 that the Orbitz launch in June 2001 was the biggest e-commerce launch ever.[4]
Ownership history[edit]
In November 2003, Orbitz filed paperwork to sell shares at between $22 and $24 each in an initial public offering.[5] The company went public on December 18, 2003 at a price per share of $26. After the IPO, the airlines held 70% of the outstanding stock and over 90% of the voting power.[6]
On September 29, 2004, Orbitz was acquired for $1.25 billion by New York City-based Cendant Corporation. Cendant paid $27.50 per share.[7]
In 2006, The Blackstone Group acquired Travelport, the travel distribution services business of Cendant, for $4.3 billion in cash. At the time, Travelport included the Orbitz travel reservation website used by consumers, the Galileo computer reservations system used by airlines and thousands of travel agents, Gulliver's Travels and Associates wholesale travel business, and other travel related software brands and solutions.[8]
Travelport announced in May 2007 that it had filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell a portion of Orbitz Worldwide in an initial public offering (IPO). Travelport said it planned to use a portion of the proceeds to pay down its debt. Trading began on July 20, 2007, and the IPO transaction closed on July 25, 2007. Travelport owned approximately 48 percent of Orbitz Worldwide following the IPO.[9]
In February 2015, Expedia announced that it would acquire Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash, to better compete with Priceline.com. The deal was announced a few days after Expedia agreed to purchase Travelocity.[10][11]
Technologies[edit]
Orbitz runs on a mixed Red Hat Linux[12] and Solaris based platform and was an early adopter of Sun Microsystems' Jini[13] platform in a clustered Java environment. JBoss is used as application servers within their environment along with various other proprietary and open source software.[14] Orbitz licenses ITA Software's Lisp-powered QPX software to power their site. Orbitz Worldwide brands have been migrated to a common technology platform, which enables the same platform to service multiple travel brands in multiple languages in different markets and currencies as well. Orbitz has released parts of its Complex Event Processing infrastructure as Open Source.[15]
Controversies[edit]
Southwest Airlines[edit]
Southwest Airlines filed a lawsuit against Orbitz for trademark infringement and false advertising in May 2001. Southwest, which had opposed the project from the outset,[clarification needed] claimed Orbitz misrepresented its prices and used its trademarks without permission. In July, it withdrew its fares from Airline Tariff Publishing Company, the entity that distributes fare information to Orbitz and others, and dropped its case against Orbitz. Southwest went on to remove themselves from every other online outlet except their own. In June 2008, Orbitz For Business became one of the first Online Travel Agents to offer Southwest flights on the Orbitz For Business website.[16]
WebLoyalty[edit]
In July 2009, CNET revealed that Orbitz, along with other popular consumer websites Buy.com and Fandango, have been routinely giving post-transaction marketers access to their customers' credit cards. The Senate Commerce Committee investigating these companies has described their services as a "scam".[17] The scam works by charging a monthly fee (many users report a $12 charge from Reservation Rewards or Webloyalty showing up on their credit card statements) that is piggybacked[clarification needed] with the Orbitz sale (as it stands, Orbitz Terms of Service agreement currently allows them to share customers' credit card information with third parties for their own uses). Orbitz ended its affiliation with the controversial marketer and does not share consumer credit card information with third parties.[citation needed]
Milgram v. Orbitz[edit]
In 2009, the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit against the company alleging violation of their Consumer Fraud Act surrounding events with a Bruce Springsteen concert, where tickets were allegedly offered for sale on their website which did not actually exist. The court in Milgram v. Orbitz granted summary judgment for Orbitz, finding that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act preempted the state law consumer fraud claims.[18]
American Airlines[edit]
In December 2010, American Airlines temporarily ceased offering fares through Orbitz following pressure from American to convince Orbitz to use its AA Direct Connect electronic transaction system.[19] AA tried to establish that Direct Connect would have full control over the distribution of its products and reduce GDS segment fees. Furthermore, Direct Connect enables AA to sell ancillary services to its customers.[20] American was later ordered by an Illinois Court to resume offering fares and flight schedules.[21] The court order came only days after American released a video jabbing Orbitz on YouTube.[22]
Media Matters' "War on Fox"[edit]
Media Matters runs a website called DropFox.com, aiming to get advertisers to boycott Fox News. Orbitz initially referred to Media Matters' efforts as a "smear campaign",[23] but agreed, on June 9, 2011, following a three-week campaign by prominent LGBT organizations, to "review the policies and process used to evaluate where advertising is placed".[24]
Skiplagged lawsuit[edit]
In 2014, Orbitz and United Airlines initiated a Federal lawsuit against 22-year-old skiplagged.com founder Aktarer Zaman.[25][26][27] The complaint alleges that Zaman "intentionally and maliciously" interfered with airline industry business relationships “by promoting prohibited forms of travel.”[28] The complaint is centered on airline policies against "hidden city tickets." Although the hidden-city practice itself is not illegal,[29] the complaint alleges that Zaman's website is disruptive to their business.

Background[edit]
Originally established through a partnership of major airlines, and subsequently owned by various entities, Orbitz.com – the flagship brand of Orbitz Worldwide – has been in operation since 2001. Other Orbitz Worldwide online travel companies include CheapTickets in the Americas; ebookers in Europe; and HotelClub and RatestoGo, based in Sydney. Orbitz Worldwide also owns and operates Orbitz for Business, a corporate travel company.
Orbitz was the airline industry's response to the rise of online travel agencies such as Expedia and Travelocity, as well as a solution to lower airline distribution costs. Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, and United Airlines, subsequently joined by American Airlines, invested a combined $145 million to start the project in November 1999. It was code-named T2 — some claimed, meaning "Travelocity Terminator" - but adopted the brand name Orbitz when it commenced corporate operations as DUNC, LLC (the initials of its first four founding airlines) in February 2000. The company began Beta testing early the next year, and Orbitz.com officially launched in June 2001.[3][1]
Pre-launch government review[edit]





This section relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (August 2015)


Even before the site began operating, the company faced intense antitrust scrutiny because five of the six "major" airlines were collaborating on the project. Collectively, they controlled 80 percent of the US air travel market. Several consumer organizations, as well as Orbitz's primary competitors at the time (Expedia, Sabre, Travelocity, Galileo) spent significant amounts of money lobbying the United States Department of Transportation to block the project from the outset, and some 23 state attorneys general also voiced concerns due to the complaints of local competitors. When the DOT permitted the company to move ahead in April 2001, the competitive lobbying effort was switched to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.[citation needed]
Among the concerns raised were these:

above all, the so-called Most Favored Nation provision, by which the airlines agreed not to cut deals with competing sites under more favorable terms than with Orbitz
the airlines' agreement to release certain discount fares only to Orbitz or other entities at Orbitz low distribution cost, at the expense of its online and offline competitors
that Computer Reservation System fee discounts extended to partner airlines would undermine competitors and damage the fledgling online travel industry
that the airlines would coordinate efforts secretly to reduce discounts
Orbitz was breaking out the service fee from the ticket price, not making the total price clear

In July 2003, two years after the Orbitz launch, the Department of Justice ruled that Orbitz was not a cartel and did not pose a threat to competition. Orbitz's rapid growth had not impeded its online competitors' businesses which had continued to grow apace, and no evidence was found of price fixing. Additionally, changes in the marketplace had eroded both the advantages of the Most Favored Nation clause and the webfares that Orbitz had due to its low supplier cost. The efforts by its competitors to generate government scrutiny and the corresponding media attention only heightened consumer interest in Orbitz and the new ways it would allow travelers to shop. Nielsen's Net Ratings division reported in July 2001 that the Orbitz launch in June 2001 was the biggest e-commerce launch ever.[4]

Background[edit]
Originally established through a partnership of major airlines, and subsequently owned by various entities, Orbitz.com – the flagship brand of Orbitz Worldwide – has been in operation since 2001. Other Orbitz Worldwide online travel companies include CheapTickets in the Americas; ebookers in Europe; and HotelClub and RatestoGo, based in Sydney. Orbitz Worldwide also owns and operates Orbitz for Business, a corporate travel company.
Orbitz was the airline industry's response to the rise of online travel agencies such as Expedia and Travelocity, as well as a solution to lower airline distribution costs. Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, and United Airlines, subsequently joined by American Airlines, invested a combined $145 million to start the project in November 1999. It was code-named T2 — some claimed, meaning "Travelocity Terminator" - but adopted the brand name Orbitz when it commenced corporate operations as DUNC, LLC (the initials of its first four founding airlines) in February 2000. The company began Beta testing early the next year, and Orbitz.com officially launched in June 2001.[3][1]
Pre-launch government review[edit]





This section relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (August 2015)


Even before the site began operating, the company faced intense antitrust scrutiny because five of the six "major" airlines were collaborating on the project. Collectively, they controlled 80 percent of the US air travel market. Several consumer organizations, as well as Orbitz's primary competitors at the time (Expedia, Sabre, Travelocity, Galileo) spent significant amounts of money lobbying the United States Department of Transportation to block the project from the outset, and some 23 state attorneys general also voiced concerns due to the complaints of local competitors. When the DOT permitted the company to move ahead in April 2001, the competitive lobbying effort was switched to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.[citation needed]
Among the concerns raised were these:

above all, the so-called Most Favored Nation provision, by which the airlines agreed not to cut deals with competing sites under more favorable terms than with Orbitz
the airlines' agreement to release certain discount fares only to Orbitz or other entities at Orbitz low distribution cost, at the expense of its online and offline competitors
that Computer Reservation System fee discounts extended to partner airlines would undermine competitors and damage the fledgling online travel industry
that the airlines would coordinate efforts secretly to reduce discounts
Orbitz was breaking out the service fee from the ticket price, not making the total price clear

In July 2003, two years after the Orbitz launch, the Department of Justice ruled that Orbitz was not a cartel and did not pose a threat to competition. Orbitz's rapid growth had not impeded its online competitors' businesses which had continued to grow apace, and no evidence was found of price fixing. Additionally, changes in the marketplace had eroded both the advantages of the Most Favored Nation clause and the webfares that Orbitz had due to its low supplier cost. The efforts by its competitors to generate government scrutiny and the corresponding media attention only heightened consumer interest in Orbitz and the new ways it would allow travelers to shop. Nielsen's Net Ratings division reported in July 2001 that the Orbitz launch in June 2001 was the biggest e-commerce launch ever.[4]
Ownership history[edit]
In November 2003, Orbitz filed paperwork to sell shares at between $22 and $24 each in an initial public offering.[5] The company went public on December 18, 2003 at a price per share of $26. After the IPO, the airlines held 70% of the outstanding stock and over 90% of the voting power.[6]
On September 29, 2004, Orbitz was acquired for $1.25 billion by New York City-based Cendant Corporation. Cendant paid $27.50 per share.[7]
In 2006, The Blackstone Group acquired Travelport, the travel distribution services business of Cendant, for $4.3 billion in cash. At the time, Travelport included the Orbitz travel reservation website used by consumers, the Galileo computer reservations system used by airlines and thousands of travel agents, Gulliver's Travels and Associates wholesale travel business, and other travel related software brands and solutions.[8]
Travelport announced in May 2007 that it had filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell a portion of Orbitz Worldwide in an initial public offering (IPO). Travelport said it planned to use a portion of the proceeds to pay down its debt. Trading began on July 20, 2007, and the IPO transaction closed on July 25, 2007. Travelport owned approximately 48 percent of Orbitz Worldwide following the IPO.[9]
In February 2015, Expedia announced that it would acquire Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash, to better compete with Priceline.com. The deal was announced a few days after Expedia agreed to purchase Travelocity.[10][11]
Technologies[edit]
Orbitz runs on a mixed Red Hat Linux[12] and Solaris based platform and was an early adopter of Sun Microsystems' Jini[13] platform in a clustered Java environment. JBoss is used as application servers within their environment along with various other proprietary and open source software.[14] Orbitz licenses ITA Software's Lisp-powered QPX software to power their site. Orbitz Worldwide brands have been migrated to a common technology platform, which enables the same platform to service multiple travel brands in multiple languages in different markets and currencies as well. Orbitz has released parts of its Complex Event Processing infrastructure as Open Source.[15]
Controversies[edit]
Southwest Airlines[edit]
Southwest Airlines filed a lawsuit against Orbitz for trademark infringement and false advertising in May 2001. Southwest, which had opposed the project from the outset,[clarification needed] claimed Orbitz misrepresented its prices and used its trademarks without permission. In July, it withdrew its fares from Airline Tariff Publishing Company, the entity that distributes fare information to Orbitz and others, and dropped its case against Orbitz. Southwest went on to remove themselves from every other online outlet except their own. In June 2008, Orbitz For Business became one of the first Online Travel Agents to offer Southwest flights on the Orbitz For Business website.[16]
WebLoyalty[edit]
In July 2009, CNET revealed that Orbitz, along with other popular consumer websites Buy.com and Fandango, have been routinely giving post-transaction marketers access to their customers' credit cards. The Senate Commerce Committee investigating these companies has described their services as a "scam".[17] The scam works by charging a monthly fee (many users report a $12 charge from Reservation Rewards or Webloyalty showing up on their credit card statements) that is piggybacked[clarification needed] with the Orbitz sale (as it stands, Orbitz Terms of Service agreement currently allows them to share customers' credit card information with third parties for their own uses). Orbitz ended its affiliation with the controversial marketer and does not share consumer credit card information with third parties.[citation needed]
Milgram v. Orbitz[edit]
In 2009, the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit against the company alleging violation of their Consumer Fraud Act surrounding events with a Bruce Springsteen concert, where tickets were allegedly offered for sale on their website which did not actually exist. The court in Milgram v. Orbitz granted summary judgment for Orbitz, finding that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act preempted the state law consumer fraud claims.[18]
American Airlines[edit]
In December 2010, American Airlines temporarily ceased offering fares through Orbitz following pressure from American to convince Orbitz to use its AA Direct Connect electronic transaction system.[19] AA tried to establish that Direct Connect would have full control over the distribution of its products and reduce GDS segment fees. Furthermore, Direct Connect enables AA to sell ancillary services to its customers.[20] American was later ordered by an Illinois Court to resume offering fares and flight schedules.[21] The court order came only days after American released a video jabbing Orbitz on YouTube.[22]
Media Matters' "War on Fox"[edit]
Media Matters runs a website called DropFox.com, aiming to get advertisers to boycott Fox News. Orbitz initially referred to Media Matters' efforts as a "smear campaign",[23] but agreed, on June 9, 2011, following a three-week campaign by prominent LGBT organizations, to "review the policies and process used to evaluate where advertising is placed".[24]
Skiplagged lawsuit[edit]
In 2014, Orbitz and United Airlines initiated a Federal lawsuit against 22-year-old skiplagged.com founder Aktarer Zaman.[25][26][27] The complaint alleges that Zaman "intentionally and maliciously" interfered with airline industry business relationships “by promoting prohibited forms of travel.”[28] The complaint is centered on airline policies against "hidden city tickets." Although the hidden-city practice itself is not illegal,[29] the complaint alleges that Zaman's website is disruptive to their business.

Background[edit]
Originally established through a partnership of major airlines, and subsequently owned by various entities, Orbitz.com – the flagship brand of Orbitz Worldwide – has been in operation since 2001. Other Orbitz Worldwide online travel companies include CheapTickets in the Americas; ebookers in Europe; and HotelClub and RatestoGo, based in Sydney. Orbitz Worldwide also owns and operates Orbitz for Business, a corporate travel company.
Orbitz was the airline industry's response to the rise of online travel agencies such as Expedia and Travelocity, as well as a solution to lower airline distribution costs. Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, and United Airlines, subsequently joined by American Airlines, invested a combined $145 million to start the project in November 1999. It was code-named T2 — some claimed, meaning "Travelocity Terminator" - but adopted the brand name Orbitz when it commenced corporate operations as DUNC, LLC (the initials of its first four founding airlines) in February 2000. The company began Beta testing early the next year, and Orbitz.com officially launched in June 2001.[3][1]
Pre-launch government review[edit]





This section relies largely or entirely on a single source. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources. (August 2015)


Even before the site began operating, the company faced intense antitrust scrutiny because five of the six "major" airlines were collaborating on the project. Collectively, they controlled 80 percent of the US air travel market. Several consumer organizations, as well as Orbitz's primary competitors at the time (Expedia, Sabre, Travelocity, Galileo) spent significant amounts of money lobbying the United States Department of Transportation to block the project from the outset, and some 23 state attorneys general also voiced concerns due to the complaints of local competitors. When the DOT permitted the company to move ahead in April 2001, the competitive lobbying effort was switched to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.[citation needed]
Among the concerns raised were these:

above all, the so-called Most Favored Nation provision, by which the airlines agreed not to cut deals with competing sites under more favorable terms than with Orbitz
the airlines' agreement to release certain discount fares only to Orbitz or other entities at Orbitz low distribution cost, at the expense of its online and offline competitors
that Computer Reservation System fee discounts extended to partner airlines would undermine competitors and damage the fledgling online travel industry
that the airlines would coordinate efforts secretly to reduce discounts
Orbitz was breaking out the service fee from the ticket price, not making the total price clear

In July 2003, two years after the Orbitz launch, the Department of Justice ruled that Orbitz was not a cartel and did not pose a threat to competition. Orbitz's rapid growth had not impeded its online competitors' businesses which had continued to grow apace, and no evidence was found of price fixing. Additionally, changes in the marketplace had eroded both the advantages of the Most Favored Nation clause and the webfares that Orbitz had due to its low supplier cost. The efforts by its competitors to generate government scrutiny and the corresponding media attention only heightened consumer interest in Orbitz and the new ways it would allow travelers to shop. Nielsen's Net Ratings division reported in July 2001 that the Orbitz launch in June 2001 was the biggest e-commerce launch ever.[4]
Ownership history[edit]
In November 2003, Orbitz filed paperwork to sell shares at between $22 and $24 each in an initial public offering.[5] The company went public on December 18, 2003 at a price per share of $26. After the IPO, the airlines held 70% of the outstanding stock and over 90% of the voting power.[6]
On September 29, 2004, Orbitz was acquired for $1.25 billion by New York City-based Cendant Corporation. Cendant paid $27.50 per share.[7]
In 2006, The Blackstone Group acquired Travelport, the travel distribution services business of Cendant, for $4.3 billion in cash. At the time, Travelport included the Orbitz travel reservation website used by consumers, the Galileo computer reservations system used by airlines and thousands of travel agents, Gulliver's Travels and Associates wholesale travel business, and other travel related software brands and solutions.[8]
Travelport announced in May 2007 that it had filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell a portion of Orbitz Worldwide in an initial public offering (IPO). Travelport said it planned to use a portion of the proceeds to pay down its debt. Trading began on July 20, 2007, and the IPO transaction closed on July 25, 2007. Travelport owned approximately 48 percent of Orbitz Worldwide following the IPO.[9]
In February 2015, Expedia announced that it would acquire Orbitz for $1.2 billion in cash, to better compete with Priceline.com. The deal was announced a few days after Expedia agreed to purchase Travelocity.[10][11]
Technologies[edit]
Orbitz runs on a mixed Red Hat Linux[12] and Solaris based platform and was an early adopter of Sun Microsystems' Jini[13] platform in a clustered Java environment. JBoss is used as application servers within their environment along with various other proprietary and open source software.[14] Orbitz licenses ITA Software's Lisp-powered QPX software to power their site. Orbitz Worldwide brands have been migrated to a common technology platform, which enables the same platform to service multiple travel brands in multiple languages in different markets and currencies as well. Orbitz has released parts of its Complex Event Processing infrastructure as Open Source.[15]
Controversies[edit]
Southwest Airlines[edit]
Southwest Airlines filed a lawsuit against Orbitz for trademark infringement and false advertising in May 2001. Southwest, which had opposed the project from the outset,[clarification needed] claimed Orbitz misrepresented its prices and used its trademarks without permission. In July, it withdrew its fares from Airline Tariff Publishing Company, the entity that distributes fare information to Orbitz and others, and dropped its case against Orbitz. Southwest went on to remove themselves from every other online outlet except their own. In June 2008, Orbitz For Business became one of the first Online Travel Agents to offer Southwest flights on the Orbitz For Business website.[16]
WebLoyalty[edit]
In July 2009, CNET revealed that Orbitz, along with other popular consumer websites Buy.com and Fandango, have been routinely giving post-transaction marketers access to their customers' credit cards. The Senate Commerce Committee investigating these companies has described their services as a "scam".[17] The scam works by charging a monthly fee (many users report a $12 charge from Reservation Rewards or Webloyalty showing up on their credit card statements) that is piggybacked[clarification needed] with the Orbitz sale (as it stands, Orbitz Terms of Service agreement currently allows them to share customers' credit card information with third parties for their own uses). Orbitz ended its affiliation with the controversial marketer and does not share consumer credit card information with third parties.[citation needed]
Milgram v. Orbitz[edit]
In 2009, the state of New Jersey filed a lawsuit against the company alleging violation of their Consumer Fraud Act surrounding events with a Bruce Springsteen concert, where tickets were allegedly offered for sale on their website which did not actually exist. The court in Milgram v. Orbitz granted summary judgment for Orbitz, finding that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act preempted the state law consumer fraud claims.[18]
American Airlines[edit]
In December 2010, American Airlines temporarily ceased offering fares through Orbitz following pressure from American to convince Orbitz to use its AA Direct Connect electronic transaction system.[19] AA tried to establish that Direct Connect would have full control over the distribution of its products and reduce GDS segment fees. Furthermore, Direct Connect enables AA to sell ancillary services to its customers.[20] American was later ordered by an Illinois Court to resume offering fares and flight schedules.[21] The court order came only days after American released a video jabbing Orbitz on YouTube.[22]
Media Matters' "War on Fox"[edit]
Media Matters runs a website called DropFox.com, aiming to get advertisers to boycott Fox News. Orbitz initially referred to Media Matters' efforts as a "smear campaign",[23] but agreed, on June 9, 2011, following a three-week campaign by prominent LGBT organizations, to "review the policies and process used to evaluate where advertising is placed".[24]
Skiplagged lawsuit[edit]
In 2014, Orbitz and United Airlines initiated a Federal lawsuit against 22-year-old skiplagged.com founder Aktarer Zaman.[25][26][27] The complaint alleges that Zaman "intentionally and maliciously" interfered with airline industry business relationships “by promoting prohibited forms of travel.”[28] The complaint is centered on airline policies against "hidden city tickets." Although the hidden-city practice itself is not illegal,[29] the complaint alleges that Zaman's website is disruptive to their business.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Orbitz for Business Sees Strong Growth in Best-in-Class Mobile Booking Tool

Industry Update




Supplier News29 July 2014Orbitz for Business Sees Strong Growth in Best-in-Class Mobile Booking Tool
Business travelers increasingly reaching for consumerized technology as trip management moves mobile

LOS ANGELES, Jul. 29, 2014 – Orbitz for Business, the corporate travel brand of Orbitz Worldwide Inc. (NYSE: OWW), today announced from the Global Business Travel Association's annual conference that usage of its mobile solution by corporate travelers has increased nearly 60 percent in the last 12 months.

In 2011, Orbitz for Business became the first major corporate travel company to launch an end-to-end mobile solution that blended the ability to book all major travel products with fully customized corporate policy controls. This March, a new version of the mobile site was released, featuring a new design to increase ease-of-use with improved speed and touch responsiveness. More information about the new mobile solution can be found at http://orbitzforbusiness.com/gomobile or by visiting the company's booth (#739) for an in-person demo, located on the main aisle on the west end of the convention center.

The demand for comprehensive mobile tools and functionality has exploded globally. Studies show that last year, 80 percent of all computing devices shipped were tablets and smartphones, and today's business traveler now carries multiple mobile devices. While mobile bookings have become increasingly commonplace among leisure travelers—Orbitz.com reports more than 30 percent of its hotel room nights sold in the first quarter of 2014 came through mobile channels—business travelers have only shown trends towards similar rates of mobile adoption when provided access to improved mobile tools that deliver a consumerized experience and incorporate custom corporate travel policies. In a recent survey of general business travelers, 75 percent of respondents said they would like the ability to make, change, or cancel their travel plans from their phone, and 80 percent say they would prefer to make their own changes via smartphone or tablet instead of calling an agent for assistance.
"At Orbitz Worldwide, it's our mission to be the best place to plan and book travel on touch devices, and our revamped Orbitz for Business mobile offering is in line with that mission, giving business travelers a mobile experience that more closely mirrors the leisure experience, " said Frank Petito, president of Orbitz for Business. "Our mobile offerings are optimized for all types of mobile devices while retaining the powerful features available in our desktop experience. Equally important, our mobile product fully supports the customized policy, control and compliance requirements of corporate travel managers and their programs. Our offering leverages what we've learned about how customers like to search and book travel on Orbitz.com, one of the world's leading online travel agencies."
The Orbitz for Business mobile website seamlessly integrates all the great elements of the traditional desktop experience, while giving business travelers the flexibility, features and functionality to book a broad array of travel products and services while on the go, including:


Make New Reservations: Search for and book thousands of flights, hotels and car rental options, including same-day and last-minute reservations. In addition, car service and rail bookings will be available this fall.

Support for All Search Types and Filters: Sort and filter across a full range of criteria and preferences, such as searching for flights by price or schedule, or searching for hotels and cars by city, airport, company location or address.

Trip Tracking and Itinerary Management: All travel reservations and trip details are accessible through My Trips, including the ability to cancel existing reservations and share itineraries.

Flight Status and Traveler Updates: Check flight status on major worldwide airlines and receive our patented real-time Orbitz for Business CARE alerts to stay informed of any changes.

Additionally, the Orbitz for Business mobile website applies all existing customized corporate travel policies, controls and compliance guidelines to new reservations, such as:


Full Policy Application for All Reservations: Travel and compliance policies are applied to new mobile reservations. This includes prioritized search results with preferred suppliers and other company-level travel policies and reference data as well as trip purpose.

Company and Global Messaging: Global messaging from Orbitz for Business and company-specific messages appear on the mobile home page, within search results, and on booking and confirmation pages, consistently across all devices.

Customer Service and Support: Travelers are always just one click away from 24/7 customer service, including email and telephone-based offline support.
