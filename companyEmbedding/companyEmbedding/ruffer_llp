The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at Ruffer (London, England) in December 2016.InterviewFirst you send a cover letter and CV. First Round is an Assessment Centre which consists of a maths test, grammar test, group exercise and three twenty minute interviews. Second (and final) round is a set of five interviews. Feedback is offered after each stage of interviews. Interviews are not particularly technical, but can ask you questions about your views on the markets. Most questions focus on your past experience and skills. All staff I encountered (bar one) seemed really friendly and like they want you to do well.Interview Questions Describe your personality type.What is your greatest weakness? (They said not to say a weakness that is actually a strength)What would you do if we rejected you? (I found out after the fact that they want you to say apply again)If you were to buy the building we were in, what questions would you want to ask before you bought it?

Woodhouse Workspace has designed the new offices of investment management company Ruffer LLP, located in London, England.
Woodhouse has just completed a design and fitout refurbishment for Ruffer, an investment management firm based in the city of London.
Woodhouse worked with leadership and management teams at Ruffer LLP to meet the objective of transforming their workplace with minimal disruption caused to their workforce.
The process was collaborative from the start, with design workshops, test fits and space plans created. These were all relayed to the client through 3D visualisation (VR) and mood boards. Ruffer was also involved in the furniture identification and selection process, which included visits to manufacturers.
The solution put in place by Woodhouse Workspace was a demolition and strip out of existing ceilings, flooring, partitioning, etc. Mechanical and electrical alterations took place to most of the building including the building management system. Some of the materials used included glass partitioning with walnut doors and frames for many of the areas within the office space. Meeting rooms had state of the art audio visual equipment installed and linked to the new furniture. The third space included a new teapoint with bespoke booths and benches leading onto a newly refurbished terrace.
Throughout the process, acoustic treatment was provided for optimal experience within the meeting rooms.
