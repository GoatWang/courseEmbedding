Saban Music Group[edit]
Saban Music Group was formed in 1980 by music and television producers Haim Saban[7] and Shuki Levy as "Saban Records", a U.S. subsidiary of "Saban International Paris" (now SIP Animation). In 1986, Warner Communications acquired Saban Records first catalog of music for about $6 million.[8] On October 4, 2010, Bug Music acquired the worldwide rights to Saban Music Group’s complete music catalog of theme songs, cues and scores from more than 90 television series and 100 made-for-television films and specials.[9]
History[edit]
In October 2006, SCG's Saban Entertainment Group division announced the beginning of its virtual studio program for starting up and developing family entertainment.[10] In March 2007, Univision Communications was sold to Broadcasting Media Partners which includes Saban Capital Group, Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, TPG Capital, and Thomas H. Lee Partners.[4] On October 17, 2011, Saban Capital Group acquired 7.5% stake in Jakarta-based Indonesian largest integrated media company, Media Nusantara Citra.[11][12][13] In July 2012, Saban Capital Group acquired minority stake in PT MNC Sky Vision Tbk, the largest pay-TV operator in Indonesia which owns Indovision and Top TV.[14] In June 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures LLC, a SCG affiliate, jointly with Konami's 4K Acquisition Corp. purchased some of the key assets of 4Kids Entertainment with Kidsco getting the Dragon Ball Z Kai, Cubix, Sonic X and The CW Network's Saturday Morning programming block contract rights.[15] In August 2012, Saban Capital Group launched a new music publishing division called "Music Ventures".[16]
On May 6, 2014, Saban Capital announced the launch of Saban Films, a distribution unit that will acquire yearly 8 to 10 feature films for the North American market.[17]
Saban Brands[edit]
On May 5, 2010, Saban Capital Group announced that it would start Saban Brands (SB), a successor company to Saban Entertainment dedicated to acquiring entertainment and consumer brands.[2] On May 12, 2010, it was announced that Saban Brands bought back the Power Rangers franchise from Disney for $43 million[18] and would produce a new nineteenth season of Power Rangers that began airing on Nickelodeon on February 7, 2011, with the previous 700 episodes being rerun on Nicktoons.[3][19] It was also announced that Saban Brands is in negotiations to buy three other brands.[20] On August 17, 2010, it was announced that Saban Brands bought Paul Frank Industries.[21][22]
On May 1, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures LLC, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, placed a bid to acquire some of 4Kids Entertainment's assets, including the US rights to the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise and The CW4Kids block, for $10 million.[23] 4K Acquisition Corp, a subsidiary of Konami, then placed a bid. On June 5, 2012, 4Kids commenced an auction between Kidsco and 4K Acquisition which was then adjourned so 4Kids, Kidsco, and 4K Acquisition could consider an alternative transaction.[24][25] On June 15, 2012, 4Kids filed a notice outlining a proposed deal in which its assets would be divided between Kidsco and 4K Acquisition which was finalized on June 26, 2012. The deal saw 4K Acquisition acquire the US rights to the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise and Kidsco acquire 4Kids' other assets including the agreements for Dragon Ball Z Kai, Cubix: Robots for Everyone, Sonic X and The CW Network's Saturday morning programming block.[26][27] On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, would begin programming the block in the fall,[28][29][30][31] and on July 12, 2012 announced that the block would be named Vortexx, which launched on August 25, 2012 and ended on September 27, 2014.[32][33]
On June 12, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands plans to reintroduce the Popples franchise with new merchandise in fall 2013.[34] On August 3, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands acquired The Playforge, the development team behind App Store success stories Zombie Farm and Zombie Life.[35] On September 19, 2012, Saban Brands announced that they acquired Zui provider of Kid-Safe Online content.[36] On September 25, 2012, Saban Brands announced that they re-acquired the Digimon franchise and its most recent season, Digimon Fusion with Toei Animation handling Asian licensing & distribution and MarVista Entertainment handling all other global licensing & distribution.[37][38]
On July 3, 2013, it was announced that Saban Brands signed a deal to manage the distribution, licensing, and merchandising of Sendokai Champions in North America and Israel and be broadcast on the Vortexx.[39] In October 2013, Saban Brands shut down The Playforge because of poor game sales.[40]
Saban Brands and Lionsgate Films announced in May 2014 that they are planning to produce a new Power Rangers feature film, and would hopefully launch a Power Rangers film franchise.[41] By August 4, Saban Brands sold KidZui to Leapfrog Enterprises.[42] Later on, Macbeth Footwear was acquired by Saban Brands, and in December, Saban Brands formed two divisions Saban Brands Lifestyle Group and Saban Brands Entertainment Group to expand their holdings.[43] On January 6, 2014, it was announced that Saban Brands Lifestyle Group acquired Mambo Graphics.[44] On March 24, 2015, it was announced that Saban Brands Lifestyle Group had acquired Piping Hot.[45]

Saban Music Group[edit]
Saban Music Group was formed in 1980 by music and television producers Haim Saban[7] and Shuki Levy as "Saban Records", a U.S. subsidiary of "Saban International Paris" (now SIP Animation). In 1986, Warner Communications acquired Saban Records first catalog of music for about $6 million.[8] On October 4, 2010, Bug Music acquired the worldwide rights to Saban Music Group’s complete music catalog of theme songs, cues and scores from more than 90 television series and 100 made-for-television films and specials.[9]
History[edit]
In October 2006, SCG's Saban Entertainment Group division announced the beginning of its virtual studio program for starting up and developing family entertainment.[10] In March 2007, Univision Communications was sold to Broadcasting Media Partners which includes Saban Capital Group, Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, TPG Capital, and Thomas H. Lee Partners.[4] On October 17, 2011, Saban Capital Group acquired 7.5% stake in Jakarta-based Indonesian largest integrated media company, Media Nusantara Citra.[11][12][13] In July 2012, Saban Capital Group acquired minority stake in PT MNC Sky Vision Tbk, the largest pay-TV operator in Indonesia which owns Indovision and Top TV.[14] In June 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures LLC, a SCG affiliate, jointly with Konami's 4K Acquisition Corp. purchased some of the key assets of 4Kids Entertainment with Kidsco getting the Dragon Ball Z Kai, Cubix, Sonic X and The CW Network's Saturday Morning programming block contract rights.[15] In August 2012, Saban Capital Group launched a new music publishing division called "Music Ventures".[16]
On May 6, 2014, Saban Capital announced the launch of Saban Films, a distribution unit that will acquire yearly 8 to 10 feature films for the North American market.[17]
Saban Brands[edit]
On May 5, 2010, Saban Capital Group announced that it would start Saban Brands (SB), a successor company to Saban Entertainment dedicated to acquiring entertainment and consumer brands.[2] On May 12, 2010, it was announced that Saban Brands bought back the Power Rangers franchise from Disney for $43 million[18] and would produce a new nineteenth season of Power Rangers that began airing on Nickelodeon on February 7, 2011, with the previous 700 episodes being rerun on Nicktoons.[3][19] It was also announced that Saban Brands is in negotiations to buy three other brands.[20] On August 17, 2010, it was announced that Saban Brands bought Paul Frank Industries.[21][22]
On May 1, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures LLC, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, placed a bid to acquire some of 4Kids Entertainment's assets, including the US rights to the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise and The CW4Kids block, for $10 million.[23] 4K Acquisition Corp, a subsidiary of Konami, then placed a bid. On June 5, 2012, 4Kids commenced an auction between Kidsco and 4K Acquisition which was then adjourned so 4Kids, Kidsco, and 4K Acquisition could consider an alternative transaction.[24][25] On June 15, 2012, 4Kids filed a notice outlining a proposed deal in which its assets would be divided between Kidsco and 4K Acquisition which was finalized on June 26, 2012. The deal saw 4K Acquisition acquire the US rights to the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise and Kidsco acquire 4Kids' other assets including the agreements for Dragon Ball Z Kai, Cubix: Robots for Everyone, Sonic X and The CW Network's Saturday morning programming block.[26][27] On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, would begin programming the block in the fall,[28][29][30][31] and on July 12, 2012 announced that the block would be named Vortexx, which launched on August 25, 2012 and ended on September 27, 2014.[32][33]
On June 12, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands plans to reintroduce the Popples franchise with new merchandise in fall 2013.[34] On August 3, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands acquired The Playforge, the development team behind App Store success stories Zombie Farm and Zombie Life.[35] On September 19, 2012, Saban Brands announced that they acquired Zui provider of Kid-Safe Online content.[36] On September 25, 2012, Saban Brands announced that they re-acquired the Digimon franchise and its most recent season, Digimon Fusion with Toei Animation handling Asian licensing & distribution and MarVista Entertainment handling all other global licensing & distribution.[37][38]
On July 3, 2013, it was announced that Saban Brands signed a deal to manage the distribution, licensing, and merchandising of Sendokai Champions in North America and Israel and be broadcast on the Vortexx.[39] In October 2013, Saban Brands shut down The Playforge because of poor game sales.[40]
Saban Brands and Lionsgate Films announced in May 2014 that they are planning to produce a new Power Rangers feature film, and would hopefully launch a Power Rangers film franchise.[41] By August 4, Saban Brands sold KidZui to Leapfrog Enterprises.[42] Later on, Macbeth Footwear was acquired by Saban Brands, and in December, Saban Brands formed two divisions Saban Brands Lifestyle Group and Saban Brands Entertainment Group to expand their holdings.[43] On January 6, 2014, it was announced that Saban Brands Lifestyle Group acquired Mambo Graphics.[44] On March 24, 2015, it was announced that Saban Brands Lifestyle Group had acquired Piping Hot.[45]

Saban Music Group was formed in 1980 by music and television producers Haim Saban[7] and Shuki Levy as "Saban Records", a U.S. subsidiary of "Saban International Paris" (now SIP Animation). In 1986, Warner Communications acquired Saban Records first catalog of music for about $6 million.[8] On October 4, 2010, Bug Music acquired the worldwide rights to Saban Music Group’s complete music catalog of theme songs, cues and scores from more than 90 television series and 100 made-for-television films and specials.[9]
History[edit]
In October 2006, SCG's Saban Entertainment Group division announced the beginning of its virtual studio program for starting up and developing family entertainment.[10] In March 2007, Univision Communications was sold to Broadcasting Media Partners which includes Saban Capital Group, Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, TPG Capital, and Thomas H. Lee Partners.[4] On October 17, 2011, Saban Capital Group acquired 7.5% stake in Jakarta-based Indonesian largest integrated media company, Media Nusantara Citra.[11][12][13] In July 2012, Saban Capital Group acquired minority stake in PT MNC Sky Vision Tbk, the largest pay-TV operator in Indonesia which owns Indovision and Top TV.[14] In June 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures LLC, a SCG affiliate, jointly with Konami's 4K Acquisition Corp. purchased some of the key assets of 4Kids Entertainment with Kidsco getting the Dragon Ball Z Kai, Cubix, Sonic X and The CW Network's Saturday Morning programming block contract rights.[15] In August 2012, Saban Capital Group launched a new music publishing division called "Music Ventures".[16]
On May 6, 2014, Saban Capital announced the launch of Saban Films, a distribution unit that will acquire yearly 8 to 10 feature films for the North American market.[17]
Saban Brands[edit]
On May 5, 2010, Saban Capital Group announced that it would start Saban Brands (SB), a successor company to Saban Entertainment dedicated to acquiring entertainment and consumer brands.[2] On May 12, 2010, it was announced that Saban Brands bought back the Power Rangers franchise from Disney for $43 million[18] and would produce a new nineteenth season of Power Rangers that began airing on Nickelodeon on February 7, 2011, with the previous 700 episodes being rerun on Nicktoons.[3][19] It was also announced that Saban Brands is in negotiations to buy three other brands.[20] On August 17, 2010, it was announced that Saban Brands bought Paul Frank Industries.[21][22]
On May 1, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures LLC, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, placed a bid to acquire some of 4Kids Entertainment's assets, including the US rights to the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise and The CW4Kids block, for $10 million.[23] 4K Acquisition Corp, a subsidiary of Konami, then placed a bid. On June 5, 2012, 4Kids commenced an auction between Kidsco and 4K Acquisition which was then adjourned so 4Kids, Kidsco, and 4K Acquisition could consider an alternative transaction.[24][25] On June 15, 2012, 4Kids filed a notice outlining a proposed deal in which its assets would be divided between Kidsco and 4K Acquisition which was finalized on June 26, 2012. The deal saw 4K Acquisition acquire the US rights to the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise and Kidsco acquire 4Kids' other assets including the agreements for Dragon Ball Z Kai, Cubix: Robots for Everyone, Sonic X and The CW Network's Saturday morning programming block.[26][27] On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, would begin programming the block in the fall,[28][29][30][31] and on July 12, 2012 announced that the block would be named Vortexx, which launched on August 25, 2012 and ended on September 27, 2014.[32][33]
On June 12, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands plans to reintroduce the Popples franchise with new merchandise in fall 2013.[34] On August 3, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands acquired The Playforge, the development team behind App Store success stories Zombie Farm and Zombie Life.[35] On September 19, 2012, Saban Brands announced that they acquired Zui provider of Kid-Safe Online content.[36] On September 25, 2012, Saban Brands announced that they re-acquired the Digimon franchise and its most recent season, Digimon Fusion with Toei Animation handling Asian licensing & distribution and MarVista Entertainment handling all other global licensing & distribution.[37][38]
On July 3, 2013, it was announced that Saban Brands signed a deal to manage the distribution, licensing, and merchandising of Sendokai Champions in North America and Israel and be broadcast on the Vortexx.[39] In October 2013, Saban Brands shut down The Playforge because of poor game sales.[40]
Saban Brands and Lionsgate Films announced in May 2014 that they are planning to produce a new Power Rangers feature film, and would hopefully launch a Power Rangers film franchise.[41] By August 4, Saban Brands sold KidZui to Leapfrog Enterprises.[42] Later on, Macbeth Footwear was acquired by Saban Brands, and in December, Saban Brands formed two divisions Saban Brands Lifestyle Group and Saban Brands Entertainment Group to expand their holdings.[43] On January 6, 2014, it was announced that Saban Brands Lifestyle Group acquired Mambo Graphics.[44] On March 24, 2015, it was announced that Saban Brands Lifestyle Group had acquired Piping Hot.[45]

Saban Music Group[edit]
Saban Music Group was formed in 1980 by music and television producers Haim Saban[7] and Shuki Levy as "Saban Records", a U.S. subsidiary of "Saban International Paris" (now SIP Animation). In 1986, Warner Communications acquired Saban Records first catalog of music for about $6 million.[8] On October 4, 2010, Bug Music acquired the worldwide rights to Saban Music Group’s complete music catalog of theme songs, cues and scores from more than 90 television series and 100 made-for-television films and specials.[9]
History[edit]
In October 2006, SCG's Saban Entertainment Group division announced the beginning of its virtual studio program for starting up and developing family entertainment.[10] In March 2007, Univision Communications was sold to Broadcasting Media Partners which includes Saban Capital Group, Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, TPG Capital, and Thomas H. Lee Partners.[4] On October 17, 2011, Saban Capital Group acquired 7.5% stake in Jakarta-based Indonesian largest integrated media company, Media Nusantara Citra.[11][12][13] In July 2012, Saban Capital Group acquired minority stake in PT MNC Sky Vision Tbk, the largest pay-TV operator in Indonesia which owns Indovision and Top TV.[14] In June 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures LLC, a SCG affiliate, jointly with Konami's 4K Acquisition Corp. purchased some of the key assets of 4Kids Entertainment with Kidsco getting the Dragon Ball Z Kai, Cubix, Sonic X and The CW Network's Saturday Morning programming block contract rights.[15] In August 2012, Saban Capital Group launched a new music publishing division called "Music Ventures".[16]
On May 6, 2014, Saban Capital announced the launch of Saban Films, a distribution unit that will acquire yearly 8 to 10 feature films for the North American market.[17]
Saban Brands[edit]
On May 5, 2010, Saban Capital Group announced that it would start Saban Brands (SB), a successor company to Saban Entertainment dedicated to acquiring entertainment and consumer brands.[2] On May 12, 2010, it was announced that Saban Brands bought back the Power Rangers franchise from Disney for $43 million[18] and would produce a new nineteenth season of Power Rangers that began airing on Nickelodeon on February 7, 2011, with the previous 700 episodes being rerun on Nicktoons.[3][19] It was also announced that Saban Brands is in negotiations to buy three other brands.[20] On August 17, 2010, it was announced that Saban Brands bought Paul Frank Industries.[21][22]
On May 1, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures LLC, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, placed a bid to acquire some of 4Kids Entertainment's assets, including the US rights to the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise and The CW4Kids block, for $10 million.[23] 4K Acquisition Corp, a subsidiary of Konami, then placed a bid. On June 5, 2012, 4Kids commenced an auction between Kidsco and 4K Acquisition which was then adjourned so 4Kids, Kidsco, and 4K Acquisition could consider an alternative transaction.[24][25] On June 15, 2012, 4Kids filed a notice outlining a proposed deal in which its assets would be divided between Kidsco and 4K Acquisition which was finalized on June 26, 2012. The deal saw 4K Acquisition acquire the US rights to the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise and Kidsco acquire 4Kids' other assets including the agreements for Dragon Ball Z Kai, Cubix: Robots for Everyone, Sonic X and The CW Network's Saturday morning programming block.[26][27] On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, would begin programming the block in the fall,[28][29][30][31] and on July 12, 2012 announced that the block would be named Vortexx, which launched on August 25, 2012 and ended on September 27, 2014.[32][33]
On June 12, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands plans to reintroduce the Popples franchise with new merchandise in fall 2013.[34] On August 3, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands acquired The Playforge, the development team behind App Store success stories Zombie Farm and Zombie Life.[35] On September 19, 2012, Saban Brands announced that they acquired Zui provider of Kid-Safe Online content.[36] On September 25, 2012, Saban Brands announced that they re-acquired the Digimon franchise and its most recent season, Digimon Fusion with Toei Animation handling Asian licensing & distribution and MarVista Entertainment handling all other global licensing & distribution.[37][38]
On July 3, 2013, it was announced that Saban Brands signed a deal to manage the distribution, licensing, and merchandising of Sendokai Champions in North America and Israel and be broadcast on the Vortexx.[39] In October 2013, Saban Brands shut down The Playforge because of poor game sales.[40]
Saban Brands and Lionsgate Films announced in May 2014 that they are planning to produce a new Power Rangers feature film, and would hopefully launch a Power Rangers film franchise.[41] By August 4, Saban Brands sold KidZui to Leapfrog Enterprises.[42] Later on, Macbeth Footwear was acquired by Saban Brands, and in December, Saban Brands formed two divisions Saban Brands Lifestyle Group and Saban Brands Entertainment Group to expand their holdings.[43] On January 6, 2014, it was announced that Saban Brands Lifestyle Group acquired Mambo Graphics.[44] On March 24, 2015, it was announced that Saban Brands Lifestyle Group had acquired Piping Hot.[45]

Saban Music Group[edit]
Saban Music Group was formed in 1980 by music and television producers Haim Saban[7] and Shuki Levy as "Saban Records", a U.S. subsidiary of "Saban International Paris" (now SIP Animation). In 1986, Warner Communications acquired Saban Records first catalog of music for about $6 million.[8] On October 4, 2010, Bug Music acquired the worldwide rights to Saban Music Group’s complete music catalog of theme songs, cues and scores from more than 90 television series and 100 made-for-television films and specials.[9]
History[edit]
In October 2006, SCG's Saban Entertainment Group division announced the beginning of its virtual studio program for starting up and developing family entertainment.[10] In March 2007, Univision Communications was sold to Broadcasting Media Partners which includes Saban Capital Group, Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners, TPG Capital, and Thomas H. Lee Partners.[4] On October 17, 2011, Saban Capital Group acquired 7.5% stake in Jakarta-based Indonesian largest integrated media company, Media Nusantara Citra.[11][12][13] In July 2012, Saban Capital Group acquired minority stake in PT MNC Sky Vision Tbk, the largest pay-TV operator in Indonesia which owns Indovision and Top TV.[14] In June 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures LLC, a SCG affiliate, jointly with Konami's 4K Acquisition Corp. purchased some of the key assets of 4Kids Entertainment with Kidsco getting the Dragon Ball Z Kai, Cubix, Sonic X and The CW Network's Saturday Morning programming block contract rights.[15] In August 2012, Saban Capital Group launched a new music publishing division called "Music Ventures".[16]
On May 6, 2014, Saban Capital announced the launch of Saban Films, a distribution unit that will acquire yearly 8 to 10 feature films for the North American market.[17]
Saban Brands[edit]
On May 5, 2010, Saban Capital Group announced that it would start Saban Brands (SB), a successor company to Saban Entertainment dedicated to acquiring entertainment and consumer brands.[2] On May 12, 2010, it was announced that Saban Brands bought back the Power Rangers franchise from Disney for $43 million[18] and would produce a new nineteenth season of Power Rangers that began airing on Nickelodeon on February 7, 2011, with the previous 700 episodes being rerun on Nicktoons.[3][19] It was also announced that Saban Brands is in negotiations to buy three other brands.[20] On August 17, 2010, it was announced that Saban Brands bought Paul Frank Industries.[21][22]
On May 1, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures LLC, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, placed a bid to acquire some of 4Kids Entertainment's assets, including the US rights to the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise and The CW4Kids block, for $10 million.[23] 4K Acquisition Corp, a subsidiary of Konami, then placed a bid. On June 5, 2012, 4Kids commenced an auction between Kidsco and 4K Acquisition which was then adjourned so 4Kids, Kidsco, and 4K Acquisition could consider an alternative transaction.[24][25] On June 15, 2012, 4Kids filed a notice outlining a proposed deal in which its assets would be divided between Kidsco and 4K Acquisition which was finalized on June 26, 2012. The deal saw 4K Acquisition acquire the US rights to the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise and Kidsco acquire 4Kids' other assets including the agreements for Dragon Ball Z Kai, Cubix: Robots for Everyone, Sonic X and The CW Network's Saturday morning programming block.[26][27] On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, would begin programming the block in the fall,[28][29][30][31] and on July 12, 2012 announced that the block would be named Vortexx, which launched on August 25, 2012 and ended on September 27, 2014.[32][33]
On June 12, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands plans to reintroduce the Popples franchise with new merchandise in fall 2013.[34] On August 3, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands acquired The Playforge, the development team behind App Store success stories Zombie Farm and Zombie Life.[35] On September 19, 2012, Saban Brands announced that they acquired Zui provider of Kid-Safe Online content.[36] On September 25, 2012, Saban Brands announced that they re-acquired the Digimon franchise and its most recent season, Digimon Fusion with Toei Animation handling Asian licensing & distribution and MarVista Entertainment handling all other global licensing & distribution.[37][38]
On July 3, 2013, it was announced that Saban Brands signed a deal to manage the distribution, licensing, and merchandising of Sendokai Champions in North America and Israel and be broadcast on the Vortexx.[39] In October 2013, Saban Brands shut down The Playforge because of poor game sales.[40]
Saban Brands and Lionsgate Films announced in May 2014 that they are planning to produce a new Power Rangers feature film, and would hopefully launch a Power Rangers film franchise.[41] By August 4, Saban Brands sold KidZui to Leapfrog Enterprises.[42] Later on, Macbeth Footwear was acquired by Saban Brands, and in December, Saban Brands formed two divisions Saban Brands Lifestyle Group and Saban Brands Entertainment Group to expand their holdings.[43] On January 6, 2014, it was announced that Saban Brands Lifestyle Group acquired Mambo Graphics.[44] On March 24, 2015, it was announced that Saban Brands Lifestyle Group had acquired Piping Hot.[45]

Saban Capital Acquisition Corp. Announces Pricing of $235,000,000 Initial Public Offering | Business Wire


























































Saban Capital Acquisition Corp. Announces Pricing of $235,000,000 
      Initial Public Offering






September 16, 2016 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Saban Capital Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”), a blank check company 
      formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset 
      acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business 
      combination with one or more businesses, today announced the pricing of 
      its initial public offering of 23,500,000 units at a price of $10.00 per 
      unit. The units will be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and trade 
      under the ticker symbol “SCACU” beginning September 16, 2016. Each unit 
      consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant, each 
      whole warrant enabling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A 
      ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. Once the securities 
      comprising the units begin separate trading, the Class A ordinary shares 
      and warrants are expected to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market 
      under the symbols “SCAC” and “SCACW,” respectively.
    

      Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are serving as 
      the underwriters for the offering. The Company has granted the 
      underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 
      units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments, if 
      any.
    

      The offering is being made only by means of a prospectus. When 
      available, copies of the prospectus related to this offering may be 
      obtained from Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Attn.: Prospectus Group, 60 
      Wall Street, New York, NY 10005-2836, email: prospectus.CPDG@db.com, 
      tel: (800) 503-4611; and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Attention: Prospectus 
      Department, 200 West Street, New York, NY 10282, or by telephone 
      toll-free at 1-866-471-2526 or by email at prospectus-ny@ny.email.gs.com.
    

      A registration statement relating to the securities has been declared 
      effective by the SEC on September 15, 2016. This press release shall not 
      constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor 
      shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction 
      in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to 
      registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such 
      state or jurisdiction.
    

      This press release contains statements that constitute “forward-looking 
      statements,” including with respect to the proposed initial public 
      offering and the anticipated use of the net proceeds. No assurance can 
      be given that the offering discussed above will be completed on the 
      terms described, or at all, or that the net proceeds of the offering 
      will be used as indicated. Forward-looking statements are subject to 
      numerous conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the 
      Company, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of the 
      Company’s registration statement and preliminary prospectus for the 
      Company’s offering filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
      (“SEC”). Copies of these documents are available on the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov. 
      The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for 
      revisions or changes after the date of this release, except as required 
      by law.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
