                                A PeopleClaim letter-rating represents our opinion of a company’s reliability based
                                on, among other factors, their response to complaints filed by PeopleClaim users.
                                Higher ratings generally reflect a history of constructively responding to all complaints
                                filed through our system, or no history of claims filed against the company through
                                PeopleClaim. See Terms of Use

                                WeCare is PeopleClaim's business-friendly interactive profile that lets you connect
                                with customers and resolve their problems. Turn lemons to lemonade: if a complaint
                                posts and you resolve the problem, the complaint is removed and the customer is
                                asked to leave a positive comment. WeCare subscribers get advance notice when a
                                negative comment is submitted, plus a quarantine period before it posts – time to
                                make contact and resolve the problem, so the complaint never posts. And there's
                                more.
