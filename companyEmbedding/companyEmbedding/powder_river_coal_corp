Description:
We were originally incorporated on October 9, 2009 under the laws of the State of Florida as Freedom Formulations, LLC.  On July 20, 2010 Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation were filed with the Florida Secretary of State converting the form of the company to a C corporation with par value of $.0000001 and the total authorized capital stock to 50,000,000,000 common shares.  Since inception, we have engaged in marketing KC 9000.  We have office space at 531 Airport North Office Park, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46825.  THG currently only requires minimal office space.  In light of present economic circumstances, we have no plans for the need for expansion of corporate office space. We do not consider our company to be a blank check company as such term is defined in Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 419 and we do not have any intention to engage in a reverse merger with any entity in an unrelated industry.Our business is focused on the sale petroleum treatment products throughout the Midwest United States and principally the state of Kansas. We provide marketing of KC 9000 primarily to independent producers, refiners of petroleum products and other market participants. The market we serve, which begins at the point of oil production and extends to the point of distribution to the customer, is commonly referred to as the midstream market. We market petroleum treatment products to markets primarily in the Midwest, ensuring that our customers have consistent access to petroleum treatment products. Our strategically located sale efforts are well positioned to benefit from the continuing need for petroleum treatment products from areas of supply to areas of demand.  As we have engaged in limited business operations, we do not have any dependence on one or a few major customers.  Although the market for petroleum treatment products is highly competitive, we are not aware of any person or entity that has a product that performs like the principal product that we market, KC 9000.Titan Holding Group specializes in marketing KC 9000 that specifically show the ability to effectively reduce the viscosity of crude oil classified as heavy oil, (i.e. API gravity of less than 22) and reduces the amounts of water and solids from the crude oil prior to transportation to a refinery. To date, we have only chosen to market KC 9000, a proprietary product owned by Freedom Energy Holdings, Inc.  Our company is an authorized seller of KC 9000 by agreement and we intend to continue marketing the product with the intention of generating revenue for the company.  KC 9000 is a proprietary blend of ingredients that has been shown to be very effective in the areas in which we are focusing, including reduction of viscosity of Heavy oil and the reduction of water and solids from the crude oil prior to transport.There presently is no specific statute or regulation that governs our handling or application of KC 9000.  As the chemicals utilized to create KC 9000 are nonhazardous and readily available from numerous suppliers, we do not anticipate the existence of any regulatory impediments in the immediate future that would negatively impact our ability to market the KC 9000 product.Our current daily operations are handled by our CEO, who handles any incoming calls which are referred by Freedom Energy Holdings, Inc. Our company since inception has reached out to a number of oil producers that have used the KC 9000 supplied by Freedom Energy.  Follow up calls are made to these oil producers soliciting further orders of the KC 9000 which is currently the only product that we offer.  Continued research is conducted by way of the internet seeking for potential leads that would facilitate further sales efforts. In addition, our CEO also continues to search for other products to compliment the companys product line. Currently this is a full description of the daily operations for the Company.

Top-producing Powder River Basin coal mines in Q2'14

Production from the largest active Powder River Basin coal mines totaled 99.63 million tons in the second quarter, according to an SNL Energy analysis of U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration data, down from the previous quarter as railroad transportation issues stymied demand.
First-quarter production from the PRB mines totaled 101.17 million tons. The second-quarter production total represented a 3.2% increase over the 96.58 million tons produced in the second quarter of 2013.
Ten of the 16 PRB mines reported higher production in the second quarter than the year-ago quarter. Production from the mines in the 12 months ended in the second quarter totaled 412.66 million tons, down 0.4% from the 414.44 million tons produced in the year-ago period.

A shift away from 8,400 Btu/lb coal is taking place in the PRB as coal producers focus their capital expenditures on developing their higher-quality, 8,800 Btu/lb mines. Cloud Peak Energy Inc.'s Cordero Rojo mine, which produces 8,423 Btu/lb coal, produced 36.08 million tons in the 12 months ended in the second quarter, down 4.5% compared to the year-ago period. Cloud Peak is reducing production at Cordero Rojo by about 10 million tons per year starting in 2015.
According to SNL Energy over-the-counter market survey data, 2015 PRB 8,800 Btu/lb coal was priced at $12.62/ton as of Aug. 5. The 2015 8,400 Btu/lb coal product was priced at $10.14/ton.
"There is quite a spread at the moment," Cloud Peak President and CEO Colin Marshall said during the company's second-quarter earnings call July 29. "I'd look at it and say, Well, I'm glad we're not trying to sell those tons into next year because I think at the moment the prices aren't that attractive. So, it reinforces why we made the decision [to cut production at Cordero Rojo], and we think that being able to deploy those assets to the dragline and some other assets around the business will give us the best return."
Marshall said Cloud Peak is benefiting from the plans to cascade equipment from Cordero Rojo to the other mine sites. The company spent just $2.6 million in capital expenditures in the second quarter, almost entirely associated with ensuring the ongoing integrity of its existing equipment.
Peabody Energy Corp.'s Caballo mine, which produces 8,500 Btu/lb coal, also has seen production totals decline. The mine, which produced 24.14 million tons in 2011, has only produced 3.46 million tons in the first half of 2014. Caballo production in the 12 months ended in the second quarter totaled 8.44 million tons, down 22.3% from the 10.86 million tons produced in the year-ago period.
Alpha Natural Resources Inc.'s Belle Ayr mine, which produces 8,550 Btu/lb coal, produced 16.10 million tons in the 12 months ended in the second quarter, down 25.82% from the 21.71 million tons produced in the year-ago period.
The mines boosting production in the second quarter include Peabody's North Antelope Rochelle operation, Cloud Peak's Antelope mine and Westmoreland Coal Co.'s Absaloka mine. North Antelope, the highest-producing mine in the U.S., produced 28.46 million tons in the second quarter, up 6.6% from the 26.71 million tons produced in the year-ago quarter. Peabody also increased quarterly production year over year at its Rawhide mine in Wyoming during the quarter.
Westmoreland's Absaloka mine, buoyed by a new deal with TransAlta Centralia Generation and a newly constructed rail wye, saw production soar in the second quarter compared to the year-ago quarter despite continued rail transportation woes.
The transportation issue is likely to last into 2015, possibly weighing on PRB production totals for the remainder of the year. Some utilities are still not receivingtheir normal shipments, and several coal executives, including at Arch Coal Inc. and Cloud Peak, said rail performance was far from optimal in June and July.
"The rail performance represents the largest risk to our business," Marshall said. "The tons are sold, the customers certainly have very low stockpiles and would like to take delivery, and the mines are in good shape. We would very much like to deliver that coal in the second half and certainly as much as possible."

Powder River Coal Corp. Description



We were originally incorporated on October 9, 2009 under the laws of the State of Florida as Freedom Formulations, LLC.  On July 20, 2010 Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation were filed with the Florida Secretary of State converting the form of the company to a C corporation with par value of $.0000001 and the total authorized capital stock to 50,000,000,000 common shares.  Since inception, we have engaged in marketing KC 9000.  We have office space at 531 Airport North Office Park, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46825.  THG currently only requires minimal office space.  In light of present economic circumstances, we have no plans for the need for expansion of corporate office space. We do not consider our company to be a blank check company as such term is defined in Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 419 and we do not have any intention to engage in a reverse merger with any entity in an unrelated industry.Our business is focused on the sale petroleum treatment products throughout the Midwest United States and principally the state of Kansas. We provide marketing of KC 9000 primarily to independent producers, refiners of petroleum products and other market participants. The market we serve, which begins at the point of oil production and extends to the point of distribution to the customer, is commonly referred to as the midstream market. We market petroleum treatment products to markets primarily in the Midwest, ensuring that our customers have consistent access to petroleum treatment products. Our strategically located sale efforts are well positioned to benefit from the continuing need for petroleum treatment products from areas of supply to areas of demand.  As we have engaged in limited business operations, we do not have any dependence on one or a few major customers.  Although the market for petroleum treatment products is highly competitive, we are not aware of any person or entity that has a product that performs like the principal product that we market, KC 9000.Titan Holding Group specializes in marketing KC 9000 that specifically show the ability to effectively reduce the viscosity of crude oil classified as heavy oil, (i.e. API gravity of less than 22) and reduces the amounts of water and solids from the crude oil prior to transportation to a refinery. To date, we have only chosen to market KC 9000, a proprietary product owned by Freedom Energy Holdings, Inc.  Our company is an authorized seller of KC 9000 by agreement and we intend to continue marketing the product with the intention of generating revenue for the company.  KC 9000 is a proprietary blend of ingredients that has been shown to be very effective in the areas in which we are focusing, including reduction of viscosity of Heavy oil and the reduction of water and solids from the crude oil prior to transport.There presently is no specific statute or regulation that governs our handling or application of KC 9000.  As the chemicals utilized to create KC 9000 are nonhazardous and readily available from numerous suppliers, we do not anticipate the existence of any regulatory impediments in the immediate future that would negatively impact our ability to market the KC 9000 product.Our current daily operations are handled by our CEO, who handles any incoming calls which are referred by Freedom Energy Holdings, Inc. Our company since inception has reached out to a number of oil producers that have used the KC 9000 supplied by Freedom Energy.  Follow up calls are made to these oil producers soliciting further orders of the KC 9000 which is currently the only product that we offer.  Continued research is conducted by way of the internet seeking for potential leads that would facilitate further sales efforts. In addition, our CEO also continues to search for other products to compliment the companys product line. Currently this is a full description of the daily operations for the Company.

Powder River Coal Corp.  f/k/a Titan Holding Group, Inc.  On October 23, 2011, Powder River Coal Corp., (f/k/a Titan Holding Group, Inc.,) terminated its contract with Freedom Energy Holdings, the company's only customer. At this date all liabilities and debts of Powder River Coal Corp., which relate to or arise out of the operations of the contract and the indemnification by Freedom Energy Holdings of all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses that may be suffered by Powder River Coal Corp. at any time which arise out of the operations of the contract.  Gains from cancellation of the contract of the discontinued operations amounted to $54,501.   On September 21, 2011, in a private equity transaction, Mr. Grant acquired the 6,000,000 (60%) shares of the company from Lanham and Lanham, LLC. The purchase price was $50,000.00 or $0.008 per share. Mr. Grant utilized his own funds for the purchase.   The major stockholder and officer advanced $7,203 to the Company for general expenses. The loan is secured by a promissory note. The terms of the note is 0% interest with no repayment schedule.     The balance due to the related parties at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was $7,203 and $41,077, respectively.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2011, the prior majority shareholder issued a note of forgiveness of debt owed to him by the Company.  The forgiveness of this obligation, in the amount of $46,850, was recognized as income and included in the discontinued operations.   Management will review these arrangements, in future period, to determine if terms are required to be formalized to reflect the economic relationship.     This still stands as the official company description given by Pink Sheets.   Business Description We were originally incorporated on October 9, 2009 under the laws of the State of Florida as Freedom Formulations, LLC. On July 20, 2010 Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation were filed with the Florida Secretary of State converting the form of the company to a C corporation with par value of $.0000001 and the total authorized capital stock to 50,000,000,000 common shares. Since inception, we have engaged in marketing KC 9000®. We have office space at 531 Airport North Office Park, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46825. THG currently only requires minimal office space. In light of present economic circumstances, we have no plans for the need for expansion of corporate office space. We do not consider our company to be a "blank check company" as such term is defined in Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 419 and we do not have any intention to engage in a reverse merger with any entity in an unrelated industry.  Our business is focused on the sale petroleum treatment products throughout the Midwest United States and principally the state of Kansas. We provide marketing of KC 9000® primarily to independent producers, refiners of petroleum products and other market participants. The market we serve, which begins at the point of oil production and extends to the point of distribution to the customer, is commonly referred to as the "midstream" market. We market petroleum treatment products to markets primarily in the Midwest, ensuring that our customers have consistent access to petroleum treatment products. Our strategically located sale efforts are well positioned to benefit from the continuing need for petroleum treatment products from areas of supply to areas of demand. As we have engaged in limited business operations, we do not have any dependence on one or a few major customers. Although the market for petroleum treatment products is highly competitive, we are not aware of any person or entity that has a product that performs like the principal product that we market, KC 9000®.   Titan Holding Group specializes in marketing KC 9000® that specifically show the ability to effectively reduce the viscosity of crude oil classified as heavy oil, (i.e. API gravity of less than 22) and reduces the amounts of water and solids from the crude oil prior to transportation to a refinery. To date, we have only chosen to market KC 9000®, a proprietary product owned by Freedom Energy Holdings, Inc. Our company is an authorized seller of KC 9000® by agreement and we intend to continue marketing the product with the intention of generating revenue for the company. KC 9000® is a proprietary blend of ingredients that has been shown to be very effective in the areas in which we are focusing, including reduction of viscosity of Heavy oil and the reduction of water and solids from the crude oil prior to transport.  There presently is no specific statute or regulation that governs our handling or application of KC 9000®. As the chemicals utilized to create KC 9000® are nonhazardous and readily available from numerous suppliers, we do not anticipate the existence of any regulatory impediments in the immediate future that would negatively impact our ability to market the KC 9000® product.  Our current daily operations are handled by our CEO, who handles any incoming calls which are referred by Freedom Energy Holdings, Inc. Our company since inception has reached out to a number of oil producers that have used the KC 9000® supplied by Freedom Energy. Follow up calls are made to these oil producers soliciting further orders of the KC 9000® which is currently the only product that we offer. Continued research is conducted by way of the internet seeking for potential leads that would facilitate further sales efforts. In addition, our CEO also continues to search for other products to compliment the company's product line. Currently this is a full description of the daily operations for the Company.

Summary Historical Production
Production by UnitProposed MinesPhotosLinksNewsDocuments 
The Powder River Basin (PRB) is a region in southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming about 120 miles east to west and 200 miles north to south known for its coal deposits. It is the single largest source of coal mined in the United States and contains one of the largest deposits of coal in the world. Most of the active coal mining in the Powder River Basin actually takes place in drainages of the Cheyenne River. Because of the Powder River Basin, Wyoming has been the top coal-producing state in the United States since 1988.
In 2007, the Powder River Basin alone produced 436 million short tons (396 million tonnes) of coal, more than twice the production of second-place West Virginia, and more than the entire Appalachian region.  Overall, the Powder River Basin accounts for about 37 percent of U.S. coal production.  The Black Thunder Mine is the most productive coal mine in the United States; in 2006 this single mine produced 84 million metric tons of coal, more than any state except Wyoming, West Virginia, and Kentucky.
The majority of the coal mined in the PRB is part of the Fort Union Formation. Because of its low sulfur and fly ash content, this coal is exported outside the region and supplies of the coal in the region makes it very desirable. Coal supplies about half of the United States electricity supplies, with the PRB mines supplying around 40% of the coal that fuels those stations, mainly to the east of the Rocky Mountains.
Reassessment of the Gillette field

Virtually all the coal mined in the Powder River Basin (431 million tons out of the 436 million tons mined in the entire basin in 2006) comes from the Gillette field. In 2008 the U.S. Geological Survey released a detailed assessment of the coal resource in the Gillette field. USGS concluded that the portion of the recoverable coal that can be mined, processed, and marketed at a profit, based on conditions in 2007, including $10.47 per ton and assuming an 8 percent rate of return, is 10.1 billion short tons for the six coal beds evaluated. This is about half the estimate arrived at by a 2002 study of the same field, which arrived at an economically recoverable resource of 23 billion short tons. However, if the price of coal is assumed to be $14.00 per ton, matching the sales price of coal for the Gillette coalfield as of March 2008, the reserve would be 18.5 billion short tons, assuming no increase from 2007 operating costs. If cost per ton rose to $60, the estimated reserve would rise to 77 billion short tons.

Pace Coal Project, Judith Basin County, MTThe Pace Coal Project was originally tested by Mobil Oil in 1979.  At that time, 45 samples were taken, which showed that the coal was high volatility bituminous, a higher grade of coal than normal in the Powder River Basin.  In April 2010, American Power Corp. acquired the land associated with the project.  It is believed that the mine could hold 410 million tons of coal.
Buckskin Mine Hay Creek II extension (proposed)The Buckskin Mine Hay Creek II proposed mine is an extension of the existing Buckskin Mine.  
Red Lodge Mine (Proposed)In February 2010, Management Energy Inc., a California coal startup, amassed leases on more than 10 square miles of land to build new coal mines in south-central Montana, near Red Lodge, in partnership with Tennessee coal entrepreneur John Baugues Jr.[4].
Otter Creek Mine (proposed)In March 2010 Arch Coal made a successful bid of $85.8 million for the right to mine about 8,300 acres of state-owned minerals in the Otter Creek Tracts in southeastern Montana. The company said the land is a strategic platform for future growth in the Northern Powder River Basin. The company controls about 1.5 billion tons of coal reserves in Montana’s Otter Creek area.[5]
The state of Montana Land Board has been looking to lease 616 million tons of coal reserves known as Otter Creek, which it received from the Federal Government at the beginning of the decade. The State Board of Land Commissioners made the initial decision on December 21, 2009. Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer, a proponent of coal development, sits on the board along with other Montana officials.[6][7]

More bad news for Ambre: Army Corps pauses Morrow Pacific review 
September 15, 2014
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has placed a hold on Ambre Energy Limited’s application to construct a barge loading terminal at the Port of Morrow in Oregon.  Ambre proposed this facility to export coal mined in the Powder River Basin to asian markets to offset flagging domestic demand.
The proposed terminal has faced harsh criticism in Oregon, where some see the coal exports as a threat to the Columbia river and the communities situated near it.

Rail congestion expected to plague Powder River Basin coal into late 2014May 22, 2014
The Powder River Basin is expected to face severe rail congestion until at least late 2014 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Despite the frigid winter and an increased demand for coal to restock pile utilities, the delays from winter weather have created a backlog of coal shipments. Additionally, a shorter harvest season and the boom in domestic oil production created the increased need for rail cars. All of these factors have cause severe delays in rail deliveries out of the Powder River Basin.
Mines like Arch Coal are seeing this first hand such as at the Black Thunder mine where the company will be trying to fulfill their orders throughout the remainder of 2014.

China Targets 70 Gigawatts of Solar Power to Cut Coal RelianceMay 19, 2014
As Washington state governor Jay Inslee recently stated that he looks to wean Washington state utilities off of coal completely, China publicly released a plan last week to speed up their solar power development. This is in response to the devastating pollution caused as a result of coal consumption in China and the growing public pressure to switch to more clean burning power.
In combination, these decisions could have a major long-term impact on the coal companies of the Powder River Basin whom rely heavily on coal exports to the Chinese market as well as utilities in the nearby Northwest.

Powder River Basin Coal: Unions Getting the SqueezeMay 14, 2014
Union workers are facing dire prospects in maintaining their unions in the Powder River Basin coal-mines. Of the 16 coal-mines operating in the Powder River Basin, only 3 are still unionized. Additionally all 3 of these remaining unions primarily work on reclaiming mined land, rather than on high volume producing coal mines.
This shrinking of unionization in the Powder River coal beds highlights the goal of the coal companies to keep the union out of the highest grossing and most productive mines.

Montana lawmaker criticizes Washington’s coal-power planMay 12, 2014
Washington state recently proposed to curb carbon pollution by eliminating imports of coal-fired power. Though coal only accounts for 13 percent of Washington’s electricity, coal accounts for almost 80 percent of the Washington utilities’ emissions of carbon dioxide.
In response, U.S. Representative Steve Daines has directly addressed Washington governor Jay Inslee to override this proposal. Daines stated that limiting imports of coal would significantly harm Montana jobs and the economy of the entire state.

Morning Energy Roundup: A bad start to 2014 for Wyoming coalMay 1, 2014
At the close of the first quarter of 2014, the four largest coal companies working in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming all posted losses. The reasons being attributed for these losses are the bad weather and rail interruptions that have slowed down the shipments of coal out of Wyoming.
Nevertheless, coal executives with Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Cloud Peak Energy and Peabody are all optimistic that next year will see significant improvement in contrast to the losses incurred during this first quarter of 2014.

U.S., Chinese relations strengthen through coalApril 28, 2014
Chinese delegates recently visited the Cordero Rojo mine in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin as part of a three-day tour of Wyoming to increase U.S., Chinese relations. The visit highlights China’s demand for American coal and the massive growth of the energy sector in China.
China is the biggest coal customer in the world and uses four times the amount of coal annually as the United States at over 4 billion tons of coal a year. The government affairs manager for Cloud Peak Energy, Jason Begger emphasized the biggest challenge in getting Wyoming coal into the hands of the Chinese is the challenges of exporting the coal out of the northwest. This article underlines the point that the supply of Wyoming coal is contributing to the vast economic growth of China’s industrialization.
