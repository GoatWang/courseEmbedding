	TELEHEALTHCARE, INC.







	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	MARCH 31, 2017




	(UNAUDITED)



	 



	NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION



	 


	TeleHealthCare, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on December 10, 2012. The Company develops platforms in the telehealth industry. Its first platform the Company developed is called CarePanda. Currently, CarePanda set up as a division of TeleHealthCare. CarePanda is an online software that helps people, family members and caregivers manage, share and control their own, their family's or their customers’ healthcare information. CarePanda links people and healthcare information together at the point of care and works on multiple platforms including Internet enabled devices and mobile phones. The Company plans to develop similar platforms for clients.


	 


	CarePanda is easy to use and has unique tools and features such as online document library, fax services and text messaging and is not dependent on electronic transfer of health information. CarePanda looks beyond healthcare and focuses on tools that help people manage their lives and care for others including, contact lists, medication lists, home inventory, emergency planning, medical bill management and many other features. CarePanda solves a number of social and healthcare industry problems including changes in healthcare regulations, socio-demographics of an aging population, growing shortage of healthcare workers and impact of "Obama Care".


	 


	On Feb 8th, 2017, the company announced its first contract with Mission Treatment and Recovery based in San Juan Capistrano, CA. Mission Treatment and Recovery is TLLT's first pilot program to use the CarePanda App beginning in August 2016 and signed an annual agreement to use the CarePanda platform on full time basis for their entire staff and facility.


	 



	NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	Basis of Accounting



	 


	The Company’s financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a September 30, fiscal year-end.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company recognizes revenue when service have been provided or delivered, the monthly subscription fees charged are fixed or determinable. Customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions, and collectability is reasonable assured.


	 


	We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received in advance of our performance.


	 



	Cash Equivalents



	 


	For purposes of the balance sheet and statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of sis months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.


	 



	Stock-based Compensation and stock warrant expense



	 


	The Company follows ASC 718-10, Stock Compensation, which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized. Grants of stock to non-employees and other parties are accounted for in accordance with the ASC 505. Stock-based compensation expense is $42,611 and $220,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Stock warrant expense is $2,685,920 and $0 for six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	 


	Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 260.


	 



	Loss per Share



	 


	The basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Diluted loss per share are the same as basic earnings loss per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company.


	 



	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures



	 


	ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:


	 


	Level 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 


	 


	Level 2 - Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 


	 


	Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 


	 


	The Company’s adoption of fair value measurements and disclosures did not have a material impact on the financial statements and financial statement disclosures.


	 


	The fair value of stock options issued is estimated at the date of issue using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions such as the expected stock price volatility and the expected period until options are exercised.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC 740,

	Income Taxes

	. A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities.


	 


	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.


	 


	No provision was made for Federal or State income taxes.

	Long-Lived Assets



	 


	Management assesses the carrying values of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives. Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment, management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to the extent possible. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. Additionally, if the Company does not have historical operating experience asset carrying amounts are expensed. For the six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not recognize any impairments for its long-lived assets. Management believes these intangible assets will continue to be utilized by the Company to generate revenues. 


	 


	Our intellectual property is comprised of indefinite-lived brand name acquired and have been assigned an indefinite life as we currently anticipate that these brand names will contribute cash flows to the Company perpetually. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. For the six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not recognize any impairments for intellectual property.


	 



	Intangible Assets



	 


	Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life. The Company monitors conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. The Company tests its intangible assets with finite lives for potential impairment whenever management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The original estimate of an asset's useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an asset's useful life or carrying value involve significant judgment. The Company has not started amortizing the intangible asset until the official launch of its website. 


	 



	Advertising



	 


	Advertising will be expensed in the period in which it is incurred. For the six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized $5,244 and $0 for advertising expenses, respectively.


	 



	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 



	 


	Leases


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The Company have early adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016.

	Stock Compensation


	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”), which modifies certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards, and classification in the statement of cash flows. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 in its first quarter of 2018. Currently, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the Company's equity awards are recorded as additional paid-in capital in its Balance Sheets. Upon adoption, the Company will record any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards in its Statements of Operations in the reporting periods in which vesting occurs. As a result, subsequent to adoption the Company's income tax expense and associated effective tax rate will be impacted by fluctuations in stock price between the grant dates and vesting dates of equity awards.


	 


	The Company reviewed all recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA, and the SEC and they did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.


	 



	NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had a negative working capital of $263,751 and an accumulated deficit of $3,454,609 at March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had not generated any significant revenue and had no committed sources of capital or financing. 


	 


	While the Company is attempting to generate revenues from telehealth platforms, the Company’s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company’s daily operations. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate additional products and revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to realize revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations or obtain adequate financing. 


	 


	The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	NOTE 4 – NOTE PAYABLE



	 


	On December 31, 2012, the Company issued a note payable to an unrelated party for $45,000. The notes are due on September 30, 2016 and have an interest rate of 6%. The principal $45,000 was paid in July 2016. As of March 31, 2017, there is $6,865 of accrued interest payable balance.


	 


	On January 1st, 2016, the Company issued a note payable to an unrelated party for $14,000. The notes are due on September 30, 2016 and have an interest rate of 10%. As of March 31, 2017, the notes are in default, there is $14,000 of principal and $1,745 of accrued interest past due.


	 


	On February 1, 2017, the Company issued a note payable to an unrelated party for $36,000. The note is due on February 1, 2018 and have an interest rate of 6%. As of March 31, 2017, there is $500 of accrued interest payable balance.

	On February 11, 2016, the Company partially completed a private placement offering to certain institutional and accredited investors pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate of 750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock resulting in gross proceeds of $75,000 to the Company. The numbers of shares are restated at 2,250,000 shares to reflect the one-for-three forward stock split filed on June 3, 2016.


	 


	On June 3, 2016, the Company filed an Articles of Amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to effect a one-for-three forward stock split (the “Forward Stock Split”) of the outstanding common stock of the Company.

As a result of the Forward Stock Split, the number of outstanding shares of the common stock increased to approximately 153,123,000. The Forward Stock Split affected all shareholders of the Company uniformly.


	 


	On August 15, 2016, the Company sold an aggregate of 250,000 shares of the Company’s common stock resulting in the gross proceeds of $25,000 to the Company associated with the private placement offering in February 2016. The numbers of shares are restated at 750,000 shares to reflect the one-for-three forward stock split filed on June 3, 2016.


	 


	On September 1, 2016, the Company granted a consultant, an option to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.1 per share. The option is exercisable as to 25% on the first quarter of the grant date and as to an additional 25% at the end of each successive fiscal quarter following the grant date.

	TeleHealthCare, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, ("TeleHealthCare" "Company" "we," "us," or "our") was incorporated on December 10, 2012. Most of the activity through March 31, 2017 involved incorporation efforts, development of our internet portal, mobile applications and preparation for this Offering.


	 


	We are a development stage company and have limited financial resources. We have not established a source of equity or debt financing. Our financial statements include a note emphasizing the uncertainty of our ability to remain as a going concern.


	 



	Company Overview



	 


	Until the end of the quarter reporting, we continued customizing our CarePanda mobile app for Apple and Android platforms. CarePanda launched in April 2016 and includes secure text and chat communication between medical professionals, nurses, staff, vendors, pharmacists, lab contacts and many others.


	 


	Based on initial pilot programs with CarePanda and customer feedback, we are evolving our business model based. Telehealth will be launching a new telehealth service, branded On.CareTM to target emerging opportunities in the telehealth market for specialty and private label telehealth services. While CarePanda connects medical clinics and specialists together, On.CareTM connects physicians, patients and insurers (billing) together. By launching both systems, TeleHealthCare will have a full service solution that customers have been asking for.


	 


	We see five key areas driving demand for telehealth services:


	 





	 





	·






	Escalating Healthcare Costs

	– Healthcare represents $3 trillion USD in costs per year (CMS.gov) in the U.S. There is an urgent and growing need to control and lower the cost of providing healthcare.

	(https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nation




	alhealthexpenddata/downloads/highlights.pdf)






	 






	 





	·






	Expanded Insured Patient Base –

	There has been a rapid rise in patient volumes as more people are insured with passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act.






	 






	 





	·






	Aging Population –

	As we age we have a higher incidence of chronic diseases. The average age of the population in the U.S. is growing resulting in an increase demand for services. It's estimated that 65 million baby boomers will become Medicare enrollees over the next decade (http://www.handsontelehealth.com/past-issues/74-why-is-telehealth-a-driving-force-in-healthcare)






	 





	 





	·






	Shortage of Medical Professionals

	– In many cities and towns throughout the U.S. there is a shortage of medical professionals, especially medical specialists. This is especially true for rural populations. This has created an imbalance of the available supply of practitioners to many areas' demand.

	Regulations –

	Although only a few regulations have passed that allow billing and adoption of telehealth services in Medicare, Medicaid or Commercial health insurance services, new regulations look to greatly expand telehealth adoption. S. 2484 called the CONNECT for Health Act, would move to waive restrictions on Medicare telehealth coverage that many consider antiquated or arbitrary. In addition to a coalition of six senators and three representatives, the bill has the support of the American Medical Association, the American Telemedicine Association, and a number of other industry groups, health systems, and tech vendors.http://mobihealthnews.com/content/latest-telemedicine-bill-could-save-18b-waiving-medicare-restrictions.





	 



	A bipartisan group of US Senators led by Brian Schatz (D-HI) has introduced new telemedicine legislation that would move to waive restrictions on Medicare telehealth coverage that many consider antiquated or arbitrary. In addition to a coalition of six senators and three representatives, the bill has the support of the American Medical Association, the American Telemedicine Association, and a number of other industry groups, health systems, and tech vendors. http://mobihealthnews.com/content/latest-telemedicine-bill-could-save-18b-waiving-


	medicare-restrictions



	 



	"Telehealth is the future of health care," Schatz said in a statement. "It saves money and improves health outcomes. Our bipartisan bill puts us on a path to transform health care delivery, making it less costly and more convenient for patients and providers."

	PRODUCTS & SERVICES:



	 


	Based on the growing market for telehealth services, TeleHealthCare will focus its energies on building an "end to end" telehealth solution company that incorporates the following services, software and devices. Many companies, including medical groups, disease management firms, mental health providers, and others find it difficult to get all these services within one solution.

	IT Services



	 


	These services offered on a 'menu' basis would include everything from setting up and managing a customer's IT network for telehealthcare; to providing training, support, setup and configuration of the telehealth services, monitoring devices, mobile apps, an EMR platform and a billing system.


	 



	Secure Video and Chat



	 


	TeleHealthCare will be offering secure, HIPAA compliant video and chat capabilities. Some customers may only want chat, others video and some both services. TeleHealthCare can integrate video and chat into a customer's existing systems.


	 



	Platform for EMR, Scheduling and Billing



	 


	While the majority of hospitals have adopted EMR systems, most disease management firms, specialty medical clinics, long term care centers, skilled nursing facilities, rehab centers and others have not yet adopted these systems. An EMR is necessary to document patient visits, manage online scheduling of telehealth services and track billing of telehealth services.


	 



	http://dashboard.healthit.gov/index.php



	 



	Monitoring Devices



	 


	To effectively monitor and manage patients in telehealth programs, especially patients with chronic care conditions, medical providers will need access to patient information gathered from remote monitoring devices that can track vital signs such as ECG, heart rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, temperature, weight, glucose levels, activity levels, etc. TeleHealthCare, Inc. will incorporate monitoring device management directly into their platform to provide vital sign history and alerts on the patient's condition. The Company will also sell certain devices to its customers.


	 



	Telehealth Programs



	 


	TeleHealthCare will develop "packaged" telehealth programs that include turn-key business plans for customers to launch a telehealth program. This includes all the organization, billing and marketing of their telehealth solution.


	 



	Telehealth Platform



	 


	Our telehealth platform will be branded as On.Care

	TM

	. The certified platform is built upon Microsoft .NET technology and is 100% SaaS based product and hosted with a secure HIPAA compliant hosting company. On.Care

	TM

	will be a web-based platform that provides very low initial investment from customers and no major upgrade charges or expensive licensing fees. On.Care

	TM

	provides flexibility to access telehealth information from anywhere and on most devices – desktops, tablets and mobile devices.


	 


	On.Care

	TM

	is designed and developed from physician input and is developed to reduce data entry and maximize physician time.

	As a corporate policy, we will not incur any cash obligations that we cannot satisfy with known resources, of which there are currently none except as described in "Liquidity" below and/or elsewhere in this prospectus. We believe that the perception that many people have of a public company make it more likely that they will accept restricted securities from a public company as consideration for indebtedness to them than they would from a private company. We have not performed any studies of this matter. Our conclusion is based on our own observations. However, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts even if we become a public entity. Additionally, the issuance of restricted shares will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of our stockholders.

	Going Concern Uncertainties




	 


	We have sufficient working capital for the next 9 months and may secure additional working capital through loans or sales of common stock. Nevertheless our auditor has issued a "going concern" qualification as part of his opinion in the Audit Report for the year ended September 30, 2016, and our unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 include a "going concern" footnote contingent on us to be able to raise working capital to grow our operations.

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 


	We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.


	 




	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements




	 


	Refer to the notes to the financial statements for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement and may be applicable to our operation, as well as those significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the current year.


	 




	Critical Accounting Policies




	 


	Our financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that they believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:



	 






	ITEM 3

	. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.



	 


	As a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item



	 






	ITEM 4

	. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.



	 




	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	:

	We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term "disclosure controls and procedures", as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of March 31, 2017, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to a reasonable assurance level of achieving such objectives. However, it should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.

	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	:

	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management's review and approval of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that:


	 





	 




	1.




	pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;














	 




	2.




	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management; and














	 




	3.




	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.





	 


	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	 


	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of these controls.


	 


	Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of March 31, 2017, our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


	 


	This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual report.


	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:


	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ending March 31, 2017, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	To the best knowledge of our sole officer and director, the Company is not a party to any legal proceeding or litigation.



	 






	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.




	 


	As a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. See the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending September 30, 2016 which identifies and discloses certain risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, those "Risk Factors" included in Item 1A of the Annual Report.



	 






	ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.




	 


	On February 10, 2017, the Company issued 7,500,000 shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of Common Stock Purchase Warrants. The exercise price of the Warrants was $0.0001.


	 


	All of the securities set forth above were issued by the Company pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the provisions of Rule 504 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. All such shares issued contained a restrictive legend and the holders confirmed that they were acquiring the shares for investment and without intent to distribute the shares. All of the purchasers were friends or business associates of the Company’s management and all were experienced in making speculative investments, understood the risks associated with investments, and could afford a loss of the entire investment. The Company did not utilize an underwriter or a placement agent for any of these offerings of its securities.

About Us

Teleheatlhcare, Inc. was founded by a team of seasoned healthcare professionals with decades of industry experience.  This team has worked collaboratively and separately on numerous telehealth projects going back to 2003. 
This hands on experience combined with the growing velocity in the adoption of telehealth led to the creation of what the principals believe is the ultimate ‘pick and shovel’ company. Teleheatlhcare, Inc. is the go to resource for those wishing to start or improve their own programs, or simply generate a new source of revenue from an existing patient base.

Our Vision

Provide the platform and foundation for telehealth solutions for medical groups, clinics, long term care centers and telemedicine companies.  Our proactive approach is the development of best business practices and promotion of products and services that will help us accomplish this.

Our Mission

We are committed as a leader in telehealthcare to help our clients improve patient care, improve quality of care and expand access to healthcare services.
Patient Care
We provide the tools to make it easy to securely communicate with your patients and your staff
Quality of Care
From online visits to monitoring biometric data, telehealth can put a program in place to help you improve quality of care of your patients.  
Access to Care
We can help patients reach additional care providers and connect physicians with patients looking to get access to specialty care.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

There are several healthcare websites that offer personal health records (Google
Health, Microsoft Health Vault), diet or health advice (WebMD, Health Grades),
healthcare portals (Med Seek) or even caregiver planning websites.

CarePanda is unique and completely different offering from these competitors.
CarePanda links people and healthcare information together at the point of care,
works on multiple platforms, solves a number of regulatory problems for
hospitals and nursing homes and is not dependent on integration with electronic
health records.

CarePanda looks at tools and features such as document libraries, fax systems,
picture libraries and text messaging that are not dependent on electronic health
records and not available on other systems. CarePanda also focuses on tools that
help people manage their lives and care including home inventory tracking,
emergency planning, medical bill management tools and much more. These unique
CarePanda solutions are not available in other competitor systems.

Company Description
TeleHealthCare, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, (“THC”) was incorporated on 
December 10, 2012. TeleHealthCare develops platforms in the telehealth industry. 
Its first platform the Company developed is called CarePanda. Currently, 
CarePanda set up as a division of TeleHealthCare. CarePanda is an


 online 
software that helps people, family members and caregivers manage, share and 
control their own, their family's or their customers healthcare information. 
CarePanda links people and healthcare information together at the point of care 
and works on multiple platforms including Internet enabled devices and mobile 
phones. The Company develops similar platforms as private label portals for 
clients.

CarePanda is easy to use and has unique tools and features such as online
document library, fax services and text messaging and is not dependent on
electronic transfer of health information. CarePanda looks beyond healthcare and
focuses on tools that help people manage their lives and care for others
including, contact lists, medication lists, home inventory, emergency planning,
medical bill management and many other features. 

CarePanda has completed the initial BETA of the product and is gathering
feedback from potential users. In early review the system requires additional
development, specifically on the design, ease of use of the application and the
unified communication tools.

CarePanda is in the process of redeveloping key features and the goal is to
re-introduce the product to BETA customers and industry experts at key
healthcare institutions later this year.

After the completion of this offering we plan to launch a market ready product
on multiple platforms (mobile, iPAD, iPhone, etc) and to create a multi-level
system that can easily be co-branded or private labeled.

It is expected to take three to four months to complete user testing. Based on
user testing, new design and product features will be added to the CarePanda
platform. This will involve designing the new features, updating the database
and developing new code for the new features. It will also involve updating the
user interface and design of the software. Based on these changes, it is
expected a market ready version of the platform will be completed in
approximately six to seven months.
