Dear Visitor,
Welcome to my online gallery. Please  have a look at several new pieces that are on display in Collection 6.  I  have been working on a series of small abstract collage paintings  which incorporate realistic images, patterns and photographs. These,  combined with acrylic and pastel or laminate, are covered with an epoxy  resin to stabilize, brighten and preserve the various materials. (To return from the gallery, click your browser's back button.)


As   a permanent ex-pat and traveler, I am continuously observing myself   and others adapting to the environment.  I am  interested in continuing  to work from these different perspectives  and find pleasure when I can  transform a surface reality or small pieces of daily life into an object  which captures a time and mood.  Though I am  painting with more  realistic images this year, my art can always be  inspired by something  as simple as a past event, a memory, or some other visual  fragment.   With this memory  or form, I mix in structure, color, composition and  texture, and the  end result is what I hope to be an evocative and  atmospheric  representation of the original idea.


Luckily,  we have relocated to Tbilisi, Georgia, and I am taking advantage of the  beautiful vistas that surround us every day. I am working with Art East  Studio as a painting teacher for children and my paintings can be seen  at #15 Akhlevdiani through the end of February.




Please visit again to see future additions to the gallery.

With warm regards,
