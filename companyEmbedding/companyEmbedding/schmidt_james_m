I have been a patient of Dr. Schmidt for 10 years. He is an excellent doctor who deeply cares for his patients. Some have stated long wait times as a problem, however I look at it as the reality it is; When he walks into the examination room, YOU are who matters! He does this for every patient. His focus is on you, and when you leave you have your care plan established (with drawings if necessary). You leave knowing you're going to be okay, because Dr. Schmidt is taking care of you. 

As for his support staff, they are wonderful! I feel privileged and lucky to have found a doctor and individuals like Mena who I feel very comfortable with, and care about as if they are family!! In fact I commute to and from Big Bear for appointments after leaving the area. I can't envision EVER having another doctor!







Dr. Schmidt is the real deal. I've been seeing him since 2008 for some mundane and some scary stuff.  He is highly skilled, confident and compassionate.  In today's IN & OUT service arena, a lot is  lost in medical care.  Excellent diagnosis and treatment takes time.  Some of which needs to be discovered with conversation about "you."  Dr. S. takes the time and his first question is, How are you, not what insurance do you have?  His office is usually busy but with  several generations of Perdo patients who know the well kept secret of his mature, responsible and nurturing care.  His staff is busy  but professional.  If something is urgent but not an emergency talk to them. They won't move you to to first in line but will certainly work you in with reason.  Not a 2 month out appointment.  Yeah, you have to wait some times but I don't want an In & Out burger.  I want a filet.

Unfortunately I was never able to see the Dr. He must have a booming business and upholds his reputation. It is a shame that his office manager Mena doesn't practice a similar attention to detail and precision that almost all of the reviews rave on about Dr. Schmidt. Due to a 90 minute wait, and a very intolerant Mena explaining it would be another hour.....I will never know how great Dr. Schmidt is. And that was with an appointment. I guess new patients aren't as valuable as old ones. The lack of communication from office staff to patients, and the disregard for somebody's time and medical issues are unacceptable. Not to detail the unprofessionalism and lack of respect towards a patient. I am disappointed in Mena specifically, for lack of patience and poor customer service. Dr. Schmidt may be great (from what I read) however, the face of his establishment has definitely deemed herself incapable of providing adequate care. Mena should not work with the general public, and definitely avoid any patient interactions. It is sad that she is having her family members post on yelp. The truth comes from the client. Not your cousin.







I've been a long time patient of Dr. Schmidts.  Not only is Dr. Schmidt the best doctor in town , but his staff is wonderful.  Yes there is a long wait but dr takes his time when its your turn.  Mena is very professional and helpful and not in anyway rude! Mena has always gone above and beyond to help and accommodate patients. And we miss Bridget! She was always so lovely and helpful as well!







The review below written by Chris is exactly on point. The front staff is awful. I switched doctors due to the incompetence of the office staff.  Dr. Schmidt is a good doctor, great actually, however his staff must all be temps. Make an appointment?  Yeah, you can, but you'll still sit the waiting room for an hour and a half then 30 more minutes in the back. The staff did not inform me I would be delayed getting my records for an appointment with a new primary. So I show up to my new appointment and am informed no records were sent even after I signed off on the privacy release and requested these records over a week ago. I was told it was a printing issue.. Yeah?  That's lovely. You should then inform the patient. Very rude on the phone   as well. If you value your time, and accuracy from the office regarding your records, go to another office. Worst experience ever from a doctor's office.







If you value your time, this isn't the Dr. you want to see. Appointment or walk in you will be waiting in the office for at LEAST 3 hours! No joke. And there isn't even a TV nor a radio in the waiting room! 
The Dr. does spend as much time with you as needed which kinda makes up for the ridiculous wait; however, I've had a problem arise that he couldn't fix and didn't refer me to a specialist until it was a little too late. 
I've been tolerant here because I do like the staff but this is what did it for me. It's approximately 100 degrees today and the office doesn't have any water! Now that is a joke! An elderly woman in the waiting room needed to take some pills and the entire office (that includes the back as well) did NOT have clean water for her to drink!







Excellent doctor that takes his time to know his patients. 
He has never failed me whenever I needed him. 
He is also a good person in general and treats people like human beings. 
You can tell he really does care about his patients and what he does.







Dr. Schmidt is a great physician, and yes you have to wait! That's just the way it is.  Please don't let Shannon's review define Dr. Schmidt or Mena (office staff) as they are both quite pleasant, professional, and knowledgeable about their jobs.  I have been Dr. Schmidt's patient for over 10 years, and today I was SQUEEZED  IN without an appointment,  because of my newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer.   Yes Shannon this was most likely on YOUR TIME during YOUR appointment as you were there before me WITH AN APPOINTMENT.  I am sorry I made you wait - how dare my breast cancer not think about a new patient and what squeezing me in and pushing back the appointment time might do for business!!! Shame on my breast!!!!   Mena had nothing to do with me being seen during YOUR time.  Anyhow, while I was  lying on the examining table waiting for Dr. Schmidt and contemplating life, and who was going to raise my 11 yr old daughter,  I hear this woman ranting and raving how "disappointed she was for not being seen in a timely manner."   I  couldn't believe that anyone would talk to  medical staff this way when "timing" has nothing to do with the office staff, but rather the Dr. who is seeing patients.  What you didn't know Shannon was that a few patients (me included) were watching and listening, with our heads sticking out of the rooms and boy oh boy what restraint Mena showed!!! Shannon you were verbally abusive beyond belief and I felt terrible for Mena that she couldn't just ask you to leave and took your abuse!!   Yes Shannon, I saw it as well as other patients who also heard it.  Last but not least, you called her a ******** person 3 times at someone who is soft spoken and sweet, and my heart broke for her.   HOW DARE YOU!!! After you snatched the paperwork from Mena's hand,  demanded her name, and swung the door open wildly, I walked to the office area IN MY GOWN, and hugged Mena, I told her she was not in any way unprofessional and that she was loved!!!  Anyone who knows Mena knows she treats the patients with kindness and compassion and does her best!!  So, my review is two fold: "take reviews with a grain of salt" and to new patients, please come meet one of San Pedro's finest doctors and great staff!  Shannon, I am not a doctor, but you need MEDS!!







All of these reviews are bs. If you see any doctor there will be a wait, the nurses do their job and are there to do what the doctor allows because he is BUSY. I saw him and he listened and was understanding and gave me a no bs explanation. I feel like every doctors office I've been to I've waited 15-an hour after my appointment because he's doing his job. I have great respect for dr Schmidt and the nurses.







I've been seeing Dr. Schmidt for eight years.  He is very caring and takes his time to explain with diagrams if needed what is going wrong in the body.  His staff is really nice.  Yes there is always a wait.  Yes I make an appointment and then call ahead.  They call your cell phone to tell you when to come in so you don't have to wait in the waiting room.  Yes there is usually a wait of about 30-60 minutes once you get there.  BUT, once you are in the room with him you have HIS COMPLETE UNDIVIDED ATTENTION!!  That is what makes Dr. Schmidt amazing.  He cares and takes his time.  I feel that high quality care is worth the wait.  I refer everyone I know to him.  I think he's the best Doctor in San  Pedro.







I love Dr. Schmidt, he is the real deal..an old school doctor that actually listens to his patients and prescribes appropriate, updated and evidence based treatments. He respects his patients and treats them like if his own family. Dr. Schmidt has patients that have been with him for over 20 yrs and continue to see him and even bring their extended family members to see him time and time again. He is a true healer, who he really cares, but caring requires listening which takes time. SO BE PREPARED TO WAIT YOUR TURN... Dr. Schmidt does not practice fast food medicine. Go elsewhere if you want to be in and out in 5 minutes and your time is too valuable to take in account the needs of others. I will continue to happily see Dr. S and wait my turn because I know despite the wait I will have quality time with my provider that cares about me and will look out for my best interest. I won't have to worry that I will be herded in and out like cattle, simply there to meet some detached provider's quota for the day, which is so common.







I am very unimpressed with Dr.Schmidt's practice. We had an appointment scheduled in the morning and they have it set up so that you call around that time to see if they're ready for you. I call and leave a voicemail, including the reason, name, and phone number to reach me back at. Never got a call. Called again later in the day, still no answer. I call first thing the next day and the response was to "Keep calling until someone picks up." No. That is not my job, I am the patient and should never have to keep calling until someone picks up. Anyways, they invite us over in the morning to get my Alzheimer-ridden grandmother's appointment out of the way. They call my grandmother back for her checkup and she tells me to wait in the waiting room for her. Over an hour passes and the receptionist asked if I was the one who accompanied my grandmother, telling me that she left twenty minutes ago. Can you imagine? You go to a DOCTOR'S office and they're so ignorant, irresponsible, and incapable to let an Alzheimer's patient walk out the front door when they see us come in together?! 
Do not, I repeat, DO NOT go here.







Do not go here if you want proper treatment, a genuine doctor who will identify and fix health issues and certainly do not go here if you find your time valuable. 

Unfortunately I've wasted the past 5 years of my health at this poor establishment. 

Fortunately when I went to a qualified doctor I wasn't given serious conditions that were overlooked by this doctor unlike the several people I know who now are properly addressing there medical concerns with qualified doctors and getting quality care. 

In addition I've never spent so much time waiting in a doctor office lobby, then more time on top of that in an empty patient room to be seen by an over-confident, under-qualified, non-humorous individual. 

The office staff is sub-par and lacks professionalism. They are incapable of properly communicating as adults. The interaction between them and myself left me very interested in how these individuals even secured a job. The interaction between them and other patients and office vendors was even more interesting to observe. 

This is a great example of poor office management and a doctor who just doesn't offer the same service anymore. Nobody should waste their valuable insurance money on this facility.







I  have been Dr Schmidt's patient for about one year and I have never had a chance to meet with him. I was only helped by a nurse practitioner. The office staff are not friendly. I have to wait more than one hour past my appointment time until they let me in.I am looking for a better Dr. in my area. I do not recommend this Dr. Schmidt to any one.







I could not be happier with the service & care I recieved from Dr. Schmidt & his staff.







I would definitely find a doctor other than Dr. Schmidt.

I arrived on time for my 12:30 appointment.  After waiting (with many others!) in the waiting area, I was finally let into a room at 1:45.  (Yes!  One hour and fifteen minutes in the waiting area!)  Once inside one of the patient rooms, I thought I would be promptly seen.  However, it was about 2:15 when the NP came in for my appointment.   

This doctor's office needs to be more considerate to its patients.  There are just too many other doctors out there to choose from.  I will be looking for another one myself.







Dr. Schmidt is our primary care physician. I swear, I've probably been there about 10 times now, and I've met the man once. You're pretty much in the care of the nurses, assistants, and physican's assistant. Don't bother making an appointment b/c you'll never be seen on time (prepare to wait at least an additional 30-60 minutes). The waiting room can get quite full. Even if you're the first appointment of the day, you'll be seen about 15 minutes after the fact, but that's still way better than the mid-mornings and afternoons. 

Parking is a pain b/c there is no direct access from the lot. You'll have to either walk through another building or walk around the lot itself. Street parking is accessible, but never available. 

The reason for the extra star is for the receptionist, Nancy. She is great. Very understanding, attentive, and will go out of her way to make you happy.







Be prepared for very long wait times if you are a patient. 

You can hear patients in the waiting room comparing notes on how long they've been there, and some were there for 2-3 hours. A fellow staff member/patient waited over 2 hours. 

The majority of the problems I had were with the front office staff that while friendly left me anxious of the accuracy and quality of care and proper billing of my visits. 

My insurance card was left in the copier, and I had to return to the office to retrieve it when I went to a local pharmacy and realized it had never been returned to me. 

Not only was it left in the copier, but it was never actually copied. 

I learned this on a visit two weeks later when they verified my insurance and they still had my previous insurance on record. 

I was given a referral phone number for a specialist, and the phone number was inaccurate. 

On one visit, none of the office staff present that day knew how to enter procedures in the system being utilized at the time. 

If you're one of the lucky ones to actually see the doctor, he's a very nice individual. The front office staff are relatively friendly as well. I just wish I wasn't nervous after each visit if the administrative side will be properly taken care of.

Bottom line: If I was asked to recommend this office, I would be hesitant.







Health care in this day and age is confusing, it is important when you do see a Dr. that they have your best interest at heart and Dr Schmidt does, and he will be your advocate.  Regardless of your age he will help guide you to the best health possible. Dr Schmidt will spend as much time with you and answer questions with as much depth and insight as he can, he cares about his patients. I have seen him when I am not feeling well, He is very thorough and orders additional tests to rule things out; he made sure I was happy with the referrals he gave. He takes notes and refers back to them in your chart from year to year, and follows up to make sure you're recovering.  I have also been there when I am healthy and we discussed diet and exercise, he measured my body fat and we discussed my blood work in depth ways to improve things over a life time. I suggest going at the end of the day and call ahead to check on the wait before hand.







Dr Schmidt is OK, but his staff is generally terrible. Nancy may be OK, but many of the others are cranky, make mistakes etc...

It can take weeks to get an appointment, when you finally get one the wait is terrible. Years ago you could see him or his partner on a Saturday, or a Wednesday night. Now he's solo, he does NOT have Wednesday night or Saturday appointments, and I think he's actually there twice a week at best.

They have messed up appointments, records, and once the nurse (?) gave my husband incorrect information about an injection he was about to receive. My husband got nervous and just told them to forget it, and he left. I checked with the CDC later and that nurse did NOT know what she was talking about! Would she have given my husband the wrong injection???? YIKES.

Then they charged someone else's appointment to my husband's insurance!

I say switch to his former partner's group, Dr. Jimenez/team on 1st & Western, who NEVER makes you wait weeks to get in.

The review below written by Chris is exactly on point. The front staff is awful. I switched doctors due to the incompetence of the office staff. Â Dr. Schmidt is a good doctor, great actually, however his staff must all be temps. Make an appointment? Â Yeah, you can, but you'll still sit the waiting room for an hour and a half then 30 more minutes in the back. The staff did not inform me I would be delayed getting my records for an appointment with a new primary. So I show up to my new appointment and am informed no records were sent even after I signed off on the privacy release and requested these records over a week ago. I was told it was a printing issue.. Yeah? Â That's lovely. You should then inform the patient. Very rude on the phone Â  as well. If you value your time, and accuracy from the office regarding your records, go to another office. Worst experience ever from a doctor's office.

If you value your time, this isn't the Dr. you want to see. Appointment or walk in you will be waiting in the office for at LEAST 3 hours! No joke. And there isn't even a TV nor a radio in the waiting room! The Dr. does spend as much time with you as needed which kinda makes up for the ridiculous wait; however, I've had a problem arise that he couldn't fix and didn't refer me to a specialist until it was a little too late. I've been tolerant here because I do like the staff but this is what did it for me. It's approximately 100 degrees today and the office doesn't have any water! Now that is a joke! An elderly woman in the waiting room needed to take some pills and the entire office (that includes the back as well) did NOT have clean water for her to drink!

Excellent doctor that takes his time to know his patients. He has never failed me whenever I needed him. He is also a good person in general and treats people like human beings. You can tell he really does care about his patients and what he does.

Dr. Schmidt is a great physician, and yes you have to wait! That's just the way it is. Â Please don't let Shannon's review define Dr. Schmidt or Mena (office staff) as they are both quite pleasant, professional, and knowledgeable about their jobs. Â I have been Dr. Schmidt's patient for over 10 years, and today I was SQUEEZED Â IN without an appointment, Â because of my newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer. Â  Yes Shannon this was most likely on YOUR TIME during YOUR appointment as you were there before me WITH AN APPOINTMENT. Â I am sorry I made you wait - how dare my breast cancer not think about a new patient and what squeezing me in and pushing back the appointment time might do for business!!! Shame on my breast!!!! Â  Mena had nothing to do with me being seen during YOUR time. Â Anyhow, while I was Â lying on the examining table waiting for Dr. Schmidt and contemplating life, and who was going to raise my 11 yr old daughter, Â I hear this woman ranting and raving how "disappointed she was for not being seen in a timely manner." Â  I Â couldn't believe that anyone would talk to Â medical staff this way when "timing" has nothing to do with the office staff, but rather the Dr. who is seeing patients. Â What you didn't know Shannon was that a few patients (me included) were watching and listening, with our heads sticking out of the rooms and boy oh boy what restraint Mena showed!!! Shannon you were verbally abusive beyond belief and I felt terrible for Mena that she couldn't just ask you to leave and took your abuse!! Â  Yes Shannon, I saw it as well as other patients who also heard it. Â Last but not least, you called her a ******** person 3 times at someone who is soft spoken and sweet, and my heart broke for her. Â  HOW DARE YOU!!! After you snatched the paperwork from Mena's hand, Â demanded her name, and swung the door open wildly, I walked to the office area IN MY GOWN, and hugged Mena, I told her she was not in any way unprofessional and that she was loved!!! Â Anyone who knows Mena knows she treats the patients with kindness and compassion and does her best!! Â So, my review is two fold: "take reviews with a grain of salt" and to new patients, please come meet one of San Pedro's finest doctors and great staff! Â Shannon, I am not a doctor, but you need MEDS!!

All of these reviews are bs. If you see any doctor there will be a wait, the nurses do their job and are there to do what the doctor allows because he is BUSY. I saw him and he listened and was understanding and gave me a no bs explanation. I feel like every doctors office I've been to I've waited 15-an hour after my appointment because he's doing his job. I have great respect for dr Schmidt and the nurses.

I've been seeing Dr. Schmidt for eight years. Â He is very caring and takes his time to explain with diagrams if needed what is going wrong in the body. Â His staff is really nice. Â Yes there is always a wait. Â Yes I make an appointment and then call ahead. Â They call your cell phone to tell you when to come in so you don't have to wait in the waiting room. Â Yes there is usually a wait of about 30-60 minutes once you get there. Â BUT, once you are in the room with him you have HIS COMPLETE UNDIVIDED ATTENTION!! Â That is what makes Dr. Schmidt amazing. Â He cares and takes his time. Â I feel that high quality care is worth the wait. Â I refer everyone I know to him. Â I think he's the best Doctor in San Â Pedro.

I love Dr. Schmidt, he is the real deal..an old school doctor that actually listens to his patients and prescribes appropriate, updated and evidence based treatments. He respects his patients and treats them like if his own family. Dr. Schmidt has patients that have been with him for over 20 yrs and continue to see him and even bring their extended family members to see him time and time again. He is a true healer, who he really cares, but caring requires listening which takes time. SO BE PREPARED TO WAIT YOUR TURN... Dr. Schmidt does not practice fast food medicine. Go elsewhere if you want to be in and out in 5 minutes and your time is too valuable to take in account the needs of others. I will continue to happily see Dr. S and wait my turn because I know despite the wait I will have quality time with my provider that cares about me and will look out for my best interest. I won't have to worry that I will be herded in and out like cattle, simply there to meet some detached provider's quota for the day, which is so common.

I am very unimpressed with Dr.Schmidt's practice. We had an appointment scheduled in the morning and they have it set up so that you call around that time to see if they're ready for you. I call and leave a voicemail, including the reason, name, and phone number to reach me back at. Never got a call. Called again later in the day, still no answer. I call first thing the next day and the response was to "Keep calling until someone picks up." No. That is not my job, I am the patient and should never have to keep calling until someone picks up. Anyways, they invite us over in the morning to get my Alzheimer-ridden grandmother's appointment out of the way. They call my grandmother back for her checkup and she tells me to wait in the waiting room for her. Over an hour passes and the receptionist asked if I was the one who accompanied my grandmother, telling me that she left twenty minutes ago. Can you imagine? You go to a DOCTOR'S office and they're so ignorant, irresponsible, and incapable to let an Alzheimer's patient walk out the front door when they see us come in together?! Do not, I repeat, DO NOT go here.

Do not go here if you want proper treatment, a genuine doctor who will identify and fix health issues and certainly do not go here if you find your time valuable. Unfortunately I've wasted the past 5 years of my health at this poor establishment. Fortunately when I went to a qualified doctor I wasn't given serious conditions that were overlooked by this doctor unlike the several people I know who now are properly addressing there medical concerns with qualified doctors and getting quality care. In addition I've never spent so much time waiting in a doctor office lobby, then more time on top of that in an empty patient room to be seen by an over-confident, under-qualified, non-humorous individual. The office staff is sub-par and lacks professionalism. They are incapable of properly communicating as adults. The interaction between them and myself left me very interested in how these individuals even secured a job. The interaction between them and other patients and office vendors was even more interesting to observe. This is a great example of poor office management and a doctor who just doesn't offer the same service anymore. Nobody should waste their valuable insurance money on this facility.

I Â have been Dr Schmidt's patient for about one year and I have never had a chance to meet with him. I was only helped by a nurse practitioner. The office staff are not friendly. I have to wait more than one hour past my appointment time until they let me in.I am looking for a better Dr. in my area. I do not recommend this Dr. Schmidt to any one.

I would definitely find a doctor other than Dr. Schmidt.I arrived on time for my 12:30 appointment. Â After waiting (with many others!) in the waiting area, I was finally let into a room at 1:45. Â (Yes! Â One hour and fifteen minutes in the waiting area!) Â Once inside one of the patient rooms, I thought I would be promptly seen. Â However, it was about 2:15 when the NP came in for my appointment. Â  This doctor's office needs to be more considerate to its patients. Â There are just too many other doctors out there to choose from. Â I will be looking for another one myself.

Dr. Schmidt is our primary care physician. I swear, I've probably been there about 10 times now, and I've met the man once. You're pretty much in the care of the nurses, assistants, and physican's assistant. Don't bother making an appointment b/c you'll never be seen on time (prepare to wait at least an additional 30-60 minutes). The waiting room can get quite full. Even if you're the first appointment of the day, you'll be seen about 15 minutes after the fact, but that's still way better than the mid-mornings and afternoons. Parking is a pain b/c there is no direct access from the lot. You'll have to either walk through another building or walk around the lot itself. Street parking is accessible, but never available. The reason for the extra star is for the receptionist, Nancy. She is great. Very understanding, attentive, and will go out of her way to make you happy.

Be prepared for very long wait times if you are a patient. You can hear patients in the waiting room comparing notes on how long they've been there, and some were there for 2-3 hours. A fellow staff member/patient waited over 2 hours. The majority of the problems I had were with the front office staff that while friendly left me anxious of the accuracy and quality of care and proper billing of my visits. My insurance card was left in the copier, and I had to return to the office to retrieve it when I went to a local pharmacy and realized it had never been returned to me. Not only was it left in the copier, but it was never actually copied. I learned this on a visit two weeks later when they verified my insurance and they still had my previous insurance on record. I was given a referral phone number for a specialist, and the phone number was inaccurate. On one visit, none of the office staff present that day knew how to enter procedures in the system being utilized at the time. If you're one of the lucky ones to actually see the doctor, he's a very nice individual. The front office staff are relatively friendly as well. I just wish I wasn't nervous after each visit if the administrative side will be properly taken care of.Bottom line: If I was asked to recommend this office, I would be hesitant.

Health care in this day and age is confusing, it is important when you do see a Dr. that they have your best interest at heart and Dr Schmidt does, and he will be your advocate. Â Regardless of your age he will help guide you to the best health possible. Dr Schmidt will spend as much time with you and answer questions with as much depth and insight as he can, he cares about his patients. I have seen him when I am not feeling well, He is very thorough and orders additional tests to rule things out; he made sure I was happy with the referrals he gave. He takes notes and refers back to them in your chart from year to year, and follows up to make sure you're recovering. Â I have also been there when I am healthy and we discussed diet and exercise, he measured my body fat and we discussed my blood work in depth ways to improve things over a life time. I suggest going at the end of the day and call ahead to check on the wait before hand.

Dr Schmidt is OK, but his staff is generally terrible. Nancy may be OK, but many of the others are cranky, make mistakes etc...It can take weeks to get an appointment, when you finally get one the wait is terrible. Years ago you could see him or his partner on a Saturday, or a Wednesday night. Now he's solo, he does NOT have Wednesday night or Saturday appointments, and I think he's actually there twice a week at best.They have messed up appointments, records, and once the nurse (?) gave my husband incorrect information about an injection he was about to receive. My husband got nervous and just told them to forget it, and he left. I checked with the CDC later and that nurse did NOT know what she was talking about! Would she have given my husband the wrong injection???? YIKES.Then they charged someone else's appointment to my husband's insurance!I say switch to his former partner's group, Dr. Jimenez/team on 1st & Western, who NEVER makes you wait weeks to get in.

        (310) 832-0686
    






I have been a patient of Dr. Schmidt for 10 years. He is an excellent doctor who deeply cares for his patients. Some have stated long wait times as a problem, however I look at it as the reality it is; When he walks into the examination room, YOU are who matters! He does this for every patient. His focus is on you, and when you leave you have your care plan established (with drawings if necessary). You leave knowing you're going to be okay, because Dr. Schmidt is taking care of you. 

As for his support staff, they are wonderful! I feel privileged and lucky to have found a doctor and individuals like Mena who I feel very comfortable with, and care about as if they are family!! In fact I commute to and from Big Bear for appointments after leaving the area. I can't envision EVER having another doctor!







Dr. Schmidt is the real deal. I've been seeing him since 2008 for some mundane and some scary stuff.  He is highly skilled, confident and compassionate.  In today's IN & OUT service arena, a lot is  lost in medical care.  Excellent diagnosis and treatment takes time.  Some of which needs to be discovered with conversation about "you."  Dr. S. takes the time and his first question is, How are you, not what insurance do you have?  His office is usually busy but with  several generations of Perdo patients who know the well kept secret of his mature, responsible and nurturing care.  His staff is busy  but professional.  If something is urgent but not an emergency talk to them. They won't move you to to first in line but will certainly work you in with reason.  Not a 2 month out appointment.  Yeah, you have to wait some times but I don't want an In & Out burger.  I want a filet.

David L.  - San Pedro







Unfortunately I was never able to see the Dr. He must have a booming business and upholds his reputation. It is a shame that his office manager Mena doesn't practice a similar attention to detail and precision that almost all of the reviews rave on about Dr. Schmidt. Due to a 90 minute wait, and a very intolerant Mena explaining it would be another hour.....I will never know how great Dr. Schmidt is. And that was with an appointment. I guess new patients aren't as valuable as old ones. The lack of communication from office staff to patients, and the disregard for somebody's time and medical issues are unacceptable. Not to detail the unprofessionalism and lack of respect towards a patient. I am disappointed in Mena specifically, for lack of patience and poor customer service. Dr. Schmidt may be great (from what I read) however, the face of his establishment has definitely deemed herself incapable of providing adequate care. Mena should not work with the general public, and definitely avoid any patient interactions. It is sad that she is having her family members post on yelp. The truth comes from the client. Not your cousin.







I've been a long time patient of Dr. Schmidts.  Not only is Dr. Schmidt the best doctor in town , but his staff is wonderful.  Yes there is a long wait but dr takes his time when its your turn.  Mena is very professional and helpful and not in anyway rude! Mena has always gone above and beyond to help and accommodate patients. And we miss Bridget! She was always so lovely and helpful as well!







The review below written by Chris is exactly on point. The front staff is awful. I switched doctors due to the incompetence of the office staff.  Dr. Schmidt is a good doctor, great actually, however his staff must all be temps. Make an appointment?  Yeah, you can, but you'll still sit the waiting room for an hour and a half then 30 more minutes in the back. The staff did not inform me I would be delayed getting my records for an appointment with a new primary. So I show up to my new appointment and am informed no records were sent even after I signed off on the privacy release and requested these records over a week ago. I was told it was a printing issue.. Yeah?  That's lovely. You should then inform the patient. Very rude on the phone   as well. If you value your time, and accuracy from the office regarding your records, go to another office. Worst experience ever from a doctor's office.







If you value your time, this isn't the Dr. you want to see. Appointment or walk in you will be waiting in the office for at LEAST 3 hours! No joke. And there isn't even a TV nor a radio in the waiting room! 
The Dr. does spend as much time with you as needed which kinda makes up for the ridiculous wait; however, I've had a problem arise that he couldn't fix and didn't refer me to a specialist until it was a little too late. 
I've been tolerant here because I do like the staff but this is what did it for me. It's approximately 100 degrees today and the office doesn't have any water! Now that is a joke! An elderly woman in the waiting room needed to take some pills and the entire office (that includes the back as well) did NOT have clean water for her to drink!







Excellent doctor that takes his time to know his patients. 
He has never failed me whenever I needed him. 
He is also a good person in general and treats people like human beings. 
You can tell he really does care about his patients and what he does.







Dr. Schmidt is a great physician, and yes you have to wait! That's just the way it is.  Please don't let Shannon's review define Dr. Schmidt or Mena (office staff) as they are both quite pleasant, professional, and knowledgeable about their jobs.  I have been Dr. Schmidt's patient for over 10 years, and today I was SQUEEZED  IN without an appointment,  because of my newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer.   Yes Shannon this was most likely on YOUR TIME during YOUR appointment as you were there before me WITH AN APPOINTMENT.  I am sorry I made you wait - how dare my breast cancer not think about a new patient and what squeezing me in and pushing back the appointment time might do for business!!! Shame on my breast!!!!   Mena had nothing to do with me being seen during YOUR time.  Anyhow, while I was  lying on the examining table waiting for Dr. Schmidt and contemplating life, and who was going to raise my 11 yr old daughter,  I hear this woman ranting and raving how "disappointed she was for not being seen in a timely manner."   I  couldn't believe that anyone would talk to  medical staff this way when "timing" has nothing to do with the office staff, but rather the Dr. who is seeing patients.  What you didn't know Shannon was that a few patients (me included) were watching and listening, with our heads sticking out of the rooms and boy oh boy what restraint Mena showed!!! Shannon you were verbally abusive beyond belief and I felt terrible for Mena that she couldn't just ask you to leave and took your abuse!!   Yes Shannon, I saw it as well as other patients who also heard it.  Last but not least, you called her a ******** person 3 times at someone who is soft spoken and sweet, and my heart broke for her.   HOW DARE YOU!!! After you snatched the paperwork from Mena's hand,  demanded her name, and swung the door open wildly, I walked to the office area IN MY GOWN, and hugged Mena, I told her she was not in any way unprofessional and that she was loved!!!  Anyone who knows Mena knows she treats the patients with kindness and compassion and does her best!!  So, my review is two fold: "take reviews with a grain of salt" and to new patients, please come meet one of San Pedro's finest doctors and great staff!  Shannon, I am not a doctor, but you need MEDS!!







All of these reviews are bs. If you see any doctor there will be a wait, the nurses do their job and are there to do what the doctor allows because he is BUSY. I saw him and he listened and was understanding and gave me a no bs explanation. I feel like every doctors office I've been to I've waited 15-an hour after my appointment because he's doing his job. I have great respect for dr Schmidt and the nurses.







I've been seeing Dr. Schmidt for eight years.  He is very caring and takes his time to explain with diagrams if needed what is going wrong in the body.  His staff is really nice.  Yes there is always a wait.  Yes I make an appointment and then call ahead.  They call your cell phone to tell you when to come in so you don't have to wait in the waiting room.  Yes there is usually a wait of about 30-60 minutes once you get there.  BUT, once you are in the room with him you have HIS COMPLETE UNDIVIDED ATTENTION!!  That is what makes Dr. Schmidt amazing.  He cares and takes his time.  I feel that high quality care is worth the wait.  I refer everyone I know to him.  I think he's the best Doctor in San  Pedro.







I love Dr. Schmidt, he is the real deal..an old school doctor that actually listens to his patients and prescribes appropriate, updated and evidence based treatments. He respects his patients and treats them like if his own family. Dr. Schmidt has patients that have been with him for over 20 yrs and continue to see him and even bring their extended family members to see him time and time again. He is a true healer, who he really cares, but caring requires listening which takes time. SO BE PREPARED TO WAIT YOUR TURN... Dr. Schmidt does not practice fast food medicine. Go elsewhere if you want to be in and out in 5 minutes and your time is too valuable to take in account the needs of others. I will continue to happily see Dr. S and wait my turn because I know despite the wait I will have quality time with my provider that cares about me and will look out for my best interest. I won't have to worry that I will be herded in and out like cattle, simply there to meet some detached provider's quota for the day, which is so common.







I am very unimpressed with Dr.Schmidt's practice. We had an appointment scheduled in the morning and they have it set up so that you call around that time to see if they're ready for you. I call and leave a voicemail, including the reason, name, and phone number to reach me back at. Never got a call. Called again later in the day, still no answer. I call first thing the next day and the response was to "Keep calling until someone picks up." No. That is not my job, I am the patient and should never have to keep calling until someone picks up. Anyways, they invite us over in the morning to get my Alzheimer-ridden grandmother's appointment out of the way. They call my grandmother back for her checkup and she tells me to wait in the waiting room for her. Over an hour passes and the receptionist asked if I was the one who accompanied my grandmother, telling me that she left twenty minutes ago. Can you imagine? You go to a DOCTOR'S office and they're so ignorant, irresponsible, and incapable to let an Alzheimer's patient walk out the front door when they see us come in together?! 
Do not, I repeat, DO NOT go here.







Do not go here if you want proper treatment, a genuine doctor who will identify and fix health issues and certainly do not go here if you find your time valuable. 

Unfortunately I've wasted the past 5 years of my health at this poor establishment. 

Fortunately when I went to a qualified doctor I wasn't given serious conditions that were overlooked by this doctor unlike the several people I know who now are properly addressing there medical concerns with qualified doctors and getting quality care. 

In addition I've never spent so much time waiting in a doctor office lobby, then more time on top of that in an empty patient room to be seen by an over-confident, under-qualified, non-humorous individual. 

The office staff is sub-par and lacks professionalism. They are incapable of properly communicating as adults. The interaction between them and myself left me very interested in how these individuals even secured a job. The interaction between them and other patients and office vendors was even more interesting to observe. 

This is a great example of poor office management and a doctor who just doesn't offer the same service anymore. Nobody should waste their valuable insurance money on this facility.







I  have been Dr Schmidt's patient for about one year and I have never had a chance to meet with him. I was only helped by a nurse practitioner. The office staff are not friendly. I have to wait more than one hour past my appointment time until they let me in.I am looking for a better Dr. in my area. I do not recommend this Dr. Schmidt to any one.







I could not be happier with the service & care I recieved from Dr. Schmidt & his staff.







I would definitely find a doctor other than Dr. Schmidt.

I arrived on time for my 12:30 appointment.  After waiting (with many others!) in the waiting area, I was finally let into a room at 1:45.  (Yes!  One hour and fifteen minutes in the waiting area!)  Once inside one of the patient rooms, I thought I would be promptly seen.  However, it was about 2:15 when the NP came in for my appointment.   

This doctor's office needs to be more considerate to its patients.  There are just too many other doctors out there to choose from.  I will be looking for another one myself.







Dr. Schmidt is our primary care physician. I swear, I've probably been there about 10 times now, and I've met the man once. You're pretty much in the care of the nurses, assistants, and physican's assistant. Don't bother making an appointment b/c you'll never be seen on time (prepare to wait at least an additional 30-60 minutes). The waiting room can get quite full. Even if you're the first appointment of the day, you'll be seen about 15 minutes after the fact, but that's still way better than the mid-mornings and afternoons. 

Parking is a pain b/c there is no direct access from the lot. You'll have to either walk through another building or walk around the lot itself. Street parking is accessible, but never available. 

The reason for the extra star is for the receptionist, Nancy. She is great. Very understanding, attentive, and will go out of her way to make you happy.







Be prepared for very long wait times if you are a patient. 

You can hear patients in the waiting room comparing notes on how long they've been there, and some were there for 2-3 hours. A fellow staff member/patient waited over 2 hours. 

The majority of the problems I had were with the front office staff that while friendly left me anxious of the accuracy and quality of care and proper billing of my visits. 

My insurance card was left in the copier, and I had to return to the office to retrieve it when I went to a local pharmacy and realized it had never been returned to me. 

Not only was it left in the copier, but it was never actually copied. 

I learned this on a visit two weeks later when they verified my insurance and they still had my previous insurance on record. 

I was given a referral phone number for a specialist, and the phone number was inaccurate. 

On one visit, none of the office staff present that day knew how to enter procedures in the system being utilized at the time. 

If you're one of the lucky ones to actually see the doctor, he's a very nice individual. The front office staff are relatively friendly as well. I just wish I wasn't nervous after each visit if the administrative side will be properly taken care of.

Bottom line: If I was asked to recommend this office, I would be hesitant.







Health care in this day and age is confusing, it is important when you do see a Dr. that they have your best interest at heart and Dr Schmidt does, and he will be your advocate.  Regardless of your age he will help guide you to the best health possible. Dr Schmidt will spend as much time with you and answer questions with as much depth and insight as he can, he cares about his patients. I have seen him when I am not feeling well, He is very thorough and orders additional tests to rule things out; he made sure I was happy with the referrals he gave. He takes notes and refers back to them in your chart from year to year, and follows up to make sure you're recovering.  I have also been there when I am healthy and we discussed diet and exercise, he measured my body fat and we discussed my blood work in depth ways to improve things over a life time. I suggest going at the end of the day and call ahead to check on the wait before hand.







Dr Schmidt is OK, but his staff is generally terrible. Nancy may be OK, but many of the others are cranky, make mistakes etc...

It can take weeks to get an appointment, when you finally get one the wait is terrible. Years ago you could see him or his partner on a Saturday, or a Wednesday night. Now he's solo, he does NOT have Wednesday night or Saturday appointments, and I think he's actually there twice a week at best.

They have messed up appointments, records, and once the nurse (?) gave my husband incorrect information about an injection he was about to receive. My husband got nervous and just told them to forget it, and he left. I checked with the CDC later and that nurse did NOT know what she was talking about! Would she have given my husband the wrong injection???? YIKES.

Then they charged someone else's appointment to my husband's insurance!

I say switch to his former partner's group, Dr. Jimenez/team on 1st & Western, who NEVER makes you wait weeks to get in.

I have been a patient of Dr. Schmidt for 10 years. He is an excellent doctor who deeply cares for his patients. Some have stated long wait times as a problem, however I look at it as the reality it is; When he walks into the examination room, YOU are who matters! He does this for every patient. His focus is on you, and when you leave you have your care plan established (with drawings if necessary). You leave knowing you're going to be okay, because Dr. Schmidt is taking care of you. As for his support staff, they are wonderful! I feel privileged and lucky to have found a doctor and individuals like Mena who I feel very comfortable with, and care about as if they are family!! In fact I commute to and from Big Bear for appointments after leaving the area. I can't envision EVER having another doctor!

Dr. Schmidt is the real deal. I've been seeing him since 2008 for some mundane and some scary stuff. Â He is highly skilled, confident and compassionate. Â In today's IN & OUT service arena, a lot is Â lost in medical care. Â Excellent diagnosis and treatment takes time. Â Some of which needs to be discovered with conversation about "you." Â Dr. S. takes the time and his first question is, How are you, not what insurance do you have? Â His office is usually busy but with Â several generations of Perdo patients who know the well kept secret of his mature, responsible and nurturing care. Â His staff is busy Â but professional. Â If something is urgent but not an emergency talk to them. They won't move you to to first in line but will certainly work you in with reason. Â Not a 2 month out appointment. Â Yeah, you have to wait some times but I don't want an In & Out burger. Â I want a filet.David L. Â - San Pedro

Unfortunately I was never able to see the Dr. He must have a booming business and upholds his reputation. It is a shame that his office manager Mena doesn't practice a similar attention to detail and precision that almost all of the reviews rave on about Dr. Schmidt. Due to a 90 minute wait, and a very intolerant Mena explaining it would be another hour.....I will never know how great Dr. Schmidt is. And that was with an appointment. I guess new patients aren't as valuable as old ones. The lack of communication from office staff to patients, and the disregard for somebody's time and medical issues are unacceptable. Not to detail the unprofessionalism and lack of respect towards a patient. I am disappointed in Mena specifically, for lack of patience and poor customer service. Dr. Schmidt may be great (from what I read) however, the face of his establishment has definitely deemed herself incapable of providing adequate care. Mena should not work with the general public, and definitely avoid any patient interactions. It is sad that she is having her family members post on yelp. The truth comes from the client. Not your cousin.

I've been a long time patient of Dr. Schmidts. Â Not only is Dr. Schmidt the best doctor in town , but his staff is wonderful. Â Yes there is a long wait but dr takes his time when its your turn. Â Mena is very professional and helpful and not in anyway rude! Mena has always gone above and beyond to help and accommodate patients. And we miss Bridget! She was always so lovely and helpful as well!

The review below written by Chris is exactly on point. The front staff is awful. I switched doctors due to the incompetence of the office staff. Â Dr. Schmidt is a good doctor, great actually, however his staff must all be temps. Make an appointment? Â Yeah, you can, but you'll still sit the waiting room for an hour and a half then 30 more minutes in the back. The staff did not inform me I would be delayed getting my records for an appointment with a new primary. So I show up to my new appointment and am informed no records were sent even after I signed off on the privacy release and requested these records over a week ago. I was told it was a printing issue.. Yeah? Â That's lovely. You should then inform the patient. Very rude on the phone Â  as well. If you value your time, and accuracy from the office regarding your records, go to another office. Worst experience ever from a doctor's office.

If you value your time, this isn't the Dr. you want to see. Appointment or walk in you will be waiting in the office for at LEAST 3 hours! No joke. And there isn't even a TV nor a radio in the waiting room! The Dr. does spend as much time with you as needed which kinda makes up for the ridiculous wait; however, I've had a problem arise that he couldn't fix and didn't refer me to a specialist until it was a little too late. I've been tolerant here because I do like the staff but this is what did it for me. It's approximately 100 degrees today and the office doesn't have any water! Now that is a joke! An elderly woman in the waiting room needed to take some pills and the entire office (that includes the back as well) did NOT have clean water for her to drink!

Dr. Schmidt is a great physician, and yes you have to wait! That's just the way it is. Â Please don't let Shannon's review define Dr. Schmidt or Mena (office staff) as they are both quite pleasant, professional, and knowledgeable about their jobs. Â I have been Dr. Schmidt's patient for over 10 years, and today I was SQUEEZED Â IN without an appointment, Â because of my newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer. Â  Yes Shannon this was most likely on YOUR TIME during YOUR appointment as you were there before me WITH AN APPOINTMENT. Â I am sorry I made you wait - how dare my breast cancer not think about a new patient and what squeezing me in and pushing back the appointment time might do for business!!! Shame on my breast!!!! Â  Mena had nothing to do with me being seen during YOUR time. Â Anyhow, while I was Â lying on the examining table waiting for Dr. Schmidt and contemplating life, and who was going to raise my 11 yr old daughter, Â I hear this woman ranting and raving how "disappointed she was for not being seen in a timely manner." Â  I Â couldn't believe that anyone would talk to Â medical staff this way when "timing" has nothing to do with the office staff, but rather the Dr. who is seeing patients. Â What you didn't know Shannon was that a few patients (me included) were watching and listening, with our heads sticking out of the rooms and boy oh boy what restraint Mena showed!!! Shannon you were verbally abusive beyond belief and I felt terrible for Mena that she couldn't just ask you to leave and took your abuse!! Â  Yes Shannon, I saw it as well as other patients who also heard it. Â Last but not least, you called her a ******** person 3 times at someone who is soft spoken and sweet, and my heart broke for her. Â  HOW DARE YOU!!! After you snatched the paperwork from Mena's hand, Â demanded her name, and swung the door open wildly, I walked to the office area IN MY GOWN, and hugged Mena, I told her she was not in any way unprofessional and that she was loved!!! Â Anyone who knows Mena knows she treats the patients with kindness and compassion and does her best!! Â So, my review is two fold: "take reviews with a grain of salt" and to new patients, please come meet one of San Pedro's finest doctors and great staff! Â Shannon, I am not a doctor, but you need MEDS!!

All of these reviews are bs. If you see any doctor there will be a wait, the nurses do their job and are there to do what the doctor allows because he is BUSY. I saw him and he listened and was understanding and gave me a no bs explanation. I feel like every doctors office I've been to I've waited 15-an hour after my appointment because he's doing his job. I have great respect for dr Schmidt and the nurses.

I've been seeing Dr. Schmidt for eight years. Â He is very caring and takes his time to explain with diagrams if needed what is going wrong in the body. Â His staff is really nice. Â Yes there is always a wait. Â Yes I make an appointment and then call ahead. Â They call your cell phone to tell you when to come in so you don't have to wait in the waiting room. Â Yes there is usually a wait of about 30-60 minutes once you get there. Â BUT, once you are in the room with him you have HIS COMPLETE UNDIVIDED ATTENTION!! Â That is what makes Dr. Schmidt amazing. Â He cares and takes his time. Â I feel that high quality care is worth the wait. Â I refer everyone I know to him. Â I think he's the best Doctor in San Â Pedro.

I love Dr. Schmidt, he is the real deal..an old school doctor that actually listens to his patients and prescribes appropriate, updated and evidence based treatments. He respects his patients and treats them like if his own family. Dr. Schmidt has patients that have been with him for over 20 yrs and continue to see him and even bring their extended family members to see him time and time again. He is a true healer, who he really cares, but caring requires listening which takes time. SO BE PREPARED TO WAIT YOUR TURN... Dr. Schmidt does not practice fast food medicine. Go elsewhere if you want to be in and out in 5 minutes and your time is too valuable to take in account the needs of others. I will continue to happily see Dr. S and wait my turn because I know despite the wait I will have quality time with my provider that cares about me and will look out for my best interest. I won't have to worry that I will be herded in and out like cattle, simply there to meet some detached provider's quota for the day, which is so common.

I am very unimpressed with Dr.Schmidt's practice. We had an appointment scheduled in the morning and they have it set up so that you call around that time to see if they're ready for you. I call and leave a voicemail, including the reason, name, and phone number to reach me back at. Never got a call. Called again later in the day, still no answer. I call first thing the next day and the response was to "Keep calling until someone picks up." No. That is not my job, I am the patient and should never have to keep calling until someone picks up. Anyways, they invite us over in the morning to get my Alzheimer-ridden grandmother's appointment out of the way. They call my grandmother back for her checkup and she tells me to wait in the waiting room for her. Over an hour passes and the receptionist asked if I was the one who accompanied my grandmother, telling me that she left twenty minutes ago. Can you imagine? You go to a DOCTOR'S office and they're so ignorant, irresponsible, and incapable to let an Alzheimer's patient walk out the front door when they see us come in together?! Do not, I repeat, DO NOT go here.

Do not go here if you want proper treatment, a genuine doctor who will identify and fix health issues and certainly do not go here if you find your time valuable. Unfortunately I've wasted the past 5 years of my health at this poor establishment. Fortunately when I went to a qualified doctor I wasn't given serious conditions that were overlooked by this doctor unlike the several people I know who now are properly addressing there medical concerns with qualified doctors and getting quality care. In addition I've never spent so much time waiting in a doctor office lobby, then more time on top of that in an empty patient room to be seen by an over-confident, under-qualified, non-humorous individual. The office staff is sub-par and lacks professionalism. They are incapable of properly communicating as adults. The interaction between them and myself left me very interested in how these individuals even secured a job. The interaction between them and other patients and office vendors was even more interesting to observe. This is a great example of poor office management and a doctor who just doesn't offer the same service anymore. Nobody should waste their valuable insurance money on this facility.

I Â have been Dr Schmidt's patient for about one year and I have never had a chance to meet with him. I was only helped by a nurse practitioner. The office staff are not friendly. I have to wait more than one hour past my appointment time until they let me in.I am looking for a better Dr. in my area. I do not recommend this Dr. Schmidt to any one.

I would definitely find a doctor other than Dr. Schmidt.I arrived on time for my 12:30 appointment. Â After waiting (with many others!) in the waiting area, I was finally let into a room at 1:45. Â (Yes! Â One hour and fifteen minutes in the waiting area!) Â Once inside one of the patient rooms, I thought I would be promptly seen. Â However, it was about 2:15 when the NP came in for my appointment. Â  This doctor's office needs to be more considerate to its patients. Â There are just too many other doctors out there to choose from. Â I will be looking for another one myself.

Dr. Schmidt is our primary care physician. I swear, I've probably been there about 10 times now, and I've met the man once. You're pretty much in the care of the nurses, assistants, and physican's assistant. Don't bother making an appointment b/c you'll never be seen on time (prepare to wait at least an additional 30-60 minutes). The waiting room can get quite full. Even if you're the first appointment of the day, you'll be seen about 15 minutes after the fact, but that's still way better than the mid-mornings and afternoons. Parking is a pain b/c there is no direct access from the lot. You'll have to either walk through another building or walk around the lot itself. Street parking is accessible, but never available. The reason for the extra star is for the receptionist, Nancy. She is great. Very understanding, attentive, and will go out of her way to make you happy.

Be prepared for very long wait times if you are a patient. You can hear patients in the waiting room comparing notes on how long they've been there, and some were there for 2-3 hours. A fellow staff member/patient waited over 2 hours. The majority of the problems I had were with the front office staff that while friendly left me anxious of the accuracy and quality of care and proper billing of my visits. My insurance card was left in the copier, and I had to return to the office to retrieve it when I went to a local pharmacy and realized it had never been returned to me. Not only was it left in the copier, but it was never actually copied. I learned this on a visit two weeks later when they verified my insurance and they still had my previous insurance on record. I was given a referral phone number for a specialist, and the phone number was inaccurate. On one visit, none of the office staff present that day knew how to enter procedures in the system being utilized at the time. If you're one of the lucky ones to actually see the doctor, he's a very nice individual. The front office staff are relatively friendly as well. I just wish I wasn't nervous after each visit if the administrative side will be properly taken care of.Bottom line: If I was asked to recommend this office, I would be hesitant.

Health care in this day and age is confusing, it is important when you do see a Dr. that they have your best interest at heart and Dr Schmidt does, and he will be your advocate. Â Regardless of your age he will help guide you to the best health possible. Dr Schmidt will spend as much time with you and answer questions with as much depth and insight as he can, he cares about his patients. I have seen him when I am not feeling well, He is very thorough and orders additional tests to rule things out; he made sure I was happy with the referrals he gave. He takes notes and refers back to them in your chart from year to year, and follows up to make sure you're recovering. Â I have also been there when I am healthy and we discussed diet and exercise, he measured my body fat and we discussed my blood work in depth ways to improve things over a life time. I suggest going at the end of the day and call ahead to check on the wait before hand.

Dr Schmidt is OK, but his staff is generally terrible. Nancy may be OK, but many of the others are cranky, make mistakes etc...It can take weeks to get an appointment, when you finally get one the wait is terrible. Years ago you could see him or his partner on a Saturday, or a Wednesday night. Now he's solo, he does NOT have Wednesday night or Saturday appointments, and I think he's actually there twice a week at best.They have messed up appointments, records, and once the nurse (?) gave my husband incorrect information about an injection he was about to receive. My husband got nervous and just told them to forget it, and he left. I checked with the CDC later and that nurse did NOT know what she was talking about! Would she have given my husband the wrong injection???? YIKES.Then they charged someone else's appointment to my husband's insurance!I say switch to his former partner's group, Dr. Jimenez/team on 1st & Western, who NEVER makes you wait weeks to get in.

Baudler DOCFrom the Inside Flap"The new Dictionary of Luther and the Lutheran Traditions is a welcome addition to the historical and theological reference shelf. Timothy Wengert and his editorial board have assembled an impressive roster of scholars to produce a well-designed work that brings up-to-date scholarship to bear on topical and biographical studies of Lutheranism from the Reformation to the present day."--RichardÂ A. Muller, senior fellow, Junius Institute for Digital Reformation Research, P.Â J. Zondervan Professor of Historical Theology, Emeritus, Calvin Theological Seminary"This impressive work will undoubtedly adorn many bookshelves and enlighten many readers from laypersons to seminarians and from clergy to teachers in higher education. The editors have gathered an impressive team of contributors writing on the historical development of the Lutheran Reformation, its global outreach, and its present significance. One can only congratulate Baker Academic for producing such a massive, easily accessible, and valuable resource."--Hans Schwarz, professor emeritus of systematic theology and contemporary theological issues, University of Regensburg, Germany"Can a dictionary be both informative and inspiring? The Dictionary of Luther and the Lutheran Traditions certainly is. The contributing scholars have given us a remarkably informative volume that explains theological doctrines, explores controversies, and describes Lutherans engaged in varied historical, global, and ecumenical contexts. The volume serves as an inspirational reminder that Lutherans continue to be a worldwide, five-hundred-year-old reforming movement within the church catholic, for the sake of the gospel."--MarkÂ S. Hanson, executive director, Christensen Center for Vocation, Augsburg CollegeFrom the Back CoverAn Essential Resource for Pastors, Scholars, and Students"An immensely valuable resource. Wide-reaching in scope and brimming with first-rate scholarship, this dictionary will be indispensable for anyone interested in Luther and the global history of Lutheranism."--Carlos Eire, T.Â Lawrason Riggs Professor of History and Religious Studies, Yale University"This comprehensive dictionary of Lutheranism will be a welcome addition to the library of anyone with interest in the Lutheran Reformation or the progress of Lutheranism to the present day. It is a gold mine of useful information on the topic, all contained conveniently between two boards."--Tony Lane, professor of historical theology, London School of Theology"Remarkable in its comprehensiveness, this volume is at once deeply attentive to the figures and ideas that spawned the Lutheran movement in sixteenth-century Germany and truly catholic in its coverage of that movement's subsequent theological development and global expansion.Â The scope and precision of the hundreds of entries, penned by leading scholars from across (and beyond) the Lutheran world, make the Dictionary of Luther and the Lutheran Traditions an essential reference work for pastors and scholars seeking to engage the full breadth of Lutheran faith and practice in all its diversity."--Ian A. McFarland, Regius Professor of Divinity, University of Cambridge"This book is a most welcome and highly informative tool for commemorating five hundred years of the Reformation. In an impressive way, it presents not only the complex cosmos of the Reformation in the sixteenth century but also the spreading of Lutheranism through time and space, offering an overview of Lutheran intellectual history. Especially helpful are the entries on Lutheranism in various countries and on unfamiliar but remarkable personalities."--Theodor Dieter, Institute for Ecumenical Research, Strasbourg"Rarely if ever has there been such a treasure trove of resources about Martin Luther and the traditions that bear his name gathered in one place. Well-researched, thorough, and highly readable, the Dictionary of Luther and the Lutheran Traditions draws from a constellation of the world's most highly regarded Luther scholars to produce the definitive guide to the Lutheran church. It is a singular and remarkable achievement."--DavidÂ J. Lose, senior pastor, Mount Olivet Lutheran Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota; past president, The Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia"This exceptional reference work contains outstanding, wide-ranging, and well-written contributions covered by a superb group of scholars."--Jon Balserak, senior lecturer in early modern religion, University of Bristol; visiting scholar in history, University of Illinois at ChicagoAbout the AuthorTimothy J.
