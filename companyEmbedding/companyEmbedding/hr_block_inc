Online Tax Return
Tax Return Online
Filing an online tax return is often presented as an easy alternative to traditional filing practices, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the process is self-explanatory. There are a number of important factors to consider when choosing the right service provider and taking advantage of deduction opportunities. Start with these tips for a successful experience.

Only choose IRS-authorized e-filers
In the Fiscal Year 2012, the Internal Revenue Service conducted 900 identity theft-related criminal investigations. Unfortunately, this figure increases every year with the growth of e-filing services. In many cases, the problem involved using an e-filer that wasn't authorized by the IRS. Make sure to take advantage of the Authorized IRS e-file Provider Locator, which allows you to contact an IRS-authorized tax professional in your area who has an approved electronic filing program.


Take advantage of IRA contributions
Say you went through the whole e-file process and aren't exactly happy with the figure you got. With most deductions, the deadline for your tax return is December 31 of the previous year. However, those who qualify for IRA contributions can make them up until April 15 of the following year. Choosing this method can help you keep more of your money in the long run.


Choose direct deductions and deposits
One of the most convenient aspects of filing a tax return online is that you can pay with a debit or credit card, or take the funds directly from your bank account. Direct deduction and deposit is typically the fastest way to undergo the process, while also reducing the risk of identity theft and processing errors.
 
H&R Block is an IRS-approved center for filing online tax returns. If you have questions or concerns about getting everything covered before filing, our tax professionals would be happy to help you optimize your online tax return. With over 12,000 locations across the country, you can count on easy accessibility and maximum convenience.

About Form 1040 
Form 1040 is the most complex of the three major individual tax forms. However, it offers many tax breaks you can't get if you file a simpler form, like Form 1040EZ or Form 1040A. You can report all types of income, expenses, and credits on a 1040.
If you receive these types of income, you must file a 1040:

Self-employment income
Tips you didn't report to your employer
Income you receive as one of these:


Partner in a partnership
Shareholder in an S corporation
Beneficiary of an estate or trust


Insurance policy dividends that are more than the premiums you paid
Interest you received or paid on securities that were transferred between interest payment dates
Distributions from a foreign trust

You also must file a 1040 if any of these apply:

You qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion. To learn more, see the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion tax tip.
You qualify to exclude income from sources in Puerto Rico or American Samoa since you were a bona fide resident of either.
You have an Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) adjustment on stock you got by exercising an incentive stock option.
You owe excise tax on insider stock compensation you got from an expatriated corporation.
You're reporting an original issue discount (OID) amount that doesn't match the amount on Form 1099-OID. To learn more, see Publication 1212: List of Original Issue Discount Instruments at www.irs.gov.
You owe household employment taxes. To learn more, see Schedule H instructions.
You're eligible for the premium tax credit. To learn more, see the Form 8962 instructions.
You're claiming the adoption credit or you received employer-provided adoption benefits. To learn more, see the Adoption Expenses tax tip.
You're a debtor in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case filed after Oct. 16, 2005.
Your employer didn’t withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes from your pay.
You had a qualified health savings account (HSA) funding distribution from your IRA.
You have a loss attributable to a federally declared disaster area.
You’re repaying the first-time homebuyer credit.

To learn more, see Publication 525: Taxable and Nontaxable Income at www.irs.gov.

This is a review for the IdentoGO services provided inside this H&R Block.

I came here to complete my TSA PreCheck application. The place was empty save for the one guy working here. All the empty cubicles made this place feel like an abandoned building in a ghost town. That's what happens when tax season is over!

I had an appointment, but I could've easily have just walked in. After I signed in, the gentleman took me to the back of the office and seated me in front of a monitor. He went over my information (which was already in the system because I'd entered it when booking my appointment), took my fingerprints digitally (no messy ink!), and took my credit card for payment.

The whole process was extremely efficient and was over in 5 minutes. Seriously, it took me longer to write this review than the amount of time I spent in the H&R Block office!







Lew Lee has been helping me find peace of mind at tax time in recent years.

Friendly help without judgement makes all the difference.







This is also the location for TSA Pre enrollment. I am only commenting on their TSA Pre services. Do NOT, I repeat,  Do NOT show up here without an appt. While walk-ins are supposed to be served when appts. don't show they will do everything possible to not serve a walk-in, even taking appt. holders 10 min. early ahead of a walk-in. It actually reached a point of ridiculousness where the other walk-in and I bet that even though we were the only two in the waiting room, we bet that they still would wait for an appt. to show vs. serve us.

My husband and I just had a great conversation with Sudhanshu Biswal. We had some initial questions about our taxes this year, and Sudhanshu was honest, knowledgeable and gave us some great next steps.







Had a 9:00 AM appointment with Bill Chan this morning. He is such a personable fellow, he made the whole nasty, tax paying ordeal, a walk in the park. The lady upfront, seemed to be a little lost, as to what her duties were, not sure if it was her first day, or if she was in training. I let her know I was there, she seemed to try to verify my appointment, then nothing. I just stood there, not knowing if she had finished with me or not. Finally, I just went and sat down, then someone else came out, and let me know my appointment would be in a few minutes. Other, than that, it would've been 5 stars. A humorous side note, the poor receptionist also, had the printer run out of ink on her (tough first morning) and she wasn't sure how to fix it. My girlfriend over heard her dilemma, and when Bill and I came out of the cubicle, my girlfriend was loading the printer ink for the lady. glad she could help and I will definitely use them again. Parking was not to bad.







The tax consultant Mindy Szutu was not able to explain any of the decisions she was talking while filing my returns. At the very least, she should have been able to explain why she was using itemized versus standard deductions, but she could not since she was basically trying the brute force method of keying in different combinations into the software to see which combination gave the lowest tax.

She was also not able to explain other things like whether we should file jointly since we were married or separately. She came to the conclusion based on 2 reports she ran that we should file separately. However, when cross checking her work ,I realized she had  made an error that would have led me to pay $7000 in excess tax. Also, similar to other peoples experience, the initial estimate was $300-$400, but in the end it became $700 because our returns were"complicated". Both my husband and I have usual bay area type income - salary and stock options from our employers, plus some mutual fund investments. Nothing too complicated, yet they were unable to give us an accurate estimate of the cost of filing a return. 

I do not see the point of paying $700 for shoddy work where I have no confidence in the decisions made.







I've been getting my taxes done at this location for about a decade now and Block has never let me down.  I've had the same person the entire time and she is great.  She checks in with me a few weeks before the office opens to make sure I'm ready to come back, and if not she helps me figure out what papers I need.  No one likes to pay taxes but Block makes it pretty easy to be done in about an hour with their computers having all my previous information stored.  Thanks to them I'm guaranteed to be getting my maximum refund, and I like that.  Thanks H&R Block!







When you come to this particular H&R Block, please check which agent you are going to be going to. And avoid Annie Jones!! I filed this year's taxes with her and I had an awful experience. After getting a quote of about $150, I finally ended up paying $420. This is almost thrice the amount quoted and she justified with a random split-up from her computer! To top it all, she wasn't able to convincingly answer any of the questions I asked about the very numbers she was handing us. The whole point of going to an external agent to handle all this, is to be sure that it is all handled. But the service was poor and misquoted and worst of all, provided no confidence whatsoever.







Anna always make filing taxes for me so easy. Being someone who waits until the last few days to file, it's nice to know that I can count on her and her team to help me get my taxes done right and in less than an hour. She was calm, patient, even gave me tips on how to save money and what to watch out for when filing. Thanks for having my back Anna and I'll see you next year! 

I had to remove a star (4/5) for lack of WiFi, but had an overall great experience!







Never use Annie Jones- she forgot to file our return. 

I honestly do not think I need to write any more than that because forgetting to file someone's returns equals she doesn't do her job. But here it goes... My husband and I went to H&R Block for the first time- we were loyal Turbotax users. But seeing as we bought a house last year, we gave this a shot. We set up the appointment and went. Annie's demenaor was unemotional, unfriendly, and uncommunicative. She did not explain any part of the process or ramifications. She just put numbers into the computer which spit out how much we owed. When we had questions, she was unable to answer them intelligently or give us any kind of remedial suggestions for next year. I asked her up front how much the services would cost and she quoted us about $200. It turned out to be $350. We paid it reluctantly- and said- whatever, our taxes are done. Or so we thought. 

On taxes, you can choose the date that the gov't removes the owed funds. We chose 2 weeks from when we met with Annie. That day came and went and nothing was deducted. I thought that odd because at the end of the day, it's the feds. They need their money. So i gave it a few more days and still no withdrawal. So I called the office and asked about it. I was met with a highly unintelligent, very difficult to understand women on the other end of the phone that could not understand my question. Once we finally gained comprehension at a 1st grad level- they said, oh that date is arbitrary, don't worry the gov't will take out their money. I laughed and said- well then don't give people the option to set the date- just tell them it will be taken out when the gov't gets around to it. I then went home  a little skeptical and looked up on the H&R Block website the status of our filing- it came up with "no information". That again raised red flags. I called the office again and got a new lady, much more helpful and intelligent. She looked up my info and thought that was odd so she promised to call me back. No call was returned. The next morning- blood beginning to boil- i checked online again. The status now said our return was rejected by the IRS. Neat.

I called the customer service line which they recommended doing which had no more information and told me to call the office that had filed to work with them. Here we go again. I called, same unintelligible woman answers- I ask to speak to someone else or a manager- she refuses. So I try to once again explain the situation- and she says "OH- I filed your return last night". I am sorry, what? You filed my returns only after I reminded you that they were not filed? You filed them in a hurry because the client called you and told you to do your job? Cool. She then told me she was with someone and would have to call me back. I told her that I had some serious questions for her but she refused to answer them and told me she would call me back. I said fine and hung up. No call was returned. I finally call back- get the nice lady again. She said that my tax preparer was going to call me back in 5 minutes. Nope, she didn't. So I went over there- to see this through in person. I get there and my tax preparer is getting water and chatting it up with the receptionist. She sees me and gets uncomfortable. I grabbed a tootsie roll from the bowl and sit down in her office. 

She explains that she wasn't in yesterday and that's why there was no call back- but our taxes are filed and received by the gov't. She said she forgot to follow up with her manager to get it approved before sending it in and that's why they weren't filed until now. I explained how unacceptable that was and how that is not doing her job. I told her that I shouldn't have to prompt her to do her job. It is my taxes- my life- my money. She needs to be respectful of that. She didn't get it- no affect- no apology. I asked her what remedy I could get for this oversight. She forwarded me to her manager- who I intend to follow up with for a major complaint and requesting a discount. This is NOT the service I am paying for. I could have done our taxes with Turbotax and trusted that it was filed. Instead, I left this responsibility in Annie's hands- and she failed.







I was so unimpressed with this office. The woman i spoke with was discouraging and unhelpful. I have used H&R Block in the past, but this was my first experience at this office. The worst service. So vague, uninterested, unhelpful.  Go somewhere else for tax advice.







I am impressed!

Obviously, I am writing this review about my own personal experience (a somewhat basic tax return) and everyone has different tax issues, but I can say that I was pleasantly surprised by the customer service and tax support at this H&R Block location. 

I have heard some horror stories about H&R Block and I was usure of what the process would be like. I made an appointment with William Lucas. I came in and was helped right away. William is obviously highly knowledgeable in tax preparation. He was SO helpful and answered all of my questions. He truly presented fantastic customer service. He encouraged me to do what was best for me and even encouraged me to file taxes on my own if possible, to avoid high fees on a basic return. I walked away feeling like he really cares about me and is not just after my money. You don't see too many people like that these days. 

I am sure that all tax preparers are different, but William appeared to be top notch and I would definitely recommend him. You can view the tax preparer profiles on the H&R Block website to see what kind of education and experience they have. Next time I have tax questions or need someone to do my taxes, I will head over to H&R Block without hesitation.







I had my taxes done with H&r block and was in communication with Anna regarding my return. When she finished, I received an email staying I would receive $900 back but would pay $393.25 in fees to h&r block because my return was "complicated". I am a 25 year old student with two W-2 forms and some mileage receipts! How is that complicated?! Luckily I got my forms back without them filing and I went to Turbo Tax! I get over $1100 back and am paying $50 in fees. Not only that, but Anna told me I'd lose money if I claimed my donations. Funny how I did claim that on Turbo Tax and get MORE MONEY BACK! Don't go to H&R block!!!!!!







My partner and I were so blown away by our experience here yesterday with Annie.  We have done our own taxes for years, but wanted help because we weren't sure about how to handle the intricacies of California domestic partnership along with the addition of our baby.  The former, we'd figured out on the past, but we had questions about claiming the latter between us.  (Side note: One more reason it sucks that the Fed doesn't recognize SSM is the multiple different returns you have to file...). We made an appt. and went in, planning to pay however much we needed to in order to get it right on the eyes of the IRS.  We sat down with Annie, preparing to resist up selling, etc.  She looked at our past years' self-prepared returns, and said, "You really don't need us, you've already done this, just do xyz to handle the baby."  We were delighted and shocked, and went on our happy way!  THEN, an hour or so later, she called us back to say, "I did some research and wanted to make this small change to my advice..."   I was so so so impressed by her integrity and thoroughness!  We did not spend a dime, and still she went the extra step to follow up, after saving us however much money we were willing and ready to pay!  I think we'll need help at some point when things get more complicated, and when we do, I am going back to Annie!  Again, integrity and awesome customer service!

But here it goes... My husband and I went to H&R Block for the first time- we were loyal Turbotax users. But seeing as we bought a house last year, we gave this a shot. We set up the appointment and went. Annie's demenaor was unemotional, unfriendly, and uncommunicative. She did not explain any part of the process or ramifications. She just put numbers into the computer which spit out how much we owed. When we had questions, she was unable to answer them intelligently or give us any kind of remedial suggestions for next year. I asked her up front how much the services would cost and she quoted us about $200. It turned out to be $350. We paid it reluctantly- and said- whatever, our taxes are done. Or so we thought. On taxes, you can choose the date that the gov't removes the owed funds. We chose 2 weeks from when we met with Annie. That day came and went and nothing was deducted. I thought that odd because at the end of the day, it's the feds. They need their money. So i gave it a few more days and still no withdrawal. So I called the office and asked about it. I was met with a highly unintelligent, very difficult to understand women on the other end of the phone that could not understand my question. Once we finally gained comprehension at a 1st grad level- they said, oh that date is arbitrary, don't worry the gov't will take out their money. I laughed and said- well then don't give people the option to set the date- just tell them it will be taken out when the gov't gets around to it. I then went home  a little skeptical and looked up on the H&R Block website the status of our filing- it came up with "no information". That again raised red flags. I called the office again and got a new lady, much more helpful and intelligent. She looked up my info and thought that was odd so she promised to call me back. No call was returned. The next morning- blood beginning to boil- i checked online again. The status now said our return was rejected by the IRS. Neat.I called the customer service line which they recommended doing which had no more information and told me to call the office that had filed to work with them. Here we go again. I called, same unintelligible woman answers- I ask to speak to someone else or a manager- she refuses. So I try to once again explain the situation- and she says "OH- I filed your return last night". I am sorry, what? You filed my returns only after I reminded you that they were not filed? You filed them in a hurry because the client called you and told you to do your job? Cool. She then told me she was with someone and would have to call me back. I told her that I had some serious questions for her but she refused to answer them and told me she would call me back. I said fine and hung up. No call was returned. I finally call back- get the nice lady again. She said that my tax preparer was going to call me back in 5 minutes. Nope, she didn't. So I went over there- to see this through in person. I get there and my tax preparer is getting water and chatting it up with the receptionist. She sees me and gets uncomfortable. I grabbed a tootsie roll from the bowl and sit down in her office. She explains that she wasn't in yesterday and that's why there was no call back- but our taxes are filed and received by the gov't. She said she forgot to follow up with her manager to get it approved before sending it in and that's why they weren't filed until now. I explained how unacceptable that was and how that is not doing her job. I told her that I shouldn't have to prompt her to do her job. It is my taxes- my life- my money. She needs to be respectful of that. She didn't get it- no affect- no apology. I asked her what remedy I could get for this oversight. She forwarded me to her manager- who I intend to follow up with for a major complaint and requesting a discount. This is NOT the service I am paying for. I could have done our taxes with Turbotax and trusted that it was filed. Instead, I left this responsibility in Annie's hands- and she failed.

I was so unimpressed with this office. The woman i spoke with was discouraging and unhelpful. I have used H&R Block in the past, but this was my first experience at this office. The worst service. So vague, uninterested, unhelpful.  Go somewhere else for tax advice.

I am impressed!Obviously, I am writing this review about my own personal experience (a somewhat basic tax return) and everyone has different tax issues, but I can say that I was pleasantly surprised by the customer service and tax support at this H&R Block location. I have heard some horror stories about H&R Block and I was usure of what the process would be like. I made an appointment with William Lucas. I came in and was helped right away. William is obviously highly knowledgeable in tax preparation. He was SO helpful and answered all of my questions. He truly presented fantastic customer service. He encouraged me to do what was best for me and even encouraged me to file taxes on my own if possible, to avoid high fees on a basic return. I walked away feeling like he really cares about me and is not just after my money. You don't see too many people like that these days. I am sure that all tax preparers are different, but William appeared to be top notch and I would definitely recommend him. You can view the tax preparer profiles on the H&R Block website to see what kind of education and experience they have. Next time I have tax questions or need someone to do my taxes, I will head over to H&R Block without hesitation.

I had my taxes done with H&r block and was in communication with Anna regarding my return. When she finished, I received an email staying I would receive $900 back but would pay $393.25 in fees to h&r block because my return was "complicated". I am a 25 year old student with two W-2 forms and some mileage receipts! How is that complicated?! Luckily I got my forms back without them filing and I went to Turbo Tax! I get over $1100 back and am paying $50 in fees. Not only that, but Anna told me I'd lose money if I claimed my donations. Funny how I did claim that on Turbo Tax and get MORE MONEY BACK! Don't go to H&R block!!!!!!

My partner and I were so blown away by our experience here yesterday with Annie.  We have done our own taxes for years, but wanted help because we weren't sure about how to handle the intricacies of California domestic partnership along with the addition of our baby.  The former, we'd figured out on the past, but we had questions about claiming the latter between us.  (Side note: One more reason it sucks that the Fed doesn't recognize SSM is the multiple different returns you have to file...). We made an appt. and went in, planning to pay however much we needed to in order to get it right on the eyes of the IRS.  We sat down with Annie, preparing to resist up selling, etc.  She looked at our past years' self-prepared returns, and said, "You really don't need us, you've already done this, just do xyz to handle the baby."  We were delighted and shocked, and went on our happy way!  THEN, an hour or so later, she called us back to say, "I did some research and wanted to make this small change to my advice..."   I was so so so impressed by her integrity and thoroughness!  We did not spend a dime, and still she went the extra step to follow up, after saving us however much money we were willing and ready to pay!  I think we'll need help at some point when things get more complicated, and when we do, I am going back to Annie!  Again, integrity and awesome customer service!

History[edit]
During World War II, Henry W. Bloch was a young Army Air Forces navigator who wanted to start a family business with his brothers in Kansas City.[1]
Home from the war in 1946, Henry saw a pamphlet suggesting a bright future for companies serving small businesses, and it fired his imagination.[1] That year, Henry and his older brother, Leon, borrowed $5,000 and opened a small bookkeeping business on Main Street in downtown Kansas City.[1] However, four months later, they had few clients and Leon decided to seek a law degree.[1]
Henry wanted to keep trying with the fledgling business and placed a newspaper ad for help-wanted.[1] He got an unexpected response—from his mother—who proposed that Henry hire his younger brother, Richard, for the job.[1] Henry and Richard Bloch jointly ran their United Business Company, which focused on bookkeeping, but also did some income tax work for clients. The brothers found that doing taxes was time consuming and they decided to end that type of service. One of their clients, John White, an ad salesman for The Kansas City Star newspaper, had a different idea; he suggested the Blochs make tax preparation a separate business and developed an ad announcing $5 tax services. The Blochs were not convinced, but they agreed to run the ad in January 1955. The next day, the brothers had an office full of tax clients, and H&R Block was born.
In 1956, the Blochs decided to expand and picked New York City. The move was profitable, but neither brother wanted to move to New York, so they agreed to sell that regional operation to two local accountants. However, since the would-be buyers could not meet the asking price, the parties agreed the Bloch brothers would get $10,000, plus royalties from the tax operation, creating the first H&R Block franchise tax office. The Bloch brothers chose to spell the name "Block" with a K to ensure the name is not mispronounced "blotch."[2] In the following years, H&R Block grew quickly and went public in 1962, then opened its first tax training school in 1965 to meet the demand for skilled tax professionals at its franchise offices.
A TV ad campaign begun in 1972 featured Henry Bloch and became the springboard for H&R Block becoming one of the most widely recognized brand names in the U.S. In 1980 H&R Block purchased the Compuserve online service.
By 1986, Block was handling more than 10 million tax returns each year and had opened offices in Canada and Australia. That year, Block worked with the Internal Revenue Service to introduce electronic filing. Since then, Block has moved further into the digital realm with tax software and online tax preparation.
The company began to expand in the 1990s into the financial services arena, offering mortgage loans, banking, and business services. H&R Block purchased Olde Discount Stockbrokers and operated as a full-service securities broker-dealer under the name H&R Block Financial Advisors. By 2007, the unit was managing $33 billion in assets, offering investment planning, advice and related financial products and services, and employed 900 financial advisors in the U.S. In 2008, H&R Block sold the unit to Ameriprise Financial for US$ 315 million.[3]
RSM McGladrey Business Solutions was created in 1999 when H&R Block acquired the assets and business of McGladrey & Pullen, based in Bloomington, Minnesota. McGladrey had 100 offices in 25 states and offered accounting, consulting, tax services, and international business services to mid-sized companies. Its clients included business in the construction, health care and manufacturing industries. Through an alliance with McGladrey & Pullen and other accountancies, the Block subsidiary operated in 70 countries under the RSM International name. In 2011, H&R Block sold the unit to McGladrey & Pullen.[4]
Business areas[edit]
Retail tax services[edit]




H&R Block Tax Service - Mar 2013


In May 2007, the company said its total U.S. clients served during the 2007 tax season reached a record 19.9 million, up 3.8 percent from the previous year period.[5] H&R Block employs 90,000 tax preparers. The company reported that in 2007, its tax clients obtained US$30 billion in tax refunds, credits and other government benefits. The company said it filed US$10 billion worth of Earned Income Tax Credits for its low-income clients.
Digital tax services[edit]
H&R Block competes for a share of the digital market with its online tax programs and software. Block's other digital offerings include H&R Block Best of Both, where clients enter their information and do their returns online and a Block tax professional reviews, edits, signs and e-files the return.

H&R Block Bank[edit]
The H&R Block Bank was chartered in 2006 and offers low-cost services to its low- to moderate-income customers. Block has said that more than one-third of its clients do not have bank accounts, and must pay high check-cashing fees for their paychecks and tax refund checks. Bank customers can establish FDIC-insured accounts with their tax refund money and then access those funds with pre-paid "Emerald" MasterCards through a nationwide network of ATMs. The accounts also allow direct payroll deposits via ACH and clients can get traditional services, such as lines of credit and individual retirement accounts.
In September 2015, H&R Block sold H&R Block Bank to BofI Holding Inc and reached an agreement for BofI to serve as the bank for H&R Block-branded financial services products including the Emerald MasterCard, Refund Anticipation Checks, and Emerald Advance lines of credit.[6]
Block Advisors[edit]
In January 2016, H&R Block launched Block Advisors, a service that provides year-round consumer tax preparation.[7] The company says they have opened 280 Block Advisor offices.[8]
Controversies[edit]
H&R Block's own taxes[edit]
In August 2005, H&R Block announced that it had overstated its earnings for 2003 and 2004 by $91.1 million. The company stated that it had "insufficient resources" to identify and report complex transactions in its corporate tax accounting. On February 23, 2006, the company said in its quarterly results that it had miscalculated its own state income taxes for 2005 and 2004, and that it owed an additional $32 million in back taxes. That mistake, plus Block's lower-than-expected earnings for the quarter, caused its stock price to drop by 8.5 percent in one day. At April 30, 2008, the company's liability recorded for "uncertain tax positions" totaled $137.6 million (excluding related interest and penalties). According to H&R Block, "This liability represents an estimate of tax positions we have taken in our tax returns that may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities." Estimated gross interest and penalties relating to these potential assessments totaled an additional $47.5 million.[9][10]
Refund anticipation loans[edit]
On Feb. 15, 2006, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer sued H&R Block, alleging the company's refund anticipation loan (RAL) business violated state and federal laws in its marketing and providing of high-cost RALs mainly to low-income clients. Block responded that it "believes the refund lending program is both fair and legal, and will vigorously defend against the complaint". On January 2, 2009, California Attorney General Edmund G. Brown Jr. reached a $4.85 million settlement with H&R Block, which prohibits the company from deceptively marketing high-cost refund anticipation loans as early "tax refunds". Consumers received up to $2.45 million in restitution if they purchased a "refund anticipation loan" or a "refund anticipation check" through H&R Block between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2008. In addition, H&R Block agreed to pay $500,000 in penalties and $1.9 million in fees and costs.[11][12] In 2011, H&R Block ceased offering RALs altogether, a move praised by consumer rights activists.[13]
Express IRA[edit]
On March 16, 2006, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued H&R Block, accusing the company of deceptive marketing of its Express IRA retirement accounts. The lawsuit alleged the company assessed fees, including set-up fees, annual fees, and account closing fees that, for 85% of account holders, resulted in the account losing money.[14] However, in July 2007, a New York state judge dismissed much of the lawsuit.[15] Justice Karla Moskowitz of the State Supreme Court excused Block and five of its units from the lawsuit. She let stand the portion of the complaint concerning another unit, H&R Block Financial Advisers, but dismissed allegations of common law fraud. At the time of the ruling, Block said it believed the remaining assertions lacked merit and that it would appeal. On January 6, 2009, a New York state appeals court overruled trial justice Karla Moskowitz's July 2007 ruling and reinstated the lawsuit against H&R Block Inc that accused the company of fraudulently marketing Express IRA retirement accounts to hundreds of thousands of lower-income clients nationwide.[16] The matter was settled in 2009.
Social Security numbers[edit]
In December 2005, H&R Block sent its customers free copies of its TaxCut software, and the mailing labels on the packages mistakenly included the recipients' Social Security numbers. Block said it sent the promotional mailing to former customers and people whose names were taken from purchased lists. The company said it is legally required to hold on to customers' tax information, including Social Security numbers, for three years. Block said no customer data has been lost or stolen as a result of the mistake, and that less than 3 percent of the mailings were involved.[17]

History[edit]
During World War II, Henry W. Bloch was a young Army Air Forces navigator who wanted to start a family business with his brothers in Kansas City.[1]
Home from the war in 1946, Henry saw a pamphlet suggesting a bright future for companies serving small businesses, and it fired his imagination.[1] That year, Henry and his older brother, Leon, borrowed $5,000 and opened a small bookkeeping business on Main Street in downtown Kansas City.[1] However, four months later, they had few clients and Leon decided to seek a law degree.[1]
Henry wanted to keep trying with the fledgling business and placed a newspaper ad for help-wanted.[1] He got an unexpected response—from his mother—who proposed that Henry hire his younger brother, Richard, for the job.[1] Henry and Richard Bloch jointly ran their United Business Company, which focused on bookkeeping, but also did some income tax work for clients. The brothers found that doing taxes was time consuming and they decided to end that type of service. One of their clients, John White, an ad salesman for The Kansas City Star newspaper, had a different idea; he suggested the Blochs make tax preparation a separate business and developed an ad announcing $5 tax services. The Blochs were not convinced, but they agreed to run the ad in January 1955. The next day, the brothers had an office full of tax clients, and H&R Block was born.
In 1956, the Blochs decided to expand and picked New York City. The move was profitable, but neither brother wanted to move to New York, so they agreed to sell that regional operation to two local accountants. However, since the would-be buyers could not meet the asking price, the parties agreed the Bloch brothers would get $10,000, plus royalties from the tax operation, creating the first H&R Block franchise tax office. The Bloch brothers chose to spell the name "Block" with a K to ensure the name is not mispronounced "blotch."[2] In the following years, H&R Block grew quickly and went public in 1962, then opened its first tax training school in 1965 to meet the demand for skilled tax professionals at its franchise offices.
A TV ad campaign begun in 1972 featured Henry Bloch and became the springboard for H&R Block becoming one of the most widely recognized brand names in the U.S. In 1980 H&R Block purchased the Compuserve online service.
By 1986, Block was handling more than 10 million tax returns each year and had opened offices in Canada and Australia. That year, Block worked with the Internal Revenue Service to introduce electronic filing. Since then, Block has moved further into the digital realm with tax software and online tax preparation.
The company began to expand in the 1990s into the financial services arena, offering mortgage loans, banking, and business services. H&R Block purchased Olde Discount Stockbrokers and operated as a full-service securities broker-dealer under the name H&R Block Financial Advisors. By 2007, the unit was managing $33 billion in assets, offering investment planning, advice and related financial products and services, and employed 900 financial advisors in the U.S. In 2008, H&R Block sold the unit to Ameriprise Financial for US$ 315 million.[3]
RSM McGladrey Business Solutions was created in 1999 when H&R Block acquired the assets and business of McGladrey & Pullen, based in Bloomington, Minnesota. McGladrey had 100 offices in 25 states and offered accounting, consulting, tax services, and international business services to mid-sized companies. Its clients included business in the construction, health care and manufacturing industries. Through an alliance with McGladrey & Pullen and other accountancies, the Block subsidiary operated in 70 countries under the RSM International name. In 2011, H&R Block sold the unit to McGladrey & Pullen.[4]
Business areas[edit]
Retail tax services[edit]




H&R Block Tax Service - Mar 2013


In May 2007, the company said its total U.S. clients served during the 2007 tax season reached a record 19.9 million, up 3.8 percent from the previous year period.[5] H&R Block employs 90,000 tax preparers. The company reported that in 2007, its tax clients obtained US$30 billion in tax refunds, credits and other government benefits. The company said it filed US$10 billion worth of Earned Income Tax Credits for its low-income clients.
Digital tax services[edit]
H&R Block competes for a share of the digital market with its online tax programs and software. Block's other digital offerings include H&R Block Best of Both, where clients enter their information and do their returns online and a Block tax professional reviews, edits, signs and e-files the return.

H&R Block Bank[edit]
The H&R Block Bank was chartered in 2006 and offers low-cost services to its low- to moderate-income customers. Block has said that more than one-third of its clients do not have bank accounts, and must pay high check-cashing fees for their paychecks and tax refund checks. Bank customers can establish FDIC-insured accounts with their tax refund money and then access those funds with pre-paid "Emerald" MasterCards through a nationwide network of ATMs. The accounts also allow direct payroll deposits via ACH and clients can get traditional services, such as lines of credit and individual retirement accounts.
In September 2015, H&R Block sold H&R Block Bank to BofI Holding Inc and reached an agreement for BofI to serve as the bank for H&R Block-branded financial services products including the Emerald MasterCard, Refund Anticipation Checks, and Emerald Advance lines of credit.[6]
Block Advisors[edit]
In January 2016, H&R Block launched Block Advisors, a service that provides year-round consumer tax preparation.[7] The company says they have opened 280 Block Advisor offices.[8]
Controversies[edit]
H&R Block's own taxes[edit]
In August 2005, H&R Block announced that it had overstated its earnings for 2003 and 2004 by $91.1 million. The company stated that it had "insufficient resources" to identify and report complex transactions in its corporate tax accounting. On February 23, 2006, the company said in its quarterly results that it had miscalculated its own state income taxes for 2005 and 2004, and that it owed an additional $32 million in back taxes. That mistake, plus Block's lower-than-expected earnings for the quarter, caused its stock price to drop by 8.5 percent in one day. At April 30, 2008, the company's liability recorded for "uncertain tax positions" totaled $137.6 million (excluding related interest and penalties). According to H&R Block, "This liability represents an estimate of tax positions we have taken in our tax returns that may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities." Estimated gross interest and penalties relating to these potential assessments totaled an additional $47.5 million.[9][10]
Refund anticipation loans[edit]
On Feb. 15, 2006, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer sued H&R Block, alleging the company's refund anticipation loan (RAL) business violated state and federal laws in its marketing and providing of high-cost RALs mainly to low-income clients. Block responded that it "believes the refund lending program is both fair and legal, and will vigorously defend against the complaint". On January 2, 2009, California Attorney General Edmund G. Brown Jr. reached a $4.85 million settlement with H&R Block, which prohibits the company from deceptively marketing high-cost refund anticipation loans as early "tax refunds". Consumers received up to $2.45 million in restitution if they purchased a "refund anticipation loan" or a "refund anticipation check" through H&R Block between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2008. In addition, H&R Block agreed to pay $500,000 in penalties and $1.9 million in fees and costs.[11][12] In 2011, H&R Block ceased offering RALs altogether, a move praised by consumer rights activists.[13]
Express IRA[edit]
On March 16, 2006, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued H&R Block, accusing the company of deceptive marketing of its Express IRA retirement accounts. The lawsuit alleged the company assessed fees, including set-up fees, annual fees, and account closing fees that, for 85% of account holders, resulted in the account losing money.[14] However, in July 2007, a New York state judge dismissed much of the lawsuit.[15] Justice Karla Moskowitz of the State Supreme Court excused Block and five of its units from the lawsuit. She let stand the portion of the complaint concerning another unit, H&R Block Financial Advisers, but dismissed allegations of common law fraud. At the time of the ruling, Block said it believed the remaining assertions lacked merit and that it would appeal. On January 6, 2009, a New York state appeals court overruled trial justice Karla Moskowitz's July 2007 ruling and reinstated the lawsuit against H&R Block Inc that accused the company of fraudulently marketing Express IRA retirement accounts to hundreds of thousands of lower-income clients nationwide.[16] The matter was settled in 2009.
Social Security numbers[edit]
In December 2005, H&R Block sent its customers free copies of its TaxCut software, and the mailing labels on the packages mistakenly included the recipients' Social Security numbers. Block said it sent the promotional mailing to former customers and people whose names were taken from purchased lists. The company said it is legally required to hold on to customers' tax information, including Social Security numbers, for three years. Block said no customer data has been lost or stolen as a result of the mistake, and that less than 3 percent of the mailings were involved.[17]

History[edit]
During World War II, Henry W. Bloch was a young Army Air Forces navigator who wanted to start a family business with his brothers in Kansas City.[1]
Home from the war in 1946, Henry saw a pamphlet suggesting a bright future for companies serving small businesses, and it fired his imagination.[1] That year, Henry and his older brother, Leon, borrowed $5,000 and opened a small bookkeeping business on Main Street in downtown Kansas City.[1] However, four months later, they had few clients and Leon decided to seek a law degree.[1]
Henry wanted to keep trying with the fledgling business and placed a newspaper ad for help-wanted.[1] He got an unexpected response—from his mother—who proposed that Henry hire his younger brother, Richard, for the job.[1] Henry and Richard Bloch jointly ran their United Business Company, which focused on bookkeeping, but also did some income tax work for clients. The brothers found that doing taxes was time consuming and they decided to end that type of service. One of their clients, John White, an ad salesman for The Kansas City Star newspaper, had a different idea; he suggested the Blochs make tax preparation a separate business and developed an ad announcing $5 tax services. The Blochs were not convinced, but they agreed to run the ad in January 1955. The next day, the brothers had an office full of tax clients, and H&R Block was born.
In 1956, the Blochs decided to expand and picked New York City. The move was profitable, but neither brother wanted to move to New York, so they agreed to sell that regional operation to two local accountants. However, since the would-be buyers could not meet the asking price, the parties agreed the Bloch brothers would get $10,000, plus royalties from the tax operation, creating the first H&R Block franchise tax office. The Bloch brothers chose to spell the name "Block" with a K to ensure the name is not mispronounced "blotch."[2] In the following years, H&R Block grew quickly and went public in 1962, then opened its first tax training school in 1965 to meet the demand for skilled tax professionals at its franchise offices.
A TV ad campaign begun in 1972 featured Henry Bloch and became the springboard for H&R Block becoming one of the most widely recognized brand names in the U.S. In 1980 H&R Block purchased the Compuserve online service.
By 1986, Block was handling more than 10 million tax returns each year and had opened offices in Canada and Australia. That year, Block worked with the Internal Revenue Service to introduce electronic filing. Since then, Block has moved further into the digital realm with tax software and online tax preparation.
The company began to expand in the 1990s into the financial services arena, offering mortgage loans, banking, and business services. H&R Block purchased Olde Discount Stockbrokers and operated as a full-service securities broker-dealer under the name H&R Block Financial Advisors. By 2007, the unit was managing $33 billion in assets, offering investment planning, advice and related financial products and services, and employed 900 financial advisors in the U.S. In 2008, H&R Block sold the unit to Ameriprise Financial for US$ 315 million.[3]
RSM McGladrey Business Solutions was created in 1999 when H&R Block acquired the assets and business of McGladrey & Pullen, based in Bloomington, Minnesota. McGladrey had 100 offices in 25 states and offered accounting, consulting, tax services, and international business services to mid-sized companies. Its clients included business in the construction, health care and manufacturing industries. Through an alliance with McGladrey & Pullen and other accountancies, the Block subsidiary operated in 70 countries under the RSM International name. In 2011, H&R Block sold the unit to McGladrey & Pullen.[4]
Business areas[edit]
Retail tax services[edit]




H&R Block Tax Service - Mar 2013


In May 2007, the company said its total U.S. clients served during the 2007 tax season reached a record 19.9 million, up 3.8 percent from the previous year period.[5] H&R Block employs 90,000 tax preparers. The company reported that in 2007, its tax clients obtained US$30 billion in tax refunds, credits and other government benefits. The company said it filed US$10 billion worth of Earned Income Tax Credits for its low-income clients.
Digital tax services[edit]
H&R Block competes for a share of the digital market with its online tax programs and software. Block's other digital offerings include H&R Block Best of Both, where clients enter their information and do their returns online and a Block tax professional reviews, edits, signs and e-files the return.

H&R Block Bank[edit]
The H&R Block Bank was chartered in 2006 and offers low-cost services to its low- to moderate-income customers. Block has said that more than one-third of its clients do not have bank accounts, and must pay high check-cashing fees for their paychecks and tax refund checks. Bank customers can establish FDIC-insured accounts with their tax refund money and then access those funds with pre-paid "Emerald" MasterCards through a nationwide network of ATMs. The accounts also allow direct payroll deposits via ACH and clients can get traditional services, such as lines of credit and individual retirement accounts.
In September 2015, H&R Block sold H&R Block Bank to BofI Holding Inc and reached an agreement for BofI to serve as the bank for H&R Block-branded financial services products including the Emerald MasterCard, Refund Anticipation Checks, and Emerald Advance lines of credit.[6]
Block Advisors[edit]
In January 2016, H&R Block launched Block Advisors, a service that provides year-round consumer tax preparation.[7] The company says they have opened 280 Block Advisor offices.[8]
Controversies[edit]
H&R Block's own taxes[edit]
In August 2005, H&R Block announced that it had overstated its earnings for 2003 and 2004 by $91.1 million. The company stated that it had "insufficient resources" to identify and report complex transactions in its corporate tax accounting. On February 23, 2006, the company said in its quarterly results that it had miscalculated its own state income taxes for 2005 and 2004, and that it owed an additional $32 million in back taxes. That mistake, plus Block's lower-than-expected earnings for the quarter, caused its stock price to drop by 8.5 percent in one day. At April 30, 2008, the company's liability recorded for "uncertain tax positions" totaled $137.6 million (excluding related interest and penalties). According to H&R Block, "This liability represents an estimate of tax positions we have taken in our tax returns that may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities." Estimated gross interest and penalties relating to these potential assessments totaled an additional $47.5 million.[9][10]
Refund anticipation loans[edit]
On Feb. 15, 2006, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer sued H&R Block, alleging the company's refund anticipation loan (RAL) business violated state and federal laws in its marketing and providing of high-cost RALs mainly to low-income clients. Block responded that it "believes the refund lending program is both fair and legal, and will vigorously defend against the complaint". On January 2, 2009, California Attorney General Edmund G. Brown Jr. reached a $4.85 million settlement with H&R Block, which prohibits the company from deceptively marketing high-cost refund anticipation loans as early "tax refunds". Consumers received up to $2.45 million in restitution if they purchased a "refund anticipation loan" or a "refund anticipation check" through H&R Block between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2008. In addition, H&R Block agreed to pay $500,000 in penalties and $1.9 million in fees and costs.[11][12] In 2011, H&R Block ceased offering RALs altogether, a move praised by consumer rights activists.[13]
Express IRA[edit]
On March 16, 2006, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued H&R Block, accusing the company of deceptive marketing of its Express IRA retirement accounts. The lawsuit alleged the company assessed fees, including set-up fees, annual fees, and account closing fees that, for 85% of account holders, resulted in the account losing money.[14] However, in July 2007, a New York state judge dismissed much of the lawsuit.[15] Justice Karla Moskowitz of the State Supreme Court excused Block and five of its units from the lawsuit. She let stand the portion of the complaint concerning another unit, H&R Block Financial Advisers, but dismissed allegations of common law fraud. At the time of the ruling, Block said it believed the remaining assertions lacked merit and that it would appeal. On January 6, 2009, a New York state appeals court overruled trial justice Karla Moskowitz's July 2007 ruling and reinstated the lawsuit against H&R Block Inc that accused the company of fraudulently marketing Express IRA retirement accounts to hundreds of thousands of lower-income clients nationwide.[16] The matter was settled in 2009.
Social Security numbers[edit]
In December 2005, H&R Block sent its customers free copies of its TaxCut software, and the mailing labels on the packages mistakenly included the recipients' Social Security numbers. Block said it sent the promotional mailing to former customers and people whose names were taken from purchased lists. The company said it is legally required to hold on to customers' tax information, including Social Security numbers, for three years. Block said no customer data has been lost or stolen as a result of the mistake, and that less than 3 percent of the mailings were involved.[17]

A Case Study – Strategy at H&R Block, Inc.
Introduction
Company Background
H&R Block opened in Kansas City, MO in 1955 specializing exclusively in income tax preparation. Because the IRS no longer offered free tax
preparation starting in 1956, H&R Block was able to capitalize on this enormous new market, by offering this service in the right place at the right time. H&R Block holds the largest market share in the tax preparation business and filed 14.3 million or 15.3% of all tax returns with the IRS in 2003 (HRB, 2003). H&R Block’s fiscal year ends on April 30th. Much of Block’s revenue is highly seasonal with over 50% of its annual revenue from the period of February – April, known as the tax season. H&R Block operates out of 9,301 tax offices and 98 Financial Centers in the United States, as well as 1,334 tax offices in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom and has a presence in all 50 states. Many of these offices are seasonally open only from January through April, although some offices remain open year round and phone representatives are available year round. Block views its business in five segments consisting of United States Operations, International Tax Operations, Mortgage operations, Investment Services and Business Services. Before H & R Block was born Henry Bloch opened up a bookkeeping business called United Business Company and later his brother Richard joined him. They did bookkeeping for several companies and they had an office of 12 employees, they even did income taxes for some of their clients. Eventually, they were becoming overloaded. So, one day they decided that they weren’t going to do income taxes anymore, but one of their clients, which was an advertiser for the Kansas City newspaper suggested that they should try to make a business out of doing income taxes. So, their client persuaded them to run an ad twice and the IRS had just stopped doing free income tax returns. So, one day their office was full of people who needed to get their taxes done. On January 25, 1955 Henry and Richard Bloch replaced their original firm with a new firm, H & R Block because they wanted a company that strictly specialized in preparing income tax returns. The company went public on February 13, 1962, with a $300,000 offering, 75,000 shares at $4 per share. H& R Block became listed on the New Stock
Exchange in 1969.
Today H&R Block Inc. is a diversified company with subsidiaries that deliver tax services and financial advice, investment and mortgage products and services, and business accounting and consulting services. The world’s largest tax preparation company, H&R Block in fiscal year 2002 served nearly 21 million clients in approximately 10,400 retail offices worldwide and with award-winning TaxCut® software and online services.
Investment services and securities products are offered through H&R Block Financial Advisors Inc., member NYSE, SIPC. H&R Block Mortgage Corp. offers retail mortgage products. Option One Mortgage Corp offers wholesale mortgage products and a range of mortgage services. RSM McGladrey Inc. serves mid-sized businesses with accounting, tax and consulting services.
Mission
To help our clients achieve their financial objectives by serving as their tax and financial partner. (HRB, 2000).
Vision
H&R Block seeks to be the world’s leading provider of financial services through tax and accounting-based advisory relationships. (HRB, 2000).
Management
Mark A. Ernst, 46, is chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of H&R Block, Inc. He was appointed chief executive officer in January 2001, and elected chairman of the board in September 2002 (HRB 2002). Ernst joined H&R Block in 1998 and was first elected to the board of directors in 1999 when he was appointed president.
Since joining the company, Ernst has been responsible for developing and implementing a long-term strategy for the company that strengthens the H&R Block brand and builds on the company’s history of service to clients. Over the past five years, he has managed the company to achieve annual results that rank H&R Block in the top 10 percent of all companies in the S&P 500 for financial performance. During his tenure H&R Block has sharpened its strategic focus on increasing the value that its tax professionals bring to their client relationships; moved forward with its mission to become its clients’ tax and financial partner; strengthened its senior management team by hiring executives with the expertise needed to offer clients a wider range of financial services; and brought more discipline to its planning processes. The company and its subsidiaries offer a full range of tax, financial and mortgage products and services, including personalized financial advice about retirement savings, home ownership, and other opportunities to help clients to build a better financial future. (HRB 2000-2005)
Structure
Block’s Five Business Segments consists of tax services available to the general public in the U.S. This includes the company’s full range of software including TaxCut personal tax preparation software, online tax preparation services through HRBlock.com and tax preparation through one of the company’s tax professionals. The company generates revenue from tax services provided through company owned tax offices and royalties from franchised branches. Also in this segment are H&R Block’s tax preparation classes in which members of the public and perspective employees learn how to complete tax returns. During ‘03 254,000 students enrolled at an average price of $450 for this 80 hour class (HRB 2003). Besides traditional personal tax services, the company also offers software TaxCut ($15-$50) and an online tax preparation program ($35-$100).
International tax operations offers all of the services listed above for U.S. citizens living abroad wishing to file U.S. tax returns in addition to
filing foreign returns for citizens of foreign countries. Pre-tax income for this segment has increased 114% over the last four years.
Investment services: This segment of H&R Block Inc. offers investment advice and related services and securities products through HRBFA (H&R Block Financial Advice) branches to the general public. A nationwide network of registered representatives makes stocks, bonds, mutual funds and similar products and available. In ‘03 Block had 1,600 financial advisors and registered associates in more than 600 offices nationwide (HRB 2003). Average trading volumes fell during fiscal year’ 03 by approximately 21%, as measured by average trades per day. This is one of Block’s sources of non-seasonal revenue and is expected to drive revenues and overall company growth during the coming years (HRB 2003-2004 statements by management in annual reports and investor meetings). Block views its key to future success of the investment services segment as retention and recruitment of financial advisors, which Block pursued in ’03 by hiring 260 experienced advisors. This segment of Block’s business has experienced severely declining revenue which is suggested to have been a result of the unfavorable environment of the equity market during the recent years. However, since acquisition of this business in ‘00 Block has been able to increase clientele in this division by over 14%. H&R Block’s management lists the Investment Services business as one of their priorities for the next six years.
Mortgage operations: Subsidiaries in the Mortgage Operations segment originate service and sell prime and sub-prime mortgage loans and securitize residual interests in the United States. Sub-prim mortgage originations constitute 90% of Block’s business in this segment. Through a network of more than 24,000 mortgage brokers in all 50 states this segment offers a diverse mortgage product line to clients that do not meet traditional
underwriting criteria, according to Reuters. These services are available through Block’s subsidiaries in addition to HRBFA branches. Block approves about 50% of their loan applications which come from over 2,200 independent sales associates throughout the U.S. Block makes money from the gain on the sale of these loans to other lenders. Through securitization the company makes money from the interest spread between its funding costs and its cost of borrowing. During the past 2 years, the declining interest rate environment has been favorable for the company and the company has been able to achieve as high as 4.46% in net profit margin. (HRB, 2004)
Business services: H&R Block’s business services segment provides accounting, tax, consulting, payroll, employee benefits to business clients and tax, estate planning, financial planning, wealth management and insurance services to individuals. These services are made available through a number of sources, the largest of which, RSM McGladrey, Inc, operates more than 100 offices in 22 states. (HRB, 2004).
The addition of these business units under the parent company along with the core H&R Block Tax Services, Inc. created the operational backbone to support a fuller line of financial services. Cross selling is heavily used and customer information, with proper consents, is shared amongst the business units for marketing and contacts. Even though this strategy is well under way, and in some ways is doing well other ways not, the average person on the street does not have any idea Block does more than “taxes”. In addition, some attempts to cross sell have worked to some degree such as mortgage products but others, such as offering IRA products to tax clients, have not. H&R Block’s average client has an income around $38,000 (individual) and do not seem to be interested in savings vehicles to the degree that would be necessary to meet sales goals.
Strategy Defined
In an effort to become “America’s year-round tax and financial partner” Block transformed itself from a company focused exclusively on tax preparation to a company that provides comprehensive financial services. This diversification aimed to offer existing clients a wider range of products and services while compensating for sagging revenue during the off season of the tax preparation business. In researching statements by management in annual reports, investor meeting materials, etc. the author finds the following strategic direction is desired by the company.
Several years the new CEO, Mr. Ernst, at H&R Block said that the new strategy is to take the steps necessary to transition the company from “tax preparer” to “financial partner” (HRB, 2000). Ask anyone you know what does this company does and you will hear “prepare taxes” but financial partner?
H&R Block, Inc. began to implement a strategy to offer clients, and potential clients, additional financial services beyond tax preparation. H&R Block acquired Olde financial (based in Detroit) and used this firm as a launch to create H&R Block Financial Advisors, Inc. In addition, Block acquired Option One mortgage (Based in Irvine, CA) and renamed the firm to H&R Block Mortgage, Inc.
Block’s management feels that the tax preparation market is so unsaturated that it is foreseeable to open 50% more stores in order to provide its customers sufficient convenient locations. H&R Block studies indicate that for some of their clients, convenience of location is valued higher than brand name and that the only way to capture such fringe customers is open stores throughout market areas. These plans are currently under formulation and implementation.
Although there was a 6% increase in the number of tax return offices, tax clients served declined 3% during ’03, which lead Block to file 600,000
fewer returns than in ‘02. This was offset by a jump in software sales of 600,000 for the same period. Block achieved increased profitability during the ’04 tax season as a result of higher tax preparation fees. Average tax preparation fees have increased about $10 per year over the last four years to $130.59 suggesting that demand is slightly price elastic. According to Mr. Ernst because of this elasticity Block can continue to raise its prices to generate revenue growth.
The company is competing on quality, not on cost and on ‘location’ whether it be a physical location or via online using the web. In addition, the company has announced the opening of 400-500 new offices for tax season 2005 in under served markets. With the trending to online and software, causing a decrease in office clients, this may be a mistake.
One of the Organization’s Corporate Priorities is to integrate and align Tax, eSolutions, Financial Advisors and Retail Mortgage, incorporating advice as a key differentiator. In that respect, the Company’s Vision states: “To be the world’s leading provider of financial services through tax-and accounting- based advisory relationships.” It appears that the vision statement does not fully reflect the company’s long-term goals since it only mentions two specific products, -tax and accounting- under the umbrella of financial services. By stating only two products, the vision statement implied that tax and accounting are the company’s core strategic goals, with the other products revolving around them. If that were the case, then all the integration and arrangement measures through structural changes done in order to accelerate the alignment process would be much ado about nothing, that is, if the company’s true intention is what can be deduced from the Vision statement.
Strategy Analyses
Some of the measurements of an effective strategy as outlined by Thompson,
Strickland & Gamble (2005) includes consideration of and alignment with the adopted competitive moves and business approaches, a focus on competitive advantage, resource strengths and overall competitive capabilities. By acquiring complimentary businesses, financial services and mortgage, the company has been able to, to a certain degree, begin offering the millions of customers who come to Block for tax preparation other financial services. During the last few years mortgage has done well, tax held steady with barely an increase, and financial services has lost money. Online services and software have shown good increases in clients yet profitability is very low at this time. Consumer awareness and trust as well as infrastructure and technology needs require more work than originally realized. In addition, the internal problems of an old cash cow business unit, Tax Services, being asked to suddenly share clients with, and work with, business units with differing cultures and operating speeds is a much larger issue perhaps than management anticipated.
The strategy of providing additional financial products to current tax customers as well as running these complimentary business units as unique operations does have a good fit, H&R Block does have competitive advantage in the service areas mentioned but more so with Tax and Mortgage than with financial services. It may be learned and the results the last few years bears this out, that the client base of Tax and Mortgage are not the most ideal financial services fit. Tax and Mortgage deal primarily with mid to low income groups and high profitability in financial services comes from the mid to high income groups.
Value Chain
The value chain categorizes the generic value adding activities of an organization. The “primary activities” include: inbound logistics,
production, outbound logistics, sales and marketing, maintenance. The “support activities” include: administrative infrastructure management, human resources management, R&D, and procurement. The costs and value drivers are identified for each value activity. The value chain framework quickly made its way to the forefront of management thought as a powerful analysis tool for strategic planning. Its ultimate goal is to maximize value creation while minimizing costs (Porter, 1985).
The value chain maps a firm into its strategically relevant activities in order to understand the behavior of costs and the existing and potential sources of differentiation. Differentiation results from the way a firm’s product, associated services, and other activities affect its buyer’s activities. All the activities in the value chain contribute to buyer value, and the cumulative costs in the chain will determine the difference between the buyer value and producer cost.
A firm gains competitive advantage by performing these strategically important activities cheaper or better than its competitors. One of the reasons the value chain framework is helpful is because it emphasizes that competitive advantage can come not just from great products or services, but from anywhere along the value chain. In strategic management it is critical to understand both the competitive advantage of an organization as well as understand the value chain.
Five Forces Model
The five forces model developed by Porter (1985) guides the analysis of organization’s environment and the attractiveness of the industry. The five forces include the risk of new competitors entering the industry, threat of potential substitutes, the bargaining power of buyers, the bargaining power of suppliers, and degree of rivalry between the existing competitors
(Porter). A starting point to analyzing the industry is to look at competitive rivalry. If entry to an industry is easy then competitive rivalry will likely to be high. If it is easy for customers to move to substitute products for example from coke to water then again rivalry will be high. Generally competitive rivalry will be high if: • There is little differentiation between the products sold between customers. In this case Block has the advantage of a long solid history with the perception being that they know what they are doing and can be trusted. In addition, electronic filing is a long time product of Block that has also gained a lot of trust with customers. Of the two competitors, Jackson Hewitt and Liberty, Block is the only one with a guarantee that pays additional costs of any errors in work done. • Competitors are approximately the same size of each other. The two competitors are very small compared to Block. No other tax preparation firm comes close to reaching the size and market share of Block.
• If the competitors all have similar strategies. They do have very similar strategies in the tax services arena; however, this will be an area to review in regards to financial services and mortgage.
Suppliers are also essential for the success of an organization, however Block is a service business and suppliers are abundant for office supplies, computer equipment, etc. Block develops its own tax software. All mission critical needs are handled by Block so the threat of suppliers is almost non existent. Although, the IRS in a sense is a supplier of the electronic filing product infrastructure and does heavily influence what sort of electronic filing products are offered.
Buyers or customers can exert influence and control over an industry in certain circumstances. This happens when there is little differentiation over the product and substitutes can be found easily. For many low income customers there is no loyalty and they will move to other providers if the fees are lower or they can get their refunds quicker.
Regarding threat of substitutes the question is: Are there alternative products that customers can purchase over Block’s product that offer the same benefit for the same or less price? This is high in the case of H&R Block due to the availability of cheap and easy tax preparation programs, the increased use of the internet by a growing number of internet users, and technology is creating new forms of service delivery such as online services and software capabilities and price.
Competitive Analysis – External
Industry Analyses Tax Preparation Industry: The IRS projected that for ‘05 they would receive 226.9 million tax returns, a number which they project to continue growing at a rate of 1.6% per year until 2010 when the total number is expected to be 247.9 million. In the U.S., tax payers may file their returns either through pipeline filing methods (sending paper forms through the U.S.P.S.) or by e-filing (IRS 2004-2005). The IRS has strongly encouraged e-filing in recent years which is now becoming increasingly popular and consists of both TeleFiling and online filing. Online filing can be completed either through a broker or from any personal computer. The IRS projects that during ‘04, 58.9 million returns will be e-filed which would constitute 26% of all expected returns. Subsequently, the IRS projects this number to grow 8% per year until 2010 when the number of e-filers is expected to be 93.5 million, or 37.7% of the expected returns during the 2010 tax season. (IRS 20042005). During recent years the IRS has promoted this method by touting higher accuracy, lower costs, less time consuming processing procedures, and refund turn around three to five weeks sooner than pipeline filing. Online filing is expected to increase by 21% from ‘03 to ‘04 and is expected to jump another 18% for the ‘05 tax season. According to HRB, the percentage of individual tax returns completed by paid preparers has risen from 48% in 1990 to 56.8% in 2002.
Tax Preparation Competition
The most recent U.S. economic census conducted in 1997 suggested that the tax preparation industry is very fragmented. While H&R Block holds 15.3% of this market its largest competitors, Intuit and Microsoft, hold significantly smaller portions. Although both of these companies directly compete with a portion of Block’s business, neither has the same business model or identical products. Intuit Inc. is a provider of business and financial management solutions for businesses and consumers and accounting professionals. This company not only produces products such as TurboTax and the Quicken line of software, they also provide the general public professional tax help in person. Intuit has offices in 13 states while Block has offices in all 50 and both companies have a presence in the U.K. and Canada. Microsoft also plays a part in the tax preparation industry with Microsoft®
Excel Version 2002 Inside Out software. Growth of two fairly new competitors, Jackson Hewitt and Liberty Tax, which are using similar business model of combination of retail locations and online services. While currently these organizations are no where near the size of Block they are growing significantly each year.
The availability of cheap and easy tax preparation programs is also an external factor which is driven by the customer need to conduct business when and where it is convenient for them. The increased use of the internet for tax preparation by a growing number of internet users is also an external factor. Technology is creating new forms of service delivery as mentioned previously regarding online services and software capabilities and price.
In addition, the Internal Revenue Service factors as both a resource and competitor in a sense. In the chapter entitled “Conceptions of Environments” (133) Scott notes that the most common conception of environment of organizations is that of a task environment. He defines this concept as all aspects of the environment that are “potentially relevant to goal setting and goal attainment” and goes on to note that it is typically narrowed to refer to the nature and sources of inputs, competitors, and markets for output. This based on the belief that most organizations are created to achieve goals, to perform some type of work.
Scott goes on later in the book and talks about managing task environments and notes (197) that there are many research resources and theories regarding the various aspects of managing the task environment, i.e., the sources of inputs, markets for outputs, competitors, and regulators.
At H&R Block there is a great deal of material that could covered under this subject but one in particular stands out and that is the need at Block for
the customers it serves in tax operations to continue to need that service. I am speaking of the Internal Revenue Service as both a resource and a competitor for Block. Block’s tax service is regulated in that all paid tax preparers must conform to tax professional rules and regulations that are part of the tax code and compliance enforcement in the responsibility of the IRS. So in one way, the IRS is a compliance officer to Block and Block must ensure that all tax professionals and company representatives comply with these rules at all times. They include sharing of information, application of tax law and theory, etc.
In addition, the IRS has been a partner to Block and these two organizations worked together, almost a joint venture in behavior, to develop electronic filing in the late 80’s. This has been a boon to both organizations. At IRS processing centers labor needs have decreased as more filer’s use electronic filing rather than mailing in paper returns. They have experienced other benefits as well, less errors, etc. At Block this new product produced a new revenue stream that now makes up approximately 30% of revenues in the tax services business unit.
Block and the IRS also work together on special projects and have a sort of standing arrangement where if the IRS wants an idea tested or hammered out they go to Block, the largest preparer with 16 million customers. Five years ago IRS was concerned over the pending proposals for changes to the earned income credit. IRS asked Block to analyze what they might mean to lower income tax papers. With 16 million customer records that could be analyzed for impact it is much more than a random sampling. The IRS used this information to make internal recommendations to the program. In many ways, over the years Block has managed to use the IRS to actually help grow the company and the IRS has benefited from this enormously. This is true case of no organization generates all the resources necessary for its goal attainment or survival (197).
Software Comparison:
TaxCut versus Turbo Tax During ’03 48 million filers used Intuit’s Turbo Tax while only 20 million used Block’s TaxCut. (HRB, 2004 & Intuit, 2004). Block’s software offerings average $10.00 less expensive for comparable software with similar features which is illustrated by TaxCut and Turbo Tax’s price ranges $15.00-$50.00 and $20.00-$70.00, respectively. Both products tout extremely user friendly features, such as aggressive deduction finder, error double check, and import of previous year’s repeatable information to promote continued use. Complaints regarding Turbo Tax are that the software is generally designed for one user to do one return and that it difficult to jump to one part of the return process without completing the entire procedure. Regarding TaxCut’s short comings, consumers have suggested that it is easier to file more complicated itemized returns with Turbo Tax than TaxCut, although this may be outweighed by the smaller price. Both products are designed to file only the federal tax return for the fiscal year the product is purchased, and both also offer a rebate program to get the state version at no cost after rebate. Because tax legislation varies by year, a new version of either product is available each year, which sustains demand for this market.
It is unclear if on of these products will clearly dominate the market in the near future because their extremely similar characteristics, pricing and availability. What is clear is that the market for ax preparation software is growing and that as long as both products remain innovative and react to
consumers demands they will continue to attract new customers. Block’s brand name is one small advantage regarding TaxCut’s prospects in the future although that is only enough to pique interest in the product, while the features and ease of use will keep customers retuning year after year.
Mortgage Industry
The specific activity mortgage bankers engage in is the purchase, packaging, and sale of loans to third parties. This segment of Block’s business is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate cuts have driven mortgage rates to a 45 year record low, which, in turn spurred a sharp increase in home mortgage refinances. The industry has directly benefited from significantly higher volume of loan transactions in recent years driving a $2.5 trillion increase, in mortgages originated between ‘00 and ‘03. Because the majority of those interested in refinancing their mortgages have had sufficient opportunity to do so, business in this sector will be driven by new mortgage originations rather than additional refinances.
The market for sub-prime mortgage will not slow down as much the prime market over a period of rising interest rates due to the cash-out refinance nature of the business. During ‘02 sub-prime originations constituted 8.3% of all loans and during ‘03 they constituted 8.4%. If interest rates rise in ‘05 as Greenspan has indicated then sub-prime originations should rise to their normal volume of 15% of all loans, nearly double what they are now. Over the new few years, the sub-prime industry expects growth of at least 5% a year. Regardless that low interest rates may have caused a spike of mortgage refinances in recent years, Block has experienced steadily increasing rate of mortgage originations the same time period.
Although mortgage refinancing may not continue to be as considerable revenue source in the future, HRB management suggested in a Goldman Sachs conference call that non-refinance mortgage origination rates are increasing steadily which should at least partially compensate.
Financial Advice Industry
H&R Block Financial Advisors (HRBFA) competes directly with a broad range of companies seeking to attract consumer financial assets, including full-service brokerage firms, discount and online brokerage firms, mutual fund companies, investment banking firms, commercial and savings banks, insurance companies and others. In ‘99, there was $6 trillion invested in mutual funds which is the largest single portion of this industry. 93% of this $6 trillion was controlled by six firms at that time. These were Vanguard (35%), Janus Capital Corp (20%), Fidelity (17%), PIMCO, Alliance, and MFS with 7% each (NYSE Market Report Searches, 2005). Clearly, Block is a small player in this enormous industry.
In the secondary business units, financial services and mortgage, there are huge number of competitors currently offering services. Both businesses who core business are in these areas with high skills and those businesses that branched into these areas whether or not related to their core business. For example, retailers running credit operations. In the regulatory arena Block business units are heavily regulated. Tax Services by Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department rules, financial services by SEC and broker regulations, and mortgage by lending laws. The most out of control areas are mortgage due to interest rate drivers and tax due to tax law changes. Foreign Markets
Of the five segments at Block only one, Tax Services, actually operates in foreign markets. Mortgage, Financial Services, and Business Services operate solely in the United States. Until Recently H&R Block placed a moderate amount of emphasis on foreign markets but the particular services Block offers, and especially the non-tax segments, are not viable in most countries.
As disclosed in the companies 2005 Annual Report the International Tax Operations segment has been aggregated with U.S. Tax Operations in the Tax Services segment and prior year results have been reclassified to reflect this change. In the 2005 Annual Report Block stated that international operations contributed $110.0 million, $97.6 million and $85.1 million in revenues for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and $11.3 million, $11.1 million and $10.5 million of pretax income, respectively. This represents only 5.2% of revenue in 2005 but is up a bit from the 3.8% contribution in 2001. Australia is flat over this time period and the growth came from tax law changes in Canada.
Considering the markets it makes sense that Block would not allocate a great deal of resources to foreign markets but instead operate primarily domestically. The company’s tax segment provides services to assist taxpayers with required self filings. Few countries have such systems requiring tax payers to self file. In Canada the tax reporting system is similar to the United States in that taxpayers file returns on an annual basis. This is also true in Australia. The United Kingdom is different in that few taxpayers are required to submit any filings.
In the financial services area there is impact from foreign markets. The financial services industry has become considerably more concentrated as many firms have been acquired by or merged with other firms in recent years. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than HRBFA and offer additional financial products and services. Competition from domestic and international commercial banks and larger securities firms is expected to continue to increase as a result of legislative and regulatory initiatives in the U.S. Firms in this industry are impacted by market performance, volatility, investor sentiment, margin balances, government regulation, and many other factors which cannot be controlled.

Mortgage industry – scale advantages dominate successful business models
Business Ethics
According to Thompson business ethics refers to the application of general ethical principles and standards to business behavior. They go on to say
that business actions are judged by the general ethical standards of society, not by a special set of more permissive standards. Examples of ethical behaviors are honesty, integrity, keeping one’s word, respecting rights of others, and practicing the Golden Rule. H&R Block has a core set of values that the company attempts, through training and orientation, to instill in each employee. H&R Block’s values are client focused. Integrity: We are honest and ethical in everything we do, Excellence: We take pride in doing our best in everything we do. We embrace change to learn and grow, Respect: We treat each other with respect and dignity, recognizing that innovation springs from unique perspectives, and Teamwork: Everyone’s collaboration and full participation make us stronger and allow us to serve clients better (HRB web site).
In my experience at Block, these values, which include being honest and ethical in all actions are adhered to by the majority of employees and leaders. Block has a culture of honesty and integrity which was fostered by Henry Block, the founder, and I would say this is a very ethical company.
Social Responsibility
Thompson outlines the notion of social responsibility as it applies to businesses concerns a company’s duty to operate by means that avoid harm to stakeholders and the environment and, further, to consider the overall betterment of society in its decisions and actions.
At H&R Block one the products sold is known as a Rapid Refund. This is a loan against a refund. The demographics of Block clients are typically middle or lower income tax payers and many qualify for a refundable tax credit known as the Earned Income Tax Credit. This is credit given to low income tax payers and was intended to help those falling into this income range to move higher up in the income levels to assist with supporting their family. Block’s Rapid Refund product is a high cost loan and the interest rate is
very high considering the length of the loan, typically a few weeks. The National Consumer Law Center is a non-profit organization specializing in consumer issues on behalf of low-income people. NCLC works with thousands of legal services, government and private attorneys, as well as community groups and organizations, who represent low-income and elderly individuals on consumer issues. According to the NCLC Refund anticipation loans (RALs) are usurious short-term loans secured by the taxpayer’s expected tax refund. Over half of RAL consumers are recipients of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), despite the fact that EITC recipients only constitute 15% of all taxpayers. They also state, from valid research, that low income Taxpayers Lost over $1 Billion in Loan Charges and Fees in 2002 Their research also indicates that check cashing fees add to the cost of getting tax refunds or RALs, especially for those consumers who do not have bank accounts. While many un-banked consumers find ways to get their checks cashed for free, commercial check cashers count on tax season to boost their revenues. One study found that 45 percent of EITC recipients planned to use a check casher to cash refund checks, further draining this program.50 Check cashers are also moving into the tax-filing and RAL market for their clientele.
Since IRS rules prohibit commercial tax preparers from charging their clients to cash tax refund or RAL checks, 51 some tax preparers have formed partnerships with check cashers. H&R Block has teamed up with ACE Cash Express, one of the nation’s largest check cashing chains. This partnership has been proven very profitable for ACE, which has seen growth in its income during tax season. Part of the H&R Block/ACE partnership involves placement of self-service check cashing machines in lobbies of H&R Block tax preparers. ACE reported that 3.2% of its check cashing fees in fiscal year 2002 came from self-service machines located in ACE stores or in H&R Block offices. ACE placed 100 machines at Block locations during 2002 and has an agreement with Block to place up to 250 machines during the 2003 tax-filing season. As of the end of June, ACE had 22 machines in company-owned locations and 150 machines available for deployment at H&R Block locations for 2003. ACE, expecting a booming business in cashing Block checks this year, announced cash inventory of $290 million during the 2003 tax season for 248 self-service machines placed in H&R Block offices. ACE also has a $55 million credit line from banks, for a total cash inventory of $345 million available to cash tax refund and refund anticipation loan checks during the 2003 taxfiling season. In addition to NCLC, several other consumer groups have charged this is a rip off and that Block is stealing some of this earned income credit from needy families and is perceived as being very unethical. Block counters that these clients in fact want this service and Block is doing nothing more than meeting the needs of its clients. This issue draws attention every year and creates quite a bit of bad press. Currently the National Consumer Law Center Consumer Federation of America is working to Ban refund anticipation loans outright or make them subject to state usury and small loan interest rate laws.
Diversification Strategies
Thompson points out that diversification becomes an attractive strategy when a company runs out of profitable growth opportunities in its original business. H&R Block since it’s inception in the 1955 was focused on one area, tax preparation. In the 1980’s they did begin to think about diversification when talk began about a flat tax. They purchased a company called CompuServe based in Columbus, OH. At the time it was doing well in the new area of online subscription services. It did not, however, fit all the tests for a good acquisition for Block and the management team at corporate lost some key people at CompuServe and had no skills at all in running such a business. In essence for several years it sort of just stayed flat in growth and innovation and AOL took off and left CompuServe in the dust. CompuServe was finally sold in the mid 1990’s and the buyer stripped off the technical infrastructure for their own use. The other services were discontinued.
This was Blocks first try at diversification so it was a long while before they tried again. In the late 1990’s a new CEO was hired, who is still managing the firm through a brand and strategic shift, and he immediately laid plans to diversify but only with complimentary businesses with a good fit to the core competencies of Block. Block certainly fits with the opening remark from Thompson in this discussion. Tax is mature and has growth potential that is limited each year.
Mergers and Acquisitions
Thompson (2005) identifies several strategy choices in chapter 6 of Crafting and executing strategy: The quest for competitive advantage and one of those is the merger and acquisition strategy. The authors state that a “merger is a pooling of two or more companies as equals, with the newly created company often taking on a new name. An acquisition is a combination in which one company purchases and absorbs the operations of another.”
According to Thompson the objective of mergers and acquisitions are to achieve one or more of the following organizational business goals; paving the way for acquiring firm to gain more market share and create a more efficient operation, expanding a firm’s geographic coverage, extending a firm’s business into new product categories or international markets, gaining quick access to new technologies, and/or to invent a new industry and lead the convergence of industries whose boundaries are blurred by changing technologies and new market opportunities.
Thompson goes on to indicate that combining operations may result in some negative consequences such as resistance from rank-and-file employees, hard-to-resolve conflicts in management styles and corporate culture, and
tough problems of integration. In addition, the author’s state that greater-than-anticipated difficulties may occur in; achieving expected cost-savings, sharing of expertise, and achieving enhanced competitive capabilities.
Regardless of possible negative effects the merger-acquisition is a much used strategic option and is a common occurrence in business today. H&R Block does have a good example of this strategic method.
In 1996 Block acquired Option One mortgage (Based in Irvine, CA) after running the business as a separate company retaining the name and structure in 2000 this firm was renamed H&R Block Mortgage, Inc. In addition, in 2000, H&R Block acquired Olde Financial, a securities firm (based in Detroit) and used this firm as a launch to create H&R Block Financial Advisors, Inc.
The addition of these two business units under the parent company, along with the core H&R Block Tax Services, Inc., created the operational backbone to support a fuller line of financial services. Cross selling is heavily used and customer information, with proper consents, is shared amongst the business units for marketing and contacts. In many other ways, outlined in my final project, the company has used these acquired firms to provide the operational structure required to gain entry into new areas relatively quickly.
Moving into financial services and mortgage has been a big plus for the company. Mortgage has been especially lucrative financially and while financial services are not as strong it is growing steadily as skills and talent is added. They do fit very well and there is cross marketing and up selling in and across the business units. It is taking longer to really integrate and turn these strategies into operational ways of doing business but they are achieving the plan.
Shareholder Value
According to Thompson there are three tests that if passed indicates the diversification move can produce added value for share holders. They also state that “managing a set of unrelated businesses is a much weaker foundation for enhancing shareholder value than is a strategy of related diversification where corporate performance can be boosted by competitively valuable cross-business strategic fits.” The industry attractiveness test measures whether the industry chosen measures favorably in competitive conditions and a market environment that is as good as or better than the current businesses. It seems that Block meets this test with their diversification strategy. By entering into the financial services and mortgage businesses they are able to cross market and sell to, for most products, existing customers of the core business. The mortgage business has done extremely well in profitability.
The cost-of-entry test measures whether the business in consideration has a cost of creating or buying that will limit profitability. In the case of Block the mortgage business has shown incredible returns on the original investment. The financial services firm purchased were slow to contribute profit but are doing so now. The better-off test measures whether, well as it says, the company is better off overall with this business. Financially if there is no increase in profits and shareholder value with the business than without it than it would not meet the test. Block is definitely better off with these businesses than without as shown in the contribution rates of the businesses to the overall corporate profit. In addition, these businesses provide value added services to the 18 million tax clients out there in the form of these added financial and mortgage services.
Block, in my opinion as a former long time executive and based upon operating results, has done well in these businesses and seem to have made good choices by using a diversification strategy of related businesses that provide added value to shareholders and customers of the cash cows tax services division.
Unfortunately, these units have not all achieved the profitability levels desired and financial services in particular has sustained some heavy losses during the first few years of implementing this strategic plan.
Strategy Analysis
Strategy – integration of services across business units. Completing its transformation from tax provider to financial services provider, H&R Block is well aware that it is entering into some stiff competition— from brick-andmortar to click-and-mortar and strictly online ventures One of the areas that could be improved that would allow for better support of the company cross selling and servicing strategy is to create greater cross operational responsibilities for local and regional managers. This company does retain a good deal of silo mentality at this level and managers should have more cross operational responsibilities. For example, those customers using online tax preparation or purchasing TaxCut software could have included year round in person service if needed at the local physical Block office. Both managers should be viewed as responsible for this customer and compensation considering accordingly. This same scenario could work in reverse with physical office customers seeking assistance via the web. Infrastructure is in place to accomplish this and only strategic planning and execution of processes changes is needed. As Thompson states “organizational capabilities emerge from a process of consciously knitting together the efforts of different work groups, departments, and external allies, not from how the boxes on the organization chart are arranged”. In the past few years technology and functional areas have been reorganized and processes reengineered to support this type of operational shift, however, the people have not been paid as much attention to. Currently, if a local Block manager has a client come in that had done their taxes with the software about all the help they can offer is an 800 number to call for support on the product but not with any tax issues. There is no incentive to assist this client any more than that. Customer needs and the market drivers should be primary considerations regardless of what branch of the company the client approaches for assistance.
H&R Block already has strong brand equity as a tax preparation company, but to successfully take advantage of financial industry deregulation, the company needed to leverage the relationships with its traditional tax customers. Much of this effort falls on its tax preparers. As the first point of contact for customers, they’re charged with gauging the interest level and potential value a tax customer would receive from other financial services, including mortgage products and investment plans. Once customers express interest, the company needed an efficient way to pass information to the appropriate financial advisors and ensure every inquiry was addressed. That was the hard part, with 1,600 advisors spread across 190 financial centers nationwide. Because of changes in policies, processes, structure, and technology solutions, when a tax customer requests more information on other H&R Block services, information on that customer’s background and interest area is automatically routed to the most qualified financial advisor for an immediate, tailored response. According to a CRM study (HRB, 2003) within the organization conducted by a software firm the company could enable its financial advisors to provide personalized sales and service, they found that H&R Block is giving its customers reason to be loyal and creating a return on relationship over the customer lifecycle.
While piloting its financial service center concept, H&R Block initially used a contact management and lead distribution application, but it ultimately lacked the robustness needed. That’s when the financial services group began seeking a new sales force automation solution. Meanwhile, the company had chosen a technology solution as its scalable, web-ready CRM solution to track and route customer inquiries— whether they come in by phone, email, the web or in person—in the company’s newly consolidated customer contact center. Its individual call centers had been using disparate call center tracking software, which meant that the company wasn’t getting a single view of each of its customers—or their profitability levels. The new customer contact center serves the tech support needs of the company’s 10,000 offices as well as its client relations, financial and e-commerce groups.
Future Plans
Thompson has several key points regarding organizational capabilities; companies don’t implement and execute strategies; people do; all managers have strategy-executing responsibility in their areas of authority, and all employees participate in the strategy execution process; and, when strategies fail, it is often because of poor execution— things that were supposed to get done slip through the cracks. A talented management team is essential talent implies that an appropriate mix of skills and experiences exists within the team. Intellectual capital is more important to strategy execution than other investments. Also decentralizing decision making which takes full advantage of the talent is important to good strategy execution. H&R Block has been reorganizing and changing the management team over the last five years. As they have added businesses through acquisition and development of new products (online and software, for example) they have added key management personnel in those areas with backgrounds and skills in the appropriate fields. While this company does not attract “stars” it has a very capable management team and the only criticism is that unfortunately many of those newly added have left after two or so years. A great deal of turnover has occurred in seeking just the right individuals. In some cases, they were not working out and in others they sought greener pastures. The management ranks in the middle levels of the company are, however, stable and exhibits a great deal of talent within their respective operational group. This company does retain a good deal of silo mentality at this level and managers should have more cross operational responsibilities. For example, those customers using online tax preparation or purchasing TaxCut software could have included year round in person service if needed at the local physical Block office. Both managers should be viewed as responsible for this customer and compensation considering accordingly. This same scenario could work in reverse with physical office customers seeking assistance via the web. Infrastructure is in place to accomplish this and only strategic planning and execution of processes changes is needed. As Thompson states “organizational capabilities emerge from a process of consciously knitting together the efforts of different work groups, departments, and external allies, not from how the boxes on the organization chart are arranged”.
Thompson also states that “the ultimate goal of decentralized decision making is not to push decisions down to lower levels but to put decision-making authority in the hands of those persons or teams closest to and most knowledgeable about the situation”. Block is a leader in this area. Local and regional managers are responsible for most decision making regarding hiring, schedule of activities (training, tax schools, etc.), location selection, local marketing, bookkeeping, public relations, etc. When I was a district manager the total experience was of running my own business with the absence of financial liability. There are, however, policies and procedures for many areas that must be adhered to in all locations but deviations are allowed with proper approvals and usually this is just one level up rather going to the CEO.
Another area is evaluation of strategy implementation. For several years the company has been designing and setting up processes to support a balanced scorecard method. (Kaplan, 1996). The balanced scorecard is a management system (not only a measurement system) that enables organizations to clarify their vision and strategy and translate them into action. It provides feedback around both the internal business processes and external outcomes in order to continuously improve strategic performance and results. When fully deployed, the balanced scorecard transforms strategic planning from an academic exercise into the nerve center of an enterprise. Kaplan and Norton describe the innovation of the balanced scorecard as follows: “The balanced scorecard retains traditional financial measures. But financial measures tell the story of past events, an adequate story for industrial age companies for which investments in long-term capabilities and customer relationships were not critical for success. These financial measures are inadequate, however, for guiding and evaluating the journey that information age companies must make to create future value through investment in customers, suppliers, employees, processes, technology, and innovation.”
The balanced scorecard suggests that we view the organization from four perspectives, and to develop metrics, collect data and analyze it relative to each of these perspectives: 1) The Learning and Growth Perspective, 2) The Business Process Perspective, 3) The Customer Perspective, and 4) The Financial Perspective. At H&R Block key performance indicators have been identified and databases put into place to provide executives with data at
all levels of the company in the four performance dimensions measured by the scorecard. Executives indicate in personal conversations with the author that the initiative is going well and the tool is providing much needed information to assist with decision making and measurement of results. Summary and closing
In a Forbes article printed in early 2004 author Emily Lambert stated “April 15, looms, but H & R Block Chief Executive Mark A. Ernst has more than taxes on his mind. He’s eager to find out how many of this season’s customers can gradually be convinced to buy H & R Block’s newer offerings, including home mortgages, business consulting and brokerage services. Last fiscal year the company’s non-tax businesses accounted for half of its $3.8 billion in revenue, most of that from its mortgage lending, which it started offering in 1997. Its financial services business hemorrhaged $128 million (pretax) last year, and the business services arm is also lagging. The loans, which can carry interest rates of 129%, appeal to cash-strapped low-income customers. Some customers may be wary, too. The company is under fire for its “refund anticipation loans.” The loans, which can carry interest rates of 129%, appeal to cash-strapped low-income customers. The fees accounted for $109 million in revenue last year. H&R Block has settled a number of loan-related laws.”
This is a powerful representation of the state of company as of that time which is result of close inspection during a time of transition. What she does not mention is how this compares to the first couple of years of the strategy implementation of broadening services. As of today, the picture is brighter and the company, while still a long way from being there, is closer to achieving some of the goals. This paper outlined the company, the strategy employed, the rationale for various components of the strategy, and how these areas fit within the strategic models studied in this course. One area that the author feels may be needed that is not current present in any of them.

Under his management, the eBay division traded $25 billion in goods and services, and reached a record $2.6 billion in revenue.

He started with eBay in 2000 as the head of eBay’s Global Marketing, where he developed the company’s first brand campaign and the largest Internet marketing function on the Web.

We've served more than 1.4 million people all across America in need of relief from IRS back taxes. Below are comments from taxpayers who have been successful at putting stress and worry over IRS back taxes behind them.





...from the first phone call I felt so relieved. Their confidence of relieving from this IRS burden rubbed off on me. I was still scared and spent many sleepness nights worrying but contacting them was the best thing I could have done. I feel like a 100 pounds is off my shoulders so I want to thank Tax Defense. They even told me that I can always call them years from now if I have any questions or need advise and that is another reason why I would advise people to put their trust in them as I did... — Sherri
When you receive a letter in the mail that has IRS on it - you tend to lose a lot of sleep and sometimes don't even open the envelope! I've had that experience and after making contact with TDN, I have to tell you, I slept better. They certainly know how to work through the issues and tame the 900 pound gorilla! — Steve B.
I have to tell you that I was so nervous going through this process however [my tax specialist] walked me though the steps and explained everything in detail. She was able to have a tax levy on my wages released the same day we talked. Trust them they are the real thing. I can't thank you enough [my tax specialist]. — Joel P.








How It Works


Individuals or businesses in need of IRS relief from back taxes call or submit a request online to receive a free consultation from tax resolution experts.

Tax relief specialists take the time to listen, understand your current situation and goals (including any immediate relief you may need to stop or prevent a wage garnishment, tax lien, or bank levy.)

Based on your unique circumstances, tax resolution experts apply existing tax relief code to provide your best options to get immediate relief and reach the lowest possible settlement with the IRS.

You may choose to resolve IRS back taxes on your own, or utilize the expertise of tax specialists who will negotiate the best possible IRS resolution or settlement on your behalf. There are no upfront retainer fees and any fees that apply must be pre-approved by taxpayers in advance, based on the scope of services provided.

View Common Questions About Tax Relief


Q: Why would the IRS agree to settle back taxes for less?
A: There are a variety of reasons why the IRS agrees to work with taxpayers and settle for less. Often individuals or families are experiencing financial hardship, whether through loss of a job or income, illness, extenuating business or marital circumstances, or a number of other reasons. In addition, there may be "doubt as to collectability", "doubt as to liability", "innocent spouse" or a variety of other tax relief options or tax appeal provisions under the current tax code. In addition, the IRS may lower your tax liability because they feel you simply don't have the financial ability to pay the full amount owed within the statutory time period.
Q: How Can the IRS Fresh Start Initiative Provide Relief for Taxpayers?
A. The IRS Fresh Start program is an effort on the part of the IRS to make it easier for financially distressed taxpayers to resolve back taxes as quickly as possible.  Through a free tax relief consultation, taxpayers can find out if the leniency offered via Fresh Start can provide relief for IRS penalties, IRS liens, and also offer more streamlined processes for Installment Agreement and Offers in Compromise.
Q: What should you do if you've received a collection letter/notice from IRS?
A: Do not ignore IRS letters or enforcement notices. They may be auto-generated but, if ignored, they will lead to a wage garnishment, tax lien, bank account levy or other asset seizure or enforcement action. Stay in contact with the IRS and consider the advantages of a free tax relief consultation - speaking to tax relief specialists who can apprise you fully of your tax relief rights and options under the law and, at your request, negotiate directly with the IRS, to bring your case to a favorable resolution.
Q. How does a free tax relief consultation work?
A. As an individual or business, when you contact the IRS directly, you will likely be communicating with a frontline IRS collector whose task it is to collect on the total amount of tax liability assessed. Through a free tax relief consultation, you will have the opportunity to get a free and fair assessment from a tax relief specialist who can review with you all the circumstances surrounding the amount you owe the IRS, or the IRS claims you owe.  In addition, the tax resolution specialist can also take the time to listen to you, understand what you are going through, and review the options available to reach the best possible settlement with the IRS.
Q. What are some of the most common reasons why taxpayers may qualify for relief?
Many people owe the IRS back taxes for a variety of reasons, in many cases due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control - including personal or financial hardship, business hardship, medical issues and more. In addition, taxpayers may not have been able to file back taxes for one or more years, or feel they have been unfairly assessed.  There also may be taxpayers who fall into the "currently not collectable" status because they simply cannot afford to pay the tax assessed. In many cases, taxpayers may qualify for relief via the IRS Fresh Start initiative.
Q: If I've fallen behind on my taxes and have the ability to pay the original amount but cannot afford to pay all the penalties and interest added on, can I pay the original amount?
A: Yes, you may qualify for a "Penalty Abatement" to remove penalties and interest. The IRS may waive penalties and interest for a variety of reasons including medical reasons, poor accounting advice, ignorance of the tax laws that apply, ex-spouse circumstances, the need to care and provide for a loved one, and more.
Q: Who can most benefit from tax relief assistance?
A: Typically, individuals and businesses who owe the IRS back taxes ranging from $10,000 to $250,000 or more can realize the greatest benefit from tax relief services.  Tax relief specialists and attorneys have a depth of knowledge and expertise and understand how to apply current tax relief code to reach the best possible tax resolution on behalf of taxpayers - including those who have not filed returns for one or multiple years for a variety of reasons. In addition, tax relief can help individuals or businesses in need of immediate relief to stop or prevent a wage garnishment, tax lien, or bank account levy.
Q: What are the benefits of a free tax relief consultation?
A: For individuals and businesses who owe back taxes to the IRS and have an urgent need to stop or prevent IRS enforcement action and settle IRS tax debt for substantially less than the full amount owed, a free tax relief consultation will provide an overview of the taxpayer's legal tax relief rights and options to resolve taxes and settle for less. All tax relief consultations come with no obligation and there is no charge to get an honest assessment of your current situation and the realistic IRS settlement options available to you.

We've served more than 1.4 million people all across America in need of relief from IRS back taxes. Below are comments from taxpayers who have been successful at putting stress and worry over IRS back taxes behind them.





...from the first phone call I felt so relieved. Their confidence of relieving from this IRS burden rubbed off on me. I was still scared and spent many sleepness nights worrying but contacting them was the best thing I could have done. I feel like a 100 pounds is off my shoulders so I want to thank Tax Defense. They even told me that I can always call them years from now if I have any questions or need advise and that is another reason why I would advise people to put their trust in them as I did... — Sherri
When you receive a letter in the mail that has IRS on it - you tend to lose a lot of sleep and sometimes don't even open the envelope! I've had that experience and after making contact with TDN, I have to tell you, I slept better. They certainly know how to work through the issues and tame the 900 pound gorilla! — Steve B.
I have to tell you that I was so nervous going through this process however [my tax specialist] walked me though the steps and explained everything in detail. She was able to have a tax levy on my wages released the same day we talked. Trust them they are the real thing. I can't thank you enough [my tax specialist]. — Joel P.

View Common Questions About Tax Relief


Q: Why would the IRS agree to settle back taxes for less?
A: There are a variety of reasons why the IRS agrees to work with taxpayers and settle for less. Often individuals or families are experiencing financial hardship, whether through loss of a job or income, illness, extenuating business or marital circumstances, or a number of other reasons. In addition, there may be "doubt as to collectability", "doubt as to liability", "innocent spouse" or a variety of other tax relief options or tax appeal provisions under the current tax code. In addition, the IRS may lower your tax liability because they feel you simply don't have the financial ability to pay the full amount owed within the statutory time period.
Q: How Can the IRS Fresh Start Initiative Provide Relief for Taxpayers?
A. The IRS Fresh Start program is an effort on the part of the IRS to make it easier for financially distressed taxpayers to resolve back taxes as quickly as possible.  Through a free tax relief consultation, taxpayers can find out if the leniency offered via Fresh Start can provide relief for IRS penalties, IRS liens, and also offer more streamlined processes for Installment Agreement and Offers in Compromise.
Q: What should you do if you've received a collection letter/notice from IRS?
A: Do not ignore IRS letters or enforcement notices. They may be auto-generated but, if ignored, they will lead to a wage garnishment, tax lien, bank account levy or other asset seizure or enforcement action. Stay in contact with the IRS and consider the advantages of a free tax relief consultation - speaking to tax relief specialists who can apprise you fully of your tax relief rights and options under the law and, at your request, negotiate directly with the IRS, to bring your case to a favorable resolution.
Q. How does a free tax relief consultation work?
A. As an individual or business, when you contact the IRS directly, you will likely be communicating with a frontline IRS collector whose task it is to collect on the total amount of tax liability assessed. Through a free tax relief consultation, you will have the opportunity to get a free and fair assessment from a tax relief specialist who can review with you all the circumstances surrounding the amount you owe the IRS, or the IRS claims you owe.  In addition, the tax resolution specialist can also take the time to listen to you, understand what you are going through, and review the options available to reach the best possible settlement with the IRS.
Q. What are some of the most common reasons why taxpayers may qualify for relief?
Many people owe the IRS back taxes for a variety of reasons, in many cases due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control - including personal or financial hardship, business hardship, medical issues and more. In addition, taxpayers may not have been able to file back taxes for one or more years, or feel they have been unfairly assessed.  There also may be taxpayers who fall into the "currently not collectable" status because they simply cannot afford to pay the tax assessed. In many cases, taxpayers may qualify for relief via the IRS Fresh Start initiative.
Q: If I've fallen behind on my taxes and have the ability to pay the original amount but cannot afford to pay all the penalties and interest added on, can I pay the original amount?
A: Yes, you may qualify for a "Penalty Abatement" to remove penalties and interest. The IRS may waive penalties and interest for a variety of reasons including medical reasons, poor accounting advice, ignorance of the tax laws that apply, ex-spouse circumstances, the need to care and provide for a loved one, and more.
Q: Who can most benefit from tax relief assistance?
A: Typically, individuals and businesses who owe the IRS back taxes ranging from $10,000 to $250,000 or more can realize the greatest benefit from tax relief services.  Tax relief specialists and attorneys have a depth of knowledge and expertise and understand how to apply current tax relief code to reach the best possible tax resolution on behalf of taxpayers - including those who have not filed returns for one or multiple years for a variety of reasons. In addition, tax relief can help individuals or businesses in need of immediate relief to stop or prevent a wage garnishment, tax lien, or bank account levy.
Q: What are the benefits of a free tax relief consultation?
A: For individuals and businesses who owe back taxes to the IRS and have an urgent need to stop or prevent IRS enforcement action and settle IRS tax debt for substantially less than the full amount owed, a free tax relief consultation will provide an overview of the taxpayer's legal tax relief rights and options to resolve taxes and settle for less. All tax relief consultations come with no obligation and there is no charge to get an honest assessment of your current situation and the realistic IRS settlement options available to you.

The books in this department are geared directly toward young readers who may not yet have the ability to read on their own or may still be learning the basics of how to sound out unfamiliar words, but we also have books for older kids ages 11 15 who are reading chapter books and other advanced children's literature. Our children's book offerings cover a wide range of reading abilities and subject matter, allowing you to build the perfect library for kids at every stage in their learning journey. Every Day Low Prices mean you can create an engaging and diverse collection of reading materials to enrich your kids' lives and make learning a fun experience for the whole family.Early childhood booksOur Children's Books department includes categories for books for children from ages Birth 2 Years and 3 4 Years. These are the shortest, simplest books, designed for parents to read out loud to their little ones. Some parents may use these easy-to-read books as a basis for teaching their children how to read by sounding out words and recognizing specific letters. If this kind of education is a priority for you, both of these sections include specially written books that focus on simple words, the alphabet and numbers from 1 10. If you'd rather just read to your child at this early stage, you can find plenty of simple stories and picture books in these sections that will suit that need as well.Books for school-aged childrenChildren who are more advanced can find longer and more complex books in our sections for children ages 5 7 and 8 11 years old. The 5 7 Years section includes a wide variety of short, simple books with easy plot lines and basic vocabulary that many elementary school children will be able to read on their own. Books in the 8 11 Years category become more advanced, dividing into chapter books that still have bigger print and smaller words to avoid frustrating young readers. Each of these sections includes classic titles and popular new books that you can choose from according to your child's personality and interests. We also have a special section for ages 15 & Up so high school-age kids can find the classics that are part of their school syllabi and discover new titles to read in their free time.Shopping for children's booksIf you're shopping for books just to add some new titles to your child's library, you can have them join you in the shopping process to make it more fun and make reading more exciting. Point out different book subjects and titles to your child and let him or her tell you which ones seem the most interesting. Focusing on the books in our Popular Brands & Characters section may be a particularly good idea when you're shopping for books with your kid; the familiar characters and themes will capture their attention and help them feel more excited about reading. If you're shopping for books as a gift for a baby shower, birthday or holiday, you can focus on classics that have shown up on kids' bedroom bookshelves for generations. From early-reader classics like the Richard Scarry Golden Books or the Berenstain Bears series to timeless chapter books like Hatchet and books by Judy Blume, picking out some of your own favorite children's books can be a fun way to bond with your children and carry on literary traditions in your family. Shopping for books for holidays is also made easy by focusing on our seasonal shops and sections in the Children's Books department. Mother's Day, Christmas, Halloween, Easter, Thanksgiving and other holidays are all popular subjects for children's books that will get your kids excited about the season.Boxed sets and collectionsOne great way to shop our Children's Books department is to look for boxed sets and book collections in our Character Books and Classic Books sections. You can find collected books from beloved authors or those featuring famous characters in these sections. Buying a complete collection at once gives your child the ability to work their way through all the books in the collection without needing to wait and buy each new book in a series. These collected sets also make fantastic gifts for baby showers, birthdays and other occasions. New parents will appreciate having their baby's bookshelves stocked with all the classics from a beloved series. We offer collections of Children's Books for different ages and stages of educational development, making this a versatile option throughout a child's life.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147332930, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35. There may be additional surcharges to ship to one of these areas, and this information will appear when you check out with your purchase.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863629, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

THE THING ABOUT UNFAIR ADVANTAGES IS, THEY'RE AWESOME.

                    Unfair advantages are an outrage. Until you're the one who has them. Then they're like the best thing ever. Clever tax breaks. Shrewd deductions. Opportunistic navigation of the United States tax code. The only time those things aren't awesome is when they're unavailable to regular people. At TaxAct, we don't "make things fair." What fun is there in that? We make unfair accessible to all. What could be more American?

THE THING ABOUT UNFAIR ADVANTAGES IS, THEY'RE AWESOME.

                    Unfair advantages are an outrage. Until you're the one who has them. Then they're like the best thing ever. Clever tax breaks. Shrewd deductions. Opportunistic navigation of the United States tax code. The only time those things aren't awesome is when they're unavailable to regular people. At TaxAct, we don't "make things fair." What fun is there in that? We make unfair accessible to all. What could be more American?

THE THING ABOUT UNFAIR ADVANTAGES IS, THEY'RE AWESOME.

                    Unfair advantages are an outrage. Until you're the one who has them. Then they're like the best thing ever. Clever tax breaks. Shrewd deductions. Opportunistic navigation of the United States tax code. The only time those things aren't awesome is when they're unavailable to regular people. At TaxAct, we don't "make things fair." What fun is there in that? We make unfair accessible to all. What could be more American?

History[edit]
During World War II, Henry W. Bloch was a young Army Air Forces navigator who wanted to start a family business with his brothers in Kansas City.[1]
Home from the war in 1946, Henry saw a pamphlet suggesting a bright future for companies serving small businesses, and it fired his imagination.[1] That year, Henry and his older brother, Leon, borrowed $5,000 and opened a small bookkeeping business on Main Street in downtown Kansas City.[1] However, four months later, they had few clients and Leon decided to seek a law degree.[1]
Henry wanted to keep trying with the fledgling business and placed a newspaper ad for help-wanted.[1] He got an unexpected response—from his mother—who proposed that Henry hire his younger brother, Richard, for the job.[1] Henry and Richard Bloch jointly ran their United Business Company, which focused on bookkeeping, but also did some income tax work for clients. The brothers found that doing taxes was time consuming and they decided to end that type of service. One of their clients, John White, an ad salesman for The Kansas City Star newspaper, had a different idea; he suggested the Blochs make tax preparation a separate business and developed an ad announcing $5 tax services. The Blochs were not convinced, but they agreed to run the ad in January 1955. The next day, the brothers had an office full of tax clients, and H&R Block was born.
In 1956, the Blochs decided to expand and picked New York City. The move was profitable, but neither brother wanted to move to New York, so they agreed to sell that regional operation to two local accountants. However, since the would-be buyers could not meet the asking price, the parties agreed the Bloch brothers would get $10,000, plus royalties from the tax operation, creating the first H&R Block franchise tax office. The Bloch brothers chose to spell the name "Block" with a K to ensure the name is not mispronounced "blotch."[2] In the following years, H&R Block grew quickly and went public in 1962, then opened its first tax training school in 1965 to meet the demand for skilled tax professionals at its franchise offices.
A TV ad campaign begun in 1972 featured Henry Bloch and became the springboard for H&R Block becoming one of the most widely recognized brand names in the U.S. In 1980 H&R Block purchased the Compuserve online service.
By 1986, Block was handling more than 10 million tax returns each year and had opened offices in Canada and Australia. That year, Block worked with the Internal Revenue Service to introduce electronic filing. Since then, Block has moved further into the digital realm with tax software and online tax preparation.
The company began to expand in the 1990s into the financial services arena, offering mortgage loans, banking, and business services. H&R Block purchased Olde Discount Stockbrokers and operated as a full-service securities broker-dealer under the name H&R Block Financial Advisors. By 2007, the unit was managing $33 billion in assets, offering investment planning, advice and related financial products and services, and employed 900 financial advisors in the U.S. In 2008, H&R Block sold the unit to Ameriprise Financial for US$ 315 million.[3]
RSM McGladrey Business Solutions was created in 1999 when H&R Block acquired the assets and business of McGladrey & Pullen, based in Bloomington, Minnesota. McGladrey had 100 offices in 25 states and offered accounting, consulting, tax services, and international business services to mid-sized companies. Its clients included business in the construction, health care and manufacturing industries. Through an alliance with McGladrey & Pullen and other accountancies, the Block subsidiary operated in 70 countries under the RSM International name. In 2011, H&R Block sold the unit to McGladrey & Pullen.[4]
Business areas[edit]
Retail tax services[edit]




H&R Block Tax Service - Mar 2013


In May 2007, the company said its total U.S. clients served during the 2007 tax season reached a record 19.9 million, up 3.8 percent from the previous year period.[5] H&R Block employs 90,000 tax preparers. The company reported that in 2007, its tax clients obtained US$30 billion in tax refunds, credits and other government benefits. The company said it filed US$10 billion worth of Earned Income Tax Credits for its low-income clients.
Digital tax services[edit]
H&R Block competes for a share of the digital market with its online tax programs and software. Block's other digital offerings include H&R Block Best of Both, where clients enter their information and do their returns online and a Block tax professional reviews, edits, signs and e-files the return.

H&R Block Bank[edit]
The H&R Block Bank was chartered in 2006 and offers low-cost services to its low- to moderate-income customers. Block has said that more than one-third of its clients do not have bank accounts, and must pay high check-cashing fees for their paychecks and tax refund checks. Bank customers can establish FDIC-insured accounts with their tax refund money and then access those funds with pre-paid "Emerald" MasterCards through a nationwide network of ATMs. The accounts also allow direct payroll deposits via ACH and clients can get traditional services, such as lines of credit and individual retirement accounts.
In September 2015, H&R Block sold H&R Block Bank to BofI Holding Inc and reached an agreement for BofI to serve as the bank for H&R Block-branded financial services products including the Emerald MasterCard, Refund Anticipation Checks, and Emerald Advance lines of credit.[6]
Block Advisors[edit]
In January 2016, H&R Block launched Block Advisors, a service that provides year-round consumer tax preparation.[7] The company says they have opened 280 Block Advisor offices.[8]
Controversies[edit]
H&R Block's own taxes[edit]
In August 2005, H&R Block announced that it had overstated its earnings for 2003 and 2004 by $91.1 million. The company stated that it had "insufficient resources" to identify and report complex transactions in its corporate tax accounting. On February 23, 2006, the company said in its quarterly results that it had miscalculated its own state income taxes for 2005 and 2004, and that it owed an additional $32 million in back taxes. That mistake, plus Block's lower-than-expected earnings for the quarter, caused its stock price to drop by 8.5 percent in one day. At April 30, 2008, the company's liability recorded for "uncertain tax positions" totaled $137.6 million (excluding related interest and penalties). According to H&R Block, "This liability represents an estimate of tax positions we have taken in our tax returns that may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities." Estimated gross interest and penalties relating to these potential assessments totaled an additional $47.5 million.[9][10]
Refund anticipation loans[edit]
On Feb. 15, 2006, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer sued H&R Block, alleging the company's refund anticipation loan (RAL) business violated state and federal laws in its marketing and providing of high-cost RALs mainly to low-income clients. Block responded that it "believes the refund lending program is both fair and legal, and will vigorously defend against the complaint". On January 2, 2009, California Attorney General Edmund G. Brown Jr. reached a $4.85 million settlement with H&R Block, which prohibits the company from deceptively marketing high-cost refund anticipation loans as early "tax refunds". Consumers received up to $2.45 million in restitution if they purchased a "refund anticipation loan" or a "refund anticipation check" through H&R Block between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2008. In addition, H&R Block agreed to pay $500,000 in penalties and $1.9 million in fees and costs.[11][12] In 2011, H&R Block ceased offering RALs altogether, a move praised by consumer rights activists.[13]
Express IRA[edit]
On March 16, 2006, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued H&R Block, accusing the company of deceptive marketing of its Express IRA retirement accounts. The lawsuit alleged the company assessed fees, including set-up fees, annual fees, and account closing fees that, for 85% of account holders, resulted in the account losing money.[14] However, in July 2007, a New York state judge dismissed much of the lawsuit.[15] Justice Karla Moskowitz of the State Supreme Court excused Block and five of its units from the lawsuit. She let stand the portion of the complaint concerning another unit, H&R Block Financial Advisers, but dismissed allegations of common law fraud. At the time of the ruling, Block said it believed the remaining assertions lacked merit and that it would appeal. On January 6, 2009, a New York state appeals court overruled trial justice Karla Moskowitz's July 2007 ruling and reinstated the lawsuit against H&R Block Inc that accused the company of fraudulently marketing Express IRA retirement accounts to hundreds of thousands of lower-income clients nationwide.[16] The matter was settled in 2009.
Social Security numbers[edit]
In December 2005, H&R Block sent its customers free copies of its TaxCut software, and the mailing labels on the packages mistakenly included the recipients' Social Security numbers. Block said it sent the promotional mailing to former customers and people whose names were taken from purchased lists. The company said it is legally required to hold on to customers' tax information, including Social Security numbers, for three years. Block said no customer data has been lost or stolen as a result of the mistake, and that less than 3 percent of the mailings were involved.[17]

History[edit]
During World War II, Henry W. Bloch was a young Army Air Forces navigator who wanted to start a family business with his brothers in Kansas City.[1]
Home from the war in 1946, Henry saw a pamphlet suggesting a bright future for companies serving small businesses, and it fired his imagination.[1] That year, Henry and his older brother, Leon, borrowed $5,000 and opened a small bookkeeping business on Main Street in downtown Kansas City.[1] However, four months later, they had few clients and Leon decided to seek a law degree.[1]
Henry wanted to keep trying with the fledgling business and placed a newspaper ad for help-wanted.[1] He got an unexpected response—from his mother—who proposed that Henry hire his younger brother, Richard, for the job.[1] Henry and Richard Bloch jointly ran their United Business Company, which focused on bookkeeping, but also did some income tax work for clients. The brothers found that doing taxes was time consuming and they decided to end that type of service. One of their clients, John White, an ad salesman for The Kansas City Star newspaper, had a different idea; he suggested the Blochs make tax preparation a separate business and developed an ad announcing $5 tax services. The Blochs were not convinced, but they agreed to run the ad in January 1955. The next day, the brothers had an office full of tax clients, and H&R Block was born.
In 1956, the Blochs decided to expand and picked New York City. The move was profitable, but neither brother wanted to move to New York, so they agreed to sell that regional operation to two local accountants. However, since the would-be buyers could not meet the asking price, the parties agreed the Bloch brothers would get $10,000, plus royalties from the tax operation, creating the first H&R Block franchise tax office. The Bloch brothers chose to spell the name "Block" with a K to ensure the name is not mispronounced "blotch."[2] In the following years, H&R Block grew quickly and went public in 1962, then opened its first tax training school in 1965 to meet the demand for skilled tax professionals at its franchise offices.
A TV ad campaign begun in 1972 featured Henry Bloch and became the springboard for H&R Block becoming one of the most widely recognized brand names in the U.S. In 1980 H&R Block purchased the Compuserve online service.
By 1986, Block was handling more than 10 million tax returns each year and had opened offices in Canada and Australia. That year, Block worked with the Internal Revenue Service to introduce electronic filing. Since then, Block has moved further into the digital realm with tax software and online tax preparation.
The company began to expand in the 1990s into the financial services arena, offering mortgage loans, banking, and business services. H&R Block purchased Olde Discount Stockbrokers and operated as a full-service securities broker-dealer under the name H&R Block Financial Advisors. By 2007, the unit was managing $33 billion in assets, offering investment planning, advice and related financial products and services, and employed 900 financial advisors in the U.S. In 2008, H&R Block sold the unit to Ameriprise Financial for US$ 315 million.[3]
RSM McGladrey Business Solutions was created in 1999 when H&R Block acquired the assets and business of McGladrey & Pullen, based in Bloomington, Minnesota. McGladrey had 100 offices in 25 states and offered accounting, consulting, tax services, and international business services to mid-sized companies. Its clients included business in the construction, health care and manufacturing industries. Through an alliance with McGladrey & Pullen and other accountancies, the Block subsidiary operated in 70 countries under the RSM International name. In 2011, H&R Block sold the unit to McGladrey & Pullen.[4]
Business areas[edit]
Retail tax services[edit]




H&R Block Tax Service - Mar 2013


In May 2007, the company said its total U.S. clients served during the 2007 tax season reached a record 19.9 million, up 3.8 percent from the previous year period.[5] H&R Block employs 90,000 tax preparers. The company reported that in 2007, its tax clients obtained US$30 billion in tax refunds, credits and other government benefits. The company said it filed US$10 billion worth of Earned Income Tax Credits for its low-income clients.
Digital tax services[edit]
H&R Block competes for a share of the digital market with its online tax programs and software. Block's other digital offerings include H&R Block Best of Both, where clients enter their information and do their returns online and a Block tax professional reviews, edits, signs and e-files the return.

H&R Block Bank[edit]
The H&R Block Bank was chartered in 2006 and offers low-cost services to its low- to moderate-income customers. Block has said that more than one-third of its clients do not have bank accounts, and must pay high check-cashing fees for their paychecks and tax refund checks. Bank customers can establish FDIC-insured accounts with their tax refund money and then access those funds with pre-paid "Emerald" MasterCards through a nationwide network of ATMs. The accounts also allow direct payroll deposits via ACH and clients can get traditional services, such as lines of credit and individual retirement accounts.
In September 2015, H&R Block sold H&R Block Bank to BofI Holding Inc and reached an agreement for BofI to serve as the bank for H&R Block-branded financial services products including the Emerald MasterCard, Refund Anticipation Checks, and Emerald Advance lines of credit.[6]
Block Advisors[edit]
In January 2016, H&R Block launched Block Advisors, a service that provides year-round consumer tax preparation.[7] The company says they have opened 280 Block Advisor offices.[8]

History[edit]
During World War II, Henry W. Bloch was a young Army Air Forces navigator who wanted to start a family business with his brothers in Kansas City.[1]
Home from the war in 1946, Henry saw a pamphlet suggesting a bright future for companies serving small businesses, and it fired his imagination.[1] That year, Henry and his older brother, Leon, borrowed $5,000 and opened a small bookkeeping business on Main Street in downtown Kansas City.[1] However, four months later, they had few clients and Leon decided to seek a law degree.[1]
Henry wanted to keep trying with the fledgling business and placed a newspaper ad for help-wanted.[1] He got an unexpected response—from his mother—who proposed that Henry hire his younger brother, Richard, for the job.[1] Henry and Richard Bloch jointly ran their United Business Company, which focused on bookkeeping, but also did some income tax work for clients. The brothers found that doing taxes was time consuming and they decided to end that type of service. One of their clients, John White, an ad salesman for The Kansas City Star newspaper, had a different idea; he suggested the Blochs make tax preparation a separate business and developed an ad announcing $5 tax services. The Blochs were not convinced, but they agreed to run the ad in January 1955. The next day, the brothers had an office full of tax clients, and H&R Block was born.
In 1956, the Blochs decided to expand and picked New York City. The move was profitable, but neither brother wanted to move to New York, so they agreed to sell that regional operation to two local accountants. However, since the would-be buyers could not meet the asking price, the parties agreed the Bloch brothers would get $10,000, plus royalties from the tax operation, creating the first H&R Block franchise tax office. The Bloch brothers chose to spell the name "Block" with a K to ensure the name is not mispronounced "blotch."[2] In the following years, H&R Block grew quickly and went public in 1962, then opened its first tax training school in 1965 to meet the demand for skilled tax professionals at its franchise offices.
A TV ad campaign begun in 1972 featured Henry Bloch and became the springboard for H&R Block becoming one of the most widely recognized brand names in the U.S. In 1980 H&R Block purchased the Compuserve online service.
By 1986, Block was handling more than 10 million tax returns each year and had opened offices in Canada and Australia. That year, Block worked with the Internal Revenue Service to introduce electronic filing. Since then, Block has moved further into the digital realm with tax software and online tax preparation.
The company began to expand in the 1990s into the financial services arena, offering mortgage loans, banking, and business services. H&R Block purchased Olde Discount Stockbrokers and operated as a full-service securities broker-dealer under the name H&R Block Financial Advisors. By 2007, the unit was managing $33 billion in assets, offering investment planning, advice and related financial products and services, and employed 900 financial advisors in the U.S. In 2008, H&R Block sold the unit to Ameriprise Financial for US$ 315 million.[3]
RSM McGladrey Business Solutions was created in 1999 when H&R Block acquired the assets and business of McGladrey & Pullen, based in Bloomington, Minnesota. McGladrey had 100 offices in 25 states and offered accounting, consulting, tax services, and international business services to mid-sized companies. Its clients included business in the construction, health care and manufacturing industries. Through an alliance with McGladrey & Pullen and other accountancies, the Block subsidiary operated in 70 countries under the RSM International name. In 2011, H&R Block sold the unit to McGladrey & Pullen.[4]
Business areas[edit]
Retail tax services[edit]




H&R Block Tax Service - Mar 2013


In May 2007, the company said its total U.S. clients served during the 2007 tax season reached a record 19.9 million, up 3.8 percent from the previous year period.[5] H&R Block employs 90,000 tax preparers. The company reported that in 2007, its tax clients obtained US$30 billion in tax refunds, credits and other government benefits. The company said it filed US$10 billion worth of Earned Income Tax Credits for its low-income clients.
Digital tax services[edit]
H&R Block competes for a share of the digital market with its online tax programs and software. Block's other digital offerings include H&R Block Best of Both, where clients enter their information and do their returns online and a Block tax professional reviews, edits, signs and e-files the return.

H&R Block Bank[edit]
The H&R Block Bank was chartered in 2006 and offers low-cost services to its low- to moderate-income customers. Block has said that more than one-third of its clients do not have bank accounts, and must pay high check-cashing fees for their paychecks and tax refund checks. Bank customers can establish FDIC-insured accounts with their tax refund money and then access those funds with pre-paid "Emerald" MasterCards through a nationwide network of ATMs. The accounts also allow direct payroll deposits via ACH and clients can get traditional services, such as lines of credit and individual retirement accounts.
In September 2015, H&R Block sold H&R Block Bank to BofI Holding Inc and reached an agreement for BofI to serve as the bank for H&R Block-branded financial services products including the Emerald MasterCard, Refund Anticipation Checks, and Emerald Advance lines of credit.[6]
Block Advisors[edit]
In January 2016, H&R Block launched Block Advisors, a service that provides year-round consumer tax preparation.[7] The company says they have opened 280 Block Advisor offices.[8]
Controversies[edit]
H&R Block's own taxes[edit]
In August 2005, H&R Block announced that it had overstated its earnings for 2003 and 2004 by $91.1 million. The company stated that it had "insufficient resources" to identify and report complex transactions in its corporate tax accounting. On February 23, 2006, the company said in its quarterly results that it had miscalculated its own state income taxes for 2005 and 2004, and that it owed an additional $32 million in back taxes. That mistake, plus Block's lower-than-expected earnings for the quarter, caused its stock price to drop by 8.5 percent in one day. At April 30, 2008, the company's liability recorded for "uncertain tax positions" totaled $137.6 million (excluding related interest and penalties). According to H&R Block, "This liability represents an estimate of tax positions we have taken in our tax returns that may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities." Estimated gross interest and penalties relating to these potential assessments totaled an additional $47.5 million.[9][10]
Refund anticipation loans[edit]
On Feb. 15, 2006, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer sued H&R Block, alleging the company's refund anticipation loan (RAL) business violated state and federal laws in its marketing and providing of high-cost RALs mainly to low-income clients. Block responded that it "believes the refund lending program is both fair and legal, and will vigorously defend against the complaint". On January 2, 2009, California Attorney General Edmund G. Brown Jr. reached a $4.85 million settlement with H&R Block, which prohibits the company from deceptively marketing high-cost refund anticipation loans as early "tax refunds". Consumers received up to $2.45 million in restitution if they purchased a "refund anticipation loan" or a "refund anticipation check" through H&R Block between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2008. In addition, H&R Block agreed to pay $500,000 in penalties and $1.9 million in fees and costs.[11][12] In 2011, H&R Block ceased offering RALs altogether, a move praised by consumer rights activists.[13]
Express IRA[edit]
On March 16, 2006, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued H&R Block, accusing the company of deceptive marketing of its Express IRA retirement accounts. The lawsuit alleged the company assessed fees, including set-up fees, annual fees, and account closing fees that, for 85% of account holders, resulted in the account losing money.[14] However, in July 2007, a New York state judge dismissed much of the lawsuit.[15] Justice Karla Moskowitz of the State Supreme Court excused Block and five of its units from the lawsuit. She let stand the portion of the complaint concerning another unit, H&R Block Financial Advisers, but dismissed allegations of common law fraud. At the time of the ruling, Block said it believed the remaining assertions lacked merit and that it would appeal. On January 6, 2009, a New York state appeals court overruled trial justice Karla Moskowitz's July 2007 ruling and reinstated the lawsuit against H&R Block Inc that accused the company of fraudulently marketing Express IRA retirement accounts to hundreds of thousands of lower-income clients nationwide.[16] The matter was settled in 2009.
Social Security numbers[edit]
In December 2005, H&R Block sent its customers free copies of its TaxCut software, and the mailing labels on the packages mistakenly included the recipients' Social Security numbers. Block said it sent the promotional mailing to former customers and people whose names were taken from purchased lists. The company said it is legally required to hold on to customers' tax information, including Social Security numbers, for three years. Block said no customer data has been lost or stolen as a result of the mistake, and that less than 3 percent of the mailings were involved.[17]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
