Overview
In the north, deep woods and clean lakes lure wildlife and nature lovers. In the central section, picturesque dairy farms dot the landscape. In the south, bustling cities provide urban amenities, a high quality of life and plenty of apartments for rent. Wisconsin, the Badger State, is a great place to explore and, when you've found just the right spot, a wonderful place to settle down.
In the north woods of Wisconsin, clear, clean lakes abound. Fishing is fine, and wildlife is plentiful. Outdoor recreation and adventure are a main draw for out-of-state visitors. The 15,000 lakes in the state are enjoyed by swimmers, fishermen and fisherwomen and boaters. The deep, cool woods provide wonderful hiking and horseback riding trails.
What to Expect

Wisconsin is most famous for two products: cheese and beer. The state's dairy farms are the country's foremost supply of milk, cheese and butter. In fact, they supply 40% of the nation's cheese and 20% of its butter! Wisconsin is also a leading manufacturer of machinery, paper, automobiles and furniture. Oh yes, and beer. For decades, several major brewers called Milwaukee home, but today only Miller Brewing Co. along with a multitude of small breweries remain.
With 15,000 lakes, it's no wonder that Wisconsin residents can often be found enjoying the great outdoors. Favorite pastimes include swimming, fishing, boating, hunting and skiing. Lake Winnebago is the largest lake in Wisconsin at 215 square miles. The state also shares shores of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. The landscape is at its most inviting in autumn, when the trees burst into brilliant shades of red, yellow and orange.
Wisconsin's overall cost of living is about 3% below the national average, with housing costs—including apartments for rent—at about 5% below average.
Milwaukee Apartments

Milwaukee calls itself a "Genuine American City," and it doesn't take long to understand why (and believe it). With just over half a million residents, Milwaukee offers a great tradition of family values, diverse cultures, warm hospitality and interesting things to do. Local attractions include breweries that offer tours, the Milwaukee Art Museum, buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright, the Brewers pro baseball team and the Bucks pro basketball team. Every summer, Milwaukee hosts Summerfest, the world's biggest festival featuring 11 days of live music. Milwaukee's weather is fairly mild, thanks to Lake Michigan's influence. Summer rarely gets warmer than the 70s, while winter rarely goes much below 30 degrees. There are plenty of apartment rentals to choose from, with the median price for apartments at $575 per month.
Madison Apartments

Madison, state capital and home to 200,000 residents, is a perennial winner of many publications' lists of the best communities to live in. Recently, Forbes Magazine rated it "Number One in Nation for Business and Careers," Ladies' Home Journal called it the "Number One Best (Small) City for Women," and Child Magazine rated it the "Number Six Best City for Families." All the accolades will come as no surprise once you seen Madison's many advantages for yourself. The wooded lakeshores and multitude of parks make the city easy on the eyes, while the elaborate capitol and Frank Lloyd Wright buildings inspire the soul. Locals have plenty of reasons to venture out of their apartments, thanks to year-round outdoor activities, from swimming, sailing, hiking and biking to snow sailing, cross-country skiing and ice fishing. Madison is also home to the highly acclaimed University of Wisconsin. A large student population ensures plenty of apartments rentals. You'll find the median price for apartments to be $640 per month.Rent.com is a free rental site that offers a large selection of trusted apartments and houses for rent. Our large selection of listings and helpful tools will make it easy for you to find an affordable apartment quickly.© 2017 RentPath, LLC.

Apartments for rent in Wisconsin
Thinking of making Wisconsin your next home state? You can find plenty of apartments throughout Wisconsin in great cities like Madison, Milwaukee, Racine and many other cities.

But don't take my word for it. Madison, WI was named "One of the Ten Most Livable Cities in the United States" by the 2007 Place Rated Almanac. The city features five beautiful lakes: Lake Mendota, Lake Monona, Lake Waubesa, Lake Kengonsa and Lake Wingra. It's on these lakes that you'll find water sports, such as boating, water skiing, fishing and more. It's around these lakes that you'll find a variety of restaurants and fun community events. It's near all of this that you'll find terrific Madison apartments for rent.

If you're moving to Madison, WI for work, you'll find many job opportunities in the area. The city is home to 10% of the nation's bioengineering firms, the University of Wisconsin at Madison, five general hospitals, more than 20 medical clinics, Google offices, a university-based Microsoft data lab and many small businesses.
Whether you're trying to get around town for work or for play, you can travel easily throughout the city on your bike. A great biking destination is the scenic Memorial Union Terrace along the downtown waterfront. Here, you'll find local eateries with outdoor seating, regional micro-breweries, music venues, sailboat rentals, people watching and more.

Along the shores of Lake Michigan at the junction of the Menomonee, Kinnickinnic and Milwaukee Rivers, you'll find many Milwaukee, WI apartments for rent. Living in a Milwaukee apartment, you'll not only get to enjoy lake breezes and natural, scenic views, but you'll enjoy all the urban improvements the city has made over the past few years. For example, the Milwaukee RiverWalk, which runs for almost three miles along the Milwaukee River through the downtown area, has experienced huge advancements in residential, commercial and recreational development. And Brewers' fans got a new place to cheer on their home team when the state-of-the-art Miller Park was opened in 2001.
Look just 30 miles south of Milwaukee and you'll find apartments for rent in Racine, WI, which is also located on the shores of Lake Michigan. With its 50 acres of soft, clean sand, North Beach is the jewel of Racine. Walk along the beach or skate and bike on scenic bike paths along the waterfront. Stop for a bite to eat and listen to live music on the weekends.
Whether you're looking for job opportunities, urban living, lakefront views, waterfront activities or all of these things, you'll find great apartments in Wisconsin cities like Racine, Milwaukee, Madison and many other large and small cities.
