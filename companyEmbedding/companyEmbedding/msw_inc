CSWE Accredited Online Master of Social Work (MSW) Programs
Students interested in pursuing a Master of Social Work (MSW) online have several options to consider as they research potential programs. Currently, there are 38 schools that offer online MSW degree programs designed for students who have not earned a Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) (also known as traditional MSW programs). In the United States, the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) is the only organization that accredits MSW programs. All schools listed on OnlineMSWPrograms.com offer CSWE accredited online MSW programs.
(For students who have already earned a BSW from a CSWE accredited undergraduate program, we have compiled a comprehensive list of schools offering Advanced Standing Online MSW Programs complete with program information and admission requirements.)

There are several reasons to consider pursuing a MSW degree. For professionals who have already earned a BSW and work in the field, a MSW is required to become a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) in all 50 states (specific licensing requirements vary by state). In addition, many states also require a MSW to become a Licensed Master Social Worker (LMSW). For professionals who are looking to make a career change, a MSW provides the education and background needed to enter the field of social work.
Online MSW programs are ideal for working professionals and for students who do not live near a campus-based program. Although there are only 38 schools that currently offer a traditional standing online MSW program (compared to 235 campus programs), students still have several options to consider as they research graduate schools. To learn more about the types of online MSW programs available, continue reading for more information.
What is CSWE Accreditation?
The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) is a partnership of educational and professional social work institutions, social welfare agencies and private citizens. Founded in 1952, CSWE is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation as the sole accrediting agency in the United States for all social work education, including online and hybrid programs. CSWE accreditation signals that a graduate or undergraduate social work education program satisfactorily meets the council’s standards for student competencies, institutional policies, curricula and more. The CSWE stresses that all accredited programs, both in person and online, are subject to the same standards and criteria.
The Benefits of Choosing a CSWE-Accredited School
CSWE-accredited schools have been recognized by the educational community and the public as having satisfactory levels of performance, integrity and quality. With this accreditation, students can be confident that the social work program they are investing in, whether it be in person or online, will be able to prepare them for the next steps in their careers. In fact, most state licensing boards require that social workers earn their degrees through CSWE-accredited schools. Even in states that don’t mandate it, CSWE accreditation can make the licensure process simpler through its standardization of educational criteria. Employers may require or prefer their candidates to hold degrees from CSWE-accredited schools. 
Specifically, CSWE accreditation entails:

Parity regardless of delivery: CSWE-accredited schools offer programs that meet the same standards and criteria, regardless of their delivery in person or online.
Practical competency: CSWE-accredited schools have a proven track record of preparing their students to meet the practical challenges of professional social work practice.
Sound policy: CSWE-accredited schools pursue goals that reinforce the values of the social work profession.
Requisite curriculum: CSWE-accredited schools offer the courses necessary for students to receive adequate social work educations.
Qualified licensure: CSWE-accredited schools grant degrees mandated by most state licensing boards for social work licensure.
Proficient employment: CSWE-accredited schools grant degrees required or preferred by employers of social workers.

ABOUT THE CSWE

The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) is a non-profit association that is recognized by theCouncil for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) as the only accrediting body for Master of Social Work (MSW) programs in the United States. CSWE sets and maintains the national accreditation standards for MSW degree programs and all online MSW programs must meet the same standards as campus-based programs. For students who wish to pursue a career in social work, it is important to graduate from a CSWE approved program in order to pursue state licensing.



BE INFORMED

Please take a minute and read our disclaimers page as licensing requirements for social workers vary by state. Prospective students should check with their state’s social work licensing board and speak with an admissions counselor about state specific requirements before applying to a program.  Overall tuition costs are estimated based on the cost per credit hour multiplied by the number of credits needed to graduate. Tuition rates displayed on the site are not guaranteed and may not include university fees or other expenses. For the most up-to-date information, speak with an admission advisor for current tuition rates.



FOR STUDENTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

For students in New Hampshire who wish to pursue a career in clinical social work, the New Hampshire Board of Mental Health Practice requires students to attend a hybrid or on-campus program in order to meet licensing requirements.

Academic Curriculum
The MSW@USC curriculum reflects the evolution of and innovations in the field of social work. The coursework explores emerging needs in the field to prepare a new kind of social worker who can meet the demands of 21st-century society. The MSW@USC features a rigorous curriculum that is the same as that of the on-campus program. Courses are delivered online and taught by our award-winning faculty.
The traditional program track is designed for students who hold an undergraduate degree in a discipline other than social work. The program can be completed on a full-time or part-time basis.
If you hold a Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) from an accredited institution, you are eligible to apply for the advanced standing program.
Structure and Emphasis
The school's departments house large, broad areas of interest. As an MSW@USC student, you will choose a specific department of study when you begin your classes:





Adult Mental Health and Wellness

Adults and Healthy Aging





Children, Youth and Families

Children, Youth and Families





Social Change and Innovation

Community, Organization and Business Innovation




You will begin your studies with a foundation in social work principles and practice and then build on that core knowledge to support your learning in one of the three departments. Your studies will be strengthened through field education.
The MSW curriculum explores content relevant to today's employers, expanding on the program's historic strengths while increasing emphasis on:

Early intervention, prevention and wellness
Leadership and effective collaboration
Implications of new findings in neuroscience
Core competencies (evidence-based practices, evidence-informed interventions)

Field Education
Hands-on experience is an integral part of any MSW curriculum. Throughout the program, you will spend more than 1,000 hours completing field education — online and offline. Learn more about field education.
Cross-Program Enrollment
MSW@USC students also have the opportunity to take courses from other online graduate programs delivered by top-tier colleges and universities. You can learn more about cross-university courses here.

4u2u Brands, LLC (Richmond, VA), marketers of high-quality juice beverages, such as Fruit 66, uses 8.4oz aluminum “slim” cans as one of their product vessels. With a wide range of flavors, and color-matched graphics on such printed cans, ensuring that there is a solid supply of containers, is critical to the success of the Fruit 66 brand. So, when the lead times for the manufacturing of printed beverage cans, quickly jumps from a norm of 4 or 5 weeks, to more than 12 weeks, 4u2u Brands is sent scrambling for alternative solutions to keep their products in-stock.

CSWE Accredited Online Master of Social Work (MSW) Programs
Students interested in pursuing a Master of Social Work (MSW) online have several options to consider as they research potential programs. Currently, there are 38 schools that offer online MSW degree programs designed for students who have not earned a Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) (also known as traditional MSW programs). In the United States, the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) is the only organization that accredits MSW programs. All schools listed on OnlineMSWPrograms.com offer CSWE accredited online MSW programs.
(For students who have already earned a BSW from a CSWE accredited undergraduate program, we have compiled a comprehensive list of schools offering Advanced Standing Online MSW Programs complete with program information and admission requirements.)

There are several reasons to consider pursuing a MSW degree. For professionals who have already earned a BSW and work in the field, a MSW is required to become a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) in all 50 states (specific licensing requirements vary by state). In addition, many states also require a MSW to become a Licensed Master Social Worker (LMSW). For professionals who are looking to make a career change, a MSW provides the education and background needed to enter the field of social work.
Online MSW programs are ideal for working professionals and for students who do not live near a campus-based program. Although there are only 38 schools that currently offer a traditional standing online MSW program (compared to 235 campus programs), students still have several options to consider as they research graduate schools. To learn more about the types of online MSW programs available, continue reading for more information.
What is CSWE Accreditation?
The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) is a partnership of educational and professional social work institutions, social welfare agencies and private citizens. Founded in 1952, CSWE is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation as the sole accrediting agency in the United States for all social work education, including online and hybrid programs. CSWE accreditation signals that a graduate or undergraduate social work education program satisfactorily meets the council’s standards for student competencies, institutional policies, curricula and more. The CSWE stresses that all accredited programs, both in person and online, are subject to the same standards and criteria.
The Benefits of Choosing a CSWE-Accredited School
CSWE-accredited schools have been recognized by the educational community and the public as having satisfactory levels of performance, integrity and quality. With this accreditation, students can be confident that the social work program they are investing in, whether it be in person or online, will be able to prepare them for the next steps in their careers. In fact, most state licensing boards require that social workers earn their degrees through CSWE-accredited schools. Even in states that don’t mandate it, CSWE accreditation can make the licensure process simpler through its standardization of educational criteria. Employers may require or prefer their candidates to hold degrees from CSWE-accredited schools. 
Specifically, CSWE accreditation entails:

Parity regardless of delivery: CSWE-accredited schools offer programs that meet the same standards and criteria, regardless of their delivery in person or online.
Practical competency: CSWE-accredited schools have a proven track record of preparing their students to meet the practical challenges of professional social work practice.
Sound policy: CSWE-accredited schools pursue goals that reinforce the values of the social work profession.
Requisite curriculum: CSWE-accredited schools offer the courses necessary for students to receive adequate social work educations.
Qualified licensure: CSWE-accredited schools grant degrees mandated by most state licensing boards for social work licensure.
Proficient employment: CSWE-accredited schools grant degrees required or preferred by employers of social workers.

ABOUT THE CSWE

The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) is a non-profit association that is recognized by theCouncil for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) as the only accrediting body for Master of Social Work (MSW) programs in the United States. CSWE sets and maintains the national accreditation standards for MSW degree programs and all online MSW programs must meet the same standards as campus-based programs. For students who wish to pursue a career in social work, it is important to graduate from a CSWE approved program in order to pursue state licensing.



BE INFORMED

Please take a minute and read our disclaimers page as licensing requirements for social workers vary by state. Prospective students should check with their state’s social work licensing board and speak with an admissions counselor about state specific requirements before applying to a program.  Overall tuition costs are estimated based on the cost per credit hour multiplied by the number of credits needed to graduate. Tuition rates displayed on the site are not guaranteed and may not include university fees or other expenses. For the most up-to-date information, speak with an admission advisor for current tuition rates.



FOR STUDENTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

Academic Curriculum
The MSW@USC curriculum reflects the evolution of and innovations in the field of social work. The coursework explores emerging needs in the field to prepare a new kind of social worker who can meet the demands of 21st-century society. The MSW@USC features a rigorous curriculum that is the same as that of the on-campus program. Courses are delivered online and taught by our award-winning faculty.
The traditional program track is designed for students who hold an undergraduate degree in a discipline other than social work. The program can be completed on a full-time or part-time basis.
If you hold a Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) from an accredited institution, you are eligible to apply for the advanced standing program.
Structure and Emphasis
The school's departments house large, broad areas of interest. As an MSW@USC student, you will choose a specific department of study when you begin your classes:





Adult Mental Health and Wellness

Adults and Healthy Aging





Children, Youth and Families

Children, Youth and Families





Social Change and Innovation

Community, Organization and Business Innovation




You will begin your studies with a foundation in social work principles and practice and then build on that core knowledge to support your learning in one of the three departments. Your studies will be strengthened through field education.
The MSW curriculum explores content relevant to today's employers, expanding on the program's historic strengths while increasing emphasis on:

Early intervention, prevention and wellness
Leadership and effective collaboration
Implications of new findings in neuroscience
Core competencies (evidence-based practices, evidence-informed interventions)

Field Education
Hands-on experience is an integral part of any MSW curriculum. Throughout the program, you will spend more than 1,000 hours completing field education — online and offline. Learn more about field education.
Cross-Program Enrollment
MSW@USC students also have the opportunity to take courses from other online graduate programs delivered by top-tier colleges and universities. You can learn more about cross-university courses here.
