GLMD data by YCharts A key point to the investing thesis was an anticipated revaluation in shares as its global phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled study ARREST progresses. Evaluating once-daily oral drug Aramchol, the trial enrolled 240 NASH patients who are overweight and pre-diabetic or have type II diabetes. Data is anticipated in the second quarter of 2018. With earlier studies demonstrating effects on steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, I believed that the stock would eventually get more attention from Wall Street as the year progressed. Taking into account recent deal premiums and scarcity of wholly owned NASH assets, I stated I wouldn't be surprised for the company to be the subject of M&A speculation. Data Presentation Data was presented at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) during the International Liver Congress (ILC) in April. Efficacy of Aramchol was demonstrated in MCD NASH and TAA fibrosis models, with the latter showing a direct antifibrotic effect. Results indicated that Aramchol has a dual effect on fibrosis by improving fatty acid oxidation in addition to a direct impact on collagen producing cells, which in turn could actually reverse fibrosis.
 Other Developments A notable election to the board of directors was made when Dr. Carol Brosgart was chosen. She previously served as Vice President of Clinical Research at Gilead Sciences (GILD) and was instrumental in the launches of hepatitis B products. Also noteworthy, she was a member of the board of directors for Tobira Therapeutics for eight years until it was acquired by Allergan (AGN) in a $1.7-billion deal. First-quarter earnings revealed a net loss of $3.2 million along with a small cash balance of $11.7 million. I estimate the company has around three to four quarters of cash and a secondary offering could be imminent. Now that recruitment of the trial has ended, management has guided a quarterly cash burn of $2-2.5 million. On the conference call, it was mentioned that Aramchol could be a very unique NASH asset, one that has been shown to downregulate steatosis and has a direct effect on fibrosis. The asset could be used as a standalone treatment or in combination with anti-inflammatory treatments. Chief Scientific Officer Liat Hyardeny commented that we could see combination studies in the future. In comments on outcomes for the phase 2 ARREST study, Chief Medical Officer Tali Gorfine noted that a 20% reduction in steatosis would be significant. Of patients enrolled in the trial, 40% had stage three fibrosis at baseline, 20% with stage 2 fibrosis and 3% with stage zero fibrosis. This illustrates that the patient population enrolled has rather advanced disease and 70% had a NAS score of five or higher. Final Thoughts Earnings are coming on July 31st, so interested readers should stay tuned for further updates from management on study progression and any indications of progress in business development. I don't want to read too much into the appointment of Dr. Brosgart to the board of directors, but with prior experience at Tobira and Gilead I wouldn't be surprised to see her connections put to good use for a collaboration or acquisition. Tobira was acquired for a premium of over 498% - even a 200% premium for Galmed would be pocket change for the majority of interested parties to receive a NASH call option in the form of Aramchol.
 For readers who bought shares after the first article, I would take partial profits in the range of 15% to 30% depending on risk tolerance. This would allow significant upside exposure, as I believe we could continue to see a significant run-up into data. For those who have done their due diligence and are interested in the story, any potential weakness caused by a secondary offering in the near term could offer a potential buy point to establish a pilot position. Risks to the story include setbacks with the ARREST trial as well as the possibility of disappointing data. Additionally, as stated before the company's limited cash position is a concern and near-term dilution is expected. Intense competition in the NASH space is also a concern, as other assets exist that are further along in development and backed by companies with significantly more resources to invest in them. Author's note: My goal is to bring to readers' attention undervalued stocks with catalysts that could propel shares higher, as well as provide a fresh perspective on stocks you may already be aware of. I also touch on planning trades and risk management, as those are two areas I feel are often neglected.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

TEL AVIV, Israel, July 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq:   GLMD) ("Galmed"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases, announced today that it has entered into a Research, Option and License Agreement ("License Agreement") and a Share Purchase Agreement with One Way Liver Genomics S.L. ("OWL"), for the development of a non-invasive, blood-based companion diagnostic tool.  Under the License Agreement, Galmed and OWL will work together during Galmed's Phase IIb ARREST Study to develop a non-invasive blood test including metabolic markers biomarkers that could potentially predict therapeutic responses to AramcholTM, Galmed's once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, or NASH.  
The development of this proprietary non-invasive companion diagnostic for AramcholTM serves a dual purpose:

Commercializing a companion diagnostic for AramcholTM that could replace liver biopsy in testing the ongoing efficacy of treatment, which may enhance AramcholTM market penetration, 
Improving NASH patient selection for AramcholTM, including for Galmed's potential future Phase III study.

Under the terms of the License Agreement, OWL will develop a proprietary companion diagnostic exclusive for AramcholTM, which will be co-funded by Galmed up to €437,000 over the course of the ARREST Study and paid based on reaching development milestones.  Upon commercialization, OWL may earn 10% royalties on annual net sales of the companion diagnostic product.
Separately, under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, OWL stands to earn two milestone payments during the ARREST Study:  The first payment of €75,000 will be paid upon the successful completion of the ARREST Study's interim results expected during the first half of 2016; the second milestone payment of €100,000 will be paid upon the successful completion of the ARREST Study.  Through these two milestone payments, totaling €175,000, Galmed shall receive shares of OWL based on its most recent valuation.  Finally, OWL has granted Galmed an option to purchase additional shares up to 19.9% of OWL.
Building on several years of collaboration between Galmed and OWL, today's announcement further positions the companies as front-runners in the treatment and diagnosis of NASH, and other liver diseases.
"In order to diagnose and treat the vast number of NASH patients, it's imperative that Galmed takes a comprehensive approach.  It's critical that the medical and scientific community collaborate to find validated, non-invasive diagnostic tools.  It's clear that today's standard of care for the diagnosis of NASH – an invasive liver biopsy – will become obsolete over the coming years and will not serve as a suitable follow-up tool to determine the success of treatment.  Galmed is endeavoring to assume a leadership role in both the treatment and diagnosis of NASH," stated Allen Baharaff, Galmed's President and Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Baharaff continued, "The collaboration with OWL, one of the world's leading metabolomics companies, is an important milestone in our strategic development plan."
"Our team of liver research professionals are proud to be involved in the exciting and innovative clinical development of AramcholTM.  OWL recognizes the unique synergies that will be created with Galmed in the development of AramcholTM.  The studies that we will perform during the ARREST Study, will allow us to obtain a more advanced OWLiver® product, our non-invasive test to diagnose NASH and identify surrogate markers linked to AramcholTM response in patients suffering from NASH.  We believe that regulatory agencies will recognize the benefits of non-invasive approaches for the diagnosis of NASH," commented Pablo Ortiz, MD, PhD, OWL's Chief Executive Officer.
Mr. Baharaff and Dr. Ortiz concluded, "Today's partnership, which is the first step in the identification of biomarkers capable of predicting an individual's response to AramcholTM is critical to the development of personalized strategies that will optimize therapeutic outcomes."

Diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH – Galmed Pharmaceuticals         1.646.780.7605   info@galmedpharma.com         SubmitDiagnosis of NAFLD/NASHResearch & DevelopmentScientific BackgroundNAFLD / NASHDiagnosis of NAFLD/NASHManagement of NAFLD/NASHQuotes of Key Opinion LeadersTerminologyUseful LinksAramcholTreatment of NASHBasic Research and Clinical DataBackground InformationMechanism of ActionClinical DataPublicationsPostersScientific BackgroundDiagnosis of NAFLD/NASHInitial diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH is based on elevated levels of liver enzymes (serum aminotransferase levels) in blood tests. When further evaluation excludes other reasons for liver disease, such as medications, viral hepatitis, or excessive use of alcohol, non-invasive imaging tests such as ultrasound, CT and MRI are acceptable indicators of the presence of NAFLD/NASH, but not reliable in assessing the degree of inflammation and fibrosis, which would help professionals distinguish between NAFLD and NASH. Moreover, some of these tests exhibit high rates of false negatives, with up to 20% of NAFLD patients showing normal liver enzyme levels, and another 20% with normal liver imaging in ultrasound and CT tests.The “standard-of-care” used to diagnose NASH is a liver biopsy, which is the most reliable approach for identifying the degree of inflammation and fibrosis. However, the procedure-related mortality and morbidity, sample errors and costs limit its use to patients with a high index of suspicion of NASH (patients with metabolic syndrome and an indication of NAFLD by non-invasive diagnostic methods).Since awareness to NAFLD/NASH is on the rise, several new non-invasive methods for diagnosis have been developed, or are under development. Among those, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMRS) is a validated, non-invasive technique for in-vivo fat and metabolite quantification. NMRS is routinely used for measuring triglycerides and potentially other liver fat components, and is increasingly being used as an endpoint in clinical trials and observational studies.Lately, there has been a growing interest in the development of clinical prediction algorithms and biomarkers, such as NAFLD fibrosis score, Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) panel score and circulating biomarkers, such as CK-181.More recently, several non-invasive diagnostic kits have been introduced to the market, some of which are eligible for insurance reimbursement in certain jurisdictions. Two of those are:FibroMAXTM is a panel of patented biomarkers for estimation of levels of fibrosis (FibroTest®), NAFLD (SteatoTest®) and NASH (NashTest®). The panel combines markers of age and gender, total bilirubin, GGT, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1 and alpha2-macroglobulin, weight, height, total cholesterol, triglycerides, ALT, AST and fasting glucose.FibroScanTM is a sonography-based non-invasive test for liver fibrosis assessment. The scanner is designed to quantify liver fibrosis by means of elastography; based on changes of the physical properties of the liver during chronic liver injury. This technique has been evaluated most consistently in patients with chronic HCV disease2[1] Chalasani N, Younossi Z et al., “The diagnosis and management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guideline by the American Gastroenterological Association, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and American College of Gastroenterology“, Gastroenterology. 2012 Jun;142(7):1592-609[2] Bensamoun SF, Wang L, Robert L, et al.

The Fatty Acid–Bile Acid Conjugate Aramchol Reduces Liver Fat Content in Patients With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver DiseaseSafadi R, Konikoff FM, Mahamid M, Zelber-Sagi S, Halpern M, Gilat T, Oren R, and the FLORA GroupClin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2014 May 9, pii: S1542-3565(14)00673-9.AbstractBackground & aims: We investigated the effects of the fatty acid-bile acid conjugate 3β-arachidyl-amido, 7α-12α-dihydroxy, 5β-cholan-24-oic acid (Aramchol; Trima Israel Pharmaceutical Products Ltd, Maabarot, Israel) in a phase 2 trial of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Methods:  We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 60 patients with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD (6 with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) at 10 centers in Israel. Patients were given Aramchol (100 or 300 mg) or placebo once daily for 3 months (n = 20/group). The main end point was the difference between groups in the change in liver fat content according to magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The secondary end points focused on the differences between groups in alterations of liver enzyme levels, levels of adiponectin, homeostasis model assessment scores, and endothelial function.Results:   No serious or drug-related adverse events were observed in the 58 patients who completed the study. Over 3 months, liver fat content decreased by 12.57% ± 22.14% in patients given 300 mg/day Aramchol, but increased by 6.39% ± 36.27% in the placebo group (P = .02 for the difference between groups, adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index). Liver fat content decreased in the 100-mg Aramchol group, by 2.89% ± 28.22%, but this change was nonsignificant (P = .35), indicating a dose-response relationship (P for trend = .01). Groups given Aramchol had nonsignificant improvements over time in endothelial function and levels of alanine aminotransferase and adiponectin, but homeostasis model assessment scores did not change. The appropriateness of a single daily dose was confirmed by pharmacokinetic analysis.Conclusions:  Three months’ administration of the fatty acid-bile acid conjugate Aramchol is safe, tolerable, and significantly reduces liver fat content in patients with NAFLD. The reduction in liver fat content occurred in a dose-dependent manner and was associated with a trend of metabolic improvements, indicating that Aramchol might be used for the treatment of fatty liver disease.

Fatty acid bile acid conjugate inhibits hepatic stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase and is non-atherogenicLeikin-Frenkel A, Gonen A, Shaish A, Goldiner I, Leikin-Gobbi D, Konikoff FM, Harats D, Gilat T.Arch Med Res. 2010 Aug;41(6):397-404.AbstractBackground and aims:  Suppression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity leads to reduction of obesity, fatty liver as well as of insulin resistance. It was, however, recently reported to enhance atherogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether inhibition of SCD by Aramchol, a fatty acid bile conjugate with known hypocholesterolemic effects, will affect atherogenesis and how.Methods:  Aramchol was tested in vitro in cultured cells and in vivo in rodents.Results:   Aramchol, at very low concentrations, reduced SCD activity in liver microsomes of mice. Aramchol enhanced cholesterol efflux from macrophages more than twofold. In vivo it increased fecal sterol output and decreased markedly plasma cholesterol levels in mice. In ApoE(-/-), LDRL(-/-) and C57Bl6 mice, the effects of Aramchol on atherogenesis were non-atherogenic.Conclusions:  Aramchol reduces SCD activity and is non-atherogenic. It may offer a means to obtain the desirable hepatic metabolic effects of SCD inhibition without the deleterious atherogenic effect.Copyright © 2010 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.

An animal model for chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis and its prevention by the oral administration of fatty acid bile acid conjugateKeizman D, Maimon N, Ish-Shalom M, Buchbut D, Inbar M, Klein B, Bernheim J, Goldiner I, Leikin-Frenkel A, Konikoff F.Cancer. 2010 Jan 1;116(1):251-5.AbstractBackground: Preoperative chemotherapy for hepatic resection of colorectal liver metastases is associated with the development of chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis (CASH). This increases the risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. To the authors’ knowledge, an animal model for CASH has not been described previously. It has been established that fatty acid bile acid conjugates (FABACs) prevent the formation of diet-induced fatty liver. The current study was designed to establish an animal model of CASH and to use that model to study the effect of FABACs on its occurrence.Methods: C57BL/6 mice were given different doses of oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Oxaliplatin administered once weekly at a dose of 6 mg/kg for a total dose of 24 mg/kg was tolerated best and was associated most consistently with CASH. Thus, that dose was chosen as the induction model for CASH. Subsequently, mice were divided into a control group (no treatment), an oxaliplatin group, and a CASH-prevention group, which received oxaliplatin and C20-FABAC at a dose of 150 mg/kg daily. The animals were killed after 28 days.Results:  Liver fat content was significantly lower (P < .0001) in the control group (51.63 mg/g) and the prevention group (62.13 mg/g) compared with the oxaliplatin group (95.35 mg/g). This difference was mainly because of the accumulation of liver triglycerides in the oxaliplatin group.Conclusions:  The current results indicated that C57BL/6 mice receiving weekly oxaliplatin can be used as a model for CASH.

Treatment of preestablished diet-induced fatty liver by oral fatty acid-bile acid conjugates in rodentsLeikin-Frenkel A, Goldiner I, Leikin-Gobbi D, Rosenberg R, Bonen H, Litvak A, Bernheim J, Konikoff FM, Gilat T.Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2008 Dec;20(12):1205-13.AbstractBackground:  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in industrialized countries. It has no accepted medical therapy. Fatty acid-bile acid conjugates (FABACs) were proven to prevent diet-induced NAFLD in rodents.Aim:  This study was undertaken to test whether oral FABACs are also effective in reducing liver fat in preestablished diet-induced NAFLD.Methods:  NAFLD was induced in mice and rats by a high-fat diet and maintained by various proportions thereof. The FABACs used were conjugates of cholic acid with either arachidic or stearic acids.Results:  FABAC therapy reduced liver fat in all four series of experiments. The rapidity of the effect was inversely proportional to the concentration of fat in the maintenance diet. In mice on a 25% maintenance diet FABACs decreased total liver lipids by about 30% in 4 weeks (P<0.03). Diglycerides (P<0.003) and triglycerides (P<0.01) were the main neutral liver lipids that decreased during FABAC therapy. Both FABACs tested reduced liver fat in NAFLD at doses of 25 and 150 mg/kg/day. High-fat diet increased, whereas FABAC therapy decreased plasma 16 : 1/(16 : 0+16 : 1) fatty acid ratio – a marker of stearoyl CoA desaturase activity. In HepG2 cells FABACs decreased de-novo fatty acid synthesis dose dependently.Conclusions: Oral FABAC therapy decreased liver fat in preestablished NAFLD in mice and rats. Inhibition of stearoyl CoA desaturase activity and fatty acid synthesis are mechanisms that may contribute to this decrease. FABACs may be potential therapeutic agents for human NAFLD.5. Hypocholesterolemic effects of fatty acid bile acid conjugates (FABACs) in miceLeikin-Frenkel A, Parini P, Konikoff FM, Benthin L, Leikin-Gobbi D, Goldiner I, Einarsson C, Gilat T.Arch Biochem Biophys. 2008 Mar 1;471(1):63-71.AbstractFatty acid bile acid conjugates (FABACs) prevent and dissolve cholesterol gallstones and prevent diet induced fatty liver, in mice. The present studies aimed to test their hypocholesterolemic effects in mice. Gallstone susceptible (C57L/J) mice, on high fat (HFD) or regular diet (RD), were treated with the conjugate of cholic acid with arachidic acid (FABAC; Aramchol). FABAC reduced the elevated plasma cholesterol levels induced by the HFD. In C57L/J mice, FABAC reduced plasma cholesterol by 50% (p<0.001). In mice fed HFD, hepatic cholesterol synthesis was reduced, whereas CYP7A1 activity and expression were increased by FABAC. The ratio of fecal bile acids/neutral sterols was increased, as was the total fecal sterol excretion. In conclusion, FABACs markedly reduce elevated plasma cholesterol in mice by reducing the hepatic synthesis of cholesterol, in conjunction with an increase of its catabolism and excretion from the body.6. ABCA1-dependent but apoA-I-independent cholesterol efflux mediated by fatty acid-bile acid conjugates (FABACs)Goldiner I, van der Velde AE, Vandenberghe KE, van Wijland MA, Halpern Z, Gilat T, Konikoff FM, Veldman RJ, Groen AK.Biochem J. 2006 Jun 15;396(3):529-36AbstractFABACs (fatty acid-bile acid conjugates) are synthetic molecules that are designed to treat a range of lipid disorders. The compounds prevent cholesterol gallstone formation and diet-induced fatty liver, and increase reverse cholesterol transport in rodents. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of FABACs on cholesterol efflux in human cells. Aramchol (3beta-arachidylamido-7alpha,12alpha,5beta-cholan-24-oic acid) increased cholesterol efflux from human skin fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of known efflux mediators such as apoA-I (apolipoprotein A-I), but had little effect on phospholipid efflux. An LXR (liver X receptor) agonist strongly increased Aramchol-induced cholesterol efflux; however, in ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1)-deficient cells from Tangier disease patients, the Aramchol effect was absent, indicating that activity of ABCA1 was required. Aramchol did not affect ABCA1 expression, but plasma membrane levels of the transporter increased 2-fold. Aramchol is the first small molecule that induces ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux without affecting transcriptional control. These findings may explain the beneficial effect of the compound on atherosclerosis.7. Effects of fatty acid bile acid conjugates (FABACs) on biliary lithogenesis: potential consequences for non-surgical treatment of gallstonesKonikoff FM, Gilat T.Curr Drug Targets Immune Endocr Metabol Disord. 2005 Jun;5(2):171-5AbstractFatty acid bile acid conjugates (FABACs) are novel synthetic lipid molecules, which were designed for the treatment of cholesterol gallstones. The rationale was to combine a cholesterol solubilizing moiety (a saturated fatty acid) with a bile acid (cholic acid) as a vehicle to enable secretion into bile and entry into the enterohepatic circulation. An amide bond was used to provide stability against intestinal degradation. Initial in vitro studies showed that FABACs are indeed cholesterol solubilizers, able to prevent biliary cholesterol crystallization. Arachidyl-amido-cholanoic acid (Aramchol) was found to be the most potent FABAC in these studies. Animal studies revealed that Aramchol was absorbed after oral administration and could prevent cholesterol crystallization as well as dissolve preformed crystals in rodents fed a lithogenic diet. In gallstone susceptible mice, Aramchol prevented gallstone formation and dissolved gallstones. FABACs were found to be metabolically active substances, also able to decrease blood cholesterol, atherosclerotic plaques and fat accumulation in the liver in several animal species. The underlying mechanisms of action are under active investigation, and several effects, e.g. on cholesterol and bile salt metabolizing enzymes as well as cholesterol efflux from cells have been discovered. These findings are, however, only the beginning of our understanding of the metabolic actions as well as the potential of use of FABACs as therapeutic agents.8. Faecal sterol output is increased by arachidyl amido cholanoic acid (Aramchol) in ratsLeikin-Frenkel A, Weinbroum AA, Leikin-Gobbi D, Krupitzky L, Goldiner I, Shafat L, Gilat T, Konikoff FM.Biochem Soc Trans. 2004 Feb; 32(Pt 1):131-3.AbstractFatty acid-bile acid conjugates (FABACs) were shown recently to have important and multiple effects on cholesterol metabolism. In human fibroblasts, they were found to markedly enhance cholesterol efflux by an ATP-binding cassette transporter A1-dependent pathway. In C57L/J mice, they increased CYP7A1 activity and RNA expression, while decreasing moderately 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity. In C57L/J mice and in hamsters, they also decreased serum cholesterol levels, whereas in other animals, this effect was not seen in short-term experiments. In the present study, we investigated potential mechanisms of action of arachidyl amido cholanoic acid (Aramchol), with particular reference to biliary and faecal sterol outputs in rats. Supplementation with Aramchol at a dose of 150 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) increased neutral sterol output by approx. 50%, while the faecal outputs of bile salts and total sterols increased by almost 2-fold. Biliary lipid outputs were not significantly different between the control and FABAC-supplemented animals. These findings indicate an overall catabolic effect of FABACs on body cholesterol.9. Prevention of diet-induced fatty liver in experimental animals by the oral administration of a fatty acid bile acid conjugate (FABAC)Gilat T, Leikin-Frenkel A, Goldiner I, Juhel C, Lafont H, Gobbi D, Konikoff FM.Hepatology. 2003 Aug;38(2):436-42AbstractFatty acid bile acid conjugates (FABACs) are a new family of synthetic molecules designed to solubilize biliary cholesterol. They were shown to prevent and dissolve cholesterol gallstones in inbred C57L/J mice fed a lithogenic, high-fat diet (HFD). In these mice, fatty liver was observed in the controls but not in the FABAC-treated ones. The present study was designed to study the effect of FABAC (arachidyl-amido-cholanoic acid) on diet-induced fatty liver in rats, hamsters, and mice. The fatty liver score (on a scale of 0-4 by light microscopy) was 4.0 in control hamsters and 0.3 in the FABAC-fed hamsters (P <.001). In mice it was 1.5 and 0.4, respectively (P <.01). The lipid/protein ratio in the liver was 1.3 +/- 0.44 (mg lipid/mg protein) in control rats and 0.66 +/- 0.04 in the FABAC group (P =.001) after 14 days. In hamsters it was 1.41 +/- 0.27 and 1.11 +/- 0.20, respectively (P =.03), after 21 days. In Imperial Charles River (ICR) mice the ratio was 0.34 +/- 0.10 and 0.17 +/- 0.07 (P =.03), respectively, after 24 days. Liver fat concentration, measured as mg lipid/g liver tissue, decreased similarly by FABAC feeding. The decrease in liver fat affected mainly the triglyceride levels. FABAC-fed animals gained weight similarly to the controls. Triglyceride absorption was unaffected by FABAC supplementation. In conclusion, oral FABAC therapy prevents/reduces the development of fatty liver in animals consuming a HFD.10. Method for the quantitative assay of fatty acid-bile acid conjugates by tandem mass spectrometryGoldiner I, Overmars H, Groen AK, Kulik W.J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci. 2003 Sep 25 ;795(1):35-40AbstractFatty acid-bile acid conjugates and especially arachidyl amido cholic acid are synthetic molecules that were shown to prevent cholesterol gallstone formation in mice and hamsters as well as to dissolve pre-existing gallstones in mice. To measure these novel compounds we developed a liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry method based on the analysis of 100 microL of plasma with stearyl amido cholic acid (stamchol, 1.5 microM/L) added as internal standard. Repeatable calibrations between 0 and 50 microM/L exhibited consistent linearity and reproducibility. Inter- and intraassay C.V.s were 5.3-11.4% and 2.6-6.4%, respectively, at targeted concentrations of 0.1, 2.3 and 50 microM/L.11. Biliary and systemic effects of fatty acid bile acid conjugatesKonikoff FM, Leikin-Frenkel A, Goldiner I, Michowitz M, Brezowski E, Harats D, Gilat T.Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2003 Jun;15(6):649-55.Background:  Fatty acid bile acid conjugates (FABACs) are novel synthetic molecules that solubilize cholesterol, prevent cholesterol crystal and gallstone formation, and dissolve pre-existing gallstones in mice. They are thus potential agents for gallstone prevention and treatment. The available knowledge concerning their biliary, systemic or possible toxic effects is, however, incomplete.Aim:  To obtain information regarding biliary and systemic effects of FABACs.Methods:  Hamsters, rats and mice were administered C20-FABAC intragastrically, and serum and bile chemistries, organ histology, animal wellbeing, and survival were monitored.Results:   FABAC feeding (150 mg/kg/day) caused no adverse effects in any of the animal species studied. FABAC did not influence biliary cholesterol, phospholipid, or bile-salt concentrations in mice. In hamsters, biliary cholesterol concentration decreased slightly, but effects on phospholipids and bile salts were inconsistent. In some mouse strains, FABAC supplementation increased transaminases slightly. In hamsters and rats, transaminases were mainly unaffected or even decreased. Serum alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, albumin and glucose were generally unaffected by FABAC feeding. No gross or histopathological differences between controls and FABAC-fed animals were noted in any of the organs investigated.Conclusions:  C20-FABAC given at a pharmacological dose is safe and devoid of any significant toxic effects in three different animal species.12. Fatty acid bile acid conjugates inhibit atherosclerosis in the C57BL/6 mouse modelGonen A, Shaish A, Leikin-Frenkel A, Gilat T, Harats D.Pathobiology. 2002-2003;70(4):215-8.AbstractObjective:  The aim of the current research was to study whether fatty acid bile acid conjugates (FABACs) have a beneficial effect on atherosclerosis progression and blood lipid levels in mice.Methods:  C57BL/6 female mice, fed a high-fat Paigen diet, were administered an oral dose of FABAC or DDH2O daily. Quantification of atherosclerotic fatty-streak lesions at the aortic sinus was performed.Results:    The FABAC-treated mice showed a significant reduction in the atherosclerotic lesion areas as compared to the control group (p = 0.019). A significant elevation in total cholesterol levels was observed in both the FABAC and control groups. Higher FABAC levels were measured in the high-density lipoprotein fraction as compared to the very-low-density and low-density lipoprotein fractions.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that FABACs, given orally, reduce the development of atherosclerosis in mice fed a high-fat high-cholesterol diet, despite a lack of effect on plasma lipid levels.Copyright 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel13. Dissolution of cholesterol gallstones in mice by the oral administration of a fatty acid bile acid conjugateGilat T, Leikin-Frenkel A, Goldiner I, Halpern Z, Konikoff FM.Hepatology. 2002 Mar;35(3):597-600AbstractGallstones, mostly cholesterol stones, affect some 15% of the population. Oral bile salts dissolve human cholesterol gallstones, but with low efficacy, and surgery remains the main therapeutic option. Fatty acid bile acid conjugates (FABACs) were shown to prevent formation of cholesterol gallstones in experimental animals. The aim of this study was to test whether these compounds could dissolve preexisting cholesterol gallstones via oral administration. Inbred, gallstone-susceptible C57J/L mice were given a lithogenic diet for 2 months, and the presence of gallstones was ascertained. The mice were then switched to a regular diet while part of them were given in addition C20-FABAC, by gavage, at a dose of 0.5 or 3 mg per animal per day. All mice tested had cholesterol gallstones after 2 months on the lithogenic diet. In study I, after 2 months on the regular diet, 3 of 4 (75%) of the controls had gallstones, whereas none of the 6 FABAC-fed animals (3 mg/d) had stones (P =.033). In study II, evaluating 2 FABAC doses, after 2 months on the regular diet, 8 of 8 (100%) of the controls had gallstones, which were found in 2 of 7 (28%) and 1 of 8 (12%) of the mice supplemented with 0.5 mg/d (P =.007) or 3 mg/d (P =.001) FABAC, respectively. On a molar basis, the dose of 0.5 mg FABAC is equivalent to 14 mg/kg/d of a bile acid. In conclusion, FABACs given orally can dissolve preexisting cholesterol gallstones in mice. This was accomplished with a dose of FABAC equivalent to the dose of bile acids used in human gallstone dissolution.14. Arachidyl amido cholanoic acid (Aramchol) is a cholesterol solubilizer and prevents the formation of cholesterol gallstones in inbred miceGilat T, Leikin-Frenkel A, Goldiner L, Laufer H, Halpern Z, Konikoff FM.Lipids. 2001 Oct;36(10):1135-40.AbstractWe have recently synthesized fatty acid bile acid conjugates (FABAC) that were able to reduce and retard cholesterol crystallization in model and human biles. When given orally, they prevented the formation of cholesterol crystals in the bile of hamsters. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the FABAC are cholesterol solubilizers, whether they can dissolve pre-existing crystals, whether they can prevent the formation of cholesterol gallstones, and to investigate the optimal type of bond between the fatty acid and bile acid. The presence of cholesterol crystals was determined by light microscopy, and the total crystal mass of precipitated crystals was measured by chemical means. Inbred (C57J/L) mice on a lithogenic diet were used to evaluate cholesterol crystal formation, dissolution, and gallstone formation in vivo. Arachidyl amido cholanoic acid (Aramchol) was the FABAC used in the present experiments. At equimolar amounts, the cholesterol-solubilizing capacity of Aramchol was higher than that of taurocholate and similar to that of phosphatidylcholine. The addition of Aramchol dissolved approximately 50% of pre-existing crystals in model bile solutions. The same phenomenon was demonstrated in human bile ex vivo, with a dose-response effect. All inbred mice developed cholesterol crystals in bile after 10-14 d on the lithogenic diet. Thereafter, supplementation of the diet with Aramchol progressively reduced the proportion of mice with crystals to 25% after 28 d. On the lithogenic diet, 100% of inbred mice developed cholesterol gallstones in the gallbladder by day 21. None of the mice whose diet was supplemented with 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg of Aramchol/d developed stones or crystals. FABAC are a new class of molecules that are cholesterol solubilizers and which are able to dissolve cholesterol crystals in bile. Upon oral administration, they dissolve pre-existing cholesterol crystals and prevent the formation of gallstones in gallstone-susceptible mice.15. Fatty acid bile acid conjugates (FABACs)–new molecules for the prevention of cholesterol crystallisation in bileGilat T, Somjen GJ, Mazur Y, Leikin-Frenkel A, Rosenberg R, Halpern Z, Konikoff F.Gut. 2001 Jan;48(1):75-9.AbstractBackground:  Cholesterol gall stones are a frequent disease for which at present surgery is the usual therapy. Despite the importance of bile acids it has become evident that phospholipids are the main cholesterol solubilisers in bile. Even phospholipid components, such as fatty acids, have anticrystallising activity.Aim: To synthesise fatty acid bile acid conjugates (FABACs) and study their effects on cholesterol crystallisation in bile in vitro and in vivo.Methods:  FABACs were prepared by conjugation of cholic acid at position 3 with saturated fatty acids of variable chain length using an amide bond. Cholesterol crystallisation and its kinetics (crystal observation time, crystal mass) were studied in model bile, pooled enriched human bile, and fresh human bile using FABACs with saturated fatty acids of varying chain length (C-6 to C-22). Absorption of FABACs into blood and bile was tested in hamsters. Prevention of biliary cholesterol crystallisation in vivo was tested in hamsters and inbred mice.Results:  FABACs strongly inhibited cholesterol crystallisation in model as well as native bile. The FABACs with longer acyl chains (C-16 to C-22) were more effective. At a concentration of 5 mM, FABACs almost completely inhibited cholesterol crystallisation in fresh human bile for 21 days. FABACs were absorbed and found in both portal and heart blood of hamsters. Levels in bile were 2-3 times higher than in blood, indicating active secretion. Appreciable levels were found in the systemic circulation 24-48 hours after a single administration. Ingested FABACs completely prevented the formation of cholesterol crystals in the gall bladders of hamsters and mice fed a lithogenic diet.Conclusions:  FABACs are potent inhibitors of cholesterol crystallisation in bile. They are absorbed and secreted into bile and prevent the earliest step of cholesterol gall stone formation in animals. These compounds may be of potential use in cholesterol gall stone disease in humans.Copyright © 2016 Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - All Rights ReservedAccessibilityTerms Of UsePrivacy PolicyContact Us

Terminology – Galmed Pharmaceuticals         1.646.780.7605   info@galmedpharma.com         SubmitTerminologyResearch & DevelopmentScientific BackgroundNAFLD / NASHDiagnosis of NAFLD/NASHManagement of NAFLD/NASHQuotes of Key Opinion LeadersTerminologyUseful LinksAramcholTreatment of NASHBasic Research and Clinical DataBackground InformationMechanism of ActionClinical DataPublicationsPostersScientific BackgroundTerminologyAlanine aminotransferase (ALT): A transaminase enzyme, found predominantly in the liver. ALT is commonly measured in blood as a part of a diagnostic evaluation of liver function tests to determine liver health. It is measured in international units/liter (IU/L). Normal values for female patients range within 5-38 IU/L; while for male patients normal values range within 10-50 IU/L1.Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): AST catalyzes the reversible transfer of an α-amino group between aspartate and glutamate and, as such, is an important enzyme in amino acid metabolism. AST is found in the liver, heart, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, and red blood cells and may be elevated in diseases of these organs. AST is commonly measured in blood as a marker for liver health. Normal values for patients range within 6-40 IU/L2.Body mass index (BMI): A measure for human body mass based on an individual’s weight and height (BMI= weight (KG)/[height(m)]2). BMI provides a simple numeric measure of a person’s thickness or thinness, allowing health professionals to discuss overweight and underweight problems more objectively with their patients. Normal BMI values for adults range from 18 to 25, where lower BMI values are considered underweight and higher BMI values are considered overweight (25-30) or obese (30-40) or morbidly obese (>40).Liver cirrhosis: A condition of irreversible scarring of the liver, the end result of chronic liver damage caused by chronic liver diseases. Once cirrhosis develops, it is not possible to heal the liver or return its function to normal. It is a serious condition that can lead to severe complications, including liver transplantation or death.Liver fibrosis: A scarring process – the formation of excess fibrous connective tissue – in response to injury. Fibrosis is not an independent disease but rather a histological change caused by liver inflammation.Insulin resistance: A pathological condition in which cells fail to respond to the normal actions of the hormone insulin. Insulin resistance is associated with metabolic syndrome and can lead to type 2 diabetes.Metabolic Syndrome: A name for a group of risk factors that occur together and increase the risk for coronary artery disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by having three or more of the following symptoms: high blood pressure, high fasting glucose levels, abdominal obesity; low HDL value; high Triglyceride value.NAFLD Activity Score (NAS): An ordinal scoring system of pathological findings in liver biopsy that was developed as a tool to measure changes in NAFLD activity during therapeutic trials. NAS is defined as an unweighted sum of scores for steatosis (0–3), lobular inflammation (0–3), and ballooning (0–2), where a higher score reflects more active disease. Some studies have used threshold values of the NAS, specifically NAS ≥5, as a surrogate for the histologic diagnosis of NASH. Because of the issues relating to time course for a clinical trial, fibrosis was not included in the score. The NAS score is not intended to be used as a tool to diagnose NASH.Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D or T2DM): Also known as adult-onset diabetes, T2DM is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood glucose as the result of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Onset of type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented through proper nutrition and regular exercise.[1] http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=295305283&linkID=908&cook=yes[2] http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=322240579Copyright © 2016 Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. - All Rights ReservedAccessibilityTerms Of UsePrivacy PolicyContact Us
