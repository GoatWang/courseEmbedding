Brian Halla



Interview
      with Brian Halla 
  May 2, 1006 
Santa Clara, California 
RW: Brian Halla served in a number of positions at Control
  Data and Intel before joining LSI Logic as Executive Vice President of the
  product group. In May, 1996, he joined National Semiconductor as President
  and CEO. Up until that time, he'd been involved almost exclusively with digital
  products. In this 2006 interview, Brian describes the many positives associated
with the less glamorous but more profitable analog semiconductors. 
  
RW: Tell us about growing up, your family, siblings - tell
  us about that. 
  
BH: Yeah, I grew up in Fort Dodge, Iowa with three brothers
  and a sister and my dad was the resident FBI agent for thirteen some counties
  in the Midwest. And went to school at the University of Nebraska . Squeezed
  in a four year EE course into five. And started my first job at Control Data
  Corporation. I've had to have had the most fabulous career anybody could ever
  want. Control Data was time spent helping get the CDC 6600's into NASA so they
  could put a man on the moon. And we all watched that first footstep and - 
  
RW: And that used discreet transistors. They're not - 
  
BH: The transistors actually - those first mainframes used
  ferrite core magnets for the memories. And then these three young guys from
  Fairchild came along and integrated a bunch of transistors to create the first
  thousand one thousand bit DRAM. But my second gig is going to Intel in 1975
  from Control Data which, of course, no longer exists, which was really kind
  of a government house, to Intel was the difference between night and day. It
  was everybody constantly bouncing off walls. The company was just a little
  tiny company then. And there's so much electricity all the time - all the time.
  And my first week on the Bob Noyce and Grove and Moore invited me to have lunch
  with them in a conference room. And I thought this is just unbelievable - unbelievable.
  But, you know, Intel was an experience I'll never forget. I spent fourteen
  years there. But it was always at general quarters. And that was just the way
  Andy ran the company. And people used to say if times were supposed to be good,
  how come it feels so bad? But obviously it got the desired results. And then
  1988, moved over to LSI Logic to get the company in the microprocessor business.
  Met Rob Walker on the first day I think. And, you know, there was kind of,
  you know, if CDC was the man on the moon and Intel was the microprocessor businesses
  and being part of the starting of the PC era, LSI Logic was the system on a
  chip days and helping Sony come out with the Sony Play Station. And LSI during
  the early nineties was, I think two years in a row, the best performing stock
  in the New York Stock Exchange thanks to the Sony Play Station and Sun Microsystems
  and a couple of other little companies like that. Came over to National in
  1996 with an intention of staying here for a couple of years. And as of today,
  I believe, I'm celebrating my ten year anniversary. So that means it was eighteen
  years ago that you and I first met. Times fun when you're having flies. 
  
RW: Well why go into engineering? What led you to that? 
  
BH: You know, we ask all of our engineers that because there's,
  as you know in the United States , there's a shortage of engineers, a shortage
  of math and science graduates. My first interest was when I got a shrink-wrapped
  transistor radio that plugged it all together and listened to that little ear
  piece and, sure enough, there was a voice. Lot of people said they got into
  engineering because of their first Heath kit or whatever. But - so it was really
  that first transistor radio. And I must also confess that trying to pick what
  course of study I would take in college was influenced by a Time  magazine
  that came out while I was a senior in high school. And it had all of the starting
  salaries of graduates. So I went down the right hand column to the biggest
  number and then read over and it said electrical engineering. And out of twenty-three
  pledge brothers that all started in EE that year, I was the only one that made
  it all the way through. And I'm glad I did. 
  
RW: Took an extra year. 
  
BH: Yeah, took that fifth year. 
  
RW: Yes. So did it take me and this was before the asians
  arrived in - en masse. It would take a little longer now. 
  
BH: Yeah. 
  
RW: Like forever. Well you - you started out as really a
  digital guy. And computers and Intel and so on. And - and similarly at LSI
  Logic. That was essentially all digital except for that screwy English deal
  where they were going to build analog and they never did. That - but now you've
  converted over. That - you're kind of an analog. 
  
BH: You know, actually at LSI when we were putting systems
  on a chip, we had one analog guy in the product group. And this guy was - he
  was stranger than everybody else. You know, the only thing kind of normal about
  him was he was his daughter's volleyball coach and so I'd run into him at volleyball
  games. But he wanted to leave the company and go back to the Midwest . He was
  the only analog engineer we had. And so we decided that, you know, you go through
  a crisis like losing a guy who's vital to it that - that time he was working
  on LVDS and which was, of course, invented at National. And you realize what
  a crisis it is to lose the analog part of the business. So we had, at that
  time Wilf had a rec freeze but we had an opening for thirty analog engineers.
  And then all of a sudden, the CEO Job at National which invented the analog
  industry comes open and it was a no brainer that - that analog had come to
  life again, even though the magic of digital killed it for a couple decades.
  Luckily nobody told National so we retained about seven hundred in the best
  and brightest analog engineers on the face of the earth. And now we're turning
  in the results. 
  
RW: Well how about the group that left and founded Linear?
  They've done well. 
  
BH: They've done extremely well. And Maxim as well. And the
  other one is ADI which started out in the East Coast. All analog companies,
  all doing extremely well. It's a relatively low capital business. You don't
  need state-of-the-art fabs. You know, Rob, if you think back on the nature
  of this business, I'm sure you've heard Gordon Moore in his speeches say �this
  is the only industry that has made the price performance gains that we've made,
  Moore's law, etc. - that if any other industry was as responsive to price performance
  gains and innovation, today you could buy a Rolls Royce for a quarter, drive
  it downtown and throw it away�. That would be the equivalent price performance
  improvements. And if you think about it - if you think about in the history
  of our industry, we have had this huge capital expense to build a fab, whether
  - whatever generation it is - as you know 300 millimeter fabs now are upwards
  of two billion dollars. So the corresponding message that goes to the field
  sales force is the little tiny things that come out of that fab have got to
  fill up the fab. So the mantra "Fill the fab". In fact, at Intel,
  there was a period of time where even Intel which now is one of the only companies
  - one of the few companies that can get paid for what they do - their mantra
  used to be "fill the f�ing fab", FTFF. And Gordon Moore, in all of
  his class, changed that to "fill the facilitized fab". And even Intel
  was driven by the need to fill the fab. And so when you're in that position
  and the customer's got multiple choices, there is no such thing as value pricing.
  And in the analog business and the companies that we just mentioned, Maxim,
  LTC, ADI and National Semiconductor, you don't need to fill the fabs. I mean,
  the fabs are fully depreciated for the most part. It's a matter of putting
  into those fabs products with the right margins, right ASP's and, you know,
  that's a matter of product definition and education of the sales force, and
  the customer. And it's a much better business. 
  
RW: Yeah. Or putting it in another way, it's not such a crazy
  business as the digital world. I wonder if , for example, at LSI Logic and
  whether we had positive retained earnings over our lifetime. I've never gone
  back and looked at the numbers. 
  
BH: Yeah, I think a couple of the companies were pretty close.
  You know, the thing about digital - if you think about this - analog - I mean,
  Bob Widlar invented the industry back in - thirty-five years ago or something.
  But this digital thing all came about as the magic of Intel and magic of the
  microprocessor and the PC and so for two whole decades, the universities all
  shut down any of their analog curriculum. Only Georgia Tech kept an analog
  curriculum alive. All the others shut it down. In fact, National donated about
  a three million dollar lab to Berkeley many, many years ago and it's got a
  beautiful plaque outside that says the National Semiconductor Analog Fab or
  Analog Lab - for the first two years they taught a digital course in that lab.
  So what happens is that there's no Synopsis equivalent synthesis. There's no
  Cadence floor planning equivalent. There's no CAD tools that help the designers.
  And so analog design is still considered a black art. So it goes around in
  the minds of the people - the design engineers. And that is incredibly valuable
  and takes a lot of the craziness out of the business. In digital, quite frankly,
  when you've got all these tools and you've got all of these graduates still
  coming out of the universities that want to be digital designers, you know,
  they come out, they're small fish in a giant pond. And with analog, there's
  still a limitation on the number of overall engineers shared by those four
  companies and then to a lesser extent by companies like Texas Instrument. 
  
RW: Well the, of course, there's the Japanese companies.
  And they do a lot of consumer work in analog. 
  
BH: Yeah, the Japanese - the Japanese are best serving as
  a role model for the Chinese because they took such a good run at the industry.
  And, you know, I came to the SIA in this job, the Semiconductor Industry Association,
  as this brash, young guy that, you know, was sure I could do it better than
  the forefathers, the founders of this industry. And the first thing I found
  out is that these guys were all heroes, Charlie Sporck and Gordon Moore and
  Wilf Corrigan, that what they did vis-à-vis the Japanese, was truly
  heroic in stopping them and forcing the anti-dumping laws, the 301 trade legislation.
  I had a role to play in that as well. I was at Intel at the time and had been
  a sales training for Hamilton/Avnet it was called in those days. And somehow
  one of the sales guys got a foil from Hitachi and the foil said don't stop
  bidding until you've won the business. If Intel undercuts you, go ten percent
  below them. If they undercut you again, go another ten percent. And it was
  written - that foil was done by a guy that used to work for me at Intel. And
  I recognized it right away and so I was the go between. I passed it onto the
  executives and they decided that - that this was very serious. And that kind
  of led to all the dumping thing. But the fight that the founders of the Semiconductor
  Industry Association put up at that time twenty-five years ago was truly, truly
  heroic. 
  
RW: Which, in many other industries, we didn't do - television
  - 
  
BH: Television, and the automobile. And, you know, that was
  - that was really the - the kind of vision is if you want to have happen to
  the semiconductor industry what happened to the television industry, you know,
  don't support us. Now having said that, Rob, here's where we are today. The
  Chinese have learned from the best and the worst of all of these would-be,
  want-to-be, countries that - that want to get what the United States has. Japan
  was the first. Korea , Taiwan followed. What's the difference? The difference
  is Japan is a very tiny set of islands. They ran out of people very quickly.
  Their cost of wages very quickly exceeded the United States . So they were
  no longer the low cost manufacturing entity. And, you know, there's other things
  that China has learned from the success of our industry here in the United
  States . One of those things, Rob, is stock options. They know they work. Stock
  options created this industry along with the other - the other kinds of things
  that we did to - to get the industry going. So in China , the stock option
  is very lucrative. Strike prices at par value and no capital gains tax on exercise.
  And what are we doing here in this country? We're eliminating stock options.
  You know, stock option expensing is just a fancy French word which means eradication
  over time. And, you know, the other thing that the Chinese have learned is
  the importance of education of these undergraduate engineers. So they would
  send them and - in shiploads over to Stanford and Berkeley and MIT to get the
  best education on the face of the earth. And now in our infinite wisdom, we're
  sending them home, �visa denied�. You know, with the capital and H-1B visas.
  And I always - I always say - Andy Grove was always kind of a hero of mine
  - working for him for fourteen years and a true mentor and if you think about
  it, Andy came over here as an immigrant - was a refugee, got himself into the
  position with a lot of hard work and Intel, over the years, has probably -
  and by the way, I always say that Andy could have been equally successful in
  the screen door business. But, over the years, he took that company to the
  point of creation of the microprocessor and the PC business. PC business got
  us the internet. The internet got us the search engines and the buying engines
  and how many hundreds of thousands of jobs have been created by a guy, Andy
  Grove, who today we'd say go home Andy, �visa denied�? And, you know, that's
  just another one. That's - so the SIA today, our primary role is to spend a
  lot of time in Washington and try to convince our politicians that we run the
  risk of losing the technology lead. And I call it a perfect storm of technology
  neglect. It's not only H-1B visas, stock options - it's substantially reduced
  funding of the National Science Foundation. DARPA now has an eighteen month
  time horizon where they need to get payback and so they put less and less of
  their money in the university system and more and more into the Raytheon's
  and Lockheed's of the world where they can get a payback. This little entity
  that got us the transistor back in 1947 that Noyce and Grove and Moore - 
  
RW: Bell Labs. 
  
BH: Bell Labs, you know, very unsuccessful entity. Right?
  One out of twenty projects is successful. But what were they? The laser and
  the transistor, surround sound, UNIX. I mean, you name it. And it's been incredibly
  important. Well Bell Labs had a source of funding from the telephone calls
  of AT&T at - I think penny per call or something that was such a gift to
  the rest of the world. Well Bell Labs now is a tiny fraction of itself and
  so is Stanford Research and so is Xerox PARC. And so the basic research now
  has to come out of the universities and that means additional funding from
  the United States government. One time in the history of our country that nobody
  remembers anymore except a few of us, 1957 where there was no question in anybody's
  mind that we had fallen behind in the technology race and that was when Sputnik
  went up. And, you know, there I was in Fort Dodge , Iowa . The whole family
  came out and all the neighbors were out and we had a blanket on the front lawn
  and a bowl of popcorn and 7-Up in bottles in those days. And, you know, you
  could hear the tittering conversation up and down the streets. And one lady
  says there it goes. And somebody else says no, that's just a shooting star.
  And - and you could smell the cigar smoke from the guy across the street. Anyway,
  then Sputnik went over and it was like the whole block went quiet because if
  you recall, in those days, certainly not in my neighborhood, but in some backyards
  in Fort Dodge, Iowa, people had bomb shelters because of the Cold War. And
  here was a satellite going overhead with a payload big enough to carry a missile
  right over the top of our houses. So Eisenhower had no problem throwing a billion
  dollars, which was a lot of money in 1957, at the space race. And he also created
  the National Defense Education Act to spur interest in math and science. Sound
  familiar doesn't it? Well the space race caused the mainframe race. So mainframes
  had to get faster and faster. That got them hotter and hotter. And Noyce and
  Grove and Moore used that transistor to create the DRAM to replace the ferrite
  core magnets in the back of mainframes. That created the semiconductor industry.
  And meanwhile, DARPA took all these mainframes now and tried to wire them together
  and that, with the help of the University of Illinois and Mosaic, became the
  internet. And Google and E-bay and Yahoo and the dot com companies that are
  now becoming very successful. And so it was that important realizing we were
  behind in those days, it was that important for the government to step in and
  fund some spending in that area. And look at the payback we got as a nation.
  We're there again. We're on the verge of losing this technology lead and because
  of this perfect storm of technology neglect. 
  
RW: Yeah. Well Silicon Valley has been a place of innovation
  for a long time. What do you attribute that success to? 
  
BH: Well certainly these founding industries - I mean, you
  start with Hewlett-Packard, right, and this whole garage shop approach to changing
  the world. And, you know, the - the energy that Intel had, but underlying all
  that and it's incredibly important not to forget the importance of venture
  capital in really getting us going. And now we've become Silicon Valley . What
  I would call and I heard Bill Gates use this term we're the IQ magnet of the
  world still. The really smart people want to be here. This is where it's going
  to happen. This is where the chances are best that you're going to surround
  yourself with a whole bunch of other really smart, high IQ people. And so I
  think we've still got that going for us. And it's one of the reasons, by the
  way, that when the best and the brightest do come from these other nations
  to get their shiny new degree or the PhD, that they stay here. And so it's
  vitally important that we let them stay here and that we do get rid of this
  cap on H-1B visas. I think it's the IQ magnet of the world still. 
  
RW: Well I was born here. So that's probably the only way
  I got in. 
  
BH: Yeah. But, I mean, look how - look how many other states
  and countries have tried to duplicate this thing, never coming close to what's
  happened here in the Valley. And it's phenomenal. 
  
RW: Well I see you've got a few photographs and so on. I
  wonder if we could go and take a look at those on your back wall and explain
  what those are? 
  
BH: Sure. Well inherited the Chairmanship of the SIA this
  year. And, you know, my primary motivation for the year is that we not lose
  the technology lead on my watch. That's why I've been spending time in Washington
  doing what I consider to be one of the most distasteful things you can do which
  is spend your time with the politicians. This is a picture of Gordon Moore
  who was absolutely one of the classiest guys in the industry and clearly responsible
  for so much of what we see around us. And I'm holding up a fish here. This
  was out on Gordon's boat. We went out to the Farallones, Dave House, myself
  and a few of the other Intel guys. And so, you know, the boat was rocking and
  I went flying into Dave House and he threw his pole and everything over the
  side and it was a four hundred dollar set of equipment. Gordon says no problem,
  I got more downstairs. And he goes down and on the way back, Gordon cleaned
  everybody's fish and then took everybody's picture with their fish. And it
  was like the - the grandfather that everybody wished they'd a had is Gordon
  Moore, just the coolest guy and classiest guy in the world. So this is a favorite.
  I thought - hey LuAnn, is there another Nebraska one over there like with me
  and Eric Crouch, the Heisman Trophy winner? Anyway, this is Frank Solich who
  is the coach of University of Nebraska , which is I still have season tickets
  and go back for one game a year. This is another classy guy, the governor of
  Maine , Angus King, who was really responsible for keeping National Semiconductor
  and for us putting Fairchild back into Maine . He was just incredibly tech
  savvy. Here's an interesting guy. Also a major supporter of the industry and
  shifted gears when he created the fabless semiconductor industry by putting
  up the first foundry. And that was TSMC. 
  
RW: Morris Chang. 
  
BH: Morris Chang, absolutely. Very vital to the industry.
  He's kind of low keyed now. I think he's retired from TSMC. Let's see. What
  else do we have? We've rung the bell several times at the New York Stock Exchange.
  National Semiconductor's a New York Stock Exchange Company. Here's a eight-year
  favorite of mine, Wilf Corrigan. Another one of the tough guys, founders of
  the industry and the Semiconductor Industry Association and one of the guys
  that fought the hardest to keep this industry on our shores when the Japanese
  wanted it the other way. And then we have George Bush. This happens to be at
  an event when George Bush was trying to solve the energy crisis for the United
  States . And at the time, National was in the information appliance business
  and we were touting thin clients. And so I was explaining to him how thin clients
  work and how it saves energy because you have all the energy spent somewhere
  where there's a server farm and you put the server farm next to a raging river
  where you can get cheap energy. You don't have to have it here in Silicon Valley
  . This was - at this - at this event, there was about five companies demonstrating
  around the room and he understood what I was talking about. He went to the
  next booth and they did this thing and President Bush goes (whew) right over
  my head. He says just a second. And he says Bob, and he calls for his - he
  says this is electric Bob over here. He says come on over electric Bob. And
  he turns to me, he says his real name's Bill but I didn't want to yell electric
  bill here in California . Anyway a lot of memories, a lot of tough guys. And
  I enjoy looking at these pictures. I got another wall full of pictures over
  here and - 
  
RW: Well we've changed the world, haven't we? I mean, the
  world we live in now is different than the world when we were kids. 
  
BH: Absolutely. And it - and it's - 
  
RW: Mostly for the best. 
  
BH: And it's changing exponentially better. Now, you know,
  if you think back on the cycles of the industry, the first one was that DRAM
  cycle where all the semiconductor companies, there was only a handful of them,
  threw everything they had at creating DRAM because that was the hot market.
  Right? That was, you know, replacing all the ferrite core magnets in mainframes.
  And, of course, we overbuilt and we went over the cliff and that was the first
  cycle. The industry only got up to five billion sales out in those days but
  we thought that was a lot of money. And then the PC boom back in the - in the
  late seventies, early eighties, all the semiconductor companies diverted all
  their capacity building PC kits and, of course, we overbuilt there too but
  we only got the industry then up to twenty-five billion. We thought never get
  any higher. Boom! Next - the next downturn in the second cycle. The third one
  was the connected PC boom now also with the cell phone. And we got the industry
  up to two hundred and four billion dollars in sales out in that internet and
  cell phone. And, of course, we overbuilt. We overbuilt infrastructure chips
  and everything else. Now we're on the upward slope of the cycle that followed
  the dot com boom, bubble burst. Different this time. All of those other cycles
  were caused by one killer application, whether it's mainframe, DRAM, PC kits,
  the internet and the cell phone. Now if you look at what's driving the industry,
  it's PDA's, it's MP3 players, it's digital TV's, it's PVR's, it's these things
  that show up under a Christmas tree or driving demand for industry and guess
  what? We now have the industry on a run rate basis at two hundred and fifty
  billion and we still haven't seen the next killer app in the IT space. Microsoft
  still hasn't released Longhorn. And yet somehow demand is going crazy. It's
  being driven by this wide diversity of two to four hundred dollar products.
  So the question I'd ask is how do you stimulate the next downturn when there
  is no one obvious place to build a pile of inventory? So I'd say it bodes pretty
  well for our industry and the future looks fairly bright. 
  
RW: All right. Well thank you. 
  
BH: Thank you, Rob.

 National Semiconductor CEO Brian Halla Discusses Role of Electronics in World's Initiatives to 'Go Green' 
 Wed, 11/18/2009 - 5:56am 
 Comments 
 by  

 




Oct. 29, 2009 - Brian L. Halla,
chairman and CEO of National Semiconductor Corp., today addressed
the role of electronics in creating more energy-efficient systems,
optimizing renewable energy sources and enabling smarter energy
storage systems.  He delivered his comments in a keynote
speech, "A World Racing to Be Green," at the Nikkei Green
Device 2009 Forum in Yokohama, Japan.
Halla highlighted innovations showing promise to
help the world consume less energy.  He noted numerous
technical breakthroughs, devices, systems and processes that enable
systems to be more energy efficient such as LED lighting, which
consumes far less energy than incandescent and fluorescent
lighting, as well as electric and hybrid vehicles.  He
discussed innovations that help renewable energy sources, such as
solar, extract more power through "smart panels" as well as
National's award-winning SolarMagic™ power optimizer,
which recoups lost energy in solar installations affected by
real-world conditions.  He also addressed effective techniques
such as active cell balancing, which enhances energy storage in
batteries, allowing them to be more efficient and last longer on a
charge. 
Halla noted products and areas where Japanese
companies have long been a leader in innovation. 
Additionally, he underscored that companies all around the globe
are focused on energy efficiency, continuing to innovate as they
bring their unique products to market.
"It is clear that the world wants to be green,
and the environment wants to be clean," said Halla. 
"Leadership in this area, whether companies or countries, is not
just economic…it is about saving the
planet."

This is a partial transcript from Your World with Neil Cavuto, December 4, 2003, that was edited for clarity.
Watch Your World w/Cavuto weekdays at 4 p.m. and 1 a.m. ET.
NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: A chip off the old block for tech giant National Semiconductor which beat Street estimates Thursday. The company posted an eight percent increase from its first quarter due to strong sales, less expenses.
With us now from California, Brian Halla, the National Semiconductor chairman and CEO.
Brian, good to have you.
BRIAN HALLA, CEO, NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR (NSM): Is that Neil?
CAVUTO: Yes, it is.
HALLA: I can hear you just fine.
CAVUTO: All right. Apologize for that before.
We were talking about your better than expected numbers, we’re also talking on a day Intel was forecasting better than expected revenue for this quarter. It seems like you tech guys are back partying. Are you?
HALLA: Hey, I’ll tell you what, it feels great. It’s going to be a very merry Christmas.
We started our recovery back at the first of the year, back in February, when we disposed of a couple digital businesses. And we said, hey, we’re going to create our own recovery at the bottom line regardless of what happens to the economy. And then about three quarters ago, we saw a sharp an up-tick in consumption of consumer products in Japan and then Asia after SARS.
And I’ll tell you what, now if we have an IT recovery, it’s icing on the cake for us. We’re an analogue company, and the analogue business is booming.
CAVUTO: Who is buying from you right now?
HALLA: We sell to all the large handset suppliers, we sell analogue circuits for flat panel displays. Our partner there is Samson. The big consumers are all the usual suspects in the display business. And we have seen a tremendous pickup of activity in notebook computers, particularly the builders in Taiwan.
CAVUTO: Let me get your sense of where you see this going. You know, there a lot of people who love your industry, Brian, who are saying they’re just afraid it has gotten ahead of yourself, including, in your case, your stock. What do you say?
HALLA: Well, am I supposed to feel bad about that?
CAVUTO: Good point.
HALLA: Last earnings call I was sitting here, and at the end of the earnings call, we closed at $28 a share. And today we’re at $42. And so, that is not a tear coming out of my eye.
CAVUTO: All right. But do you think it can last?
HALLA: Oh, yes. Absolutely.
You know, it is like everything. Everything is eventually going to a semiconductor level. And right now, and particularly in the analogue business, virtually everything is using more and more analogue circuitry. Sight, sound, touch and feel, all of that stuff is analogue.
CAVUTO: All right. We’ll see what happens. Brian Halla, thank you very much, National Semiconductor’s chairman and CEO.
HALLA: Thank you, Neil. Good to talk to you.
CAVUTO: Thank you, sir.

 Brian Halla talks about the future at electronica 
 Mon, 11/10/2008 - 7:30am 
 Comments 
 by  

 



National Semiconductor’s (www.national.com) CEO, Brian Halla, spoke today at a press conference on the eve of electronica 2008 in Munich about the future of technology and National Semiconductor’s role in it. He spoke about the power of convergence, the importance of analog, and the Next Big Thing. 
Brian pointed out that analog is not only where the real world lives; it is also immune from Moore’s law in that circuit size and density is not a factor in analog performance. In addition, the intense pressure for low-power circuits and energy-efficient operation can be addressed very effectively in the analog realm. The challenges lie in system integration and education to adopt and apply the latest in analog signal and power management technologies and integrate them properly with the digital side of the house.
National Semiconductor’s PowerWise technology family is focused on the concept of “Analog to Information” where the entire processing chain is moved to the analog domain. The example Brain gave was their LMV1089 audio chip which uses analog far-field noise suppression in real time to perform the same noise reduction as a digital circuit but with only 10% of the power consumption (http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LMV1089.html).
Brian stated that the current trend is towards more integrated systems that improve the quality of life, in areas such as alternate energy, health care, safety, and productivity. The explosion of technology has followed a roller-coaster curve, with every new application area creating both new growth and a subsequent bust, followed by consolidation of the disruptive technologies involved. This is then followed in turn by the development of the next generation of new technologies, which causes the cycle to repeat. According to him, we are poised at the beginning of a new cycle based in consumer-driven applications integrating all the precious technological advances.
 
 
 
From the 70’s to the 80’s the dominant meme was Man talking to a Machine. In the 80’s began the trend of Man talking to 2 Machines, then more and more and more. Now we are at the point where Machines talk to Machines in the service of Man. Ubiquitous computing, driven by portable electronics and integrated devices such as smart phones, will be the face of the future.
One major area of development is in Solar Power, which is plagued by poor performance due to solar shading. Even if only one panel of a solar array is in shade, the entire assembly can fall in power output by as much as 75% or more. Since solar panels are connected in serial strings, a solar array suffers from the same problem that a 6-cell flashlight with one bad battery does when one of them is in the shade.
National Semiconductor has recently released a product to directly address this need, the SolarMagic module. This device can isolate a bad panel from the rest, and feed its reduced output into the system without affecting neighboring panels, increasing overall efficiency of the array by as much as 30%. This technology can also be used in multiple-battery arrays in the exact same way, isolating bad cells while still allowing them to contribute to the system’s total power output.
The next step may be integrating the electric car and the smart house in an energy-management system that uses the vehicle battery for storage. This is still a ways in the future, as it will rely on battery “supercharging” technology to charge a battery in a very short time.
