They offer bank accounts including savings accounts, checking accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs).

General FAQs



Are Barclays Bank of Delaware® (Barclays) accounts FDIC insured?
Yes. Barclays Bank Delaware is a member of the FDIC, so our deposit accounts are insured up to the maximum amount allowed by law. If you want to learn more about FDIC insurance limits, visit www.fdic.gov.


Are there fees for Barclays accounts?
There are no monthly maintenance or annual fees charged for Barclays accounts. Certain circumstances, like early withdrawal of CDs or insufficient funds, may incur penalties or fees. For more information about fees, please see account Terms and Conditions. 


What is an "external account"?

Your external account is a bank account you have with another U.S. financial institution. It’s linked to your Barclays account so that you can transfer money between the two. Any external account that is linked to your Barclays account must be in an account holder’s name. This includes payment processing companies such as: Paypal, Dwolla, Coinbase, Venmo, Square, and Payday loan deposits. 



Tell me about "test deposits."
For security reasons, we use test deposits as part of the external account verification process. 2 to 3 business days after you add a link to your Barclays account, we’ll make two test deposits of less than $1.00 into your external account. We do not use your money to make these test deposits.

We’ll then ask you to log in to your Barclays account and report the amounts of those test deposits. After you have confirmed the test deposit amounts, you’ll be able to begin transferring money between your Barclays account and your external account. We use this method to verify each new external account. If you do not verify your external account within 99 days from when you opened your account, transfers will be restricted until you can verify your external bank account. 



How do I reset my password?
You can reset your Barclays Online Banking password on our website. Simply select the Forgot UserID and/or Password link Log In from the Barclays Online Banking home page. You will be asked a few short questions to verify your identity. Then choose to have a one time pass code sent to you by email, phone, or text .The one time pass code will be active for 10 minutes.

How do I set up a direct deposit?

To set up direct deposit, simply contact the external account from which you’d like to transfer funds into your Barclays account.  You’ll need to follow their procedures for setting up direct deposit but all of them will need the following information:

How long are deposits on hold?
For all deposits made by check or electronically (collection orders), funds will be held for five (5) business days from the effective date for those funds, which is the day that we credit your Account for that deposit.

How long does it take for an ACH transfer from my Barclays account to post to my external account?
ACH transfers to your external account typically post 2 to 3 business days after they are processed.


Is there a limit to the number of transfers I can make from my Barclays Online Savings account?
Yes. Federal law limits the number of, and types of, withdrawals and transfers you can make each month from a savings account. You can make no more than 6 transfers or withdrawals, or a combination thereof, to another account per statement cycle to another account without incurring a fee. 
Transfers include any transaction that reduces your account balance, initiated by Barclays or any other institution. For more information, please refer to the Transaction Limitations section in the account Terms and Conditions. Barclays reserves the right to close accounts that have violated this policy more than three times in a twelve month period. If the Barclays account is closed, funds will be transferred back to the originating account.

To set up this preference, please log in to your account, select the Account detail tab, and go to the Additional Details section. Under CD interest disbursement, select the Edit option.


Are there penalties for early termination?
Yes. We charge 90 days simple interest on the amount withdrawn for CD Accounts with terms of less than 24 months. For CD Accounts with terms greater than 36 months, we charge 180 days simple interest on the amount withdrawn. In certain circumstances, such as the death or incompetence of an account owner, we may waive the early withdrawal penalty.

 
CD Laddering



How do I decide which terms are best for my ladder?
Determine how often you want access to your funds. The more frequent you want access, the shorter term your CDs should be.


What happens at CD maturity?
You’ll be sent a notice of your CD maturity options. You can either reinvest those funds in a new CD at the current interest rate, or have full access to the funds.


How often can I access my money?
If you choose to break your CD before it matures, you will incur a penalty. Otherwise, when it matures, you can choose to reinvest the funds or to cash in the CD.

 
Accounts for Minors



Do you offer online accounts for children under 18 years old?
As of June 6, 2017 we no longer offer accounts for minors. For any account(s) for minor(s) opened before this date, your account terms and conditions will remain the same.


What can a minor do with their account?
Children under 18 can make deposits to their online savings account, check account balances, and review account activity. They can also set up their own user names and passwords.


How does the child make withdrawals?
Minors cannot make withdrawals from their online savings accounts. Withdrawals must be handled by the qualified adult joint account holder.


Who receives a Federal Form 1099-INT for tax purposes?
As the primary account holder, the minor will receive end-of-year 1099-INT forms.

 
Deposit Checks



What is Deposit Checks?

The Deposit Checks feature allows you to make a check deposit into your Barclays Online Savings Account by uploading a picture of a check from your computer, laptop or mobile device. This feature was formerly known as Remote Deposit Services, and is still covered in your Account Agreement under that name.

 
 


How do I use the Deposit Checks feature?

When you’re logged in to your online account, select the Deposit Checks tab and follow these steps:
1. Tell us about your deposit, such as the amount on the check and the receiving account.
2.  Sign the back of your check.
3.  Upload a picture, from your phone, tablet or personal computer, of the front and back of the check.
We’ll send you an email confirmation once we receive the images and another email once the deposit is processed. Checks deposited after 3pm ET will be processed the next business day.  There’s a 5-day minimum hold time on the amount deposited.



What kind of checks can I deposit through Deposit Checks?
You can deposit all checks made payable to you, with the exception of:

Money orders
Third party checks
Foreign checks



Are all computers and scanners compatible with Remote Deposit software?
Remote Deposit is compatible with most computer and scanner models.


Is the Deposit Checks feature secure?
Yes. Our website and app offer multiple layers of security including password protection, internet firewalls, and encryption.


What should I do with my checks after I deposit them remotely?

When you deposit a check through Deposit Checks, images of the front and back of your check are processed as if a paper check was physically deposited. After funds are available in your account, please mark your physical checks as “Void” and securely dispose of them so that they won’t be deposited again.



Are there any limits when using the Deposit Checks feature?

Yes. There are limits on the amounts you can deposit remotely:



Check amount maximum: $5,000
Daily amount maximum: $10,000
Check number maximum: 10 checks in a single day
10 business day maximum: $50,000 / 20 checks



 
Please note that for the Barclays Dream Account, the maximum deposit is $1,000 each calendar month, per account.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 01/31/2001
            

                BBB has determined that Barclays Bank Delaware meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means: 
1. provide any required product labeling information

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase
                        









Honor Promises









            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Barclays Bank Delaware has received 3.78 out of 5 stars based on 47 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Security policy
Security Statement
Your online security is our #1 concern. Nothing is more important. Our job is to make sure your deposit account and personal information are always secure. My colleagues and I have been given extraordinary resources and the latest state-of-the-art technology to provide you with a secure online environment.
I'm proud of the security system we have created. Because of this commitment to security, your account and personal information are safe within Barclays and when you communicate with Barclays.
If you have any questions about our security measures, contact a Customer Care Relationship Manager at 888-710-8756. We’re here to help you, seven days a week from 8am to 8pm ET.
Raj Kedda
Information Security Officer, Barclays Bank Delaware
Our Security Measures
Here are some of the ways we provide the utmost in online security:

We use Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security to provide a 128-bit secure link between your browser and us. A Global Digital certificate signed by VeriSign assures that you are, in fact, communicating with Barclays and not a copycat site.
We have built a time-out into your logon session. Your connection to our site will be closed after a period of inactivity. This protects you in case you forget to log out.
We use firewalls and other technology to block unauthorized traffic to our site. Our state-of-the-art monitoring equipment ensures that unauthorized access is prevented.
Information is always encrypted between areas of Barclays and between Barclays and our partners. Not only is communication between you and Barclays encrypted, but also between Barclays and its business partners. It's one more way to ensure the security of your personal information.

Our Email Security Standards
All of our legitimate emails that you receive will contain four pieces of consistent information to enable you to easily verify if an email related to your account is authentic:

Your first and last name.
Our mailing address along with information on how to contact us via email or by phone.
A unique tracking identification that we can use to verify the email; if you have any doubts about the authenticity of an email, please call 888-710-8756.

In addition, we will never ask you in an email to verify sensitive information such as your full account number, User name, Password or Social Security Number.
What You Can Do to Protect Your Security
In addition to the latest security technology, here are some tips to protect your security: 
Know WHO you are dealing with.

Interact with reputable companies. If you are unsure of the company, ask for paper brochures/materials to be sent to your home.
Check to be sure you are on the website of the company with which you want to do business. Website names (URLs) that are very similar to those of legitimate companies can easily be created by someone intending to commit fraud.
Take the time to read the provider's Website Privacy Policy before proceeding. This should outline both the company's security measures and personal information sharing policies. Protect your personal information.
Never disclose your password to anyone, even a customer service representative from that company.
Only provide merchants information necessary for the transaction.
Ensure the site is encrypted before providing account or other personal information. Look for a key or lock on your screen and confirm the URL begins with https://
Use unique passwords - avoid date of birth, Social Security Number, or simple words.
Avoid sending personal information via email unless the security is specifically outlined.
Always keep a record of your online transactions.
Use a secure browser.

Protect your personal information.

Never disclose your password to anyone, even a customer service representative from that company.
Only provide merchants information necessary for the transaction.
Ensure the site is encrypted before providing deposit account or other personal information. Look for a key or lock on your screen.
Use unique passwords - avoid date of birth, Social Security Number, or simple words.
Avoid sending personal information via email unless the security is specifically outlined.
Always keep a record of your online transactions.
Use a secure browser.

Protect yourself from email scams.
Barclays is committed to keeping your information secure. You can protect yourself by being aware of common tricks used to obtain access to your information.
Recently, some reputable companies have experienced email fraud. In these scams, individuals received an email linked to a website that looks like it came from the reputable company, often a bank or other financial institution. The email usually states that there is a problem with the customer's account and requests the customer's Username and Password. This type of scam is called spoofing or phishing. You are the first line of defense against phishing. Never provide your Username and Password in response to an unsolicited request.
By following a few helpful hints when viewing your email, you can help protect your personal information. Consider the following:

A legitimate email regarding your deposits account, issued by Barclays Bank Delaware, will always have the three consistent pieces of information outlined above in our Email Security Standards.
Only open email attachments when you recognize the sender. Attachments are sometimes used to spread computer viruses that could access your personal information.
Do not include sensitive information such as your full account number, Social Security Number, User name, Password, or bank account number in emails you send. Barclays will never include such sensitive information in emails we send to you.
Many fraudulent emails contain spelling or grammatical errors. Do not respond to an email if there are obvious mistakes.

Security is very important to us. If you have any questions or if you wish to validate the authenticity of a communication, you can always contact us securely by calling the phone 888-710-8756 or by logging into our website to send a secure email.
