consideration of the Issuing Entity’s delivery of the Notes
and the Certificates to, or upon the order of, the Depositor, the
Depositor does hereby enter into this Agreement and the Second Step

obligations hereunder and thereunder and to sell, transfer, assign

Financed Vehicles or Obligors;

(iv) the interest of the Depositor
in any proceeds from recourse against Dealers on the
Receivables;

(v) all right, title and interest of
the Depositor in, to and under the Pooling Agreement, the First
Step Receivables Assignment, the Servicing Agreement and the

(b) It is the intention of the

(c) The foregoing sales, transfers,

any other Person to the Obligors, Dealers, insurers or any other
Person in connection with the Receivables, any Dealer Agreements,
any insurance policies or any other agreement or instrument
relating to any of them.

consideration conveyed by the Depositor pursuant to
Section 2.01(a) , and declares that the Issuing Entity
shall hold such consideration upon the trust set forth in the Trust
Agreement for the benefit of the Certificateholders, subject to the
terms and conditions of the Indenture, this Agreement and the
Second Step Receivables Assignment and the rights of the
Noteholders with respect thereto. The Issuing Entity hereby agrees
to and accepts the appointment and authorization of Ally Financial
as Servicer under Section 2.01 of the Servicing Agreement. The
parties agree that this Agreement, the Second Step Receivables
Assignment, the Indenture, the Trust Agreement, the Notes and the
Certificates constitute the Further Transfer Agreements for
purposes of the Pooling Agreement.

Section 2.03 Representations and
Warranties as to the Receivables . Pursuant to
Section 2.01(a)(v) , the Depositor assigns to the
Issuing Entity all of its right, title and interest in, to and
under the Pooling Agreement. Such assigned right, title and
interest includes the benefit of the representations and warranties
of the Seller made to the Depositor pursuant to Section 3.01
of the Pooling Agreement. The Depositor hereby represents and
warrants to the Issuing Entity that the Depositor has taken no
action which would cause such representations and warranties of the
Seller to be false in any material respect as of the Closing Date.
The Depositor further acknowledges that the Issuing Entity and its
permitted assignees rely on the representations and warranties of
the Depositor under this Agreement and of the Seller under the
Pooling Agreement in accepting the Receivables and executing and
delivering the Notes and the Certificates. The foregoing
representation and warranty speaks as of the Closing Date, but
shall survive the sale, transfer and assignment of the Receivables
to the Issuing Entity and the pledge thereof to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.

Section 2.04 Repurchase of
Receivables Upon Breach of Warranty . Upon discovery by the
Seller, the Depositor, the Servicer, the Owner Trustee or the
Indenture Trustee of a breach of any of the representations and
warranties in Section 3.01 of the Pooling Agreement or in
Section 2.03 or Section 3.01 of this
Agreement that materially and adversely affects the interests of
the Noteholders or the Certificateholders in any Receivable, the
party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice
thereof to the others. As of the last day of the second Monthly
Period following its discovery or its receipt of notice of such
breach (or, at the Depositor’s election, the last day of the
first Monthly Period following such discovery or receipt of
notice), unless such breach shall have been cured in all material
respects, in the event of a breach of the representations and
warranties made by the Depositor in Section 2.03 or
Section 3.01 , the Depositor shall repurchase, or in
the event of a breach of a representation and warranty under
Section 3.01 of the Pooling Agreement, the Depositor shall use
reasonable efforts to enforce the obligation of the Seller under
Section 4.04 of the Pooling Agreement to repurchase such
Receivable from the Issuing Entity on the related Distribution
Date. The repurchase price to be paid by the breaching party (the
“ Warranty Purchaser ”) shall be an amount equal
to the Warranty Payment calculated as of the last day of the
related Monthly Period. It is understood and agreed that the
obligation of the Warranty Purchaser to repurchase any Receivable
as to which a breach has occurred and is continuing, and the
obligation of the Depositor to enforce the Seller’s
obligation to repurchase such Receivables pursuant to the Pooling
Agreement shall, if such obligations are fulfilled, constitute the
sole remedy against the Depositor or the Seller for such breach
available to the Issuing Entity, the Financial Parties, the Owner
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee.

ARTICLE III

Section 3.01 Representations of

      Fitch Rates Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2014-SN2
    





October 22, 2014 02:14 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to Ally Auto 
      Receivables Trust 2014-SN2:
    

      --$240,000,000 class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$109,000,000 class A-2A asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$391,000,000 class A-2B asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$275,000,000 class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      --$91,900,000 class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The pool consists of strong quality leases 
      with a weighted average (WA) FICO score of 762, seasoning of 11.2 months 
      and a diversified residual value (RV) maturity schedule.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE) Structure: 2014-SN2 incorporates a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial CE to the class A notes is 18.75%, 
      building to 21.75%. Available CE is sufficient to support Fitch's 
      'AAAsf' stressed credit and residual loss assumptions of 4.25% and 
      29.45%, respectively.
    

      Unhedged Floating-Rate Note: The class A-2b notes are expected to pay 
      interest on a floating-rate basis, while the assets pay a fixed rate and 
      will not be hedged. As such, Fitch has stressed the transaction 
      structure using its 'AAA' LIBOR-up stressed assumptions.
    

      Improved Loss Performance: Credit and residual losses on Ally's 
      portfolio have declined significantly from the elevated levels seen in 
      2008 and 2009. This is a result of strong obligor credit quality and a 
      recently solid wholesale used vehicle market, leading to higher recovery 
      rates and residual realization.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates Ally Financial, the parent of Ally, 
      the originator and servicer, 'BB' with a Stable Rating Outlook. Fitch 
      believes Ally Financial to be a capable originator, underwriter and 
      servicer, as evidenced by historical performance of its managed 
      portfolio and prior securitizations.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated 
      the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Ally Auto Receivables Trust 
      2014-SN2 to increased credit and residual losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays 
      relatively little sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses, 
      showing downgrades of only one rating category even under Fitch's severe 
      (2.5 times base case loss) scenario. The transaction shows significantly 
      more sensitivity to residual loss volatility, although, even under 
      Fitch's severe scenario, the class A notes would be expected to retain 
      an investment grade rating.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated Oct. 10, 2014. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2014-SN2 - Appendix'. This R&W is compared 
      to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated April 17, 2012.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
