Rice Energy Acquires Lola Energy Assets In Confidential Sale
Jul 24 17
A subsidiary of Rice Energy Inc. (NYSE:RICE) has purchased all of the assets held by upstart Lola Energy LLC in a series of transactions that were finalized this month, according to deed transfers and assignments of interest filed in three northern West Virginia counties and another in southwest Pennsylvania. Chief Executive Officer of Denham Capital Management LP, Jim Crockard's LinkedIn profile indicated the company exited its position in a "confidential sale" this month to "an undisclosed strategic buyer just ahead of breaking ground on the company's first permitted pad location" in Greene County, PA. Rumors of the sale to Rice have swirled for weeks. The price Rice agreed to pay for the assets could not be determined. It's also unclear how the new assets might impact EQT Corp.'s $8 billion acquisition of Rice, which was announced in June, 2017. Representatives for Rice and Lola could not be reached to comment. If the assets are included in that deal, they would likely sweeten the pot, sources familiar with the companies said. "It does move the needle,” said a source who did not want to be named discussing a transaction that hasn’t been formally announced.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
