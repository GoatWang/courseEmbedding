Glassbridge Enterprises, known as Imation Corporation prior to 2017, is an American holding company. Through the company's two subsidiaries, Glassbridge focuses primarily on investment, asset management and global enterprise data storage. Prior to the name change, Glassbridge had three core elements – traditional storage (magnetic tape and optical products), secure and scalable storage (data backup, data archive and data security for small and medium businesses) and what the company calls “audio and video information” products.[3]

History[edit]
Imation was started in 1996, when 3M spun off its data storage business. The company underwent a divestment of non-core businesses, and invested in four core product technology areas: secure storage, scalable storage, wireless/connectivity, and magnetic tape.[4]
As part of 3M, the company was involved in the development of many technological improvements in data storage, such as the introduction of the first magnetic tape in 1947, the first quarter-inch tape cartridge for data storage (QIC) in 1971, and the 3.5-inch (89 mm) floppy disk in 1984.
In February 2012, Imation announced a product set for securing mobile data, identities, and workspaces, based on the premise that employees used portable storage devices to transport corporate data.[5]
The security news followed five acquisitions the company made in 2011 in scalable storage and data security: ENCRYPTX;[6] MXI Security from Memory Experts International; the assets of ProStor; the secure data storage hardware business of IronKey; and intellectual property from Nine Technologies. Imation received an exclusive license from IronKey for its secure storage management software and service and a license to use the IronKey brand for secure storage products.[7]
In October 2011, Imation products for small and medium businesses centered on its DataGuard and InfiniVault multi-tier data protection and data archive appliances.
The company sold consumer electronics, headphones and accessories under the Imation, Memorex, TDK Life on Record, and XtremeMac brands. The combined Imation, Memorex and TDK Life on Record brands made the company into a global market share leader in sales of CD-R and DVD media[8][9][10] before that business was shut down in 2016.[11]
Imation changed its name to Glassbridge Enterprises on February 21, 2017.[12]

Return Policies

      Each product is fully guaranteed by the manufacturer (unless specifically stated otherwise). The complete warranty is included with the product. The manufacturer's warranty covers repair or replacement of defective parts, subject to the conditions set forth. On most items, antonline offers an exclusive 30 day return for refund policy.

      The following products are not accepted for return and must be repaired by manufacturers' authorized service centers: TVs and monitors, computer products, laser printers, scanners, fax and other devices with delicate optics. To locate a service center near you, please refer to your product manual. Unused software may be returned, if unopened, with some exceptions. Defective software, games, CDs and DVDs may be returned for the same title only. Some software programs, consumables and media are not returnable to antonline under any circumstance and must be returned to the manufacturer. Stereo and electronic equipment should be bench-tested prior to installation (units that have been installed, scratched, or abused will not be accepted for return or credit).

      If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you may return it for refund (excluding shipping and handling charges) within 14 days, subject to a return authorization from antonline (see exceptions above).

      Returns are subject to a restocking fee, depending on the condition of goods and packaging material; and cost incurred in restocking.

Please do not tape or write anything on the item or packaging. antonline will charge you for replacement of damaged, altered, missing, written-on, or taped-on contents or cartons. antonline reserves the right to refuse any such returns.

Return Procedures

      Pack the products into a shipping box with plenty of packing material, and tape securely. Write the RMA number issued by customer service clearly on the shipping label as instructed. Any merchandise returned to antonline without prior authorization will be refused. Please ship your parcel back to antonline freight prepaid. antonline suggests that you use UPS Ground Service (Insured). Sorry, antonline cannot accept COD or freight-collect shipments.

Keep Your Data Safe by Backing Up Your Hard Drives
If you aren’t backing up your computer files regularly, you’re inviting disaster. Make quick work of the backup process with one of these hard drive duplicators that creates an exact replica of all of the files on your current hard drive. Or consider employing tape and data cartridge drives to ensure your data stays safe. Regardless of which method you choose, the most important thing to remember about backing up your desktop computer or laptop hard drive is to do it early and often.
Extend Your Storage Capabilities
Today’s activities can use up a lot of computer storage space. From photographs to audio and video files, your computer drives can quickly fill up. And one great way to extend your storage capabilities is to install a new CD, DVD or Blu-ray drive and burn files to a CD or DVD. eBay carries a variety of storage drives, like these Dell CD/DVD/Blu-ray drives and these HP CD/DVD/Blu-ray drives, which can expand your storage space exponentially. And, of course, external hard drives are a convenient and inexpensive way to expand storage.
Blank Storage Media Keeps Things Running Smoothly
Don’t forget the media! Whether you’re creating a large number of DVDs for sale using a CD/DVD/Blu-ray duplicator, or you’re simply wanting to back up or store important files, make sure your operation runs smoothly by keeping enough blank storage media on hand. eBay has blank CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs as well as blank tapes and data cartridges.
USB Flash Drives Offer Affordable, Portable Computing Storage
A solid state drive with no moving parts, USB flash drives are an extremely affordable, portable way to save and share files. For example, today’s 16 GB USB flash drives can typically hold more than 320,000 Word doc pages—or almost 10,000 photos or 4,000+ MP3 files! Choose the flash drive with the media storage that meets your needs and your budget from top-rated SanDisk USB flash drives and Kingston USB flash drives, and you’ll be ready to go.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryComputers, Tablets & Network HardwareComputer Drives, Storage & Blank MediaCD, DVD & Blu-ray DrivesCD, DVD & Blu-ray DuplicatorsComputer Drive Bay CaddiesComputer Drive Enclosures & DocksFloppy, Zip & Jaz DrivesHard Drives (HDD, SSD & NAS)Hard Drive DuplicatorsTape & Data Cartridge DrivesUSB Flash DrivesBlank Media & AccessoriesOther Drives, Storage & Blank MediaBrandsee allHPKingstonSamsungSanDiskSeagateToshibaUnbranded/GenericWesternConditionsee allNewNew other (see details)Manufacturer refurbishedSeller refurbishedUsedFor parts or not workingNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

Glassbridge Enterprises, known as Imation Corporation prior to 2017, is an American holding company. Through the company's two subsidiaries, Glassbridge focuses primarily on investment, asset management and global enterprise data storage. Prior to the name change, Glassbridge had three core elements – traditional storage (magnetic tape and optical products), secure and scalable storage (data backup, data archive and data security for small and medium businesses) and what the company calls “audio and video information” products.[3]

History[edit]
Imation was started in 1996, when 3M spun off its data storage business. The company underwent a divestment of non-core businesses, and invested in four core product technology areas: secure storage, scalable storage, wireless/connectivity, and magnetic tape.[4]
As part of 3M, the company was involved in the development of many technological improvements in data storage, such as the introduction of the first magnetic tape in 1947, the first quarter-inch tape cartridge for data storage (QIC) in 1971, and the 3.5-inch (89 mm) floppy disk in 1984.
In February 2012, Imation announced a product set for securing mobile data, identities, and workspaces, based on the premise that employees used portable storage devices to transport corporate data.[5]
The security news followed five acquisitions the company made in 2011 in scalable storage and data security: ENCRYPTX;[6] MXI Security from Memory Experts International; the assets of ProStor; the secure data storage hardware business of IronKey; and intellectual property from Nine Technologies. Imation received an exclusive license from IronKey for its secure storage management software and service and a license to use the IronKey brand for secure storage products.[7]
In October 2011, Imation products for small and medium businesses centered on its DataGuard and InfiniVault multi-tier data protection and data archive appliances.
The company sold consumer electronics, headphones and accessories under the Imation, Memorex, TDK Life on Record, and XtremeMac brands. The combined Imation, Memorex and TDK Life on Record brands made the company into a global market share leader in sales of CD-R and DVD media[8][9][10] before that business was shut down in 2016.[11]
Imation changed its name to Glassbridge Enterprises on February 21, 2017.[12]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
