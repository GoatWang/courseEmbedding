(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  This quarterly report and other reports filed by Fellazo Corp. ("we," "us," "our," or the "Company"), from time to time contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company's management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company's management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the filings, the words "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "expect", "future", "intend", "plan", or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company's management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.  Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.  Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates.  GENERAL  Fellazo Corp. was incorporated on May 28, 2014 in the State of Nevada and established fiscal year on August 31. We have recently started our operations. To the date May 31, 2016 our company possesses minimal assets, has generated limited revenues from selling printed products to its customers and incurred losses since inception of $15,943. We specialize in billboard, banner and large format printing.  We have purchased one cutting plotter and one digital printing machine from HARTLAND IMPEX LP, entered into one year Commercial Lease Agreement, signed Sale Contract with our first customer Persic-Adv, Ltd and receive revenues of $3,800 from this customer and also the Company receive limited revenues of $4,370 from selling the Company's products to Marat-Somp, SRL, our second customer.  We decided to start our activities from Chisinau, Moldova, where we have located our first cutting plotter.  Proceeds we plan to raise from this offering are necessary to start our plan of operations. We have foreseen for different number of shares to be sold in this offering, which are 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the shares sold. The minimum estimated amount of assets necessary to start our operations is $20,000. We need these assets to pay for our legal offering, purchase raw materials, marketing and administrative costs.  PRODUCT OVERVIEW  Fellazo Corp offers following products:  1. Billboard printing, large format printing  High quality printing feature of our plotter and broadside printing capabilities enable us to produce billboard advertisements. Despite advertising last days has been converted to electronic banners, billboards still remain one of the main and efficient advertisement types.  2. Printing and cutting thermal transfer films  Thermal transfer films with printed image or text on them are widely used in clothing industry. Our plotter is able to print images and/or text on such film and cut it out, so that afterwards it can be applied to almost any other type of clothing.  3. Printing and cutting designer film  Many banners and light boxes are made using designer film with printed company name and logo. With help of our cutting plotter we can cut logos and text from designer film, such as Oracal and Avery.  4. Production of car stickers  Bumper stickers, images or any other ornaments can be produced using our cutting plotter.  CUTTING PLOTTER  We have already purchased one cutting plotter BJ-67S for our operations from HARTLAND IMPEX LP. This equipment does not require any special technical skills for manufacture process. Cutting plotter delivery set includes the plotter itself and supplies for testing.  DIGITAL PRINTING MACHINE  As of the date we have purchased one more unit of equipment from HARTLAND IMPEX LP. - Digital printing machine.  RAW MATERIALS  We plan to keep stock of following raw materials necessary for our operations:  * Outdoor billboard paper,  * Thermal transfer film,  * Oracle and Avery designer films,  * Vinyl water resistant paper,  * Printer ink.  Other kinds of materials for manufacture we may consider adding in the course of operations and can always order upon client's request.  POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS  In the opening stage of our operations our President and Director, Galina Hripcenco will put on market our printed product and negotiate with potential and existing customers. We intend to develop and maintain client database with customers who may want to order our products. We will follow up with our customers and offer them free samples and special discounts from time to time.  We expect that our potential clients may be:  1. Advertising agencies.  2. Sewing shops.  3. Car design studios.  4. Private clients.  Regular clients with small orders may be provided a 5% discount at the discretion of our Director. Distributors and partners will get 30% discount.  As of May 31, 2016 Fellazo Corp. has entered into two sale contracts with two customers. The Company has generated limited revenues of $8,170 from inception.  STORAGE AND DELIVERY  The product produced by Fellazo Corp does not require any storage facilities, as it will be produced directly for each order. The number of demonstration samples to be kept is insignificant and does not require any special premises for storage. We are going to sign a contract with local delivery company, such as DHL Moldova, Unipost-Express, on regular basis. Term of delivery shall be not more than 7 days, which shall include product production and delivery to the client. We have not signed any contracts with delivery company yet.  EMPLOYEES  The Company has recently started its operations and currently has no employees, other than our sole officer and director, Galina Hripcenco, who will initially perform all work in production and organization of our business.  COMPETITION  The industry we are entering is concentrated and competitive. Competitors will include companies with substantial customer bases and working history. There can be no assurance that we can maintain a competitive position against current or future competitors, particularly those with greater financial, marketing, service, technical and other resources. Our failure to maintain a competitive position within the market could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations.  Some of the competitive factors that may affect our business are as follows:  1. Increasing number of competitor.  Other competitors may follow our business model of similar products manufacture, which will reduce our competitive edge.  2. Price.  Our competitors may be selling similar product at a lower price forcing us to lower our prices as well and possibly sell our products at loss.  3. New technologies.  Newer trends in advertising market, such as online advertising, new fashion and new technologies in clothing manufacture, new materials used for car design instead of vinyl, etc., many of these factors may eventually have influence to efficiency of our business model.  MARKETING  As long as we have different kind of products to offer, our marketing campaign can involve many possible promotional activities. First of all we plan to use our logo on all the products we make as a way to raise customer awareness.  We shall hand out our products, such as stickers and t-shirts with funny images at fairs and car shows. We plan to produce booklets and flyers with company information. We will place our stands at advertising trade shows offering our services for outdoor advertising on billboards, banners and light boxes.  LEASE AGREEMENT  Fellazo Corp has signed a lease agreement as of June 1, 2015 coming into force on August 1, 2015 with Ungureanu Alexandru, Chisinau, Moldova, for one-year term, and lease renovation for additional two-year term from August 1, 2016 to August 1, 2018. The premise allows us to place maximum two cutting plotters and place office items. According to the agreement we lease office of 58 square meters on the first floor at str. Vasile Lupu 16, Chisinau 2008, Republic of Moldova. The agreed annual rental fee is $3,120.  INSURANCE  We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.  GOVERNMENT REGULATION  We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and "best-efforts" basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the
securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will
raise the full $80,000 as anticipated.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,000, which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Galina Hripcenco, our
president and director, has agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the
registration process. Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from
this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain
reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board or other
quotation service when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on
the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or other quotation service. Ms. Hripcenco
will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this
offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Ms.
Hripcenco. Ms. Hripcenco will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when
we generate revenues to pay the obligation.


The industry we are entering is concentrated and competitive. Competitors will
include companies with substantial customer bases and working history. There can
be no assurance that we can maintain a competitive position against current or
future competitors, particularly those with greater financial, marketing,
service, technical and other resources. Our failure to maintain a competitive
position within the market could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and result of operations.

Some of the competitive factors that may affect our business are as follows:

1. Increasing number of competitor.

Other competitors may follow our business model of similar products manufacture,
which will reduce our competitive edge.

2. Price.

Our competitors may be selling similar product at a lower price forcing us to 
lower our prices as well and possibly sell our products at loss.

3. New technologies.

Newer trends in advertising market, such as online advertising, new fashion and
new technologies in clothing manufacture, new materials used for car design 
instead of vinyl, etc., many of these factors may eventually have influence to 
efficiency of our business model.

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and "best-efforts" basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the
securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will
raise the full $80,000 as anticipated.

Other expenses               --        $   400        $   980        $ 1,480

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,000, which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Galina Hripcenco, our
president and director, has agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the
registration process. Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from
this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain
reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board or other
quotation service when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on
the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board or other quotation service. Ms. Hripcenco
will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this
offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Ms.
Hripcenco. Ms. Hripcenco will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when
we generate revenues to pay the obligation.


The industry we are entering is concentrated and competitive. Competitors will
include companies with substantial customer bases and working history. There can
be no assurance that we can maintain a competitive position against current or
future competitors, particularly those with greater financial, marketing,
service, technical and other resources. Our failure to maintain a competitive
position within the market could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and result of operations.

Some of the competitive factors that may affect our business are as follows:

1. Increasing number of competitor.

Other competitors may follow our business model of similar products manufacture,
which will reduce our competitive edge.

2. Price.

Our competitors may be selling similar product at a lower price forcing us to 
lower our prices as well and possibly sell our products at loss.

3. New technologies.

Newer trends in advertising market, such as online advertising, new fashion and
new technologies in clothing manufacture, new materials used for car design 
instead of vinyl, etc., many of these factors may eventually have influence to 
efficiency of our business model.
