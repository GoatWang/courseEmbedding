A diversified product line - Dowty Propellers








































Dowty PropellersWorld-leading manufacturer of integrated propeller systems
 




A diversified product line

Many of the modern turboprop engines in operation today are equipped with propellers and control systems from Dowty Propellers.
As a specialist in all-composite propellers, the company has produced more than 23,000 such blades – which have accumulated over 300 million flying hours in powering regional airliners, military airlifters and amphibious aircraft – along with their use on marine hovercraft.
The company’s propeller product line offers robustness and reliability – incorporating advanced aerodynamics for optimized takeoff, climb and cruise performance, along with low noise.  Dowty Propellers’ modular design for both control systems and blades ensure ease of maintenance.  Combined with proven reliability, they provide users with low through-life costs.
Regional passenger aircraft equipped by Dowty Propellers include the twin-engine Saab 340, which was the world’s first FAR Part 25-certified airliner with all-composite blades; the follow-on Saab 2000; Fokker Aircraft’s twin-engine Fokker 50 and Fokker 60; and Bombardier’s twin-engine Q400 Dash 8 – using a system with single removable blades that facilitates maintenance.
In the military sector, Lockheed Martin’s four-engine C-130J and the twin-engine Alenia Aeronautica C-27J Spartan airlifters benefit from the performance of Dowty Propellers’ propeller systems, including their robustness in missions from unprepared airfields and front-line operating conditions, along with the ShinMaywa US-2 aircraft that supports sea-based search and rescue missions.
In military marine applications, the two shrouded airscrews on Textron Systems’ Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) hovercraft are manufactured and maintained by Dowty Propellers.  Dowty Propellers also has been awarded the propeller unit contract for design, development and test-craft phase of the Ship to Shore Connector (SSC), which is being developed by Textron Systems to replace the LCAC.
