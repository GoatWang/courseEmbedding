Tisch, a member of the CNA Board of Directors and the chief executive officer of Loews Corporation (NYSE:   L), CNA's largest shareholder. "After an exhaustive search process, CNA's board is confident that we have selected the ideal individual for the job. We feel that Dino has the qualities necessary to lead CNA into its next phase of growth, building on the phenomenal work that Tom has done over the past seven years." 
Mr. Tisch added, "I want to thank Tom for his inspired leadership at CNA. He set the company on a path of disciplined underwriting, consistent earnings growth and financial strength. We expect CNA's success to continue in 2016 with Tom at the helm."
Mr. Motamed added, "Dino Robusto is a top-tier, proven insurance leader. I am proud to hand over the reins to Dino, and I am confident he will continue the progress the CNA team has made over the past several years."

Taking the helm in a perfect storm—Industry veteran Tom Motamed brings experience and vision to CNA 04/09

Taking the helm in a perfect storm
Industry veteran Tom Motamed brings experience and vision to CNA
By Elisabeth Boone, CPCU

The phrase “perfect storm,” taken from the title of Sebastian Junger’s breathtaking saga of the Gloucester fishing fleet’s encounter with destiny in the North Atlantic, has been used to describe everything from meteorological catastrophes to financial collapses.
Albeit well worn, the term describes with pinpoint accuracy the situation in which large, multiple line insurers currently find themselves. Like the 50-foot waves that buffeted the swordboat “Andrea Gail” in The Perfect Storm, powerful forces are challenging carriers on all sides: the prolonged soft market in property/casualty lines; possible reserve inadequacies for life companies; the stock market volatility, the credit crunch, and the ongoing crisis in the housing market.
Given the number, nature, and magnitude of these challenges, few would question the decision of industry veteran Thomas F. Motamed to retire last June from The Chubb Corporation after a distinguished 31-year career with the insurer. Motamed joined Chubb in 1977 as a claims trainee and in 2002 was elected vice chairman and chief operating officer.
Quite a few people, however, might wonder what motivated Motamed to defer his well-earned R&R and instead return to the executive suite, this time at a leading multi-line carrier based in Chicago.
On January 5, 2009, Motamed began his tenure as chairman and chief executive officer of CNA Financial, the holding company of CNA insurance companies. He succeeded Stephen W. Lilienthal, who retired in Deccember 2008 after holding those positions since 2002.
In an exclusive interview with Rough Notes, Motamed explained his reasons for accepting the top post at CNA and, from the perspective of his first 30 days on the job, shared his insights into the myriad challenges that face his organization and its competitors in today’s storm-tossed market.
“First and foremost, I thought there was a tremendous opportunity to build a great company,” Motamed said. “CNA has been around since 1897, so it has a long history, and I thought it had good people. This is a people business, and if you have good people who are on the right page, you can win.”
Ranking priorities
Given the “perfect storm” in which insurers are struggling to remain afloat, how do leaders like Motamed approach the challenge of establishing their priorities?
“Everyone—individuals, businesses in general, and certainly insurance companies—is facing a decline in the value of their assets,” Motamed observed. “To me, probably the most serious issue insurance companies are dealing with, particularly life companies, is the asset side of the balance sheet. Clearly, everyone is hoping for an economic recovery and a financial market recovery, but we need to be constantly looking at ways to improve the financial side of the business.”
In recent months, some life insurers have been petitioning their home state insurance departments to reduce reserve requirements to help preserve their financial stability ratings in the current crisis. We asked Motamed to comment on this trend.
“Every insurance company I know has taken a hit on the asset side,” he replied. “When that happens, you’re subjected to scrutiny by the rating agencies. I believe that all of us who run companies, who believe that we have good products, services and people, don’t want to operate under the cloud of a lower rating. People look to the financial strength of insurers to protect their assets when it comes to a claim,” he pointed out.
“It’s important to remember that we’re not the only ones in control of our destiny. We’re watched by the rating agencies and by state regulators, and by the federal government when it gives TARP money to insurers.” In this environment, Motamed remarked, “I think everyone is trying to avoid a downturn in their rating.” 
Eye on the cycle
These days you’d have to go a long way to find any Pollyannas in the insurance business, and Motamed is no relentless optimist. Neither, however, is he a pessimist; his long experience in the industry informs his stance as a confirmed realist.
“I think it’s a great business with great people, and it’s cyclical,” he said. “People have to understand that we’re in a cycle now where it’s not as lucrative for insurers, and customers are getting lower prices. And that will change.”
For that reason, Motamed sees no reason to view today’s soft property/casualty market as anything more than an inevitable turn in the traditional underwriting cycle.
“A lot of people are complaining about the soft market, but the current soft cycle is a lot shorter than historic soft market cycles,” he commented. “It’s not as bad as people think, and the calendar year results are pretty good for most insurance companies. The current accident years are coming under some pressure, but a lot of companies reported pretty good earnings and combined ratios, aside from what happened on the investment side of the house.
“Core property and casualty results continue to be pretty good,” Motamed continued. “Growth is not good, but in economic times like these, where sales and payrolls are down and people are not reinvesting in their businesses, it’s hard to charge people more money for insurance when they’re already suffering economically.”
In times like these, Motamed said, “Whether you’re an insurance company or an agent, the most important thing you can do is stay close to the customer. We have to stay close to our agents and brokers, and we have to execute our fundamentals in a superb way. We also have to be clear about our abilities in the marketplace, and we have to exercise what I call ‘continuing underwriting discipline,’” Motamed asserted.
It’s equally important to recognize, he continued, that “this is a face-to-face business. Underwriters need to be in front of their agents, and agents need to be in front of their customers. Technology is never going to change the face-to-face nature of the business, and I don’t think it should.”
Pointing to another imperative, Motamed said, “We have to make sure we’re providing excellent service to the ultimate customer, because that’s who pays the bills.”
Playing to strengths
How does Motamed characterize the key strengths of CNA in today’s economic climate?
“I’ve learned a lot about the company since I got here, and I’ve been very pleased,” Motamed replied. “First, we have good ratings, and people look to that. We have solid service capabilities in claims, risk control, and back-office operations. We’re known in the marketplace for underwriting strength in our HealthPro business, construction, and our programs.” (The CNA HealthPro division was profiled in an article titled “Leading the Way in Health Care Liability” in the October 2008 issue of Rough Notes.)
A key strength for CNA is its relationships with the agents and brokers who distribute its products, Motamed emphasized. “We’re very much an independent agent company, and agents will be hearing more about CNA expanding its relationships with groups like the Big ‘I’ and the CIAB. We believe we have to work with our agency force to provide first-class solutions to clients,” he said.
“Agents need to be more selective as to whom they represent,” Motamed remarked, “and stick with those relationships and build stronger relationships with a core group of companies, rather than dealing with a fractured list of markets. It’s not economical, and it creates problems on the E&O side if you don’t really know what your markets are selling.”
What’s more, Motamed commented, “Agents have to be more vocal to their underwriters as to what products and services they want and what their customers are willing to pay for. On the other hand, we as underwriters know that price is part of every sales equation, but agents need to demonstrate their value to the client as well as the value of the market they are representing.
“At the end of the day,” Motamed asserted, “relationships are everything. In soft markets and hard markets, agents want long-term relationships with their clients, and we want the same with our agents. It’s cost effective; ultimately it’s more profitable not only for the agent and the underwriter but also for the client when there’s a long-term relationship.”
Future of consolidation
The last several years have seen the consolidation of some industry giants that few if any industry observers ever would have imagined joining forces. Centuries-old names have disappeared amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions as insurers seek to control their ever-rising costs of doing business. We asked Motamed to comment on this trend and whether he expects it to continue.
“It’s kind of a ‘tale of two cities,’” he responded. “On the one hand, I expect more consolidation because there are companies with weaker balance sheets that are unable to raise capital in this economic climate. Underwriting results have deteriorated in the soft market, so logically that suggests that some companies would view a sale to be in the best interests of their shareholders.
“On the other hand, there are fewer buyers, because they have weaker balance sheets as well,” Motamed observed, “and they also have the problem of raising capital today. What’s more, today there are many fewer companies to buy than there were 30 years ago. So when you look at consolidation, logically it should happen—but will it? Only time will tell.”
Like his peers in the executive suites of other top insurers, Motamed was leery of playing the role of crystal ball gazer. Asked what he thinks the property/casualty business might look like three to five years from now, he did offer some thoughts.
“I can’t predict the future with any degree of accuracy, but I expect there will be a turning point on pricing in the next year or two,” Motamed said. “However, that will be muted by the effects of the economy. Underwriters will be able to get a better price for the product, but whether it’s payroll, sales, or total insured values, they are still going to be depressed until the economy comes back.
“We’re looking at a scenario where the bottom line may improve, but growth will be difficult in a soft economy. Profitability could improve as rates increase, but the fact is that clients still won’t be paying a lot more for their insurance,” Motamed said.
Challenges notwithstanding, Motamed declared: “I continue to be excited about the opportunities at CNA. It’s great to be back in the saddle, and CNA has a lot of advantages. We have talented people who really want to work with our agents, and our local presence in the marketplace with CNA offices is very important so our field people can have face-to-face discussions with their agents,” Motamed said. “We want to be a company that thinks in a big way but acts very locally.”

Executive profile: Thomas Motamed, CNA Financial - tribunedigital-chicagotribune




 



Executive profile: Thomas Motamed of CNA FinancialChief executive saw an opportunity to turn around companyJuly 06, 2014|By Becky Yerak, Tribune reporterCNA Financial CEO Thomas Motamed has helped turn around the once-struggling company. (Abel Uribe, Chicago Tribune)Thomas Motamed, fresh out of law school, found the legal profession too dry.So at a friend's suggestion, he tried another field he thought might be more interesting: peddling life insurance.But that got old fast."I really didn't like sitting around kitchen tables at night telling people, 'When you die, your spouse is going to be living in a refrigerator box by the railroad tracks if you don't buy insurance,'" Motamed said. "It didn't come out exactly that way, but that was the message."After a year of selling life insurance, he joined Chubb Corp. — which sold property and casualty insurance — and went on to work at the New Jersey-based company for 31 years, eventually landing the No. 2 job as vice chairman and chief operating officer.Then, in 2008, conglomerate Loews Corp., controlled by New York's billionaire Tisch family, came calling. It needed a new CEO to run its Chicago-based CNA Financial subsidiary, which sells property and casualty insurance to businesses.Motamed took the job and moved into the red tower at 333 S. Wabash Ave. in January 2009. He planned to stay until 2014, but, thanks to a renegotiated contract, will stay through 2016. His total compensation each of the past two years has been more than $10 million.Under Motamed's leadership, revenues are up as the company has made a bigger effort to serve such industries as technology and financial services, and the company's credit rating has been upgraded. It has resumed its cash dividend and also has made an underwriting profit in four of the past five years, the exception being the year that Superstorm Sandy hit the Northeast."It was a great choice by Loews to pick him to run CNA," said Pat Ryan, former CEO of Aon who now heads Ryan Specialty Group.CNA profits also have been helped by cost cutting. More than 700 Chicago-area jobs have been shed since Motamed, 65, took the helm. That represented about a quarter of its local workforce, many of them information technology jobs that were outsourced.His early years: The son of an Iranian immigrant father and an Irish mother, his parents married young and divorced when Motamed was only 1.His father, who got full custody, "was in college all day and would come home at night," Motamed recalled. Then his father went to medical school, worked as an intern and a resident and went on to become a surgeon."My grandmother wanted me more than he wanted me," Motamed said. He described his grandmother as "very supportive," and said he was essentially raised by his father's parents in Garden City, N.Y., on Long Island.Motamed earned a biology degree at Adelphi University in Garden City. He was the captain and most valuable player on the lacrosse team. The athletic field is named for him."I had a full college career and didn't spend a lot of time in the library," Motamed said.That may have derailed his family's expectation of him getting into medical school and to follow in the footsteps of his father, grandfather, who was a surgeon to the shah of Iran in the 1940s, and great grandfather. An aunt was a radiologist.His career path: Motamed held 14 jobs in his first 18 years at Chubb, many lateral moves, and in departments such as claims, legal, training, field operations and marketing."That's how you really learn things," he said. Most people today can't do what he did, he said, because the rise in dual-income couples makes it more difficult to move.How he became CEO of CNA Financial: Loews CEO Jim Tisch, whose company owns about 90 percent of CNA stock, said Motamed had been on his radar since conducting the search that led to the hiring of the guy Motamed would replace."We were ready to go out and hire a headhunter when one director sitting next to Tom" at an industry event "asked Tom if he might be interested in the CNA job," Tisch recalled. Motamed said he met with Tisch on and off for five months."I thought it was an opportunity to take a brand name that was tarnished and turn it around or polish it," Motamed said. Motamed told Business Insurance magazine in 2009 that as he looked at CNA he didn't think it had a "real growth strategy, and there certainly was room for improvement on the profitability side."His hiring was announced in May 2008, but because of a one-year noncompete and long-term incentives he'd forfeit if he violated it, Motamed wasn't supposed to join CNA until June 2009.By the fall of 2008, Tisch decided he didn't want to wait until then. Chubb released Motamed from certain noncompete restrictions that allowed him to join CNA on Jan. 1, 2009.What Tisch liked about Motamed: "He knows the industry and business inside and out," including claims, underwriting, marketing and legal, adding that he also knows almost everyone in the commercial property and casualty insurance business.Tisch tells of how one relatively large insurance brokerage had a "grudge" against CNA. So Tisch arranged for the head of that brokerage and Motamed to meet in Loews' New York office.1 | 2 | 3 |  Next

NOT FOR PUBLICATION
OPINION
ANNE E. THOMPSON, District Judge.
This matter comes before the Court upon the motions to dismiss brought by Defendants The Ayco Company, L.P. ("Ayco") and The Chubb Corporation ("Chubb") on the basis of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (ECF Nos. 75, 76). Plaintiffs Thomas F. Motamed, George R. Fay, and David S. Fowler ("Plaintiffs") oppose. (ECF Nos. 87, 89). The Court has issued the opinion below based upon the written submissions of the parties and without oral argument pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 78(b). For the reasons stated herein, Chubb's motion to dismiss will be denied, and Ayco's motion to dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part.
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs are former Chubb executives. Plaintiffs' allegations are as follows: as employees of Chubb, Plaintiffs participated in a company retirement program, which entitled them to certain deferred compensation benefits after retirement. In 1999, Chubb offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to participate in a new benefit program called The Chubb Corporation Estate Enhancement Program. This program was designed to reduce Plaintiffs' estate tax payments by providing part of their compensation in the form of a life insurance policy, which would not be taxed. Ayco advised Chubb on the creation of the program, helped market the program, and also acted as an individual financial adviser to Plaintiff George Fay ("Fay").
To participate in the program, Plaintiffs would relinquish their rights to accrued benefits in the company pension plan. In return, Chubb would purchase a variable life insurance policy for each plaintiff under a split-dollar arrangement. Chubb would make a one-time premium payment to the insurance company in the amount of approximately four times the relinquished pension benefits. The policy provided a death benefit payable after the death of each plaintiff and his spouse. Under the split-dollar arrangement, each plaintiff's estate would receive 75% of the face value of the policy, and Chubb would receive 25% of the face value of the policy and the policy cash value. In marketing the program to Plaintiffs, Chubb stated that the financial benefits from participating in the program were potentially much greater than the Plaintiffs would receive through the deferred pension plan.
All three plaintiffs chose to participate in the program and relinquished between $100,000 and $462,500 in pension benefits in exchange for life insurance policies with face values between $3,630,000 and $15,000,000. Chubb paid the initial premiums to purchase the policies. However, the face value of each policy was actually an estimate based on an estimated return on the investments in the policies of at least 8.76% per year, compounded for the life of the policies. The investments have not resulted in a return of at least 8.76%. Therefore, on May 14, 2010, Plaintiffs received a letter advising them that the life insurance policies would lapse unless they made significant additional premium payments. Meanwhile, Plaintiffs have been required to pay taxes each year on the economic value of the death benefit. This value increased over time and will increase dramatically after the death of the first insured of each couple, making the tax payments unsustainable.
On October 2, 2015, Plaintiffs filed suit against Chubb and Ayco, arguing that the benefit program was inadequately designed and marketed and should not have been offered to Chubb's executives. Plaintiffs asserted claims against Chubb under theories of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and detrimental reliance. Plaintiffs asserted claims against Ayco under the theory of negligent misrepresentation, and Fay individually asserts claims for breach of contract and professional malpractice.
Chubb and Ayco filed motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint on December 11, 2015. In lieu of opposing the motions to dismiss, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on January 4, 2016. On January 25, 2016, Chubb and Ayco filed motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' amended complaint. The Court granted Ayco's motion to dismiss on March 15, 2016, dismissing the counts against Ayco without prejudice. On March 24, 2016, the Court granted Chubb's motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part: the motion was denied as to the breach of contract claims and granted as to the breach of fiduciary duty and detrimental reliance claims.1 Then, on April 29, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. On May 23, 2016, Ayco and Chubb filed motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' second amended complaint. These motions are presently before the Court.
DISCUSSION
A. Legal Standard
A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests the sufficiency of a complaint. Kost v. Kozakiewicz, 1 F.3d 176, 183 (3d Cir. 1993). The defendant bears the burden of showing that no claim has been presented. Hedges v. United States, 404 F.3d 744, 750 (3d Cir. 2005). When considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a district court should conduct a three-part analysis. See Malleus v. George, 641 F.3d 560, 563 (3d Cir. 2011). "First, the court must `take note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a claim.'" Id. (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 56 U.S. 662, 675 (2009)). Second, the court must accept as true all of a plaintiff's wellpleaded factual allegations and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210-11 (3d Cir. 2009). The court may disregard any conclusory legal allegations. Id. Finally, the court must determine whether the "facts are sufficient to show that plaintiff has a `plausible claim for relief.'" Id. at 211 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679). Such a claim requires more than a mere allegation of an entitlement to relief or demonstration of the "mere possibility of misconduct;" instead, the facts must allow a court to reasonably infer "that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Id. at 210, 211 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79).
B. Analysis
1. Chubb's Motion to Dismiss
The second amended complaint contains claims against Chubb for breach of contract and detrimental reliance. The Court will address each claim in turn.
a. Breach of Contract
In its most recent motion to dismiss, Chubb asserts that the second amended complaint fails to state claims for breach of contract because Plaintiffs' factual allegations of breach are inconsistent with the terms of the agreements. Plaintiffs respond that this argument is barred by the law of the case doctrine, as it was previously considered when the Court decided Chubb's prior motion to dismiss. In the alternative, Plaintiffs assert that this argument is barred by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(g)(2).
The law of the case doctrine "limits relitigation of an issue once it has been decided" in an earlier stage of the same litigation. Hamilton v. Leavy, 322 F.3d 776, 786-87 (3d Cir. 2003) (citing In re Continental Airlines, Inc., 279 F.3d 226, 233 (3d Cir. 2002)). The doctrine is designed to "promote finality, consistency, and judicial economy." Id. at 786. The law of the case doctrine does not limit a federal court's power, but it directs its exercise of discretion. Public Interest Research Group of N.J., Inc. v. Magnesium Elektron, Inc., 123 F.3d 111, 117 (3d Cir. 1997). Courts generally do not revisit prior decisions in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, such as when "(1) new evidence is available; (2) a supervening new law has been announced; or (3) the earlier decision was clearly erroneous and would create manifest injustice." Id. at 116-17. However, this doctrine only applies when decisions are made on the merits of a case. See, e.g., United States v. Hatter, 532 U.S. 557, 566 (2001).
The Court previously considered Chubb's argument that the breach of contract claims against Chubb should be dismissed because Plaintiffs' allegations were inconsistent with the plain language of the agreement. (See Op. 6, ECF No. 64). The Court determined that this defense "goes to the merits of the case and should be raised in responsive pleadings, not in a preanswer motion brought under Rule 12(b)(6)." (Id. (citing Worldcom, Inc. v. Graphnet, Inc., 343 F.3d 651, 657 (3d Cir. 2003)). Moreover, the Court noted that the terms of the life insurance policies were themselves at issue, and that the terms were not "plain and unambiguous." (Op. 6, ECF No. 64).
The Court agrees that this decision was not made on the merits of the breach of contract claims, and thus, the law of the case doctrine does not apply. However, the Court finds that its prior reasoning still holds, and the issue is still premature for consideration at this stage of the litigation. Moreover, Chubb's inclusion of this argument in its second motion to dismiss appears to be an attempt to ask the Court to reconsider its prior opinion without having filed a motion for reconsideration. Given that no motion for reconsideration was filed within the fourteen days allowed under Local Rule 7.1(i), the Court will not reconsider the issue at this time. Therefore, Chubb's motion to dismiss will not be granted as to these claims.2
b. Detrimental Reliance
Chubb further argues that the complaint fails to state a detrimental reliance claim because the additions made to this claim in the second amended complaint "supply very little meat to the bare bones allegations of detrimental reliance the Court found to be insufficient in the [first amended complaint]." (Def.'s Br. 18, ECF No. 76-1). Plaintiffs respond that the detrimental reliance claim should not be dismissed because Plaintiffs plead all of the required elements of the claim.
To establish a claim for detrimental reliance, a plaintiff must establish (1) that the defendant made a representation, (2) that the defendant had knowledge that the plaintiff was acting on the basis of that representation, and (3) that the plaintiff relied to their detriment on that representation. Granelli v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., 569 F. App'x 125, 132 (3d Cir. 2014) (citation omitted); see also Facteon, Inc. v. Comp Care Partners, LLC, No. 13-6765, 2015 WL 519414, at *2 (D.N.J. Feb. 9, 2015) (noting that the elements of a detrimental reliance claim are a clear and definite promise, an expectation by the promisor that the promise would be relied on, and reasonable reliance by the promisee).
In response to Chubb's prior motion to dismiss, the Court found that Plaintiffs pled elements one and two of detrimental reliance but that they failed to address element three, reliance. In the second amended complaint, Plaintiffs allege that
Chubb promised that the Estate Enhancement Program would result in increased benefits to the estates of the participants, that the programs would result in death benefits as set forth in the respective insurance policies, that plaintiffs would not be responsible for additional premiums, and that the program was economically viable.
(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 47, ECF No. 74). Plaintiffs further allege that they relied on Chubb's representations because they "agreed to participate in the program based on [Chubb's] promises." (Id. ¶ 49). While Chubb characterizes these allegations as "bare bones," (Def.'s Br. 18, ECF No. 76-1), more is not required at this juncture.
Chubb also argues that Plaintiffs' reliance is unreasonable as a matter of law based on various statements Chubb made in the contract and in other materials provided to Plaintiffs. However, as noted above, this is not a case where the terms of the contract are plain and unambiguous. Therefore, a decision on this issue is premature at the stage of a motion to dismiss, and so Chubb's motion will be not be granted on this basis.
For the foregoing reasons, Chubb's motion to dismiss will be denied in its entirety.
2. Ayco's Motion to Dismiss
The second amended complaint contains claims against Ayco for negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, and professional malpractice. In its most recent motion to dismiss, Ayco makes multiple arguments. First, Ayco asserts that the complaint fails to state a negligent misrepresentation claim because Plaintiffs fail to plead reliance or a misrepresentation. Second, Ayco argues that all of Plaintiffs' claims are time-barred by the statute of limitations. Third, Ayco disputes Fay's malpractice claim on the grounds that Fay pleads neither causation nor injury. Fourth, Ayco asserts that Fay fails to state a claim for breach of contract because he does not allege that there is a contract under which he can sue. Lastly, Ayco argues that the breach of contract claim is duplicative of Fay's malpractice claim.
a. Statute of Limitations and Negligent Misrepresentation
Plaintiffs assert that Ayco's arguments as to the statute of limitations and their failure to plead a misrepresentation are barred by the law of the case doctrine. The Court previously considered Ayco's argument that the complaint should be dismissed because the claims were time-barred and as well as the argument that Plaintiffs failed to plead misrepresentation, a required element of negligent misrepresentation. (See Op. 5-6, 7, ECF No. 59). In response to the allegations on failure to plead misrepresentation, the Court ruled that "[w]hile Plaintiffs could have provided more detail, these allegations provide enough material to survive a motion to dismiss." (Id. at 7). As for the statute of limitations argument, the Court ruled that accepting all of Plaintiffs' allegations as true—as the Court must when reviewing a motion to dismiss—the claims fell within the statute of limitations. (Id. at 6).
Given that the Court previously decided these issues, and these rulings were on the merits, Ayco's arguments as to the statute of limitations and failure to plead a misrepresentation would be barred by the law of the case doctrine unless one of the exceptions to this doctrine applied. As described above, the three exceptions to the law of the case doctrine are when "(1) new evidence is available; (2) a supervening new law has been announced; or (3) the earlier decision was clearly erroneous and would create manifest injustice." Public Interest Research Group of N.J., Inc., 123 F.3d at 116-17. Ayco has not argued that any of these exceptions apply. Instead, it argues that the Court's prior decisions on this issue were dicta, and thus are not barred by the law of the case doctrine. However, the Court finds that these decisions were integral to the Court's prior opinion, and thus, were not dicta. Because the Court already considered these arguments, and Ayco has not shown that any exception applies, the Court finds that the arguments regarding the statute of limitations and the failure to plead a misrepresentation are barred by the law of the case doctrine. Therefore, Ayco's motion to dismiss will not be granted on these bases.
As for Ayco's argument that Plaintiffs fail to plead justifiable reliance, another required element of negligent misrepresentation, the Court finds that the allegations in the second amended complaint are sufficient. Under New Jersey law, the elements of a negligent misrepresentation claim are: (1) the defendant negligently made a false communication of material fact; (2) the plaintiff justifiably relied upon the misrepresentation; and (3) the reliance resulted in an ascertainable loss or injury. Elias v. Ungar's Food Products, Inc., 252 F.R.D. 233, 251 (D.N.J. 2008). The Court previously found that Plaintiffs failed to plead any factual allegations of justifiable reliance, because they only said that "[p]laintiffs Motamed, Fay, and Fowler justifiably relied on the information supplied to them and the representation that the Estate Enhancement Program would be an effective program when they opted to participate in the program and relinquish their rights to receive benefits under the Chubb Pension Excess Benefit Plan." (Op. at 7, ECF No. 59 (citing Am. Compl. ¶ 61, ECF No. 41)). This allegation was conclusory and did not provide any factual support for Plaintiffs' claim of justifiable reliance.
In the second amended complaint, Plaintiffs add that they justifiably relied on Ayco's misrepresentations because "Ayco is a national organization that held itself out as having expertise in designing and evaluating retirement benefits and programs and was hand-selected by Chubb to be the consultant tasked with providing competent financial advice for its executives." (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 66, 78, 90, ECF No. 74). Further, "[b]ut for Ayco's misrepresentations, [Plaintiffs] would not have agreed to relinquish [their] deferred compensation and participate in the Program." (Id. ¶¶ 67, 79, 91). With the addition of these factual allegations, the Court finds that Plaintiffs adequately pled justifiable reliance. Therefore, Ayco's motion to dismiss the negligent misrepresentation claim will not be granted.
b. Professional Malpractice
Ayco argues that Fay fails to state a claim for professional malpractice because the second amended complaint fails to plead causation or injury. A professional malpractice claim accrues when "(1) the claimant suffers an injury or damages; and (2) the claimant knows or should know that its injury is attributable to the professional negligent advice." Vision Mortgage Corp. v. Patricia J. Chiapperini, Inc., 704 A.2d 97, 100 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1998), aff'd, 722 A.2d 527 (N.J. 1999) (citation omitted). The Court previously dismissed Fay's professional malpractice claim on the grounds that "[b]y failing to state that he participated in the program on the basis of Ayco's advice, Fay has not pled that the injury is `attributable to' or caused by the allegedly professionally negligent advice." (Op. at 9, ECF No. 59). In the second amended complaint, Fay adds that "[b]ut for Ayco's advice, Fay would not have agreed to participate in the Program." (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 116, ECF No. 74). This addition is sufficient for Plaintiffs' claim to survive a motion to dismiss.
As for Ayco's argument that Fay did not plead any injury, the Court notes that Fay pleads that he will suffer the lapse of the insurance policy and unsustainable income tax payments as a result of Ayco's alleged professional malpractice. (Id. ¶ 118). These injuries are sufficient to support a professional malpractice claim. Consequently, Ayco's motion to dismiss the professional malpractice claim will not be granted. c. Breach of Contract
Ayco argues that Fay fails to state a claim for breach of contract because he does not adequately plead that he was a third-party beneficiary of the Chubb-Ayco agreement, as he does not cite specific contract provisions permitting him to raise a direct claim against Ayco. Moreover, Ayco argues that because Fay does not allege a specific contractual duty separate from professional malpractice, the breach of contract claim is subsumed by his malpractice claim.
The Court agrees that the breach of contract claim is duplicative of Fay's professional malpractice claim. Although Fay pleads that the Ayco-Chubb contract exists, he does not plead that any particular provisions of this contract have been breached. Rather, Fay argues that under the contract, Ayco "had a contractual obligation to provide appropriate and competent advice to Fay" that was breached when Ayco recommended that he participate in the Estate Enhancement Program and failed to disclose certain risks. (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 96, ECF No. 74). Specifically, Fay states that "[t]he advice provided by Ayco was below the standard required of a consultant in the insurance industry, and constituted a breach of the contract between Ayco and Chubb." (Id. ¶ 103). In the absence of any additional allegations of breach that go beyond the alleged violations of Ayco's professional duty, the Court finds that the breach of contract claim is duplicative of Fay's professional malpractice claim. See Amboy Bancorporation v. Bank Advisory Grp., Inc., 432 F. App'x 102, 111 (3d Cir. 2011); Lopez-Siguenza v. Roddy, No. 13-2005, 2014 WL 4854452, at *7 (D.N.J. Sept. 30, 2014). Therefore, the breach of contract claim (Count VIII) will be dismissed with prejudice.
Consequently, Ayco's motion to dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part: the motion will be granted as to Count VIII and denied as to all other counts (Counts V, VI, VII, and IX).
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, Chubb's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' second amended complaint will be denied. Ayco's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' second amended complaint will be granted in part and denied in part. The motion will be denied as to Counts V, VI, VII, and IX. The motion will be granted as to Count VIII, and that claim will be dismissed with prejudice. A corresponding order follows.


FootNotes 
1. The detrimental reliance claim was dismissed without prejudice, whereas the breach of fiduciary duty claim was dismissed with prejudice.

2. Plaintiffs also argue that Chubb's argument about the breach of contract claims is barred by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(g)(2), which prohibits "raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion." The Court finds that this rule does not apply because the argument asserted was not omitted from the earlier motion.

The Claimant Thomas F. Motamed was Chairman and CEO of CNA Financial Corporation but apparently the panel made the decision that his position as a chief executive for a financial corporation did not mean that he understood the nature and risks involved with the Lehman structured products. Accordingly, the panel ordered UBS to pay $2.2 million to Mr. Motamed and his wife, Christine. This was 100% of their losses. Additionally, UBS was ordered to pay interest on the $2.2 million at a rate of 6% per annum from April 4, 2008 until the award was paid, plus $13,650 in forum fees for the arbitration. (FINRA# 09-02087; Thomas F. Motamed and Christine B. Motamed v. UBS Financia Services, Inc., R. Ashley Early and Judith L. Sierko)According to FINRA BrokerCheck Reports, the brokers named in the case who worked out of the Charleston, SC office are no longer with UBS since March 2009 and each had other customer complaints filed against them for selling structured products resulting in settlements of between $2.9 million and $3.8 million, in addition to the $2.2 million award to the Motameds.If you have suffered losses from investing in Lehman Brothers’ structured products, please contact our securities law firm for a confidential, no obligation consultation at 1-800-259-9010.
