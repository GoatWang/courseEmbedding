FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Singapore’s Ascott REIT Acquires Sheraton Tribeca NY Hotel for $158M









 Lifen Tang, March 14, 2016March 14, 2016 


 

Singapore’s Ascott Residence Trust (Ascott REIT) (SGX: A68U), a unit of CapitaLand Limited (ADR)(OTC: CLLDY), said it acquired the 369-room Sheraton Tribeca New York Hotel from FC-Canal Ground Tenant LLC for $158 million. This is Ascott Reit’s second acquisition in New York in less than a year.
The acquisition involves the leasehold interest in the land of the 21-story Sheraton Tribeca property expiring in 2112 and a sub-leasehold interest expiring in 2105. The improved hotel land parcel at 350 Canal Street, New York, N.Y., is located on the border of Tribeca and Soho, and is listed as a portfolio property of Lexington Realty Trust (NYSE: LXP). The Sheraton Tribeca was built in 2010.
“Ascott Reit has been acquiring quality assets valued at around S$300 million to S$500 million per annum in the past few years and expects to continue with this strong growth momentum,” said Lim Jit Poh, chairman, Ascott Residence Trust Management Ltd.(ARTML). “Our latest acquisition in New York will expand Ascott Reit’s portfolio to 90 properties with 11,667 apartment units, bringing us a step closer to achieving our target asset size of S$6.0 billion by 2017. Besides the United States of America, we will actively seek accretive acquisitions in key cities of markets such as Australia, Japan and Europe.”
“In 4Q 2015, our maiden acquisition in New York, Element New York Times Square West, was the biggest contributor to revenue growth. With our second acquisition in New York, will make up 10% of our asset size, and Asia Pacific and Europe will constitute 63% and 27% respectively,” said ARTML’s CEO Ronald Tay.
“We target to increase our presence in the United States of America to constitute up to 20% of our asset size by 2017. Our long-term strategy in the United States of America is to acquire a scalable portfolio of stable, operating assets, with an initial target of key gateway cities along the Eastern Seaboard,” added Tay. “Sheraton Tribeca New York Hotel has been achieving strong occupancy of more than 90% in the past year and average daily rate has been growing steadily since its opening in October 2010. Following the acquisition, the hotel will continue to be managed by FC-Canal Management LLC.”
The accretive acquisition at an EBITDA yield of 6.8% is expected to increase Ascott Reit’s  distribution income in FY 2015 by $6.6 million.
The acquisition will be partly funded through a private placement of S$100 million, and the balance through debt. Morgan Stanley is the placement agent and underwriter for the private placement, but is not advising Ascott on the hotel acquisition.
Jones Lang LaSalle Americas (JLL) conducted the property valuation for Ascott Reit.
Ascott Reit’s asset size has quadrupled to S$4.7 billion since it became publicly traded in 2006. The REIT’s international portfolio comprises 89 properties with 11,298 units in 38 cities across 14 countries in the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe. Ascott Reit was awarded ‘Best REIT (Asia)’ by World Finance magazine at its Real Estate Awards in 2015.
Ascott Reit’s serviced residences are mostly operated under the Ascott, Citadines and Somerset brands. They are mainly located in key gateway cities such as Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, Guangzhou, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, London, Manila, Melbourne, Munich, New York, Paris, Perth, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo.
Ascott Reit is managed by ARTML, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Ascott Limited and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CapitaLand Limited (ADR)(OTC: CLLDY), one of Asia’s largest real estate companies, headquartered and listed in Singapore.
CapitaLand’s diversified global real estate portfolio includes integrated developments, shopping malls, serviced residences, offices and homes. Its two core markets are Singapore and China, while Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam have been identified as new growth markets. The company also has one of the largest real estate fund management businesses with assets located in Asia. The company was formerly known as Pidemco Land Limited and changed its name to CapitaLand Limited in November 2000. CapitaLand was founded in 1989. CapitaLand has a market capitalization of $9.47 billion.
