Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

NASD Regulation Charges Josephthal & Co., Inc. and Top Execs with Fraud and Unfair Dealing With Customers | FINRA.org

NASD Regulation Charges Josephthal & Co., Inc. and Top Execs with Fraud and Unfair Dealing With Customers




Washington, D.C.—NASD Regulation, Inc., today announced that it has issued a complaint charging Josephthal & Co., Inc., New York, NY; Dan D. Purjes, Chief Executive Officer; Paul H. Fitzgerald, Managing Director of Capital Markets; and Matthew I. Balk, former Senior Managing Director for Equity Marketing, with fraud and unfair business practices with investors in connection with security sales.
According to NASD Regulation’s complaint, in late May 1996, Josephthal violated federal securities laws and NASD conduct rules during a massive sales effort aimed at selling, from their inventory, over 1.1 million common shares of VictorMaxx Technologies, Inc. (VMAX). As the underwriter of VictorMaxx’ initial public offering and market maker for the stock, Josephthal supported the stock from August 1995 until the beginning of May 1996. By mid-May 1996, the firm had suffered a loss of between $3 and $4 million on the inventory held in the stock.
In an effort to cut its losses, Purjes, Fitzgerald, and Balk decided to sell the position to the firm’s customers. However, it is alleged that the firm’s representatives had shown little interest in retailing the stock until mid-May when, to induce the sales force to move the stock, Purjes, Fitzgerald, and Balk paid them commissions of about 29 percent of an investor’s total purchase of the stock. As a result, from May 17-May 31, 1996, the Josephthal sales force aggressively recommended VictorMaxx to its customers. During these 10 business days, Josephthal brokers sold almost 1,000,000 shares in over 400 customer transactions at an average price of $2.10 per share. Sales during the two-week effort represented nearly 36 percent of the tradable shares of the common stock. Josephthal remained a market maker in the security throughout the fraudulent sales effort.
Shortly after Josephthal sold its position, the market price of VictorMaxx tumbled. Within a month, it was below a dollar, where it has remained since. On October 24, 1996, it was delisted from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market and by the fourth quarter of 1996 the price ranged from $.01 to $.375. Thus, an investor in VictorMaxx who purchased during the May sales effort and held onto that stock for no more than 45 days would have incurred more than a 50 percent loss. According to the complaint, in violation of the firm’s obligation of fair dealing, at no time did it disclose to its customers its plan to quickly dispose of its losing inventory position through a massive retail sales effort fueled by an extremely high special sales credit to its sales force.
The complaint also notes that just days before the start of the VictorMaxx sales effort, Josephthal and Purjes had settled, with the NASD, a case with almost identical violations.
NASD Regulation did not allege that VictorMaxx, Inc., which is listed on the OTC Bulletin BoardSM, knew that Josephthal was selling off its stock in the marketplace or engaged in any wrongdoing.
The issuance of a disciplinary complaint represents the initiation of a formal proceeding by NASD Regulation in which findings as to the allegations in the complaint have not been made and does not represent a decision as to any of the allegations contained in the complaint. Because this complaint is unadjudicated, the respondents should be contacted before drawing any conclusion regarding the allegations in the complaint.
Under NASD rules, the individuals and the firm named in the complaint can file a response and request a hearing before an NASD Regulation disciplinary panel. Possible sanctions include a fine, suspension, bar, or expulsion from the NASD.
This matter was investigated by NASD Regulation’s District Office in Denver, Colorado.
Investors can obtain the disciplinary record of any NASD-registered broker or brokerage firm by calling (800) 289-9999, or by sending an e-mail through NASD Regulation’s Web site.
NASD Regulation oversees all U.S. stockbrokers and brokerage firms with public customers. NASD Regulation and The Nasdaq Stock Market are subsidiaries of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD®) the largest securities-industry self-regulatory organization in the United States.

Matthew McConaughey Talks Hair Loss

American actor Matthew McConaughey is best known for films such as How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days and The Lincoln Lawyer. You may have also heard the rumours that have been circling for some time with regards to his apparent hair loss and subsequent regrowth.
Pull The Plug On Transplant Rumours
The Texas native has been rumoured to have had hair plugs, otherwise known as FUE or Follicular Unit Extraction, a surgical procedure where ‘plugs’ of hair are extracted from the back of the scalp (where male pattern hair loss does not effect) and transplanted onto the areas of hair loss atop the scalp. This is the most common form of hair transplant, as unlike strip surgery, where a strip of skin is removed from the back of the head, it leaves no scarring.
However, the actor revealed in the March issue of Elle magazine that he has in fact been using a hair loss treatment to get his hair back. Whilst we can’t comment on the effectiveness of the 31 year old’s chosen treatment, we do know that a medically backed hair loss treatment programme should always be the first method to try before a hair transplant is attempted.
Moony Advice
The actor also had some other interesting advice, although we’re a bit sceptical about its effectiveness! He explained: “If you want your hair to be thicker, cut it when the moon is about to be full – a heavy, full, waxing moon.”
It is generally recommended that a treatment plan that contains at least one of the medications licensed by the MHRA and approved by the FDA for the treatment of hair loss is tried for six months before a transplant is considered. Many men believe that a transplant is the only effective way to tackle hair loss, but by using a plan containing Propecia and minoxidil, hair can often be regrown and the natural progression of hair loss halted.
 Treatment Before Transplant
Finasteride 1mg – a drug commonly known by its first original brand name, Propecia – and minoxidil work in different ways, so are highly complementary when taken together. Finasteride 1mg helps to stop all over thinning of scalp hair by blocking the effects of powerful androgen DHT, which causes follicle miniaturisation in those genetically predisposed to pattern hair loss. Minoxidil is a vasodilating substance that can take care of a receding hairline and other areas of stubborn loss such as a thinning crown, when recommended formulations of high strength minoxidil are applied directly to the affected area(s) either once or twice per day, as recommended.
Of course, McConaughey can combine his hair loss treatment with many other complementary additions that combine to create a comprehensive hair care and regrowth plan. For instance, the FDA cleared LaserComb is a device that emits a low power laser to stimulate deep into scalp and encourage a faster rate of regrowth. There is also the option of taking the supplement Hair Vitalics, which ensures that even a busy actor like McConaughey is getting the right vitamins and minerals for optimum hair growth.

HERE Is the Final Word on MATTHEWs HT.
