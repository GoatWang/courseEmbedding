Marketing Haikus from Ron Coughlin

















Thursday, May 3, 2007







Brilliant





With marketing like this...how can any of us not realize that the old... get the ad from the ad agency on Madison Avenue, go to the media firm and optimize the GRPs and create a website that delivers the product message.... model is a disadvantaged one.  This is brilliant and what is more brilliant is the fact that Smirnoff has generated millions and millions of "word of mouth" generated (aka free) impressions for their new product.

The Mirror is broken





My most random unformed posting yet...is the first casualty of the newly empowered informed consumer the classic purely "reflective" advertising model?...eg. "we as a brand embody the same values or interests as you (reflect your aspirations) and therefore we are the brand for you and a brand through which you express who you are".  It seems to me that with so many brands with so many new exciting and specific benefits tailored to sub group's needs, purely lifestyle reflective advertising and packaging may be a thing of the past.

NO DEAD ENDSHeard a snippet from the communications Chief at Whirlpool that builds on the idea of 3D marketing. The principle is "no dead ends". Each element of the marketing mix must have an active link to the another element of the marketing mix. A dead end is a commercial that doesn't link to a text activity or a web activity or a package that doesnt encourage a second experience by phone, web or person. Dead ends are lost consumer engagements, lost brand bonding opportunities and lost efficiency. Great term jeff and who doesn't want to see more of the Maytag repairman

Found the snippet below on a Business Week Survey of Advertising/Marketing leaders.  For me, user generated content is merely a manifestation of an enabled consumer.  Today, the more you enable the consumers to participate in the construction of your products and communication... the better off you'll be.  The more you enable the consumer to tailor how they interact with the brand and its components.... the better off you'll be.  Sometimes, culture boils things down to their most superficial level -- user generated ads may be a passing fad... However, lets not miss the important part...there are increasing numbers of consumers who want to engage with our brands at a level not contemplated by our mass market textbooks.  Further, the more our brands and products tell "stories" as Seth Godin likes to proselytize... the more consumer desire for engagement will grow.A great example...we did a bit of research and found that over 30% of viewers of our TV ads would be interested in our website, yet less than 35% could see the website address from the end of one of our ads.   Now, dogma says we don't want to waste too much time featuring the website at the end of the ad, because thats "boring"... yet there are a significant group of consumers who want to engage more actively.  The winners will be those with new approaches and who challenge assumptions to create new paradigms.  User generated content is only today's tip of that iceburg.SNIPPET BELOW........The world of marketing and advertising is rife with buzzwords and catch phrases, and to round out the survey, we asked respondents which words and phrases they were most sick of hearing. At the top of the list? "Buzz marketing," "viral," and "user-generated content"—the videos made by fans either for brand-sponsored competitions or as personal YouTube productions.And what did they predict they'll be most sick of hearing about next year? "User-generated content" rose to the top of the list. Though they may be sick of user-generated content, Cornelius said she, for one, is skeptical the trend will go away. "I think agencies fear losing control, but agencies who are sick of it now will be sick of it next year. It's here to stay."

Spent last week in Shanghai with our new Marketing VP, Harry Hui. Harry joined us from the music industry, where he ran Universal Music's Asia business. Besides, reminding me that Shanghai is the most exciting place on the planet. The trip was a great reminder of a few important things... We need to keep our eyes open to the outside world. Harry took me to the #1 web television broadcaster and the #2 web based gaming company, where the average employee age was 24. These are the companies that are defining the world for our teens. We can not only learn alot from these companies, but they can also be powerful partners.Look for inspiration in new places. Harry took me to a Chinese herbalist. The doctor, who was a descendant of the doctor who took care of the last Emperor, told me I had too much heat inside and that I needed to CALM DOWN. Didn't need to fly 18 hours to find that out. Enough about me... What we were there for was to find inspiration for new products. This was the most important herbalist in China addressing issues that aren't even recognized in the West with functional ingredients products that have thousands of years of resonance.Look East young man (woman). Used to be that we came from NY to teach our Asian marketers from the famous book of Kotler, P&G, Enrico, Pottash, etc. Now, with every trip to Asia, I come back with a new perspective that I can bring to the rest of the world. The pace of change is so fast, the consumers, media players and marketers are less entrenched with "how its always been" -- a lethal combination that creates the most exciting marketing on the planet.

setting up my blog





So today I entered the future or the current...who knows. My first blog (Marketing Haiku's by Ron Coughlin). Took me all of 1 minute. Wondered why I'd waited so long...Wondered whether this is the right place to set up the blog or if this is the "wrong" place to do so. Wondered what I'd actually say, now that I have a blog. Feels good to actually publish something.I set this up to catalog and share the hundreds and thousands of bits of marketing brilliance, insight and insanity that I see in my travels. I set it up to share thoughts with others and to begin a dialogue. Lets begin...

Can HP's split help it beat the PC slump?

As HP prepares to split into two companies, the company's president of 
  Personal Systems tells Sophie Curtis it plans to be at the forefront 
  of creating new product categories












Ron Coughlin will be president of HP Inc's Personal Systems business

 On the first day of next month, HP, the American technology giant that was famously founded in a garage in Palo Alto in 1939, is splitting in two. The company’s data centre infrastructure business – comprising servers, storage and networking – will become Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, and its PC and printer business will become HP Inc.  It is arguably the biggest upheaval in the company’s history. While HP has bought and spun off many subsidiaries in its 76 years – from 2001’s $24bn acquisition of Compaq to the $12bn purchase of Autonomy in 2011 that turned into a major corporate scandal – it has never overhauled its core structure in quite such a dramatic fashion.  The two companies will be of practically equal size: HP estimates that HP Enterprise will have revenue strength of $58bn and operating profits of $6bn, while HP Inc will have revenues of $57bn and operating profit of $5bn.  The man responsible for the lion’s share of the latter is Ron Coughlin. Under the new structure he will be president of HP Inc’s Personal Systems business, putting him in charge of PCs, tablets, accessories and their related services – a unit that currently brings in $35bn of revenues. Coughlin will report to Dion Wesler, HP Inc’s new chief executive, with HP’s current chief, Meg Whitman, taking over the other side of the company when the two split.  “What makes us most excited about the new HP Inc is the ability to have the creativity and speed of an entrepreneur and the scale of a Fortune 100 company,” said Mr Coughlin. “This means that when we have a great idea, we’re going to move fast, and we’re going to create new categories, but at the same time, when we get that idea, we can put it in every country, every city, every province in the world.”  Some argue that the split is long overdue. Former chief executive Leo Apotheker proposed spinning off the company’s PC business in 2011, but the plan was dropped following pressure from shareholders, which ultimately led to Apotheker’s departure.  Meg Whitman took the helm of Hewlett Packard shortly before it acquired Autonomy for $11.1bn (£7.7bn) in 2011  Photo: Reuters Ms Whitman led a reorganisation of the company in 2012 that saw the PC business combined with the Imaging and Printing Group, helping to pave the way for the current separation plan.  HP is now taking a big leaf out of the book of IBM, another major IT supplier, which realised years ago that it was never going to be a one-stop shop for corporates, and started to sell off “non-core” businesses such as printers, PCs and servers. Rather than gradually divesting businesses though, it is splitting, which offers several advantages. Existing shareholders will get shares in both companies, and the two have agreed not to compete with each other for three years after the split. They will partner to buy supplies, jointly sell products to customers, and share patents and other intellectual property.  Mr Coughlin said part of the reason that the previous attempt to spin off the PC business was unsuccessful was because of “brand dis-synergies”. In other words, HP had decided that the PC business would suffer if it was not able to use its famous brand to sell its products.  This time, both companies will get to keep HP in their name, which Mr Coughlin said “took a lot of the dis-synergy out, and really unlocked the value”.  HP Spectre x2 HP Inc will focus on three key areas – “core”, which is about using HP’s clout and scale to offer high-end features at the lowest possible cost, “growth”, which is about focusing on fast-growing categories like all-in-one PCs and convertibles, and “future” – creating new product categories.  At its consumer event in Barcelona this week, the company unveiled a slew of new devices with this new strategy in mind, including the Spectre x2, a elegant lightweight tablet with a detachable metal keyboard, an all-in-one PC with a huge 34-inch curved display, and a range of colourful HP Stream cloud-based Windows laptops.  The company is also looking to the future with its recently launched Sprout computing platform, which combines an all-in-one desktop computer with two touch displays, a scanner, a depth sensor, a high-resolution camera and a projector, to create a 3D computing experience – or in HP's parlance, “Blended Reality”.  “We have been on a drumbeat of innovation. It started in October 2014, when we launched our Blended Reality,” says Mr Coughlin. “It was a vision last October, it’s becoming a reality now. Today if you go on HP.com, we sell Sprout. We also sell Sprout bundled with a 3D printer – 40pc of Sprout sales come bundled with a 3D printer.”  HP Sprout However, splitting the company into two comes at a price. HP stands to lose $400m to $450m during the split. The company hopes its cost-cutting efforts will help offset that number. Last month, HP said it expects to cut about 33,300 jobs over the next three years, on top of the 55,000 layoffs previously announced. The latest cuts represent a 10pc reduction in the company’s total workforce.  Revenue from the PC and printer business – what will become HP Inc after the split – fell 11.5pc in its fiscal third quarter, which ended on July 31. HP has said it expects the market for PCs and printers to remain tough for “several quarters”: the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, as well as sluggish business investment, has meant both corporate customers and consumers holding back on buying computers.  Despite this, Mr Coughlin is optimistic about the future of the PC market, and confident of HP’s place within it. The addressable market for personal systems – hardware ranging from PCs to printers to mobile devices – is worth $340bn, he said, with half of that market growing at nine per cent.  “We have a scale market with significant growth pockets, and we’ve proven we can gain share in the PC category,” he said. “I’m also optimistic because we have momentum. We are blessed with being able to go public with one of the world’s strongest brands. Our marketing engine has never revved stronger.”    On the whole, analysts tend to agree that HP Inc has an opportunity to take a lead in the development of innovative hardware, in partnership with Microsoft, which under its chief executive, Satya Nadella, is undergoing something of a revolution focused on its new Windows 10 software. However, many believe that it has to look beyond its traditional markets, having seen the smartphone revolution pass it by almost completely.  The growing “internet of things” industry – connecting everyday devices to mobile or Wi-Fi connections to improve efficiency – could be one of these, especially given HP’s reputation among enterprises.  Coughlin says that operating as a separate company will allow HP Inc to invest more money in new categories as well as creating its own, rather than simply pouring all of its research and development budget into improving its existing technology. This is not only an intent but has been built into the new company’s framework, he says, highlighting how Mr Wesler was announced as HP Inc’s new chief executive when the company unveiled its next-generation Sprout technology a year ago.  “It’s not by chance,” Coughlin says. “It highlights the fact that innovation is going to be a centrepiece of the company under his leadership.”  Forrester analyst Peter Burris said that HP Inc will need to “place some big bets” and “run like the wind” if it hopes to play a role in shaping the consumer device and services industry. However, Mr Coughlin said that HP Inc will only play in markets where it can add value, both in terms of experience and from a shareholder perspective.  “Our focus is commercial mobility. In January we launched eight new devices in four vertical focus areas – retail, field service, education and healthcare. A great example is our healthcare tablet that is antimicrobial, it has a camera to scan the patient’s tag, so the whole idea is mobilising work flows, and that’s our focus. We can add value there, we believe there’s a need, we don’t believe our competitors serve that market well and we believe that there’s profit pools there,” he said.  “We don’t chase share for share’s sake. We don’t believe that we can do well in the $79 tablet market. I don’t think that anybody is going to do well there. In commercial, the good news is that the whole category has profit, and is such that you can offer great experience and great return for shareholders.”
