Moodys Investors Service Upgrades Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Universitys Credit Rating
  


July 22, 2017 -- 






















  Daytona Beach, Florida (PRWEB) July 22, 2017  Moody's Investors Service (?Moody's") has increased its credit rating for Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University from Baa1 to A3. This investment-grade rating is the highest underlying rating the University has received from Moody's. Moody's announced the increase on July 18, 2017, citing the University's large and growing scale of operations and consistently positive operating performance as well as strong fiscal management. ?We are extremely pleased to receive the upgraded rating from Moody's," said Mori Hosseini, Chair of Embry-Riddle's Board of Trustees. ?This upgrade is a result of the commitment of the Embry-Riddle Board and Administration to being good stewards of the University's financial resources. A consistent focus on operating efficiencies and strategic investments in our programs and our facilities has clearly strengthened the University." Dr. P. Barry Butler, President of Embry-Riddle, noted that the Moody's report commented on the University's disciplined financial and capital planning. ?The Board and the Administration work very closely together in these two key areas," he said. ?Students are the ultimate benefactors of the increased rating. Now, the University will have access to even lower interest rates, which will allow us to continue to focus on affordability and our graduates' return on investment."  Moody's further indicated that the University's market niche as the leading provider of aviation and aerospace technology-related education was a key strength.    ?The rating is also indicative of the University's strategic positioning," Dr. Butler added. Further, ?our focus on relevant, STEM-related degrees has contributed to increased enrollment."  The announcement by Moody's can be found online. About Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, the world's largest, fully accredited university specializing in aviation and aerospace, is a nonprofit, independent institution offering more than 80 baccalaureate, master's and Ph.D. degree programs in its colleges of Arts & Sciences, Aviation, Business, Engineering and Security & Intelligence.

        Dan White: Action is necessary on Medicaid
    


By Dan White
The Philadelphia Inquirer

Jul 21, 2017

Over the past few weeks, much of the country seems finally to have woken up to the reality that we are on a highly unsustainable fiscal path. One of the key drivers of that unsustainability, at both the federal and state levels, is Medicaid.Much has been written on this subject in response to the health-care bill winding its way through the Senate, and at this point it can be easy to conflate opinion with reality. Here are three of the most important facts about Medicaid.First and foremost, the program is incredibly important. Just over 70 million Americans get their health insurance through Medicaid. Many of those people are on the extreme lower end of the income distribution, and the program’s existence has saved countless lives since its inception in the mid-1960s.
Second, insuring that many people isn’t cheap. The program will cost roughly $600 billion this year, around $8,500 per Medicaid recipient.Third, and of most interest lately, the program’s costs are growing much faster than the revenue used to pay for them.This is projected to continue. According to the last actuarial report from the Obama administration, Medicaid costs will grow an average of more than 6 percent per year over the next decade. Meanwhile, nominal personal income, the collective pool of income out of which all of us pay our taxes, will grow just over 4 percent per year.This means that every year, there will be a roughly two percentage point growth mismatch in the amount of money we need to spend on Medicaid and the amount of money we will collect to pay for it. This funding gap is not new; it has persisted ever since the program was first instituted, and has resulted in Medicaid taking up a larger and larger portion of overall government spending.At the federal level, this is relatively simple to deal with. We issue more Treasury bonds and run up the national debt to pay for the mismatch. At the state level things get a bit more complicated. States must have balanced budgets, and as such are a zero-sum game. Every additional dollar they have to spend on Medicaid is a dollar that cannot be spent on other things like education, public safety, or infrastructure.Thus, as Medicaid has grown from about 9 percent of state budgets in the mid-1980s to almost 20 percent today, other spending programs have shrunk in proportion. The next time you get upset because you see funding for things like public universities or K-12 schools decline as a share of the budget, you’ll know why. In response, one of the most simplistic and commonly proposed solutions to this problem is to raise taxes.Raising taxes is the right solution when a level shift in funding is required, for example when adding a new program to the budget. But Pennsylvania and other states don’t have a level problem, they have a growth problem.
Raising taxes in this instance would only give us more rope to hang ourselves with. Because spending would still accelerate faster than revenue, in short order we would be right back to where we started, only with a greater tax burden on the economy.One of the biggest points of contention in the Senate health-care bill is Toomey’s proposal to cap Medicaid growth at the rate of inflation. In a strict sense this would not be a cut to Medicaid, in that Medicaid spending is not declining from one year to the next. Rather, the measure would force the program, at the federal level, to grow much more slowly than it otherwise would.This provision of the bill holds monumental implications for Medicaid as well as the federal and state budgets. The only problem is that reasonable people can disagree vehemently about whether those implications are good or bad.At the heart of the matter is whether or not you can slow the pace of health-care cost growth by turning down the amount of government money you pour into health care. Medicaid has continuously grown faster than the economy, not because of increases in the number of people enrolled, but because of increases in the cost per enrollee.
Sound theory suggests that this is at least in part because the government is required by law to pay into the system as much as is necessary to cover a recipient’s health-care costs, and this gives little incentive for the system to keep costs low.This is a core tenet of many conservative economists’ work, but it is a concept also recognized by many left of center as well. In theory, then, capping the pace at which Medicaid spending can increase from one year to the next should eventually reduce the rate at which underlying health-care costs grow, which again is a fiscal necessity for both the federal and state governments.The problem is what happens if this approach does not work, or does not work quickly. The federal government would be better off fiscally and protected from risk because of the cap. State governments are the ones essentially operating without a net under this scenario.If underlying costs don’t fall in line with the capped growth in federal spending, states will have to make up the difference. Thus so much of the consequences of this proposed policy ultimately depend on how states handle the reforms. Their reaction would be limited to two options: Limit the number of Medicaid enrollees, or find ways to limit growth in cost per enrollee. Neither would be an easy lift.The only thing that is clear in this debate is that we are beyond the point of questioning whether or not action is necessary. The only question now is what action to take. Continuation of the status quo is not an option.

      diluted EPS excludes a $0.13 unrealized gain on a foreign currency 
      collar to economically hedge the Bureau van Dijk euro-denominated 
      purchase price (the “Purchase Price Hedge Gain”) and $0.03 of 
      Acquisition-Related Expenses.
    

MCO SECOND QUARTER 2017 REVENUE UP 8%


      Moody’s Corporation reported global revenue of $1.0 billion for the 
      second quarter of 2017, up 8% from the second quarter of 2016.
    

      U.S. revenue was $567.8 million, up 4%, and non-U.S. revenue was $432.7 
      million, up 13%. Revenue generated outside the U.S. constituted 43% of 
      total revenue, up from 41% in the prior-year period. The impact of 
      foreign currency translation was negligible.
    

MIS Second Quarter Revenue Up 10%


      Global revenue for Moody’s Investors Service (MIS) for the second 
      quarter of 2017 was $686.7 million, up 10% from the prior-year period. 
      U.S. revenue was $412.4 million, up 3%, and non-U.S. revenue was $274.3 
      million, up 21%. The impact of foreign currency translation was 
      negligible.
    

      Corporate finance revenue was $355.8 million, up 17% from the prior-year 
      period. This result reflected a favorable mix within each of U.S. 
      leveraged finance issuance and EMEA investment grade issuance, as well 
      as strong growth in EMEA bank loan issuance and Asian bond issuance. 
      U.S. and non-U.S. corporate finance revenues were up 6% and 40%, 
      respectively.
    

      Structured finance revenue totaled $119.2 million, up 7% from the 
      prior-year period, primarily driven by the continued strength of U.S. 
      CLO issuance. U.S. structured finance revenue was up 12%, while non-U.S. 
      revenue was down 3%.
    

      Financial institutions revenue was $102.4 million, up 14% compared to 
      the prior-year period. This result was largely driven by an increase in 
      issuance from infrequent issuers in EMEA. U.S. and non-U.S. financial 
      institutions revenues were up 8% and 20%, respectively.
    

      Public, project and infrastructure finance revenue was $104.7 million, 
      down 7% from the prior-year period. This result was primarily driven by 
      a decline in U.S. issuance and a change in mix of European 
      infrastructure issuance. The revenue decline was partially offset by 
      strong growth in infrastructure issuance in Asia. U.S. public, project 
      and infrastructure finance revenue was down 12%, while non-U.S. revenue 
      was up 4%.
    

MA Second Quarter Revenue Up 3.5%


      Global revenue for Moody’s Analytics (MA) for the second quarter 2017 
      was $313.8 million, up 3.5% from the second quarter of 2016. U.S. 
      revenue was $155.4 million, up 6%, and non-U.S. revenue was $158.4 
      million, up 1%. The impact of foreign currency translation was 
      negligible.
    

      Revenue from research, data and analytics (RD&A) was $180.9 million, up 
      7% from the prior-year period. This result was primarily driven by 
      strength in sales of credit research and ratings data feeds. U.S. and 
      non-U.S. RD&A revenues were up 6% and 10%, respectively.
    

      Enterprise risk solutions (ERS) revenue of $97.3 million was flat to the 
      second quarter of 2016 primarily due to the timing of revenue 
      recognition for customer projects, many of which are expected to 
      complete in the second half of the year. U.S. ERS revenue was up 7%, 
      while non-U.S. revenue was down 5%.
    

      Revenue from professional services of $35.6 million was down 5% from the 
      prior-year period. U.S. professional services revenue was up 6%, while 
      non-U.S. revenue was down 10%.
    

SECOND QUARTER 2017 OPERATING EXPENSE UP 5%


      Second quarter 2017 operating expense for Moody’s Corporation was $543.0 
      million, up 5% from the prior-year period. The increase was primarily 
      attributable to annual salary increases, higher accruals for incentive 
      compensation and the Acquisition-Related Expenses, partially offset by a 
      decline in non-compensation expenses and a favorable foreign currency 
      translation impact of 2%.
    

      Operating income was $457.5 million, up 12% from the prior-year period. 
      Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by 1%. 
      Adjusted operating income of $497.0 million was up 13% from the 
      prior-year period. Operating margin was 45.7%, up from 44.2%. Adjusted 
      operating margin was 49.7%, up from 47.5%.
    

      Moody’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was 32.1%, up 
      from 31.9% in the prior-year period.
    

FIRST HALF 2017 REVENUE UP 13%


      For Moody’s Corporation overall, global revenue was $1,975.7 million for 
      the first half of 2017, up 13% from the first half of 2016. U.S. revenue 
      was $1,145.6 million, up 12%, while non-U.S. revenue was $830.1 million, 
      up 15% from the prior-year period. The impact of foreign currency 
      translation was negligible.
    

      MIS revenue totaled $1,354.9 million for the first half of 2017, up 18% 
      from the prior-year period. U.S. revenue was $834.9 million, up 14%. 
      Non-U.S. revenue was $520.0 million, up 25%, and represented 38% of MIS 
      revenue, up from 36% in the first half of 2016.
    

      MA revenue totaled $620.8 million for the first half of 2017, up 4% from 
      the prior-year period. U.S. revenue of $310.7 million was up 7%. 
      Non-U.S. revenue was $310.1 million, up 2%, and represented 50% of MA 
      revenue, down from 51% in the first half of 2016.
    

FIRST HALF 2017 OPERATING EXPENSE UP 4%


      Operating expense for Moody’s Corporation in the first half of 2017 was 
      $1,074.8 million, up 4% from the prior-year period. Foreign currency 
      translation favorably impacted expense by 2%.
    

      Operating income was $900.9 million, up 26% from the first half of 2016. 
      Foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by 1%. 
      Adjusted operating income of $972.9 million was up 25% from the 
      prior-year period. Moody’s reported operating margin was 45.6% and its 
      adjusted operating margin was 49.2%.
    

      The effective tax rate for the first half of 2017 was 27.8%, down from 
      32.1% in the prior-year period, primarily due to a first quarter 
      non-cash, non-taxable gain from a strategic realignment and expansion 
      involving Moody’s Chinese affiliate China Cheng Xin International Credit 
      Rating Co. Ltd. (the “CCXI Gain”) and a tax benefit from the adoption of 
      the new accounting standard for equity compensation ASU 2016-09, 
      “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.”
    

      Diluted EPS of $3.39 for the first half of 2017 was up 51% compared to 
      the same period in 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS of $2.99 for the first 
      half of 2017 was up 33% from the same period in 2016. First half 2017 
      adjusted diluted EPS excludes the $0.31 per share CCXI Gain, the $0.13 
      per share Purchase Price Hedge Gain and $0.04 per share of 
      Acquisition-Related Expenses.
    

2017 CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND LIQUIDITY


$152.1 Million Returned to Shareholders in 
      Second Quarter


      During the second quarter of 2017, Moody’s repurchased 0.7 million 
      shares at a total cost of $79.5 million, or an average cost of $115.35 
      per share, and issued 0.4 million shares as part of its employee 
      stock-based compensation plans. Moody’s also returned $72.6 million to 
      its shareholders via dividend payments during the second quarter of 2017.
    

      Over the first half of 2017, Moody’s repurchased 1.2 million shares at a 
      total cost of $134.5 million, or an average cost of $114.06 per share, 
      and issued 1.9 million shares as part of its employee stock-based 
      compensation plans. Moody’s also returned $145.2 million to its 
      shareholders via dividend payments during the first half of 2017.
    

      Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2017 totaled 191.0 million, down 1% 
      from June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2017, Moody’s had $0.6 billion of 
      share repurchase authority remaining.
    

      As part of Moody’s financing of the pending acquisition of Bureau van 
      Dijk, in June 2017, Moody’s issued $1.0 billion of notes consisting of 
      $500.0 million of 2.625% senior unsecured notes due 2023 and $500.0 
      million of 3.250% senior unsecured notes due 2028. At quarter-end, 
      Moody’s had $4.9 billion of outstanding debt and $1.5 billion of 
      additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility 
      and undrawn term loan.
    

      Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter-end 
      were $3.4 billion, up 51% from December 31, 2016, primarily reflecting 
      the financing for the pending acquisition of Bureau van Dijk. Cash flow 
      from operations for the first half of 2017 was $(47.7) million, a 
      decline from $546.4 million in the first half of 2016. Free cash flow 
      for the first half of 2017 was $(90.5) million, a decline from $492.1 
      million in the first half of 2016. These declines in cash flow were due 
      to payments the Company made in the first quarter of 2017 pursuant to 
      its 2016 settlement with the Department of Justice and various states 
      attorneys general.
    

ASSUMPTIONS AND OUTLOOK FOR FULL YEAR 2017


      Moody’s outlook for 2017 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical 
      conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors, including 
      interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, corporate profitability 
      and business investment spending, mergers and acquisitions, consumer 
      borrowing and securitization, and the amount of debt issued. These 
      assumptions are subject to uncertainty, and results for the year could 
      differ materially from our current outlook. The Company’s guidance 
      assumes foreign currency translation at end-of-quarter exchange rates. 
      Specifically, the Company’s forecast reflects exchange rates for the 
      British pound (£) of $1.30 to £1 and for the euro (€) of $1.14 to €1.
    

      Certain components of Moody’s 2017 guidance have been modified to 
      reflect the company’s current view of business conditions. This guidance 
      does not include estimates of Bureau van Dijk’s financial results as the 
      acquisition has not yet closed.
    

      Full year 2017 diluted EPS is now expected to be $5.69 to $5.84 which 
      includes the CCXI Gain, the Purchase Price Hedge Gain and 
      Acquisition-Related Expenses. Excluding these items, full year 2017 
      adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be $5.35 to $5.50. Please refer 
      to Table 11 – 2017 Outlook for a reconciliation of diluted EPS to 
      adjusted diluted EPS. Both ranges include an estimated $0.16 per share 
      tax benefit due to the adoption of the new accounting standard for 
      equity compensation as well as an estimated $0.14 per share impact from 
      the financing expenses related to the pending acquisition of Bureau van 
      Dijk and a reduction of share repurchase activity as a consequence of 
      financing the acquisition.
    

      Moody’s now projects an adjusted operating margin of approximately 47%.
    

      Moody’s now expects revenue to increase in the high-single-digit percent 
      range.
    

      For MIS, Moody’s now expects revenue to increase in the 
      high-single-digit-percent range. U.S. revenue is still expected to 
      increase in the mid-single-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue 
      is now expected to increase in the low-teens percent range.
    

      Corporate finance revenue is now expected to increase in the low-teens 
      percent range. Financial institutions revenue is now expected to 
      increase in the high-single-digit percent range.
    

      For MA, Moody’s now expects revenue to increase in the 
      high-single-digit-percent range. U.S. revenue is now expected to 
      increase in the mid-single-digit percent range and non-U.S. revenue is 
      now expected to increase in the low-double digit percent range.
    

      RD&A revenue is now expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent 
      range.
    

      A full summary of Moody’s guidance as of July 21, 2017, is included in 
      Table 11 – 2017 Outlook at the end of this press release.

      Moody’s business and operations that involve a number of risks and 
      uncertainties. The forward-looking statements in this release are made 
      as of the date hereof, and the Company disclaims any duty to supplement, 
      update or revise such statements on a going-forward basis, whether as a 
      result of subsequent developments, changed expectations or otherwise. In 
      connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is identifying examples of 
      factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to 
      differ, perhaps materially, from those indicated by these 
      forward-looking statements. Those factors, risks and uncertainties 
      include, but are not limited to, world-wide credit market disruptions or 
      an economic slowdown, which could affect the volume of debt and other 
      securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets; other 
      matters that could affect the volume of debt and other securities issued 
      in domestic and/or global capital markets, including regulation, credit 
      quality concerns, changes in interest rates and other volatility in the 
      financial markets such as that due to the U.K.’s referendum vote whereby 
      the U.K. citizens voted to withdraw from the EU; the level of merger and 
      acquisition activity in the U.S. and abroad; the uncertain effectiveness 
      and possible collateral consequences of U.S. and foreign government 
      actions affecting world-wide credit markets, international trade and 
      economic policy; concerns in the marketplace affecting our credibility 
      or otherwise affecting market perceptions of the integrity or utility of 
      independent credit agency ratings; the introduction of competing 
      products or technologies by other companies; pricing pressure from

      development and global expansion; the impact of regulation as an NRSRO, 
      the potential for new U.S., state and local legislation and regulations, 
      including provisions in the Financial Reform Act and regulations 
      resulting from that Act; the potential for increased competition and 
      regulation in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions; exposure to 
      litigation related to our rating opinions, as well as any other 
      litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and 
      inquires to which the Company may be subject from time to time; 
      provisions in the Financial Reform Act legislation modifying the 
      pleading standards, and EU regulations modifying the liability 
      standards, applicable to credit rating agencies in a manner adverse to 
      credit rating agencies; provisions of EU regulations imposing additional 
      procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services; the

      other cybersecurity concerns; the outcome of any review by controlling 
      tax authorities of the Company’s global tax planning initiatives; 
      exposure to potential criminal sanctions or civil remedies if the 
      Company fails to comply with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that 
      are applicable in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, 
      including sanctions laws, anti-corruption laws, and local laws 
      prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials; the impact of 
      mergers, acquisitions or other business combinations and the ability of 
      the Company to successfully integrate acquired businesses; currency and 
      foreign exchange volatility; the level of future cash flows; the levels 
      of capital investments; and a decline in the demand for credit risk 
      management tools by financial institutions. Other factors, risks and 
      uncertainties relating to our pending acquisition of Bureau van Dijk 
      could cause our actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those 
      indicated by these forward-looking statements, including the ability of 
      the parties to successfully complete the proposed acquisition on 
      anticipated terms and timing, or at all; risks relating to the 
      integration of Bureau van Dijk’s operations, products and employees into 
      Moody’s and the possibility that anticipated synergies and other 
      benefits of the proposed acquisition will not be realized in the amounts 
      anticipated or will not be realized within the expected timeframe; risks 
      that the proposed acquisition could have an adverse effect on the 
      business of Bureau van Dijk or its prospects, including, without 
      limitation, on relationships with venders, suppliers or customers; 
      claims made, from time to time, by venders, suppliers or customers; 
      changes in the European or global marketplaces that have an adverse 
      effect on the business of Bureau van Dijk; and other factors, risks and 
      uncertainties relating to the transaction as set forth under the caption

      Act of 1995 ” in Moody’s report on Form 8-K filed on May 15, 2017, which 
      are incorporated by reference herein. These factors, risks and 
      uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause 
      Moody’s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated, 
      expressed, projected, anticipated or implied in the forward-looking 
      statements are described in greater detail under “Risk Factors” in Part 
      I, Item 1A of the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year 
      ended December 31, 2016, and in other filings made by the Company from 
      time to time with the SEC or in materials incorporated herein or 
      therein. Stockholders and investors are cautioned that the occurrence of 
      any of these factors, risks and uncertainties may cause the Company’s 
      actual results to differ materially from those contemplated, expressed, 
      projected, anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements, 
      which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s 
      business, results of operations and financial condition. New factors may 
      emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to 
      predict new factors, nor can the Company assess the potential effect of 
      any new factors on it.

Table 7 - Transaction and Relationship Revenue




           
        



          The tables below summarize the split between transaction and 
          relationship revenue. In the MIS segment, excluding MIS Other, 
          transaction revenue represents the initial rating of a new debt 
          issuance as well as other one-time fees while relationship revenue 
          represents the recurring monitoring of a rated debt obligation 
          and/or entities that issue such obligations, as well as revenue from 
          programs such as commercial paper, medium-term notes and shelf 
          registrations. In MIS Other, transaction revenue represents revenue 
          from professional services and outsourcing engagements and 
          relationship revenue represents subscription based revenues. In the 
          MA segment, relationship revenue represents subscription-based 
          revenues and software maintenance revenue. Transaction revenue in MA 
          represents software license fees and revenue from risk management 
          advisory projects, training and certification services, and 
          analytical and research engagements.

Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin:




           
        



          The Company presents Adjusted Operating Income because management 
          deems this metric to be a useful measure of assessing the operating 
          performance of Moody’s. Adjusted Operating Income excludes 
          depreciation and amortization and Acquisition-Related Expenses. 
          Acquisition-Related Expenses consist of expenses incurred to 
          complete and integrate the pending acquisition of Bureau van Dijk. 
          Depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize 
          productive assets of different ages and use different methods of 
          acquiring and depreciating productive assets. Acquisition-Related 
          Expenses are excluded due to the material nature of these expenses 
          which are not expected to recur at this dollar magnitude subsequent 
          to the completion of the multi-year integration effort. Acquisition 
          related expenses from previous acquisitions were not material. 
          Management believes that the exclusion of depreciation and 
          amortization and Acquisition-Related Expenses, detailed in the 
          reconciliation below, allows for an additional perspective on the 
          Company’s operating results from period to period and across 
          companies. The Company defines Adjusted Operating Margin as Adjusted 
          Operating Income divided by revenue.

          The table below reflects a reconciliation of the Company’s net cash 
          flows from operating activities to free cash flow. The Company 
          defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities 
          minus payments for capital additions. Management deems capital 
          expenditures essential to the Company’s product and service 
          innovations and maintenance of Moody’s operational capabilities. 
          Accordingly, capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use 
          of Moody’s cash flow. Management believes that free cash flow is a 
          useful metric in assessing the Company's cash flows to service debt, 
          pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases.

Table 10 - Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share 
          Attributable to Moody's Common Shareholders




           
        



          The Company presents this adjusted measure to exclude the CCXI Gain 
          and the Purchase Price Hedge Gain as the frequency and magnitude of 
          similar transactions may vary widely across periods. Additionally, 
          the Company excludes Acquisition-Related Expenses due to the 
          material nature of these expenses which are not expected to recur at 
          this dollar magnitude subsequent to the completion of the multi-year 
          integration effort. Acquisition-Related Expenses from previous 
          acquisitions were not material. Acquisition-Related Expenses consist 
          of expenses incurred to complete and integrate the pending 
          acquisition of Bureau van Dijk. This measure allows for an 
          additional perspective when comparing Moody’s net income and diluted 
          earnings per share from period to period. Below is a reconciliation 
          of this measure to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP amount:

Table 11 - 2017 Outlook




           
        



          Moody’s outlook for 2017 is based on assumptions about many 
          geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market 
          factors, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, 
          corporate profitability and business investment spending, mergers 
          and acquisitions, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the 
          amount of debt issued. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, 
          and results for the year could differ materially from our current 
          outlook. Our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at 
          end-of-quarter exchange rates. Specifically, our forecast reflects 
          exchange rates for the British pound (£) of $1.30 to £1 and for the 
          euro (€) of $1.14 to €1. This guidance does not include revenue and 
          operating expense estimates related to the pending acquisition of 
          Bureau van Dijk.

IQALUIT, Nunavut, July 20 -- The government of Nunavut, a Canadian territory, issued the following news release:Finance Minister Keith Peterson is pleased that, for the fifth year in a row, Moody's Investors Service has reaffirmed the Government of Nunavut's (GN) continued credit rating of Aa1 with a stable outlook. This rating was first assigned to the GN in August 2012."Maintaining our Aa1 rating for the fifth year in a row shows that the Government of Nunavut's prudent approach to spending is recognized as one of the strengths of our government," said Minister Peterson. "Our government's careful budgeting, low debt and strategic decisions about where to invest have allowed us to fulfill our fiscal responsibility."Moody's credit opinion highlights the GN's substantial federal transfers that support revenue stability, its low and affordable debt burden - the lowest of all provinces and territories - and its track record of modest consolidated surpluses among its credit strengths. However, Moody's also points out that over the medium term the GN will continue to face pressures, primarily because of ongoing operating and infrastructure spending, a narrow and volatile economy with a dependence on the mining sector, and evolving governance and management policies.An issuer credit rating is an independent opinion about whether an organization is able and willing to meet its financial obligations.

State Of The Economy: SA’s Junk Status Could Last For At Least 6 Years  

Post by  Chika Udeh    July 20, 2017

Not minding all that has been said about the future of the South African economy and how important it is for all hands to be on deck to bring it back to its feet, an economist said the current South Africa’s junk status will last for not two, four, but for at least six years.
A lot has been predicted about what lies ahead concerning the state of the South African economy since it was downgraded to junk status and later recessed.
Lesiba Mothata who is the executive chief economist for Alexander Forbes Investment Solutions predicts that the South African credit rating which was downgraded earlier this year, would stay until 2023 but added that this wasn’t ‘the end of the world’ as there’s light at the end of the tunnel for the country.

SA’s credit ratings was downgraded to Junk status by three rating agencies after they expressing concern over the political upheavals, government debt, and in particular the sacking of Mr Gordhan and replacing him with Malusi Gigaba.
Speaking about people’s reaction to the announcements by Moodys and S&P rating agencies, Mothata said: “People ask if SA is more like Zimbabwe or more like Venezuela. Yet, we have seen the spectacular bond performance and globally it looks like there will be continued demand for emerging market debt.
“I am not saying there are no risks. There are, for instance, concerns about left leaning policy here.”
He said he is confident that South Africa can negotiate the current economic conditions, but they have to take advantage of growth in sub-Saharan Africa to help them restore confidence in the economy.







“Don’t have an exaggerated view of the downgrades or its economic outcome. I have a glass half full approach. SA policy error risks are substantial and it has become a confidence issue now. Yet, I believe SA can weather the storm.” he said, adding that it is likely that the economic status will receive a further downgrade in December, but urged people to keep a calmer perspective.
The economist, however, noted that the state-owned entities including the South African Airline (SAA) and Eskom, are causing the most stress to the economy as their ill performances undermined investor confidence.
Privatisation is, however, not the answer. Especially not for Eskom, who could “make electricity very expensive, he said.
Six years seems a long time to wait for economic improvement, but somehow, the rand has survived a barrage of setbacks in 2017. This is our biggest source of optimism.

Meanwhile, some analysts who have been exploring the long-term consequences of a credit downgrade for South Africa disagree with Finance Minister, Malusi Gigaba, that its effects will be minimal on ordinary citizens.
For the analysts, the down grade means that investors both domestic and foreign will require more in terms of interest. It also means that government will have less money to spend on basic services and yet our government has committed to a lot of basic services provision especially to the poor, which means in all likelihood taxes will go up; that means that inflation will go up. Interest rates aren’t going to come down, so you’ll continue to pay more on your credit card debt and car loans than you would have if we had a stable economy.
Downgrading  SA to junk would increase South Africa’s debt-servicing costs, seen at R144-billion in the 2016/17 fiscal year. Thus, paying higher debt costs would mean less money for critical services such as housing, education and sanitation, which could incite more protests that have rocked towns across the country.

European Union – Rising Challenges to Growth and Integration


                        The European Union and its core, the euro area, continues to face a challenging growth outlook and the risk of political fragmentation is rising. This page presents Moody's research related to key credit issues concerning growth and stability challenges within the EU
                    



Changing tides: politics, elections and credit risk


                        The far-reaching nature of various political shifts under way across the world, particularly in advanced economies, has raised the potential for significant changes in policy direction. On this page, you will find Moody's research about key credit issues related to upcoming elections and political developments globally
                    



Environmental Risks and Developments


                        Concern over environmental change is leading to significant government policy initiatives globally and rising corporate innovation and investment. This heightened attention will lead to disruptive industry change, shifting investor capital allocation strategies and rising input costs related to increased pricing on carbon emissions and water usage. At the same time, severe environmental events, whether natural (earthquakes, hurricanes, droughts and floods) or man-made (oil spills and nuclear accidents), are of growing concern to many market participants who are concerned natural events are increasing in frequency and severity. This page highlights Moody's research on the credit implications of these developing environmental trends.

A History of Impact With more than 100 years of history in the bond rating business, the Moody’s name is synonymous with global leadership in credit risk.
Learn more about our rich history:







1900

John Moody & Company commences operations, publishing Moody’s Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities. Addressing investors’ need for information in the fast-growing public securities markets centered in New York City, the Moody’s Manual provides statistics on stocks and bonds across a range of companies and public sector borrowers. Within two months, the book is completely sold out.







1903

Moody’s Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities becomes a best seller in the United States.







1907

The stock market crashes. Without enough capital to survive the downturn, John Moody sells his manual business.







1909

John Moody returns to the financial market, this time with an analysis of securities values. His company publishes a book that analyzes the stocks and bonds of America’s railroads and offers valuable conclusions about their investment potential. The publication is the first ever to rate public market securities and is an overnight success.







1913

With Moody’s ratings now a factor in the bond market, John Moody expands his business to evaluate industrial companies and utilities.







1914

Moody’s Investors Service (MIS) is incorporated as the rating business expands to cover bonds issued by US cities and municipalities.







1924

Moody’s ratings cover almost 100% of the US bond market.







1930s

In the throes of the Great Depression, Moody’s provides valuable insight and analysis. With bond defaults soaring, those that are highly rated by Moody’s consistently prove to be of superior credit quality, rarely missing payments.







1962

Dun & Bradstreet acquires Moody’s.







1970s

Moody’s ratings extend to cover the commercial paper market and bank deposits.







1975

The US Securities and Exchange Commission introduces the concept of Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NSRO). MIS is one of the first companies to be designated as an NRSRO.







1980s

With growing competition, Moody’s launches the Corporate Credit report service to provide institutional investors with insight into its rating assignments. The transparency provided by this research enables investors to better understand the rationale underlying Moody’s ratings.







2000

Moody’s spins off from Dun & Bradstreet to trade publicly under the NYSE symbol MCO.







2000

Seeking to build on its reputation for expertise in credit analysis by developing tools for banks to make better commercial lending decisions, Moody’s makes several acquisitions that result in the development of Moody’s Risk Management Services and products including RiskAnalyst.







2002

Moody’s acquires KMV which over the previous decade pioneered the application of modern financial theory to derive credit scores on a purely quantitative basis. Together with MIS’s ratings based on the fundamental analysis of credit professionals, Moody’s now offers best-of-breed credit metrics based on both qualitative and quantitative techniques. KMV and MRMS are integrated.







2005

Moody’s acquires Economy.com, a provider of macroeconomic research and econometric modeling services. The acquisition enables Moody’s to provide deeper economic context for the company- and industry-specific analysis provided by MIS.







2006

Moody’s acquires Wall Street Analytics, a leading provider of data and analytics for mortgage- and asset-backed securities. WSA’s cash flow modeling tools supplement the insight provided by Moody’s ratings of securitized transactions, broadening the company’s relevance in the fast-growing structured finance market.







2008

Moody’s Corporation reorganizes, creating two operating companies: Moody’s Investors Service, focusing exclusively on the assignment and monitoring of credit ratings and development of credit research; and Moody’s Analytics, which provides a wide range of information products, software solutions, and professional services to support the risk management activities of financial institutions worldwide.







2008

Moody’s Analytics acquires Fermat expanding its software product offering to include solutions that support regulatory capital calculations and reporting requirements under the BIS bank capital standards, as well as asset-liability management and exposure management.







2010

Moody’s Analytics acquires CSI Global Education, the exclusive provider of education and examinations required for licensing in the Canadian securities industry. CSI significantly extends MA’s financial training business, adding deep expertise in certification and credentialing to the product portfolio.







2011

Moody’s acquires a majority stake in Copal Partners. Founded in 2002 in India to support the corporate finance departments of leading investment banks, Copal Partners is the pioneer of financial research outsourcing to the sector.







2011

Moody’s Analytics acquires Barrie & Hibbert, a leading provider of specialized analytical capabilities for insurance company asset valuation. Based in Scotland, B&H represents the extension of MA’s Enterprise Risk Solutions business into the insurance industry, building on our leading position in banking.







2013

Moody’s acquires Amba Research, a leading provider of investment research and analytics support services to the global capital markets industry, creating CopalAmba.







2014

Moody’s Analytics acquires WebEquity Solutions to expand its penetration of the US bank segment. With over 800 community banks and credit unions as clients of its SaaS-delivered LendingCloud product, WebEquity bolsters MA’s position as the leader in US bank loan origination software.







2014

Moody’s Analytics acquires Lewtan, a provider of information and analytics to the securitization markets. Lewtan expands MA’s footprint with trading desks and asset managers specializing in structured securities, and also extends our product offering for issuers of such securities.







2014

Moody’s completes its acquisition of remaining stake in CopalAmba – a market and quality leader in providing custom research services (information, analysis, and insight) to the financial and corporate sectors. This acquisition complements Moody’s broader focus on packaged and off-the-shelf research, technology, and tools.







2015

Moody’s acquires Equilibrium, a provider of credit rating and research services in Peru and other countries in Latin America.







2016

Moody’s Analytics acquires GGY, the leading provider of actuarial software to Canadian insurers. Based in Toronto, GGY accelerates MA’s expansion in financial risk analytics for insurers worldwide.







2016

Moody’s acquires full ownership of Korea Investors Service (KIS), a leading provider of domestic credit ratings in Korea. Founded in 1985, KIS serves the domestic capital markets in Korea with credit ratings, research and other services. Moody’s first acquired a majority stake in KIS in 2001.

                Our rating methodologies describe the analytical framework rating committees use to assign ratings. As set forth in the methodologies, our methodologies are not intended to present an exhaustive treatment of all factors reflected in our ratings. Rather, they describe the key qualitative and quantitative considerations that are usually most important for assessing credit risk in a given sector. Each rating committee applies its own judgment in determining whether or how to emphasize rating factors it considers to be of particular significance. Although most of our methodologies apply to a particular industry, sector or class of issuers or transactions, some describe our approach to analytical considerations that aren’t specific to any single sector. Typically these cross-sector methodologies cover general credit-related topics and can be used in conjunction with sector-specific methodologies to assign ratings. The Methodology Development Group (MDG) develops and the Methodology Review Group (MRG) reviews and approves our methodologies for all rating groups, including sovereign, financial institutions, structured finance, corporate finance, and public, project and infrastructure finance.

Moody's Corporation, often referred to as Moody's, is an American business and financial services company. It is the holding company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), an American provider of financial analysis software and services.
Moody's was founded by John Moody in 1909 to produce manuals of statistics related to stocks and bonds and bond ratings. Moody's was acquired by Dun & Bradstreet in 1962. In 2000, Dun & Bradstreet spun off Moody's Corporation as a separate company that was listed on the NYSE under MCO. In 2007, Moody's Corporation was split into two operating divisions, Moody's Investors Service, the rating agency, and Moody's Analytics, with all of its other products.[4]

History of Moody's[edit]
Moody's Corporation traces its history back to two publishing companies established by John Moody, the inventor of modern bond credit ratings. It was first published in 1900 by John Moody, nine years before he founded Moody's Corporation. Initially called Moody's Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities, it was later superseded by Moody's Manual of Railroads and Corporation Securities, then by Moody's Analyses of Investments.[5][6]
In 1900, Moody published his first market assessment, called Moody's Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities, and established John Moody & Company.[7] The publication provided detailed statistics relating to stocks and bonds of financial institutions, government agencies, manufacturing, mining, utilities, and food companies. It experienced early success, selling out its first print run in its first two months.
By 1903, Moody's Manual was a nationally recognized publication.[8] The 1907 financial crisis fueled several changes in the markets, including the creation of the Federal Reserve System.[7] Meanwhile, Moody was forced to sell his business, due to a shortage of capital.[8] Moody returned in 1909 with a new publication focused solely on railroad bonds, Analysis of Railroad Investments,[9][10] and a new company, Moody's Analyses Publishing Company.[7]
In 1962, Moody's Investors Service was bought by Dun & Bradstreet, a firm engaged in the related field of credit reporting, although they continued to operate largely as independent companies.[11] By the late 1990s, Moody's superior performance compared to its parent company brought investor pressure to separate the businesses.[12] In December 1999, Dun & Bradstreet announced it would spin off Moody's Investors Service into a separate publicly traded company.[13] The spin-off was completed on September 30, 2000.[14]
Moody's Investors Service[edit]
Main article: Moody's Investors Service
Moody's Investors Service is the bond credit rating business of Moody's Corporation, representing the company's traditional line of business and its historical name. Moody's Investors Service rates debt securities in several market segments related to public and commercial securities in the bond market. These include government, municipal and corporate bonds; managed investments such as money market funds, fixed-income funds and hedge funds; financial institutions including banks and non-bank finance companies; and asset classes in structured finance.[15]
Moody's Investors Service's closest competitors are Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Group. Together, they are sometimes referred to as the Big Three credit rating agencies. Moody's Investors Service and its close competitors play a key role in global capital markets as a supplementary credit analysis provider for banks and other financial institutions in assessing the credit risk of particular securities.[16]
According to Moody's, the purpose of its ratings is to "provide investors with a simple system of gradation by which future relative creditworthiness of securities may be gauged". To each of its ratings from Aa through Caa, Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3; the lower the number, the higher-end the rating. Aaa, Ca and C are not modified this way.[17][18]
Moody's Analytics[edit]
Main article: Moody's Analytics
Moody's Analytics is a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation established in 2007 to focus on non-rating activities.[19] It performs economic research related to credit analysis, performance management, financial modeling, structured analysis and financial risk management. Moody's Analytics also offers software and consulting services, including proprietary economic models and software tools, as well as professional training for the financial services sector, particularly risk management accreditation.
Moody's Analytics started in 1995 as a business unit providing quantitative analysis services, including credit risk assessment software and services, called Moody's Risk Management Service (MRMS),[7][14] and grew through partnerships and acquisitions in the late 1990s and 2000s, expanding its client base and capabilities.[14] Acquisitions included KMV, Economy.com, Wall Street Analytics, Fermat International, Enb Consulting Ltd., The Institute of Risk Standards and Qualifications (iRSQ) and CSI Global Education Inc.[20]
The Moody's Foundation[edit]
In 2002, Moody's Corporation created a corporate philanthropy program, The Moody's Foundation, focused on educational initiatives in mathematics, economics and finance. The organization offers grants to 501(c)(3) non-profits and equivalent international organizations, accredited schools and some governmental organizations.[21]
Since 2006, its main program is the annual Moody's Mega Math Challenge (M3 Challenge), a student academic challenge co-sponsored with the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM),[22] in which several hundred teams of high school students use quantitative analysis and modeling to solve problems related to real-life financial topics such as Social Security and the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008.[23][24] Since 2010[25]
Moody's Research Labs[edit]
Moody's Research Labs, Inc. was a business incubator focused on research and development specializing in financial risk modeling and analysis, focused on developing such products for use by other divisions of Moody's Corporation.[26] Its president was Roger Stein.[27] In March 2011 Moody's Analytics announced the release of a software program developed by Moody's Research Labs, the Mortgage Portfolio Analyzer, to assist portfolio managers in managing credit risk.[28] Moody's Research Labs was dissolved in February 2012.
Lawsuit Settlements[edit]
October 2011 - Moody’s reached a settlement resolving claims by the state of Connecticut that the credit rating company unfairly gave lower ratings to public bonds.[29]
July 2012 - Moody’s said it reached a settlement with stockholders in lawsuits filed over structured finance ratings.[30]
April 2013 - Moody's reached a settlement avoiding what would have been their first jury trial over crisis-era ratings. The fourteen plaintiffs, were led by Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and King County, Washington. They claimed lawsuits filed in 2008 and 2009 that Moody's misled them by allegedly inflating ratings on two so-called structured investment vehicles they purchased.[31]

Moody's Corporation, often referred to as Moody's, is an American business and financial services company. It is the holding company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), an American provider of financial analysis software and services.
Moody's was founded by John Moody in 1909 to produce manuals of statistics related to stocks and bonds and bond ratings. Moody's was acquired by Dun & Bradstreet in 1962. In 2000, Dun & Bradstreet spun off Moody's Corporation as a separate company that was listed on the NYSE under MCO. In 2007, Moody's Corporation was split into two operating divisions, Moody's Investors Service, the rating agency, and Moody's Analytics, with all of its other products.[4]

History of Moody's[edit]
Moody's Corporation traces its history back to two publishing companies established by John Moody, the inventor of modern bond credit ratings. It was first published in 1900 by John Moody, nine years before he founded Moody's Corporation. Initially called Moody's Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities, it was later superseded by Moody's Manual of Railroads and Corporation Securities, then by Moody's Analyses of Investments.[5][6]
In 1900, Moody published his first market assessment, called Moody's Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities, and established John Moody & Company.[7] The publication provided detailed statistics relating to stocks and bonds of financial institutions, government agencies, manufacturing, mining, utilities, and food companies. It experienced early success, selling out its first print run in its first two months.
By 1903, Moody's Manual was a nationally recognized publication.[8] The 1907 financial crisis fueled several changes in the markets, including the creation of the Federal Reserve System.[7] Meanwhile, Moody was forced to sell his business, due to a shortage of capital.[8] Moody returned in 1909 with a new publication focused solely on railroad bonds, Analysis of Railroad Investments,[9][10] and a new company, Moody's Analyses Publishing Company.[7]
In 1962, Moody's Investors Service was bought by Dun & Bradstreet, a firm engaged in the related field of credit reporting, although they continued to operate largely as independent companies.[11] By the late 1990s, Moody's superior performance compared to its parent company brought investor pressure to separate the businesses.[12] In December 1999, Dun & Bradstreet announced it would spin off Moody's Investors Service into a separate publicly traded company.[13] The spin-off was completed on September 30, 2000.[14]
Moody's Investors Service[edit]
Main article: Moody's Investors Service
Moody's Investors Service is the bond credit rating business of Moody's Corporation, representing the company's traditional line of business and its historical name. Moody's Investors Service rates debt securities in several market segments related to public and commercial securities in the bond market. These include government, municipal and corporate bonds; managed investments such as money market funds, fixed-income funds and hedge funds; financial institutions including banks and non-bank finance companies; and asset classes in structured finance.[15]
Moody's Investors Service's closest competitors are Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Group. Together, they are sometimes referred to as the Big Three credit rating agencies. Moody's Investors Service and its close competitors play a key role in global capital markets as a supplementary credit analysis provider for banks and other financial institutions in assessing the credit risk of particular securities.[16]
According to Moody's, the purpose of its ratings is to "provide investors with a simple system of gradation by which future relative creditworthiness of securities may be gauged". To each of its ratings from Aa through Caa, Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3; the lower the number, the higher-end the rating. Aaa, Ca and C are not modified this way.[17][18]
Moody's Analytics[edit]
Main article: Moody's Analytics
Moody's Analytics is a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation established in 2007 to focus on non-rating activities.[19] It performs economic research related to credit analysis, performance management, financial modeling, structured analysis and financial risk management. Moody's Analytics also offers software and consulting services, including proprietary economic models and software tools, as well as professional training for the financial services sector, particularly risk management accreditation.
Moody's Analytics started in 1995 as a business unit providing quantitative analysis services, including credit risk assessment software and services, called Moody's Risk Management Service (MRMS),[7][14] and grew through partnerships and acquisitions in the late 1990s and 2000s, expanding its client base and capabilities.[14] Acquisitions included KMV, Economy.com, Wall Street Analytics, Fermat International, Enb Consulting Ltd., The Institute of Risk Standards and Qualifications (iRSQ) and CSI Global Education Inc.[20]
The Moody's Foundation[edit]
In 2002, Moody's Corporation created a corporate philanthropy program, The Moody's Foundation, focused on educational initiatives in mathematics, economics and finance. The organization offers grants to 501(c)(3) non-profits and equivalent international organizations, accredited schools and some governmental organizations.[21]
Since 2006, its main program is the annual Moody's Mega Math Challenge (M3 Challenge), a student academic challenge co-sponsored with the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM),[22] in which several hundred teams of high school students use quantitative analysis and modeling to solve problems related to real-life financial topics such as Social Security and the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008.[23][24] Since 2010[25]
Moody's Research Labs[edit]
Moody's Research Labs, Inc. was a business incubator focused on research and development specializing in financial risk modeling and analysis, focused on developing such products for use by other divisions of Moody's Corporation.[26] Its president was Roger Stein.[27] In March 2011 Moody's Analytics announced the release of a software program developed by Moody's Research Labs, the Mortgage Portfolio Analyzer, to assist portfolio managers in managing credit risk.[28] Moody's Research Labs was dissolved in February 2012.
Lawsuit Settlements[edit]
October 2011 - Moody’s reached a settlement resolving claims by the state of Connecticut that the credit rating company unfairly gave lower ratings to public bonds.[29]
July 2012 - Moody’s said it reached a settlement with stockholders in lawsuits filed over structured finance ratings.[30]
April 2013 - Moody's reached a settlement avoiding what would have been their first jury trial over crisis-era ratings. The fourteen plaintiffs, were led by Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and King County, Washington. They claimed lawsuits filed in 2008 and 2009 that Moody's misled them by allegedly inflating ratings on two so-called structured investment vehicles they purchased.[31]

Moody's to pay $3.3 billion to buy Dutch business intelligence company Bureau van Dijk
Moody's Corp.  said Monday it will buy Dutch business intelligence company Bureau van Dijk for 3 billion euro, or the equivalent of $3.27 billion. Moody's said the deal, which is expected to close late in the third quarter, will be funded through cash held offshore and new debt financing. Moody's expects the deal to add to adjusted earnings per share in 2018 and to GAAP EPS in 2019. Bureau van Dijk is currently owned by investment firm EQT. "Bureau van Dijk is a high growth information aggregator and distributor that positions Moody's at the center of a unique network of global risk data," said Moody's CEO Raymond McDaniel. "This acquisition provides significant opportunities for Moody's Analytics to offer complementary products, create new risk solutions and extend its reach to new and evolving market segments." Moody's stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has soared 22% year to date while the S&P 500  has gained 6.8%.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody's Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.  This MD&A contains Forward-Looking Statements. See "Forward-Looking Statements" commencing on page 55 and Item 1A. "Risk Factors" commencing on page 17 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.  THE COMPANY  Moody's is a provider of (i) credit ratings, (ii) credit, capital markets and economic related research, data and analytical tools, (iii) software solutions and related risk management services, (iv) quantitative credit risk measures, financial services training and certification services and (v) research and analytical services. Moody's has two reportable segments: MIS and MA.  MIS, the credit rating agency, publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. Revenue is primarily derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors. Additionally, MIS earns revenue from certain non-ratings-related operations which consist primarily of the distribution of research and financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region as well as revenue from ICRA's non-ratings revenue. The revenue from these operations is included in the MIS Other LOB and is not material to the results of the MIS segment.  The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support financial analysis and risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. Within its RD&A business, MA distributes research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, including in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies and commentary on topical credit-related events. The RD&A business also produces economic research as well as data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores. Within its ERS business, MA provides software solutions as well as related risk management services. The PS business provides research and analytical services and financial training and certification programs.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  Moody's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody's to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody's evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, contingencies, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and other retirement benefits, UTBs and stock-based compensation. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management's judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable, fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable.  Pursuant to ASC Topic 605, when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables, the Company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.  The Company's products and services will generally qualify as separate units of accounting under ASC Topic 605. The Company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand-alone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the Company's control. In instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit.  28 MOODY'S 2016 10K  Table of Contents  The Company determines whether its selling price in a multi-element transaction meets the VSOE criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or, if the deliverable is not yet being sold separately, the price established by management having the relevant authority to establish such a price. In instances where the Company is not able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement, which may be due to the Company infrequently selling each element separately, not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range, or only having a limited sales history, the Company attempts to establish TPE for deliverables. The Company determines whether TPE exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing, possible differences in its market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the Company may contain a significant level of differentiation and/or customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained, the Company generally is unable to reliably determine TPE. Based on the selling price hierarchy established by ASC Topic 605, when the Company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, the Company will establish an ESP. ESP is the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. The Company establishes its best estimate of ESP considering internal factors relevant to is pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives, standalone sales prices of similar products, percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service, and customer segment and geography. Additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend. The Company reviews its determination of VSOE, TPE and ESP on an annual basis or more frequently as needed.  In the MIS segment, revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued. Revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities, structured credit, international residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities, which was approximately 25 years on a weighted average basis at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately $133 million, $121 million, and $107 million.  Multiple element revenue arrangements in the MIS segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service. In instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort, fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees. The Company generally uses ESP in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the Company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish VSOE or TPE for initial ratings.  MIS estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which, in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee, issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding. Revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available. The estimate is determined based on the issuers' most recent reported quarterly data. At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, accounts receivable included approximately $25 million, $24 million, and $22 million, respectively, related to accrued commercial paper revenue. Historically, MIS has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings. Furthermore, for certain annual monitoring services, fees are not invoiced until the end of the annual monitoring period and revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period. At December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, accounts receivable included approximately $159.1 million, $146.4 million, and $127.8 million, respectively, relating to accrued monitoring service revenue.  In the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include software licenses and related maintenance, subscriptions, and professional services. Revenue from subscription based products, such as research and data subscriptions and certain software-based credit risk management subscription products, is recognized ratably over the related subscription period, which is principally one year. Revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer. If uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service, revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs. Software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period. Revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized as the services are performed. A large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of November, December and January.  Products and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and non-software deliverables, revenue is allocated to the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables, as a group, using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.  If the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using VSOE. In the instances where the Company is not able to determine VSOE for all of the deliverables of an arrangement, the Company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its VSOE and the  MOODY'S 2016 10K 29  Table of Contents  residual revenue to the delivered elements. If the Company is unable to determine VSOE for an undelivered element, the Company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the Company has delivered all of the elements or when VSOE has been determined for the undelivered elements. In cases where software implementation services are considered essential and VSOE of fair value exists for post-contract customer support ("PCS"), once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, license and service revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis as implementation services are performed, while PCS is recognized over the coverage period. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for PCS, once the delivery criteria has been met on the standard software, service revenue is recognized on a zero profit margin basis until essential services are complete, at which point total remaining arrangement revenue is then spread ratably over the remaining PCS coverage period. If VSOE does not exist for PCS at the beginning of an arrangement but is established during implementation, revenue not recognized due to the absence of VSOE will be recognized on a cumulative basis.  Accounts Receivable Allowance  Moody's records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue, based on historical experience and current conditions. Such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Additionally, estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Actual billing adjustments and uncollectible account write-offs are charged against the allowance. Moody's evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and invoice adjustment experience as well as the current aging status of customer accounts. Moody's also considers the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Based on its analysis, Moody's adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances. This process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, Moody's results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance. Management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write-offs under current conditions. However, significant changes in any of the above factors, or actual write-offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the Company's consolidated results of operations.  Contingencies  Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management's best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities.  For claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, where it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In other instances, where a loss is reasonably possible, management does not record a liability because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, but discloses the contingency if significant. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation, regulatory, governmental investigations and inquiries, enforcement and similar matters and contingencies, particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also cannot predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition. However, in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them, the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages, an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time.  The Company's wholly-owned insurance subsidiary insures the Company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker's compensation, employment practices litigation, employee medical claims and terrorism, for which the claims are not material to the Company. In addition, for claim years 2008 and 2009, the insurance subsidiary insured the Company for defense costs related to professional liability claims. For matters insured by the Company's insurance subsidiary, Moody's records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion. The Company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management's best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as  30 MOODY'S 2016 10K  Table of Contents  well as actuarially determined estimates. Defense costs for matters not self-insured by the Company's wholly-owned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided.  For income tax matters, the Company employs the prescribed methodology of Topic 740 of the ASC which requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.  Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  On July 31 of each year, Moody's evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.  The Company has six primary reporting units: two within the Company's ratings business (one for the ICRA business and one that encompasses all of Moody's other ratings operations) and four reporting units within MA: RD&A, ERS, FSTC and MAKS. The RD&A reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor-oriented research and data developed by MIS as part of its ratings process, in-depth research on major debt issuers, industry studies, economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools. The ERS reporting unit provides products and services that support the credit risk management and regulatory compliance activities of financial institutions and also provides advanced actuarial software for the life insurance industry. These products and services are primarily delivered via software that is licensed on a perpetual basis or sold on a subscription basis. The FSTC reporting unit consists of the portion of the MA business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and implementation services. The MAKS reporting unit, formerly known as Copal Amba, provides research and analytical services. Copal Amba was renamed Moody's Analytics Knowledge Services in December 2016.  The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a three-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. If a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist, the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the Company concluding that it is more  likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company must perform a third step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions or realignments. For the reporting units where the Company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach, the Company's accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years. At July 31, 2016, the Company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on all reporting units, which resulted in no impairment of goodwill.  In January 2017 there was a management change in the MAKS business. As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, a new operating and strategic plan for this reporting unit under the new management structure has not yet been completed. Based on all available information, the Company does not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the MAKS reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount at December 31, 2016. A quantitative impairment assessment for the MAKS reporting unit will be performed in the first quarter of 2017 upon the completion of revised financial projections under the new management structure which could result in a reduced fair value as compared to the July 31, 2016 fair value.  Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and appropriate comparable market metrics. However, as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain, actual future results may differ from these estimates. In addition, the Company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units.  Other assets and liabilities, including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units.  MOODY'S 2016 10K 31  Table of Contents  Sensitivity Analyses and Key Assumptions for Deriving the Fair Value of a Reporting Unit  The following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of December 31, 2016 as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in ASC Topic 350, assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of July 31, 2016, which was the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units.   Sensitivity Analysis Deficit Caused by a Hypothetical Reduction to Fair Value Goodwill 10% 20% 30% 40% MIS $ 46.3 $ - $ - $ - $ - RD&A 174.7 - - - - ERS 323.5 - - - - FSTC 85.2 - - (14.4 ) (34.6 ) MAKS 159.9 - - - (6.5 ) ICRA 234.0 - - - - Totals $ 1,023.6 $ - $ - $ (14.4 ) $ (41.1 )  Methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining of the fair value of reporting units:  The following is a discussion regarding the Company's methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units, excluding ICRA, as of July 31, 2016, the date of each reporting unit's last quantitative assessment. As ICRA is a publicly traded company in India, the Company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization.  The fair value of each reporting unit, excluding ICRA, was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples. The DCF analysis requires significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that is based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the Company's financial position and results of operations. Moody's allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition.  The sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and WACC assumptions described below are as of July 31, 2016. The following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology that requires significant management judgment:  � Future cash flow assumptions -The projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. These projections are consistent with the Company's operating and strategic plan. Cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis were utilized in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue based . . .  Feb 24, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
