Bottom Line Personal

General Motors Company (GM) has become a far more efficient company with a leaner, more-focused product line and signs of genuine innovation, such as the upcoming Chevrolet Bolt electric car.








Cutler’s New Prez Focuses On Output


Worcester Business Journal
November 2015
“In terms of running the firm, what motivates me most is creating an investment environment where the other investment professionals in the firm really have a competition of ideas. What securities we should be buying and what securities we should be selling.  Nothing is black and white; it is just about the strength of your opinion on why your argument is the best. You have to have conviction in your argument.”








Focus:  40 Under 40


Worcester Business Journal
September 2015
Geoff Dancey, president and managing member of Cutler Capital Management, has been selected as a “40 Under Forty” honoree by area business publication, Worcester Business Journal.








Investment Ideas – Health Pipeline


Bottom Line  Personal
August 2015
Merck is undervalued because of concerns about how well it can integrated acquired companies and about their effect on its debt load.  But the company has an AA credit rating and strong balance sheet, and it has shown itself able to handle many ups and downs.

About Cutler
Investment Approach
Investment Process




Our Approach to Investing: Judgment plus Discipline.
At Cutler, we believe that long-term risk-adjusted performance is best achieved by combining the judgment of seasoned portfolio managers with the discipline of a well-defined investment process. Our security selection utilizes a five step bottom-up approach that starts with a proprietary screen to generate ideas, followed by detailed structural, credit, and fundamental analysis to complete our understanding of the securities value and risks.
Our investment strategies all start with a core portfolio of convertible securities. Depending on the investment mandate and risk profile, we then adjust the emphasis toward capital preservation or toward growth. While our strategies range from relatively aggressive to more defensive, the basic tenets of our investment philosophy remain the same across all of our portfolios:
Identify Value.
We look for convertibles and underlying equities that appear to be undervalued. This sets the stage for capital appreciation and long-term outperformance without undue risk to principle.
Capitalize on “Positive Asymmetry”.
Certain convertibles have structural features that give them an advantageous risk/return profile.  In essence, these securities can have significant upside potential yet still have strong downside protection.  In our investment process, we screen the global convertible universe for issues with low conversion premiums, attractive yields, and short maturities.  We look for candidates that have a delta (a measure of sensitivity to stock prices) that is between 25% – 70%. We typically avoid busted or deep-in-the-money convertibles.
Balance Risk and Reward.
We constantly monitor and evaluate risk/reward profiles at the individual security level and at the portfolio level. We also look for potential catalysts that could change our level of conviction towards any particular position. Taking profits and limiting losses is an important part of our discipline, especially in our more conservative portfolios.
Invest in What We Know. 
We perform our own credit, market, and interest-rate research.  We track securities and companies over time and develop a history with the issuer that is invaluable to our assessment of the investment potential of each security.
Buy for the Long-term.
By the nature of our investment process, we favor strong companies with solid long-term prospects and we manage our portfolios for long-term appreciation.  At the same time, when we do trade, we strive to be opportunistic in order to generate incremental performance.
Commit to Performance for our Clients.
Our focus is on delivering performance for our clients, not on gathering the largest amount of assets.  Limiting assets under management has two key advantages: it lets us manage portfolios that are composed exclusively of our “best ideas,” and it lets us operate in sectors of the market that larger firms typically overlook.  Our investment approach is truly one that is designed to exploit the advantages of being a niche player in a growing yet still inefficient market.

The Efficient Frontier for Stocks, Bonds and Convertibles
Investing in convertible bonds can expand the efficient frontier of a portfolio as compared to investing only in bonds or in a blend of stocks and bonds. The chart below displays the efficient frontier of a hypothetical portfolio that combines convertible securities and bonds, compared to one that combines stocks and bonds. As the chart shows, the hypothetical portfolio with convertibles shows a greater return for the level of risk.

Investment Strategies
Cutler offers three distinct investment strategies targeted to meet the different risk profiles of our investors: Opportunistic, Balanced and Defensive .

Each of these strategies is anchored by a disciplined portfolio management process that starts with quantitative screening followed by detailed credit and fundamental analysis.  Cutler’s portfolio management team then constructs a portfolio of convertible bonds, convertible preferred equities, mandatory securities, REITs and/or dividend-paying equities that have been evaluated on the merits of their relative value and risk attributes.  Positions may or may not overlap strategies, but each strategy is uniquely designed to meet our client’s expectation for risk and reward.
Opportunistic Long/Short Equity Strategy
This long/short equity strategy seeks to achieve the long-term returns associated with a stock portfolio but with less volatility.  The portfolio is invested primarily in equity-like convertibles and convertible preferred securities but will also include some REITs and dividend-paying common stocks.  leverage, options and short selling are employed to enhance returns and manage risk.
Balanced Strategy
The balanced strategy targets a return profile similar to a portfolio invested 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds but with less volatility.   The portfolio is invested primarily in convertible securities but will also include REITs and dividend-paying common stocks.  Margin is not used in this investment strategy.  Options and short-selling are employed to manage risk or generate income.
Defensive Strategy
This bond-plus strategy seeks enhanced returns in comparison to investment grade corporate bonds with less interest rate risk.   The portfolio is primarily composed of U.S. and global investment grade, “at-the-money” convertibles that offer downside protection with the added potential for an equity kicker should the underlying stocks appreciate.
