Westfield has a unique group of investment professionals who are experts in investing in their particular growth sectors. The information advantage that we garner from our work in the field is a key to our success as fundamental investors.                                                                                                                                                                                
		
		
		
		
		 
	



Our Team
Our analysts know the right questions to ask and assimilate that information into a discernible investment case. Their ability to piece together the mosaic of information that they gather from company management teams, suppliers, users and competitors, and then compare that information to what they hear from Wall Street sources to ensure a compelling investment theme, sets Westfield’s analysts apart from their peers.   
Westfield’s team approach to portfolio management allows us to capitalize on the group’s collective best thinking and allows our analysts to have an impact on client portfolios within their specific areas of coverage, as well as the portfolio in general.
 
Investment Team
Westfield's portfolio management responsibilities are handled at the Investment Committee level for the majority of our strategies, with purchase and sale decisions being made by consensus vote and implemented across all portfolios within a product. Each of the 14 members of the Investment Committee follows several industry groups across the capitalization spectrum and is responsible for bringing investment ideas from their industries to the Committee for approval. The Investment Committee meets on a weekly basis to present new investment opportunities, review current portfolio holdings, and to discuss overall market factors and their impact on the portfolio.
Every Westfield client benefits directly from the combined experience and collective expertise of our investment team. Our investment team is made up of experienced, talented and insightful individuals that work within an interdependent investment process to build portfolios for our clients with higher growth potential. 
 
Marketing & Client Service
Westfield employs a marketing and client service team that is dedicated to providing exceptional client service and spends considerable time communicating with our clients.

We believe that we can best serve a client's evolving investment goals by maintaining regular lines of communication. We take pride in our ability to communicate and discuss product and portfolio performance with a wide range of audiences, from clients that are not regularly engaged in financial markets to highly sophisticated investors. 
 
Operations
Westfield employs a dedicated Operations team that is responsible for the administration of client portfolios, for servicing the clients/consultants associated with these portfolios, and for assisting the investment committee in various aspects of the investment process.

Mid Cap Growth Equity
Inception Date: July 1, 1994
Strategy AUM: $1,494 million as of June 30, 2017
Status: Open to new investors
		
		
		
		
		 
	




Since 1994, Westfield’s Mid Cap Growth Equity strategy has provided clients with exposure to a relatively concentrated portfolio of mid cap companies with market capitalizations typically between $1.5 billion and $12 billion at the time of initial purchase or within the range of its benchmark, the Russell Midcap® Growth Index.  In constructing client portfolios, our team endeavors to identify 55 to 65 stocks which we believe provide our clients the best opportunities for growth while maintaining our disciplined valuation sensitivity.
The Mid Cap Growth Equity strategy is offered as a separate account and through a sub-advised mutual fund vehicle.

What are analysts saying about TESARO stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about TESARO stock: 
1. FBR & Co analysts commented, "We received our first data snapshot from the RX-3117 Phase 2a study in advanced muscle invasive bladder cancer at ASCO this weekend with data coming from 10 patients in stage 1 of the study. The study achieved the predefined efficacy criteria (two of ten patients achieving a PFS of at least four months or a partial or complete tumor response), where 22% of patients have experienced PFS for a minimum of six months. One of the two aforementioned patients is still on study, achieving 175 days of stable disease. While only stage 1 of this study, we believe it is important to point out that patients who have reached this stage of disease are usually limited to palliative or best supportive care." (6/5/2017)
2. Cann analysts commented, "On Saturday, June 3, 2017, Tesaro provided a corporate update that described initial data from the TOPACIO trial of niraparib (Zejula) plus Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and results of a phase I trial of TSR-042, and provided an update on the commercial launch of Zejula and its commercial businesses in the US and Europe. The launch is exceeding our expectations, and management reiterated plans to advance Zejula into the front-line ovarian cancer setting and to expand into other tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer. We are adjusting our Zejula outlook based on the current status of the launch." (6/5/2017)
3. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "TSRO reported 1Q financials, provided a pipeline update and commented on Zejula’s." (5/11/2017)
4. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Tesaro, Inc. is an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company for cancer patients. The Company's product portfolio consists of Rolapitant, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, TSR-011, an orally available anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and other cancer indications, and Niraparib, an orally active and potent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with solid tumors. Tesaro, Inc. is based in Waltham, Massachusetts.   " (3/31/2017)
5. Wedbush analysts commented, "With first-mover advantage in the maintenance setting, a lack of requirement for a diagnostic, as well clinical data that is at least as good as Lynparza in gBRCA patients, we continue to believe that TSRO remains an attractive acquisition candidate." (3/28/2017)

Westfield Capital is on the block


August 25, 2015

Westfield Capital Management Co. LP is up for sale, according to four sources.
Boston-based Westfield, an investment advisor, went up for sale in the spring, sources said. Sandler O’Neill + Partners LP is advising, they said.
Westfield provides investment management services to institutions and wealthy individuals. The firm had $16.9 billion in assets under management as of June 30. Westfield was previously a unit of Boston Private Bancorp Inc. In 2009, Boston Private sold Westfield to company management for $59 million in cash proceeds.
The process is in the late stages and a winning bidder could be announced soon, sources said.
Westfield could sell for $300 million to $400 million, two of the sources said. It’s unclear who is bidding. Other Boston asset managers were expected to be interested in Westfield including Natixis and Old Mutual. Private equity also was seen as potential bidders for Westfield, sources said.
Another asset management deal, the sale of RS Investments, is expected to hold a third round, two bankers said. Bidders including RidgeWorth Investments, Victory Capital, Virtus Investment Partners and Victory Capital were vying for RS, peHUB reported. DoubleLine Capital also is bidding to buy RS, which was put up for sale by Guardian Life Insurance Company of America earlier this summer, Reuters News said.
Second round bids were due Aug. 14, Reuters reported.
Westfield and Sandler O’Neill could not immediately be reached for comment.

Learn More About Professional Property Management



Do I need a property manager?
As the owner of a small-scale rental property, you may be on the fence about whether or not to use a property management company. Especially if you've never managed an income property, it can be tempting to assume that property management duties amount to "find tenants, sign lease, receive rent check," along with handling some minor maintenance issues from time to time. 
In reality, managing tenant relations, staying on the right side of the law, being on call for any emergencies that come up, staying on top of home maintenance, conducting periodic property inspections, and handling the accounting and taxes can be a time-consuming effort.
Professional property managers have developed systems that allow them to manage all of the above with maximum efficiency. Their expertise allows them to prevent problems before they arise, as well as handle any issues that do come up with minimum disruption to your revenue stream.

Is property management affordable for single-family rental owners?
Not only is property management affordable, using a property manager can actually increase your property's overall profitability. Most property managers charge a small percentage of your monthly rent in exchange for comprehensive services that range from finding and screening tenants, to handling emergency maintenance, to keeping the books and preparing year-end taxes. 
For what usually amounts to $100.00-$200.00 per month, you can outsource all of the responsibilities related to managing your rental property. When you weigh that fee against the 10-15 hours per month you'd likely spend managing the property yourself, not to mention being constantly on-call in case of emergency, the tradeoff becomes pretty clear.
You should also consider that property management companies are experts at preventing vacancies and turnover costs, the two factors that can sink your profit margins almost instantly. As the owner of a single-family rental home, keeping your property filled is especially important---your total revenue is likely generated by a single set of tenants.

How can I find the right property management company for me?
You can take the first step toward finding the right property management company by using All Property Management's search feature to locate the property managers in your area who manage single family homes. We recommend that you speak with two or three companies to determine which company's services, strengths, and fee structure best suit your needs.

What should I look for in a professional HOA manager?
The most effective attributes a successful HOA Property Management Company can have are: 1.) the ability to handle day-to-day issues without supervision 2.) guide the Board's decision-making processes and 3.) be responsive to homeowners. 
Naturally, a successful HOA manager should be professionally compentent in all aspects of Association Management and have the requisite certifications and track record to perform their required duties. But there are other attributes that are important to be a successful HOA service provider.
Homeowners have more permanence than renters, so effective HOA Management must consider the long-term implications of its actions differently than a typical property management firm. Consistency, longevity and proven experience are important considerations, as are the interpersonal skills of the firm's managers in dealing with conflicts, emergencies and the expressed interests of the Board in improving their community.
With this in mind, it's important to hire an HOA management company that has proven methods for managing group politics and negotiating agreements among members with conflicting points of view. As you interview potential HOA managers, be sure to focus a significant portion of your discussions on understanding each manager's typical communication methods and tactics for conflict resolution.

What Does an Apartment Manager Do?



An apartment or duplex building manager handles the day-to-day operations of an apartment complex, whether big or small. While the responsibilities will vary based on the specific needs of the complex’s owners and the agreed upon employment terms with the management company, their duties can include any or all of the following:

Rental Payment: A manager plays two roles, 1) rent enforcer and 2) payment. They will manage collecting rent and use their local knowledge to set the right rental payment levels to attract tenants and get you the most from your investment.
Manage Tenants: From finding tenants to dealing with complaints and evictions, an apartment complex manager handles it all. In addition they screen tenants, negotiate leases, facilitate move-in and move-out inspections and more.
Maintenance & Repair: a building manager handles the physical management of the property, including regular and preventative maintenance, as well as repairs.
Legal Issues: Professional managers know local, state and national laws for screening tenants, handling security deposits, terminating a lease, evicting a tenant, and complying with safety standards.
Budget & Records: The manager must maintain thorough records, including income and expenses, inspections, leases, maintenance requests, complaints, repairs, rent collection, insurance and can help with taxes for the property.


Any tips on hiring the RIGHT property manager?
Here is a great checklist for finding a capable apartment or duplex complex manager:

Proven Profit: A track record of profitably managing complexes
Reviews: A strong background in customer service and former tenant reviews
Assistance: A crew of maintenance professionals or relationships with local vendors
Planning: Detailed, computerized accounting and seasonal maintenance tracking systems
Licensed: Professional certifications or licenses from trade organizations such as: the Institute of Real Estate Management, National Apartment Association, National Association of Residential Property Managers and the Community Associations Institute.



Do I really need an apartment building management company?
The more tenants you have the higher volume of complaints, maintenance issues, and vacancies you will need to deal with. It is in your best interest to employ a manager to quickly respond to emergencies and collect the rent on time.
Apartment building managers have professional knowledge to assist you with hiring and managing local vendors, keeping current with local, state and federal housing laws, maintaining low vacancy rates, and dealing with sensitive tenant issues such as evictions. 

How can I easily find a property manager?
At All Property Management, we make it easy to find the right apartment complex manager for your rental property, whether you’re looking for someone to manage a few apartments and townhomes, a large apartment complex, commercial property – or a portfolio that includes all these and more. Just select the property type and fill in your rental’s zip code to generate an instant list of apartment building managers in your area. For best results, we recommend interviewing at least two or three companies to find the one that is best suited for your needs.
