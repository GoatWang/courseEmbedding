An accomplished orator with a strong background in experiential marketing, Larry's trademark has been the development and production of business theater on behalf of Express Scripts. These thought provoking and highly engaging programs allow Express Scripts to display the depth of its team while exploring and discussing the complex and dynamic pharmaceutical landscape. A frequent spokesperson for the company, Larry articulates Express Scripts' business model and vision of pharmacy benefit management for both external and internal audiences.
Under Larry's leadership, Express Scripts has moved to a centralized best-in-class approach to a multitude of sales-support functions. This has allowed for greater consistency and quality control across all prospect-facing materials, meetings and correspondence.
Larry Zarin came to Express Scripts in 1996 as president of Express Scripts Vision, the company's managed vision care subsidiary. In January 1998, after the sale of Express Scripts Vision, Larry moved to corporate, where he has taken a leading role in the successful integration of the company's numerous major acquisitions — including ValueRx, Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, NPA, CuraScript and Priority Healthcare.
