        		General description
				
				

        Adenylate cyclase type 5 (ADCY5) is highly expressed in the myocardium and striatum. It is a 1261 amino acid protein having an intracellular amino-terminus, two membrane-spanning helices (M1 and M2) that are present beside the intracellular cyclase homology domains (C1 and C2) and a short intracellular loop. ADCY5 is a membrane-bound, type III adenylate cyclase. The gene encoding it is present on chromosome 3q21.

        Adenylate cyclase type 5 (ADCY5) catalyzes conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine-3′, 5′-monophosphate (cAMP). It is an effector enzyme and links various activated receptors with regulation of different cellular functions. ADCY5 which is a Ca2+-inhibited enzyme, is very important for insulin secretion. It combines glucose to generation of cAMP, increase in Ca2+ levels and β-cell connectivity. Mutation in ADCY5 is linked with autosomal dominant familial dyskinesia along with facial myokymia. It is also associated with type 2 diabetes risk.

Quick Overview
This is one of our most popular products. It combines a Bob Beck Pulser/Blood Electrifier and a Colloidal Silver Maker in one user-friendly, small and inexpensive package.





description


Details

It's powered by a 9 volt battery or an optional A/C adapter and is totally microprocessor controlled with multiple outputs and frequencies.
This unit has the three most widely used frequencies that have proven helpful for users of Bob Beck's Pulser - 4Hz, 16Hz, and 100Hz. Our RSG-2 is the only product we are aware of that has all three frequencies. Most competing products only have the standard 4Hz, and even fewer have 4Hz and 100Hz. Ours has 4Hz, 16Hz, and 100Hz, as well as a colloidal silver generator with both Constant-current and Current-Limited outputs!
Everything needed is included with the RSG-2 - all straps, cables, silver wires, etc. All you do is provide your own distilled water to make colloidal silver.
The only accessories we normally recommend are extra cotton sleeves for the Beck Pulser and an A/C adapter to use when making colloidal silver. Extra silver wires are also available if you need a spare set.
Includes a one year manufacturer's warranty against defects.
Batteries and AC adapter sold separately.
