ABOUT THE PRODUCT

 
 
 
 




The ivWatch Model 400 consists of the ivWatch Patient Monitor, for monitoring and notifications, a reusable sensor cable that uses visible and near-infrared light, and a disposable receptacle that is placed next to the peripheral IV to secure the sensor to the patient. If changes in the optical properties of the tissue near the PIV insertion site are consistent with an infiltration, the ivWatch monitor will provide audible and visual notifications, alerting clinicians of an infiltration event.

 
HOW IT WORKS

 
 
 




EVALUATION PROGRAM
ivWatch offers an evaluation program for using the device within a healthcare setting to demonstrate how the ivWatch Model 400 can help improve patient safety with the early detection of IV infiltrations. For information on pricing and quantities, please email sales@ivWatch.com.
