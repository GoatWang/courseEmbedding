Hydrogen and Its Applications
Hydrogen (H2) is the simplest and lightest element in existence. At sea-level atmospheric pressure, a cubic foot of hydrogen weighs just 0.09 ounce. An atom of hydrogen consists of only one proton and one electron. Hydrogen is also the most plentiful element in the universe. Despite its simplicity and abundance, hydrogen doesn't occur naturally as a gas on the Earth - it is always combined with other elements. Water, for example, is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O).

Hydrogen is also found in many organic compounds, notably the hydrocarbons that make up many of our fuels, such as gasoline, natural gas, methanol, and propane. Hydrogen can be separated from hydrocarbons through the application of heat - a process known as reforming. Currently, most hydrogen is made this way from natural gas. An electrical current can also be used to separate water into its components of oxygen and hydrogen. This process is known as electrolysis. Some algae and bacteria, using sunlight as their energy source, even give off hydrogen under certain conditions.

Hydrogen is high in energy, yet an engine that burns pure hydrogen produces almost no pollution. NASA has used liquid hydrogen since the 1970s to propel the space shuttle and other rockets into orbit. Hydrogen fuel cells power the shuttle's electrical systems, producing a clean byproduct - pure water, which the crew drinks.

Hydrogen has number of applications from chemical processing, petroleum recovery and refining, metal production and fabrication, aerospace, and fuel cells. The sectors with the greatest demand for hydrogen are petroleum refineries for hydrocracking and ammonia production for fertilizer. Transportation fuel is an emerging sector with enormous potential in the future. 

Market Size
Hydrogen production is a large and growing industry. Market size of global hydrogen production was estimated to be 53 million metric tons in 2010, of which 12% was shared by merchant hydrogen and rest with captive production. With decreasing sulfur level in petroleum products, lowering crude oil quality and rising demand of hydrogen operated fuel cell applications, global hydrogen production volume is forecasted to grow by compound annual growth rate of 5.6% form 2011 to 2016. The Hydrogen production market in terms of value was estimated to be approximately $150 billion in 2011.

Production of Hydrogen and Delivery
Hydrogen is either produced centrally or on-site. On-site generation (also known as distributed generation) eliminates number of problems associated with transportation and delivery and thus the market for on-site generation systems is growing significantly. Also, in recent years, small scale on-site generation option has become more lucrative since new on-site hydrogen generation technologies offering low cost when compared to delivered merchant hydrogen. When hydrogen is produced using a centralized plant, it has to be delivered to the point of consumption by various delivery modes such as pipeline, trucks or cylinders.

For large quantities, pipelines are the preferred option. Although pipeline delivery is cheaper in the long term than packaged options like trucks and cylinders, it can only be economically justified when the quantity is sufficiently high. Pipelines require significant initial investment and extremely high volume to pay out over the long term. On the other hand, cylinders are used for small quantities and preferred by industries such as glass manufacturing, metal production and fabrication, food processing and electronics.

The Asia and Oceania region is the largest market with 39% of global production share in 2010. This region generated around 21 million metric tons of hydrogen in 2010. The Asia and Oceania region pioneered in refinery and ammonia production capacity and this makes it the largest consumer. Europe and Eurasia is the second largest producer followed by North America, the third largest region. North America is the largest market for merchant hydrogen with 60% of global merchant hydrogen production in 2010. By country, the U.S. is the largest merchant producer with 47% of global merchant hydrogen production share. China is the largest consumer with 22% of global hydrogen consumption share. China's greatest demand comes from ammonia producers and it is the world's largest producer and accounted for 32% of worldwide ammonia production in 2010.

Presently, most of the hydrogen for industrial purposes is produced by steam reforming of natural gas or methane. This production technology dominates due to easy availability and low prices of natural gas. Partial oxidation of petroleum oil is second in production capacity after steam reforming of natural gas. The third largest production technology in terms of production capacity is steam gasification of coal. In 2010, an estimated 25.6 million metric tons of hydrogen was produced using steam methane reforming (SMR). Production costs vary according to size of production plant, type of plant, utilization factor, feedstock cost, transportation and delivery. 

Hydrogen and Fuel Cells
A fuel cell combines hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, heat and water. Fuel cells are often compared to batteries. Both convert the energy produced by a chemical reaction into usable electric power. However, the fuel cell will produce electricity as long as fuel (hydrogen) is supplied.

Fuel cells are a promising technology for use as a source of heat and electricity for buildings, and as an electrical power source for electric motors to propel vehicles. Fuel cells operate best on pure hydrogen. But natural gas, methanol, or even gasoline can be reformed to produce the hydrogen required for fuel cells. Some fuel cells can even be fueled directly with methanol, without using a reformer.

In the future, hydrogen could also join electricity as an important energy carrier. An energy carrier moves and delivers energy in a usable form to consumers. Renewable energy sources, like the sun and wind, can't produce energy all the time. But they can, for example, produce electric energy and hydrogen, which can be stored until it's needed. Hydrogen can also be transported (like electricity) to locations where it is needed.

Fuel cells are a viable option for many uses today and have been adopted by industries that need reliable, clean fuel sources. For example, forklifts operate indoors where combustion engines would require expensive ventilation systems. Instead of building a fleet of battery powered forklifts, which require perhaps two or three extra batteries for every forklift in operation, major companies such as Wal-Mart and Coca-Cola are choosing equipment powered by hydrogen fuel cells, which refuel in minutes and run at full power for eight hours. Similarly, hydrogen fuel cells are already being used in cities around the world to power public transportation buses. 

Market for Renewable Hydrogen
Environmental Concerns - CO2 Mitigation
The increasing demand for hydrogen for heavy oil upgrading, desulfurization and upgrading of conventional petroleum, and for production of ammonium, in addition to the projected demand for hydrogen as a transportation fuel and portable power, will require hydrogen production on a massive scale. Increased production of hydrogen by current technologies will consume greater amounts of conventional hydrocarbons (primarily natural gas), which in turn will generate greater greenhouse gas emissions. Production of hydrogen from renewable sources offers the possibility to contribute to the production capacity with lower or no net greenhouse gas emissions (without carbon sequestration technologies), increasing the flexibility and improving the economics of distributed and semi-centralized systems. 

Decentralized Production
Renewable hydrogen systems can be adapted to on-site decentralized production of hydrogen, circumventing the need to establish a large and costly distribution infrastructure. Renewable hydrogen production offers the potential for a distributed hydrogen supply network model, which would be based on on-site hydrogen production. On-site production is considered by many to be the most likely pathway during the market development of energy systems. A distributed network of such sites could provide a cost-effective refueling infrastructure, as hydrogen must be used as close as possible to its production site to optimize the overall energy efficiency of a hydrogen-based energy system.

Remote Communities / Islands
There are socio-economic benefits as well as technical reasons for developing renewable hydrogen systems in remote communities. The need for improved energy security, protection against fluctuating and/or high fuel costs and abundant renewable energy resources are key drivers behind these projects. In addition, the need for clean air, reduced noise and community development are also good reasons. Hydrogen systems can offer jobs, tourism and engender community pride. The cost of conventional fuel and the restrictions on conventional uses of renewable resources make hydrogen more attractive.

Distributed generation is becoming an increasingly popular approach to providing local power, and although each individual system is generally small, the number of islands or remote communities that could benefit from renewable hydrogen systems total represents a significant market opportunity. A number of communities are already under way working to create renewable hydrogen systems.

TECHNOLOGY
Breakthrough Nanotechnology for Making Renewable Hydrogen from Sunlight
Hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant element and cleanest fuel in the universe. Unlike hydrocarbon fuels, such as oil, coal and natural gas, where carbon dioxide and other contaminants are released into the atmosphere when used, hydrogen fuel usage produces only pure water (H2O) as the byproduct. Unfortunately, pure hydrogen does not exist naturally on Earth and therefore must be manufactured. Historically, the cost of manufacturing renewable hydrogen as an alternative fuel has been higher than the cost of the energy used to make it. This is the dilemma of the Hydrogen Economy, and one that HyperSolar aims to address.

For over a century, splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis has been well known. Theoretically, this technology can be used to produce an unlimited amount of clean and renewable hydrogen fuel to power a carbon-free world. However, in practice, current commercial electrolysis technologies require (a) expensive electricity, and (b) highly purified water to prevent fouling of system components. We believe these are the major barriers to affordable production of renewable hydrogen.

The Perfect and Sustainable Energy Cycle
As it turns out, Mother Nature has been making hydrogen using sunlight since the beginning of time by splitting water molecules (H2O) into its basic elements - hydrogen and oxygen. This is exactly what plant leaves do every day using photosynthesis. Since the produced hydrogen is immediately consumed inside the plant, we can't simply grow trees to make hydrogen.

If technology can be developed to mimic photosynthesis to split water into hydrogen, then a truly sustainable, low cost, and renewable energy cycle can be created to power the Earth for millenniums. However, cost has been the biggest barrier to realizing this vision.

Water Splitting
In the process of splitting a water molecule, input energy is transferred into the chemical bonds of the resulting hydrogen molecule. So in essence, manufactured hydrogen is simply a carrier or battery-like storage of the input energy. If the input energy is from fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, then dirty carbon fossil fuel energy is simply transferred into hydrogen. If the input energy is renewable such as solar and wind, then new and clean energy is stored in hydrogen.

While the concept of water splitting is very appealing, the following challenges must be addressed for renewable hydrogen to be commercially viable:


Energy Inefficiency  — Since hydrogen is an energy carrier, the most energy it can store is 100% of the input energy. However, conventional systems approach to electrolysis lose so much of the input energy in system components, wires and electrodes that only a fraction the solar electricity actually makes it into the hydrogen molecules. This translates to high production cost and is the fundamental problem with water splitting for hydrogen production. HyperSolar is addressing this problem with its low cost and energy efficient technology.

Need for Clean Water —Conventional electrolysis requires highly purified clean water to prevent fouling of system components. This prevents current technology from using the large quantities of free water from oceans, rivers, industrial waste and municipal waste as feedstock. HyperSolar's technology is designed to use any natural water or waste water for the unlimited production of renewable hydrogen.     


Breakthrough Nanotechnology
Electrolysis water-splitting in its simplest form is the transfer of "input electrons" in the following chemical reactions.

Cathode (reduction): 2 H2O + 2e- -> H2 + 2 OH-

Anode (oxidation):     4 OH- -> O2 + 2 H2O + 4 e-

From these equations it is easy to see that if every input electron (e-) is put to work and not lost, then a maximum amount of input electrons (i.e. energy) is transferred and stored in the hydrogen molecules (H2). Additionally, if there were a very high number of cathode and anode reaction areas within a given volume of water, then a very high number of these reactions could happen simultaneously throughout the medium to split every single water molecule into hydrogen wherever electrons are available.

To address this fundamental electron transfer efficiency problem, HyperSolar is developing a novel nanoparticle to maximally ensure that every single electron is put to work in splitting a water molecule. Our nanoparticle has two very important features:


Self-contained Photoelectrochemical Nanosystem  — Our low cost nano-size particle technology is designed to mimic photosynthesis and contains a solar absorber that generates electrons from sunlight, as well as integrated cathode and anode areas to readily split water and transfer those electrons to the molecular bonds of hydrogen. Unlike solar panels or wind turbines that produce a sizeable number of electrons that will be lost before reaching the hydrogen bonds, our nanoparticles are optimized at the nano-level to ensure maximal electron generation and utilization efficiency. Consequently, our nanoparticle technology uses substantially fewer photovoltaic elements, an expensive material, than conventional solar panels to achieve the same system level efficiency. Thereby significantly lowering the system cost of what is essentially an electrolysis process.

Protective Coating — The biggest problem with submerging photovoltaic elements in water for direct electrolysis is corrosion and short circuiting. To address this problem, we have developed a protective coating that encapsulates key elements of the nanoparticle to allow it to function for a long periods of time in a wide range of water conditions without corrosion. This allows the nanoparticles to be submerged or dissolved into virtually any source of water, such as sea water, runoff water, river water, or waste water, instead of purified distilled water.

By managing the science of electrolysis at the nano-level, we believe that our nanoparticle technology can deliver unmatched cost reductions to enable the commercial production of renewable hydrogen from any sources of water, with sunlight as the only source of energy. 
Our nanoparticle technology is a next generation solution. However, during the process of developing this technology, we have achieved a number of discrete technology breakthroughs that have allowed us to develop a commercial solution for today's renewable hydrogen market (see HyperSolar H2Generator).

Distributed Low Cost Renewable Hydrogen Production
Hydrogen in water has an amazing energy storage density. We estimate that only 10 liters of water is required to store enough solar energy in renewable hydrogen to power a typical American home consuming 10kWh/day of electricity. When hydrogen is used in a fuel cell for electricity production, water is produced and can be easily recycled for reuse. Therefore, the actual consumption of water for renewable hydrogen production is quite low.

One of the most significant challenges in using hydrogen is transporting it to the point of use. Long haul transportation of hydrogen by trucks or pipeline remains technically and economically challenging. However, by enabling the low cost production of renewable hydrogen wherever there is water and sunlight, we can facilitate a distributed hydrogen production model without long haul transportation and delivery.



24x7 Renewable Electricity



With sunlight and water readily available in most parts of the world, the HyperSolar H2Generator™ can be connected to a conventional fuel cell to create a self-contained 24x7 renewable electricity generator. During the day, solar energy is constantly stored as hydrogen.  At any time during the day or night, the stored hydrogen can be converted to electricity through the fuel cell. This 24x7 availability of solar electricity has eluded the photovoltaic industry, but not with solar based renewable hydrogen. Depending on the electricity demands of the user, which could be a house, an apartment, an office building, or a small community, the number of reactor vessels and storage tanks can be adjusted accordingly.  
		 


24x7 Renewable Power Plants



Conventional solar and wind electricity are intermittent. When the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing, solar panels and wind turbines from renewable power plants are not producing electricity. As a result, these renewable power plants are not reliable enough to be a standalone utility scale power plant. While conventional electrolysis technology can technically be used to store solar or wind electricity as hydrogen, it is very cost prohibitive because of the inherent system-level energy losses.  Otherwise, electrolysis would be the current standard storage technology for solar and wind power. By implementing the HyperSolar H2Generator on a utility scale, large farms of low cost reactor vessels can be employed to convert large areas of solar energy into hydrogen for concentrated storage. Then, 100% renewable hydrogen powered electricity can be produced through utility scale fuel cells - 24x7.
		


Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles



As of 2009, motor vehicles used most of the petroleum consumed in the U.S. and produced over 60% of carbon monoxide emissions and 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Emission and petroleum related geopolitical problems are only growing for the U.S. and the world as the demand for personal and mass transit grows with an increasing population. Electric power vehicles do not have any tailpipe emissions and have been praised as the solution to the world's transportation needs. However, current battery based electric vehicles suffer from two big problems: (1) long charging time, and (2) plugin electricity is from a fossil fuel power plant that burns coal or natural gas. With a renewable hydrogen powered fuel cell vehicle, charging time could be as fast as a regular gasoline fill-up, and the only byproduct of hydrogen fuel usage is water. It is only with renewable hydrogen that the electric vehicle visions can be realized at a large scale. A growing list of automakers such as Audi, BWM, Toyota and Honda are all developing hydrogen fuel cell cars.

One of the biggest problems with the hydrogen car vision is the lack of hydrogen fueling stations, and the cost to build such an infrastructure is enormous. However, by using the HyperSolar H2Generator, standalone fueling stations can build and operated one by one along any highway where there is water and sunlight. During the day, solar energy can be stored as hydrogen in the HyperSolar H2Generator, which is connected to individual fueling stations. The reactor vessels and storage tanks can be sized appropriately to accommodate the local traffic volume. In this manner, a large distributed renewable hydrogen production infrastructure can be built with minimal capital risk.
		


Renewable Natural Gas



The renewable hydrogen produced by the HyperSolar H2Generator can be easily reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce a carbon neutral and renewable methane (CH4) under a well-known reaction called the Sabatier reaction.
		
CO2 + 4H2 -> CH4 + 2H2O
This renewable methane is essentially pipeline ready natural gas and can be used as a direct replacement for traditional natural gas to power the world, without fracking, drilling or CO2 emissions.

A Breakthrough Technology
HyperSolar has developed a breakthrough technology to make renewable hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water. Renewable hydrogen, the cleanest and greenest of all fuels, can be used as direct replacement for traditional hydrogen, which is usually produced by reforming CO2 emitting natural gas.
	


Inspired ByPhotosynthesis
By optimizing the science of water electrolysis, our low cost photoelectrochemical process efficiently uses sunlight to separate hydrogen from any source of water to produce clean and environmentally friendly renewable hydrogen. Our innovative solar hydrogen generator eliminates the need for conventional electrolyzers, which are expensive and energy intensive. We believe that our solution will produce the lowest cost renewable hydrogen available in the market today.


The Next GreatRenewable Fuel
Hydrogen is the most abundant element and cleanest fuel in the universe. Unlike hydrocarbon fuels, that produce harmful emissions, hydrogen fuel produces pure water as the only byproduct. Using our low cost method to produce renewable hydrogen, we intend to enable a world of distributed hydrogen production for renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

					Full Description



Hypersolar, Inc., incorporated on February 18, 2009, is engaged in developing a solar-powered particle system that mimics photosynthesis to separate hydrogen from water. The Company intends for technology of this system to be licensed for the production of renewable hydrogen to produce renewable electricity and hydrogen for fuel cells. The Company is focused on developing a submersible hydrogen production particle that can split water molecules under the sun, emulating the functions of photosynthesis. Each particle is a complete hydrogen generator that contains a high voltage solar cell bonded to chemical catalysts by an encapsulation coating.The Company is developing a modular system that enables the daily production and storage of hydrogen for any time use in electricity generation, oil and gas refining, fertilizer manufacturing or any other applications of hydrogen. The Company's technology is HyperSolar H2Generator. The Company's HyperSolar H2Generator technology consists of primary stages, such as Reactor Vessels, Hydrogen Compressor and Hydrogen Storage. In Reactor Vessels, the reactors resemble transparent rectangular boxes containing water and tens of thousands of self-contained particles suspended in a solution. When exposed to sunlight, hydrogen gas bubbles up into an air gap on top for separation and collection. In the Hydrogen Compressor, the produced hydrogen gas is compressed for space efficient storage. In Hydrogen Storage, the hydrogen can be stored in compressed gas tanks or chemical canisters depending on the application. Each stage of the HyperSolar H2Generator can be scaled independently according to the hydrogen demands and length of storage required for a specific application. A small-scale system can be used to produce continuous renewable electricity for a small house or a large scale system can be used to produce hydrogen to power a community. The Company has not generated any revenues.The Company competes with Air Products and Chemicals Inc., and Air Liquide.

HyperSolar Technology Well-Positioned to Capture Silicon Panel Market as New Study Predicts CPV Sector Growth | Business Wire
























































HyperSolar Technology Well-Positioned to Capture Silicon Panel Market 
      as New Study Predicts CPV Sector Growth




Low-concentration Layer Redefines Concentrated Photovoltaic (CPV) 
      Sector






March 23, 2011 04:10 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SANTA BARBARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HyperSolar, Inc. (OTCBB: HYSR), the developer of a breakthrough 
      technology that magnifies the power of the sun to significantly increase 
      the power output of solar cells, today announced that following a new 
      industry report predicting elevated growth of the CPV sector, the 
      company expects its technology to redefine and expand the boundaries of 
      conventional CPV with a product that captures the silicon solar panel 
      market.
    


      “This report confirms that concentrating sunlight onto a PV cell is 
      gaining in popularity as a viable solar solution,” said Tim Young, CEO, 
      HyperSolar, Inc. “But, to really drive this idea home and bring the cost 
      per watt of solar energy down to prices equal to conventional 
      electricity, the market needs a product that uses concentration 
      techniques in mainstream applications – such as conventional flat 
      silicon panels. This is exactly what HyperSolar offers.”
    

      The “CPV Technology Market Status Update and Future Prospects” report by 
      Strategy Analytics concluded the CPV sector is expected to grow by 174 
      per cent through 2015 to account for four percent of the global solar 
      supply. It was presented last week at Solartech World 2011 in Gwangju, 
      Korea.
    

      The report also highlighted the intrinsic barrier the sector faces due 
      to the fact that most CPV technologies require direct sunlight. Mr. 
      Young added, “HyperSolar’s innovative new CPV approach does not require 
      direct sunlight, nor does it require bulky optical elements or 
      failure-prone tracking devices, as do other CPV technologies.”
    

      The HyperSolar layer takes the form of an acrylic “top sheet” that 
      allows a solar cell to produce as much as 400 percent more power. By 
      adding the concentrator, manufacturers can use significantly fewer solar 
      cells, thus dramatically reducing cost.
    

About HyperSolar, Inc.


      HyperSolar is developing a breakthrough technology that magnifies the 
      power of the sun to significantly increase the power output of solar 
      cells. Using innovative photonics and low-cost manufacturing processes, 
      HyperSolar is developing the world's first thin and flat solar 
      concentrator for standard solar cells. Applied on top of solar cells, 
      the low-cost HyperSolar concentrator can increase solar cell power 
      output by as much as 400%. By adding the HyperSolar concentrator, 
      manufacturers can use significantly fewer solar cells in the production 
      of solar panels and dramatically reduce the cost per watt of solar 
      electricity. To learn more about HyperSolar, please visit our website at http://www.HyperSolar.com.

HyperSolar has nothing to sell (i.e product) to generate revenue.  Thus it has no income, but to start up as a company and do the work to make the Particles (research, development, ...) it needs funding.  After an IPO there are limited ways to get funding.  Traditional loans for a risky company are virtually nil.  So, the common instruments involve "Convertible Debentures" and for HYSR, Convertible Notes. HYSR sells the Notes to lenders who, at Note maturity, get "Warrants" or basically the rights up to an infinite number of shares to sell to get their loan back plus one boo-coo big profit.  If you look at the 10k listed above, look at pages F-10 and F-11, including the Derivative Liabilities, and read the terms on each of the Notes that HYSR has going now.  See that the Note Holders can and do sell their shares at a heavily discounted share price.  They do so until the terms of the contract are satisfied.  The Notes payback is a very dilutive thing and thus the number of Outstanding Shares (O/S) goes up and share value goes down.  When you are buying shares that are being sold by Note Holders, you are buying a DEBT that HYSR, by contract, has to pay off. (Shares that are just traded by shareholders are not debt and have no effect on the company).  Check out, online, "Convertible Notes" as that is the financing instrument most commonly used.  Also try to learn of the great dangers that can happen from them.   Hope this helps.

HyperSolar H2Generator™
H2Generator – Eliminates the Need for an Electrolyzer!
Today's standard system for producing solar generated hydrogen consists of a solar cell array connected to an electrolyzer. An electrolyzer is an electrolysis device that uses electricity to split distilled water into hydrogen and oxygen. Commercially available electrolyzers are very energy intensive and expensive. HyperSolar is developing and intends to market a novel solar hydrogen generator that eliminates the expensive electrolyzer by integrating the electrolysis function directly into a solar cell. 
H2Generator Cell
The key to the direct integration of a solar cell and electrolysis is our proprietary, patent-pending polymer coating that performs two very important functions: (1) conductively "glues" catalyst material directly on to a conventional solar cell, and (2) protects the solar cell from corrosion when submerged in an electrolytic solution. The result is a standalone, self-contained solar hydrogen generator – the H2Generator Cell.
H2Generator Panel
H2Generator Cells will be arranged as a matrix in a flat panel reactor filled with an electrolytic solution.
H2Generator System
H2Generator Panels can be connected together to scale to any size system to meet application specific hydrogen requirements. The H2Generator System will contain a process control unit that automates the liquid chemical processes as well as hydrogen removal from the H2Generator Panels into a temporary storage tank.
Two primary configurations of the H2Generator System are planned, including:
1. Low Pressure – Hydrogen produced by the H2Generator Panels are at atmospheric pressure (1 bar), and will be pumped into a buffer tank for immediate off take by downstream system components.
2. Elevated Pressure – Hydrogen produced by the H2Generator Panels will be processed through a pressure booster, a gas dryer, and a purifier that produces high purity hydrogen at an elevated pressure for direct charging of metal hydride hydrogen storage tanks, or further compression for high pressure gas tanks.
Distributed and Scalable
The HyperSolar H2Generator will be designed to be a linearly scalable and self-contained renewable hydrogen production system. As a result, it is intended to be installed almost anywhere to produce hydrogen fuel for local use. This distributed model of hydrogen production will address one of the greatest challenges of using clean hydrogen fuel on a large scale – the need to transport hydrogen in large quantities.
Each stage of the HyperSolar H2Generator can be scaled independently according to the hydrogen demands and length of storage required for a specific application. A small scale system can be used to produce continuous renewable electricity for a small house, or a large scale system can be used to produce hydrogen to power a community.

The H2Generator technology is currently under development. We are in the process of designing a demonstration unit.

HyperSolar Demonstrates Large Solar Hydrogen Prototype
Jul 11, 2017
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 
SANTA BARBARA, Calif., July  11, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HyperSolar, Inc. (OTCQB:HYSR), the developer of a breakthrough technology to produce renewable hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water, today announced it has completed its largest prototype to date, a one square foot unit that is capable of producing hydrogen in a completely renewable process. A video of the prototype and process can be found here.
The prototype was completed with the key objective of demonstrating how the technology can be scaled up while remaining highly productive. A key challenge in maintaining the hydrogen production efficiency in a scaled-up device is managing the increased solution transport losses from one side of the cell to the other. HyperSolar uses its patent-pending process that substantially reduces the solution transport losses, thereby maintaining the efficiencies of hydrogen production in a large solar cells-based device.  As the Company continues to increase the size of its working prototype, it can effectively showcase to future partners and customers its potential for real world application, such as a hydrogen fueling station or in the warehouse of a big box retailer. The latter of which has become more commonplace in American business, as evidenced by ongoing hydrogen fuel technology implementation at e-commerce titans Walmart and Amazon. The prototype was completed at the University of Iowa campus, the site of its growing scientific team led by CTO Dr. Joun Lee and University of Iowa professor, Dr. Syed Mubeen.  “With this demonstration and further improvements in stability and efficiency through innovations in catalyst integration technology, we believe our prototypes can soon be commercially viable,” said Dr. Joun Lee, HyperSolar chief technologist.   Demand for hydrogen has increased significantly in the last three years with fuel cell vehicles and power equipment coming to market from large auto manufacturers like Honda and Toyota and fuel cell makers like Plug Power. To date however, over 95% of hydrogen produced still uses a method utilizing natural gas, a fossil fuel. HyperSolar’s process is completely green and sustainable and can be deployed off grid.  “The demonstration of this working prototype represents a significant milestone in HyperSolar’s quest to produce completely renewable hydrogen at or near the point of distribution,” said Tim Young, CEO of HyperSolar. “We have executed on the key objective of successfully scaling our technology and safely producing increased volumes of renewable hydrogen. By establishing our ability to grow in size without reducing efficiency, we will turn our attention to incorporating processes and materials that will also reduce cost. If successful, we believe the potential for identifying partners to support bringing the technology to scale, as well as eventual commercialization, will continue to become more realistic.” HyperSolar’s primary research is focused on developing a completely renewable, low-cost and submersible hydrogen production particle that can split water molecules using the power of the sun, emulating the core functions of photosynthesis. Each particle is a complete hydrogen generator that contains a novel high voltage solar cell bonded to chemical catalysts by a proprietary encapsulation coating.

TECHNOLOGY
Breakthrough Nanotechnology for Making Renewable Hydrogen from Sunlight
Hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant element and cleanest fuel in the universe. Unlike hydrocarbon fuels, such as oil, coal and natural gas, where carbon dioxide and other contaminants are released into the atmosphere when used, hydrogen fuel usage produces only pure water (H2O) as the byproduct. Unfortunately, pure hydrogen does not exist naturally on Earth and therefore must be manufactured. Historically, the cost of manufacturing renewable hydrogen as an alternative fuel has been higher than the cost of the energy used to make it. This is the dilemma of the Hydrogen Economy, and one that HyperSolar aims to address.

For over a century, splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis has been well known. Theoretically, this technology can be used to produce an unlimited amount of clean and renewable hydrogen fuel to power a carbon-free world. However, in practice, current commercial electrolysis technologies require (a) expensive electricity, and (b) highly purified water to prevent fouling of system components. We believe these are the major barriers to affordable production of renewable hydrogen.

The Perfect and Sustainable Energy Cycle
As it turns out, Mother Nature has been making hydrogen using sunlight since the beginning of time by splitting water molecules (H2O) into its basic elements - hydrogen and oxygen. This is exactly what plant leaves do every day using photosynthesis. Since the produced hydrogen is immediately consumed inside the plant, we can't simply grow trees to make hydrogen.

If technology can be developed to mimic photosynthesis to split water into hydrogen, then a truly sustainable, low cost, and renewable energy cycle can be created to power the Earth for millenniums. However, cost has been the biggest barrier to realizing this vision.

Water Splitting
In the process of splitting a water molecule, input energy is transferred into the chemical bonds of the resulting hydrogen molecule. So in essence, manufactured hydrogen is simply a carrier or battery-like storage of the input energy. If the input energy is from fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, then dirty carbon fossil fuel energy is simply transferred into hydrogen. If the input energy is renewable such as solar and wind, then new and clean energy is stored in hydrogen.

While the concept of water splitting is very appealing, the following challenges must be addressed for renewable hydrogen to be commercially viable:


Energy Inefficiency  — Since hydrogen is an energy carrier, the most energy it can store is 100% of the input energy. However, conventional systems approach to electrolysis lose so much of the input energy in system components, wires and electrodes that only a fraction the solar electricity actually makes it into the hydrogen molecules. This translates to high production cost and is the fundamental problem with water splitting for hydrogen production. HyperSolar is addressing this problem with its low cost and energy efficient technology.

Need for Clean Water —Conventional electrolysis requires highly purified clean water to prevent fouling of system components. This prevents current technology from using the large quantities of free water from oceans, rivers, industrial waste and municipal waste as feedstock. HyperSolar's technology is designed to use any natural water or waste water for the unlimited production of renewable hydrogen.     


Breakthrough Nanotechnology
Electrolysis water-splitting in its simplest form is the transfer of "input electrons" in the following chemical reactions.

Cathode (reduction): 2 H2O + 2e- -> H2 + 2 OH-

Anode (oxidation):     4 OH- -> O2 + 2 H2O + 4 e-

From these equations it is easy to see that if every input electron (e-) is put to work and not lost, then a maximum amount of input electrons (i.e. energy) is transferred and stored in the hydrogen molecules (H2). Additionally, if there were a very high number of cathode and anode reaction areas within a given volume of water, then a very high number of these reactions could happen simultaneously throughout the medium to split every single water molecule into hydrogen wherever electrons are available.

To address this fundamental electron transfer efficiency problem, HyperSolar is developing a novel nanoparticle to maximally ensure that every single electron is put to work in splitting a water molecule. Our nanoparticle has two very important features:


Self-contained Photoelectrochemical Nanosystem  — Our low cost nano-size particle technology is designed to mimic photosynthesis and contains a solar absorber that generates electrons from sunlight, as well as integrated cathode and anode areas to readily split water and transfer those electrons to the molecular bonds of hydrogen. Unlike solar panels or wind turbines that produce a sizeable number of electrons that will be lost before reaching the hydrogen bonds, our nanoparticles are optimized at the nano-level to ensure maximal electron generation and utilization efficiency. Consequently, our nanoparticle technology uses substantially fewer photovoltaic elements, an expensive material, than conventional solar panels to achieve the same system level efficiency. Thereby significantly lowering the system cost of what is essentially an electrolysis process.

Protective Coating — The biggest problem with submerging photovoltaic elements in water for direct electrolysis is corrosion and short circuiting. To address this problem, we have developed a protective coating that encapsulates key elements of the nanoparticle to allow it to function for a long periods of time in a wide range of water conditions without corrosion. This allows the nanoparticles to be submerged or dissolved into virtually any source of water, such as sea water, runoff water, river water, or waste water, instead of purified distilled water.

By managing the science of electrolysis at the nano-level, we believe that our nanoparticle technology can deliver unmatched cost reductions to enable the commercial production of renewable hydrogen from any sources of water, with sunlight as the only source of energy. 
Our nanoparticle technology is a next generation solution. However, during the process of developing this technology, we have achieved a number of discrete technology breakthroughs that have allowed us to develop a commercial solution for today's renewable hydrogen market (see HyperSolar H2Generator).
