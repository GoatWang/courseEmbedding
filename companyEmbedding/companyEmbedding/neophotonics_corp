Overview
 NeoPhotonics Semiconductor (Neo Semi) has three technology platforms: GaAs Optoelectronics, InP Optics, and SiGe Optoelectronics with two in-house fabs: GaAs and InP.
Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is a III-V semiconductor compound material used in some field-effect transistors (FETs), and integrated circuits (ICs). With high electron mobility, GaAs-based optoelectronics components are useful at ultra-high RF (radio frequencies), and in fast electronic switching applications. The properties of the GaAs allow the devices based on GaAs technology to operate at frequencies more than 200GHz. GaAs devices also generate less noise than most other types of semiconductor components. This is important in small signal amplification. Neo Semi’s pHEMT (pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistors) platform is not just a technology leader, but also a volume leader in the areas of high performance discrete devices such as driver amplifiers, TI (Transimpedance) amplifiers, broadband amplifiers, and power amplifier. 

Indium phosphide (InP) is also a III-V semiconductor compound material. Other than the high speed properties similar to GaAs, it has a direct bandgap which can emit or absorb 1310nm and 1550nm lasers which makes InP a perfect candidate for optical devices, such as lasers and photo detectors. Neo Semi has developed and optimized the in-house scalable InP fab processes to make ultra-fast speed InP based EML. EML (electroabsorption modulated laser) incorporates the laser and modulator in one package. With its voltage-induced electroabsorption phenomena, Neo Semi’s EML has a capability to operate more than 60Gbps with a high reliability.


Silicon germanium (SiGe) is an alloy of silicon and germanium used as a semiconductor material in integrated circuits (ICs) for heterojunction bipolar transistors or as a strain-inducing layer for CMOS transistors. SiGe allows CMOS logic to be integrated with heterojunction bipolar transistors, which have higher forward gain and lower reverse gain than traditional homojunction bipolar transistors. This translates into lower current and higher frequency. A relatively new technology, SiGe provides high speed performance with a lower power consumption, which is especially suitable for high volume and low cost product. Combined with the expertise of GaAs high speed optoelectronics, Neo Semi is currently developing TI (Transimpedance) amplifiers based on SiGe platform.

NeoPhotonics Introduces High Power DFB Lasers for 100G Silicon Photonics Applications

High Optical Power 1310nm and 1550nm CW Laser and Laser Arrays with
      Low Power Consumption for 100G Datacenter Solutions

    ANAHEIM,Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar. 22, 2016--
      (OFC Conference) – NeoPhotonics Corporation (NYSE: NPTN), a
      leading designer and manufacturer of components, modules and subsystems
      for bandwidth intensive communications networks, today announced 1310nm
      and 1550nm high power lasers and laser arrays for use in 100G silicon
      photonics based QSFP28 modules for datacenter applications.
    

      With the ever-growing demand for more bandwidth, datacenter operators
      and service providers are actively deploying low-cost, scalable, silicon
      photonics based 100G modules defined in industry standard MSAs such as
      CWDM4, CLR4 and PSM-4. Each of these is designed around a specific
      implementation of silicon high speed analog and digital electronic
      devices and related photonic components. Notably, all rely on indium
      phosphide distributed feedback (DFB) lasers as an efficient, high power light
      source.
    

      In support of the emerging Silicon Photonics ecosystem, NeoPhotonics has
      introduced a range of high power, uncooled lasers and laser array
      sources for both the 1310nm and 1550nm wavelength bands. These lasers
      support power from 40-60 mW over a wide temperature range.
    

      One specific 100G datacenter application uses silicon photonics parallel
      single-mode architecture, or PSM4, in a high power laser diode array
      product. NeoPhotonics has partnered with Mellanox Technologies, a leader
      in Silicon Photonics, to develop laser arrays which can be passively
      flip-chip bonded onto Mellanox’s optical engine producing a high volume,
      low-cost, electronics style assembly for a 100G PSM-4 module.
    

      “We are pleased that NeoPhotonics has opened its unique high power, high
      yield laser technology to the ecosystem. Several key laser integration
      and performance features have enabled us to support our customers with a
      solid and growing portfolio of high performance LinkX 100G modules and
      cables,” said Mehdi Asghari, vice president of silicon photonics,
      Mellanox Technologies.
    

      “NeoPhotonics was a pioneer in the development and volume production of
      InP PIC based DFB lasers and particularly in the extension of this
      technology to arrays. Among other applications, we have shipped several
      hundred thousand of these lasers over the last decade into demanding
      DWDM applications,” said Tim Jenks Chairman and CEO of NeoPhotonics. “We
      are pleased to announce the new application of this versatile technology
      for intra-datacenter 100G connections,” continued Mr. Jenks.
    

NeoPhotonics is exhibiting at the OFC conference its suite of standard
      and small form factor PIC-based components for 100G coherent line-side
      applications, along with its 100G client-side CFP2 and QSFP28
      transceivers and its next generation multicast switch for contentionless
      networks (booth 3301 at the Anaheim Convention Center, March 22nd-24th).

Overview
Technology:  NeoPhotonics Laser Devices product offering is based on established Indium Phosphide (InP) laser and photonic integration technology. We have over 10 years of industry leading design and production history for both high power distributed feedback laser (DFB) lasers and high speed modulated device technology such as directly modulated lasers, electro-absorption modulated laser and Mach Zehnder modulators.  
Design expertise:  Devices today are based on InGaAsP and InGaAlAs. Our mature and high volume DFB laser or distributed feedback laser utilizes a special grating that is created as part of the laser cavity, and the base device structure is based on an efficient buried heterostructure laser design as shown in Fig1.





Fig. 1 Buried heterostructure laser 
The special grating is written using an e-beam lithography system which enables creating an array of lasers on a single chip with each laser emitting a unique wavelength.  Fig. 2 shows an atomic force microscope image of special phase shifted grating where each line is approximately 100nm wide. In a single chip the machine can write multiple gratings, each with a different grating period to create the array.
NeoPhotonics offers multiple products based on these laser array technologies. Below are two examples that have 12 lasers in one chip per Fig 3.





Fig. 2 E-beam written phase-shifted grating
Laser wavelengths are typically in the 1310nm range (S-band) or the 1550nm range (C-band) as shown in Fig 4. To date we have shipped over 20 million individual DFB lasers, primarily in tunable laser and GPON fiber-to-the-home applications.

NeoPhotonics Corporation is an American public corporation based in San Jose, California. It was founded in 1996.[1] The company develops, manufactures and sells optoelectronic products that transmit, receive and switch high speed digital optical signals for communications networks,[2] These products include transceivers, tunable lasers, high bandwidth receivers, optical semiconductors, photonic integrated circuits, and 100 gigabit per second and above modules."[1] These are each "cost-effective components that handle massive amounts of data at very high speeds".[3]
NeoPhotonics products primarily implement coherent technology and include those designed for 100G and beyond data rates, such as at 200G, 400G and 600G, for telecom and datacenter or content provider networks and applications. The company's high speed 100G and beyond coherent products are based on Advanced Hybrid Photonic Integration technology.
Applications in coherent transmission use not only amplitude but also phase and polarization to increase data rates tenfold or more over conventional “on-off” transmission protocols. Coherent transmission is also necessary for next-generation flexible and efficient switching of signals individual wavelength without conflict or contention between wavelengths in an optical network, such as Software Defined Networks. Coherent transmission has become the technology of choice for the most advanced high speed telecommunications networks today.
Revenues from the company's high speed products have grown rapidly due to the rapid expansion of telecom backbone and content provider networks accommodating increased mobile traffic. Initial adoption of the company's 100G coherent products were in the Long Haul market sector, over the next several years it is expect that growth in 100G and beyond will be mainly driven by adoption of 100G coherent products in the much larger Metro market sector and the datacenter market for large web-scale data network market.
NeoPhotonics Corporation is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol NPTN.[4]
History[edit]
The company was co-founded by Chinese-born Sean Bi and Japanese-born Nobuyuki Kambe in 1996.[5] The two men were introduced by one of Bi's professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[5] Meanwhile, the company received an initial investment of US$1 million from Pete Thomas at Institutional Venture Partners.[5] The company was initially called NanoGram Corporation,[5] and pursued development of technologies and applications using inorganic nanomaterials. The company changed its name to NeoPhotonics Corporation in 2002.
At that time, and according to Forbes, in 2002, in the midst of the tech bubble, the company was reorganized into three companies: NanoGram Devices, which kept the battery-making technology for medical devices; NeoPhotonics, which went after the optical devices market; and a third firm, NanoGram Corp., which initially managed the intellectual property and then further developed optical and polymer films using nanomaterials. It also received US$35 million from investors in 2002.[6] In early 2003 the company acquired Lightwave Microsystems,[5] a manufacturer of silica-on-silica passive integrated optical products. Late that year, again in 2003, the company filed for reorganization under bankruptcy.[5] Shortly thereafter, after completing their reorganization and exiting bankruptcy, the company sold NanoGram Devices for approximately US$45 million to Greatbatch Technologies.[5]
In 2005, the company acquired ownership in Photo Tenchnology Co., Ltd., a Chinese manufacturer of optoelectric devices and modules, based in Shenzhen, China. By 2006 they acquired most all of Photon's outstanding shares. In the following years, NeoPhotonics further acquired optical component companies Optun, Inc., Lightconnect, Inc., BeamExpress, Inc., and Paxera Corp.
The company completed is initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange on February 2, 2011.[7] As of October 2016, the market capitalization of NeoPhotonics Corporation was approximately $700 million.[8]
As of June 2016, the company owned approximately 550 US patents and 100 patents overseas.[5] The company operates manufacturing in Silicon Valley, California; Tokyo, Japan; and Shenzhen, China.

Externally Modulated Laser
Photonics SpectraMay 2017NeoPhotonics Corp.Request Info 
        

            SAN JOSE, Calif. — A low-power-consumption, 28-GBaud externally modulated laser (EML) with an integrated driver from Neophotonics Corp. is designed for client side 4 x 25 NRZ 100-G, 4 x 50 PAM4 200-G and 8 x 50 PAM4 400-G applications.


The EML integrates a driver, which utilizes low-power linear GaAs amplifier technology, with the 28-GBaud EML at the chip-on-carrier (CoC) level. The CoC assembly fits into a four-channel transmitter optical sub-assembly (Quad TOSA), designed for 100-Gbps QSFP28 and CFP4 form factors, eliminating the need for a separate driver on the board.


Customers can directly link the CMOS-based CDR IC to the 28-GBaud CMOS drivable EML for low-power consumption and space savings. In PAM4 applications, the integrated linear driver the EML an attractive option for 200- and 400-Gbps applications due to the simple and direct connection to the PAM4/CDR IC.Visit company websitehttp://www.neophotonics.comAbout this supplier/Company.aspx?CompanyID=10132

NeoPhotonics Corporation











 Company Background
NeoPhotonics Corporation is a developer and vertically integrated manufacturer of photonic integrated circuit (PIC) based components, modules and subsystems for use in telecommunications networks. Their products include active semiconductor, passive PIC and MEMS multi-dimensional switching functions in a single product. This integration is enabled by nano-materials and nano-scale design and fabrication technologies. The company is a leading provider of optical components, modules and subsystems that enable the delivery of video, voice and data over telecommunications and cable TV networks.  NeoPhotonics maintains headquarters in San Jose, California and ISO 9001:2000 certified engineering and manufacturing facilities in Silicon Valley and Shenzhen, China (1a).
The company acquired Santur for $39.2 million in 2011. Santur manufactured tunable laser arrays for metropolitan and long-haul multiplexing systems for telecom networks, and PIC's based on indium phosphide. NeoPhotonics integrated Santur's complementary technology into its own products in an effort to tap new markets for optical networking gear driven by the growth of data centers (2).
Suppliers and Buyers
NeoPhotonics  makes more than half of its sales in China.  The company's top client is China-based communications equipment maker Huawei (which accounts for nearly half of sales); its other key customers include Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco Systems, Ericsson, Fujitsu, Mitsubishi Electric, NEC, and ZTE. NeoPhotonics' top 10 clients together account for nearly 90% of sales. This percentage has crept up in recent years making the company increasingly reliant upon a limited number of clients to sustain its revenue growth (2).
Strategic Partnerships
NeoPhotonics received more than $200 million in private equity funding from such investors as Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Harris & Harris Group, International Finance Corp., Institutional Venture Partners, Oak Investment Partners, prior to its IPO in 2011 (2).
In 2012, NeoPhotonics raised $40 million through a strategic investment from Rusnano.  Rusnano's Managing Director Sergey Polikarpov has also been appointed to the NeoPhotonics board of directors.
NeoPhotonics is planning to build R&D facilities in Russia. The company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes as well as to establish design and production capabilities in Russia. The expansion in Russia is expected to be completed by July 31, 2014 (3).
Innovation and Technology
NeoPhotonics have developed extensive expertise in the design, large-scale fabrication, high-volume module manufacturing and commercial deployment of our PIC products and technologies. The process of designing and manufacturing PICs in high volume with predictable, well-characterized performance and low manufacturing costs is complex and multi-faceted. In addition, through precise fabrication and positioning of physical features, NeoPhotonics integrates PIC devices fabricated on separate wafers out of different materials, matching the material to the function to improve performance attributes and reduce production costs. NeoPhotonics’ hybrid integration allows it to integrate active devices, such as lasers and photodiodes, with high-performance passive devices, such as switches, routers and filters, to provide the desired network functions on a single PIC.  NeoPhotonics also sells its products as modules and subsystems which contain electronic hardware and firmware control that can be interfaced directly with customer systems. NeoPhotonics designs the electronic hardware and develops the firmware to integrate these with NeoPhotonics’ optical products to meet customer specifications (1b).
NeoPhotonics believes that their vertically integrated manufacturing strategy, which extends from wafer fabrication through module and subsystem assembly and test, provides a sustainable competitive advantage in their industry. Manufacturing of their modules and subsystems is highly complex, utilizing extensive know-how in multiple disciplines and accumulated knowledge of manufacturing processes and equipment. NeoPhotonics vertically integrated manufacturing operations reduce the time required to develop, test and produce new products and configurations and enables higher performance, consistency and reliability. NeoPhotonics has developed proprietary testing methodologies that also help decrease development times, enabling NeoPhotonics to introduce products to the market more quickly (1b).
