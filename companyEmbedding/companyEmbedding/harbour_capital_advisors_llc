Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NN (NASDAQ:NNBR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $33.50 (21.16% upside)

Welcome to Harbour Capital Advisors
In 1997, Harbour Lights Holding Company was founded by a New York-based family to centralize management of their family businesses and investments. In January 2005, the family patriarch died unexpectedly at age 60. Without hesitation, his wife and family turned to Harbour Lights to navigate the transition of family assets and settlement of the estate. In their greatest hour of need, the family knew they had a trusted team in place which would ensure continued oversight of their business and investment holdings, while prudently planning and investing for future generations.
 
In 2011, Harbour Capital Advisors was formed to bring that same level of comfort, knowledgeable expertise and highly personalized service to other families.
As an independent, privately-owned firm, Harbour Capital Advisors delivers objective wealth management advice. Serving a limited number of families with complex financial needs, we are able to execute investment and planning ideas nimbly and efficiently. Built on the success of Harbour Lights over a generation, we harness the research, investment solutions and trading platforms of many of the world’s largest investment firms while maintaining independence through open architecture. We leverage the talents of our successful professionals and serve as one point of contact for “the business of the family”. Our mission is to solve problems our clients may not even know they have. We pride ourselves on being the family wealth guardian, trusted counselor and investment expert.
