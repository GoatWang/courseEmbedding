“As a rationalist and a mechanist, I view all phenomena as ultimately explainable. ‘There’s no such thing as magic,’ is one of my common refrains. But some observations may seem to contradict all past experience. That’s what makes science so interesting, and it’s why Kopf’s performance was especially delightful to watch. I saw it a month ago, and have been puzzling over it ever since. Kopf is a consummate artist, and I hope to understand one day how he was able to do what he did.” -Dr. Bruce Beutler, Nobel laureate

“Jared Kopf is a name one often hears whispered among magical cognoscenti. A protégé of Bob White, his sleight-of-hand skills are outstanding; and he is a serious student of the art, focusing like his teacher on what may be considered the Vernon tradition.” -MAGIC Magazine

“He’s one of the best card guys out there right now . . . You’re going to love his work. Professional on every level.” -Dan Buck

What will he teach?

Sleights

How to improve everything from your pinky break and double lift to your top palm and blind shufﬂe.
“Shufﬂe Sh*t” - A table multiple shift that will put even the most observant spectator to sleep.
Thoughts on the “Push-Through Shufﬂe”
The “Flops I Know” blind cut by John Wilson and Jared Kopf, and its applications to stack work
...And whatever else comes to mind!

Card Magic & Gambling Routines

The Copenhagen Card
A version of Hofzinser’s “Everywhere and Nowhere” with a strange presentation and fooling method utilizing sleights from the classic books of magic as well as from the gaming table.

An Open Display of Triumph
A version of Vernon’s classic that will fool lay audiences and experts alike. This method mirror’s the original from Stars of Magic, but there is no blind shufﬂe.

Merlin’s Lost Ace Trick
The classic knuckle-buster from Expert Card Technique, is taught in its original form along with a few presentational touches on the equivoke sequence.

On Marlo’s One-Rifﬂe Run-Up
A gambling demonstration in which the pseudo-cardshark shows how the four aces can be stacked for any number of hands with only one riffle shuffle.

Mentalism

A Simple Game
A version of the which-hand game, with three objects and three participants. Three people each select an object of their own free will, but the mentalist proves that he controlled their choices from the beginning.

Rifﬂe OOSOOM
A new set-up for Dai Vernon’s classic mental card effect, “Out of Sight, Out of Mind.”

Three-Card Will
A version of the so-called free will plot with a shufﬂed deck of cards.

*Set list is subject to change

His original effects have appeared in Genii and MUM and various digital projects. He lives with his wife Elayna and his son Martin in Dallas, Texas.

            While  the material explored in this lecture is surely comprehensive and valuable for any "card"
magician, Jared Kopf needs to learn how to teach what he knows in a manner that is clear and
structured without rambling from one thought to the next. There were so many segues from one though
to the next, that the original idea of the effect was lost in the long and arduous explanation of
the moves. After an hour, of watching and waiting for an explanation of the first thing he did, I
forgot entirely what he was talking about. Although his demonstrations of technique was excellent
the multiple and often annoying jump to another thought was distracting and left this observer
filled with lots of "moves" without substance. Suggestion to Jared…..do one thing and then explain
the method if you chose. You will be a better teacher as you have lots of knowledge that can be more
readily shared with the proper presentation.

            I think its only my attitude but i disliked that lecture cause i thought its more gambling than it
actually was and his teaching style is not that great. The material covered is mainly basic stuff
and hes not going in much detail on the push through although its announced. For Beginners its
probably good but for the others not that. You are probably better with Jason England or Joe Barry.

            Too much side talk and not focus on the main point of the trick.  I can tell that he truly thought
and spent lots of times developing his presentations and that is probably why he has a lot of
information to share - thank you, but no thank you.  The lecture was not a total waste of time, but
just not well presented to engage the attendees.  Dan had to steer him back on track and make
explained Jared points a few times.  Three stars.

            Jared never ceases to impress and this lecture is no exception.  Mr. Kopf is a link to the great
masters such Miller, Vernon and Marlo.  He has an understanding of conjuring technique and
psychology that is difficult to contend with as well as a vast knowledge of the art itself.
Any serious student of magic will definitely get their money's worth with this lecture.

            I feel like have a good understanding on sleight of hand, especially around cards. I picked
up so many tips on ways to improve my card magic and sleight of hand that I can't give this lecture
anything but 5 stars.  It really was fantastic. I found the effects that Jared taught to be
strong, but more importantly a great vehicle to teach the sleights he wanted to teach.  
Thanks Jared for your lecture.

            This is by far the best lecture i have ever seen, and i have seen (in person) Fielding West, David
stone, Shin Lim, Gene Anderson, Harry Anderson, David Gin, Rob Zabrecky, John Shryock, and countless
lectures on penguin live. You can tell he has the biggest passion for magic, like no other, if you
do any card magic at all you need to buy this lecture there is no question about it. If you dont buy
this lecture then you are defiantly missing on something, i wish i could give it 10 stars!

            If you want to go from doing card tricks to CARD MAGIC, get  Jared's Penguin Live lecture and learn
the difference. He knocked me out with simple, elegant techniques and clever plots that
will please any audience. A+++ on this must have lecture for  anyone that uses playing
cards in their magic.

            horrible teacher, terrible entertainer.  no way this guy gets booked for private events unless the
CEO is his relative. technicly sound, but rambles too much.  didn't teach one trick that is useable.
took forever to explain the card trick with 3 cards or 3 objects.  just a bore. i think penguin is
running out of magicians to lecture.

Jared Kopf
Any Cards at any Numbers























About the trick 


A stunning feat of the mind, Jared Kopf's Any Cards at any Numbers will leave your audience stunned and take your reputation to a whole new level. Imagine, a spectator and yourself choose two separate cards. Then, as if by a miracle, you know the position of their selection, and they know the exact position of yours. 
An intricately woven architecture makes Kopf's effect absolutely baffling--to both laymen and conjurors alike. If you're looking for a new closing effect, or just a hard-hitting stand alone piece, you have to pick up Any Cards at any Numbers. You won't regret it. 
And for those of you familiar with Karl Fulves' work, Jared has streamlined and improved a diabolical method you may already know.

Jared Kopf is a sleight-of-hand expert, conjuror, and mind reader trained in the classics and spurred by innovation. His unique approach to the art of legerdemain has bewildered audiences from all over the world. He has entertained millionaires and billionaires, actors and sports heroes, law enforcement officers and gaming experts, even his fellow tricksters and (so far) one Nobel laureate. With only his brain, hands, and occasionally some everyday objects—from playing cards, dice and currency, to lemons, coffee cups and phone books - Jared creates memorable amusement, mystery, and wonder.

Categories: Close Up, MentalismMedia Type: eBookFormat: CD-ROM 



Product Description
Jared Kopf is known in the underground for this close up sleight of hand magic, but what is not as well known is his creativity when it comes to performing and creating mentalism. This CD contains Jared's notes in PDF format, so they can be read on your computer or portable device. 

Paying with Magazine Clippings - They believe they see cash, and offer to sell you their clothes. What they thought was cash, are now clippings from a magazine. Altering someone's perception should not be this easy.

A Simple Game - Jared's version of which hand, done with three objects and three people. The routine builds to an impossible conclusion.

Impromptu Graphology - a way to mark four of the spectator's business cards on the fly. Combine this with any pseudopsychometry routine you know and blow some minds.

The Tarot Is Typically Tommyrot - a fortune telling routine done with a regular deck of cards

Run, Luke! Run! - Paul Swinford with a mentalism twist.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."
