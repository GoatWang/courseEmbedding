Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Product Description

 
Day traders are the fastest growing breed of investors today; known as “extreme investors,” they bypass brokers and trade directly on
NASDAQ or the NYSE. They have to be lightning fast because, at the stroke of a keyboard, they can lose big time—and many do. Yet their numbers keep swelling because, for those who are successful, earnings can reach $5,000 to $7,000 a day.
The unrivalled star of day trading in Canada is Charles Kim, part owner of Swift Trade Securities Inc., Canada’s first day-trading brokerage firm. Charles is the trader who trains the traders; in between his training sessions he can earn thousands of dollars a day, just by pushing the right buttons at the right times. Charles understands the market, the volatility of the stocks, the importance of intuition, the rules of the game, the issues at stake, and the value of “ethical” trading.
Swift Trader is Charles Kim’s primer on day trading. It’s a how-to guide that shows how to read the subtle movements and shifts on the volatile NASDAQ market, and it also gives an in-depth look at Canadian markets, as well as the specifics for day trading in Canada.
More of what’s inside:

how to make short-sell transactions
how to watch for trends
how to prepare a daily game plan
how to minimize your losses

About the Author
Toronto-based Charles Kim is a part owner of Swift Trade Securities Inc., the first day-trading brokerage firm in Canada, which has recently set up nine other offices across the country. A computer expert, Charles Kim had never traded on the stock market until he became involved in Swift Trade less than two years ago. Today he is very much in demand by the media and by would-be day traders who pay thousands of dollars to learn his techniques.
