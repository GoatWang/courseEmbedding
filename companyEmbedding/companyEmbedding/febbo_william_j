            OptimizeRx Corp Appoints William J. Febbo as CEO
       



 


            News
      
            2.22.2016
      



ROCHESTER, MI. – February 22, 2016 – OptimizeRx Corp. (OTCQB: OPRX), a software company whose premier content-delivery platform enables pharmaceutical companies to provide on-demand patient-savings and support services right at point of prescribe, has appointed William J. Febbo as chief executive officer. Febbo succeeds David Harrell, who will continue to serve as chairman of the Board. 
Febbo brings to OptimizeRx more than 18 years of experience in building and managing health services and financial businesses. His career includes strategic development, technology and product innovation, corporate finance, and M&A within a variety of leadership roles. 
“Will’s extensive leadership experience in both technology and healthcare companies made him the ideal candidate to lead us through our next stage of growth,” said Harrell. “In fact, he has already contributed important leadership when, as COO of Merriman Capital, he helped secure WPP's investment via their operating company, Grey Healthcare Group (GHG), a leading provider of healthcare communications services.”
Febbo commented: “When I met Dave and his team, it was clear they had the vision and passion to strengthen OptimizeRx’s market leadership in automating copay savings and product support right within physicians’ electronic workflow. I helped lead the discussions for GHG to become a strategic investor, given their domain expertise, client reach, and strong leadership team. This team includes their CEO, Lynn Vos O’Connor, who recently joined OptimizeRx’s board. Through this equity partnership, we plan to navigate OptimizeRx’s EHR eco-system and its unique pathway between medical professionals and industry to grow more brands and services.”
OptimizeRx has partnered with more than 20 of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world, including Pfizer, Lilly, Novartis, Sanofi, Bayer and AstraZeneca. These companies have automated their copay savings and trial voucher programs using OptimizeRx’s proprietary, on-demand, content delivery platform that reaches more than 250,000 healthcare providers through a network of over 350 electronic health records (EHRs).
OptimizeRx’s automation of copay savings for brand drugs as a replacement of traditional drug samples represents a total projected addressable market of more than $1 billion, with Surescripts forecast of more than 2 billion electronic prescriptions for 2016.
More and more pharmaceutical and biotech companies are seeking higher return on investment on their marketing by working with innovative digital platforms like OptimizeRx. The OptimizeRx platform has demonstrated an ROI of up to 12:1, according to independent studies sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. These companies recognize the need for new ways to reach and support doctors who have less and less time to spend with pharmaceutical sales representatives.
“Our digital content-delivery platform is supporting the pharmaceutical industry’s shift from legacy paper prescription and sampling to a digitally enabled relationship between patient and medical provider,” continued Febbo. “By connecting the fragmented EHR environment, we deliver streamlined information to physicians and measurably improve the patient experience.  We provide innovative solutions to increase adherence to prescriptions, which represents a major obstacle to achieving improved health outcomes. OptimizeRx has the capital to expand its sales and marketing efforts, as well as launch new products and services to drive revenue growth.”
Lynn O’Connor Vos, OptimizeRx’s director and CEO of ghg, commented: “Will’s appointment comes at an opportune time with WPP and OptimizeRx developing new platforms to deliver vital information to physicians and patients. Together, we plan to expand OptimizeRx’s point-of-care EHR promotional network and service offerings.”
