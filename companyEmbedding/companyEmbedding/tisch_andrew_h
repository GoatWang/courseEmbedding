Andrew Tisch is the co-chair of Loews Corporation, the company founded by his father Larry Tisch and uncle Bob Tisch. Together with his brother, James S. Tisch, and his first cousin, Jonathan Tisch, Andrew oversees a holding company involved in hotels, oil, and insurance.[1] His mother is Wilma "Billie" Stein.
Like his brother and cousin — with whom he makes up the triumvirate now in charge of the family business — Andrew has been involved with the company his entire career. In the 1980s, he served as president of Bulova; a decade later, he moved over to the Lorillard Tobacco Company. (Loews has since divested both.)
Testifying under oath before Congress in 1994, Tisch said that he didn't believe that nicotine is addictive nor that cigarette smoking causes cancer.[2]
Following the deaths of Loews founders Larry and Bob, the reins were handed to Andrew's brother, Jim, who now serves as CEO. His first cousin Jon oversees the company's hotel business.
Andrew's other first cousin — Jon's brother — is Steve Tisch, the movie mogul who produced Forrest Gump, Risky Business, and other big-budget Hollywood films, as well as co-owner of the National Football League's New York Giants. Andrew has two other brothers: Tom Tisch and Dan Tisch. Both own significant stakes in Loews Corp., but are not involved on a day-to-day basis.
Andrew devotes a great deal of his time to many local and national organizations. Some of the civic organizations with which he is currently involved include the City Parks Foundation (chairman), the Wildlife Conservation Society (trustee/secretary), and the New York City Police Foundation (trustee/executive committee).
He is deeply involved in critical issues affecting education. He holds leadership positions at Harvard Business School (Dean's Board of Advisors), Cornell University (vice chairman of the Board of Trustees) and the Young Women's Leadership Foundation (co-founder). He is also a member of the Economic Club of New York (former chairman), the Brookings Institution (trustee), and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
Andrew is active in Jewish communal affairs through the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (trustee); the Jewish Leadership Forum (founding chairman); and the Jewish Business Leadership Forum (founder).
He holds a B.S. degree from Cornell University (1971) and an M.B.A. from Harvard University (1977). Andrew is married to educator and journalist Ann Rubenstein Tisch and lives in New York.
Personal life[edit]
Andrew has been married twice:

Susan Hiat Tisch Allen who he has since divorced. They have a son, Alexander Hiat Tisch (born 1979) and a daughter Lacey Ann Tisch (born 1980). Both Lacey and Alexander were married by Susan Hiat's father, a rabbi, at the Central Synagogue in Manhattan.[3][4] Susan's sister, Merryl Hiat, is married to Andrew's brother, James S. Tisch.
Ann Rubenstein Tisch, a former reporter for NBC who co-founded an all-girls public school in Harlem.[5] They have two daughters named Sarah Tisch and Charlotte Tisch.
