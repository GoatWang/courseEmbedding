History 
The History of Salzman International
The company was founded shortly after World War II by Herbert A. Salzman, when he returned from the War and went into the meatpacking business with his father. Salzman wasn’t fond of the work and opened his own business, then called Centennial Corp., to process animal glands to be used in the pharmaceutical industry. He enjoyed the work more, because the products helped men and women live normal lives.
By the 1970s, the company was one of the world's leading manufacturers of insulin to control diabetes. Our company has continued to earn a highly respected status with suppliers and customers alike; companies appreciate our history of service, integrity and reliability.
The company has grown to address the needs of it's customers and meet the demand for our growing range of products. The company is still family owned and operates according to the demanding standards established by our founder.
Our customers have come to depend on us to serve as a vital part of their team, trusting our ability to fill the need for new products developed in a strictly controlled environment according to exacting standards.

Company Description


Salzman & Co's investment objective is to outperform the S&P 500 over a given business cycle. The firm's primary strategy is to focus on investments in businesses deemed to be undervalued and event-driven investments. Salzman uses fundamental research to analyze and value individual investments and seeks to identify investment opportunities priced below the fundamental value that they attribute to such investments. The firm seeks to identify investment opportunities they believe are well-managed, strategically and operationally strong and priced at an attractive valuation relative to their long-term intrinsic values. Salzman maintains a long-term investment horizon. They may, on occasion, also elect to use a variety of additional strategies including short sales and investment futures, options, and warrants or other derivative instruments, and investments in real estate and real estate related assets.
