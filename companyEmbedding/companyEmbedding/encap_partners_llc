The Wurster fluid bed coating technique mastered by Coating Place was invented by Dr. Dale E. Wurster Ph.D. in 1958. Since that time, Coating Place has remained the leading Wurster fluid bed coating services supplier in the industry.Coating Place expanded its manufacturing facility in 2012 through the purchase of its Specialty Chemical Manufacturing Facility located in Sauk City, WI. This 110,000 ft² facility features numerous Wurster fluid bed coating units capable of custom manufacturing a variety of Specialty Chemical or Food Grade GMP products.Work in the specialty chemical industry began for Coating Place in 1977, soon after its founding. In 1987, Coating Place began development work on the microencapsulation of breaker products for numerous oil field service companies. Coating Place was the exclusive supplier of breaker products to one of the leading service companies for over 20 years. Encapsulated breaker is used in the hydraulic fracturing industry to delay the release of active breaker material into the fracturing fluid. This time-released delay allows the material to be pumped to higher well temperatures before reaction occurs. Coating Place was a forerunner in the innovation of encapsulated breakers during the surge for delayed release breaker solutions. With over 35 years of experience in the specialty chemical field, Coating Place is capable of unique solutions for problems posed by the industry.

Lawn Patch Kit - Encap

































































 
 







Lawn Patch Kit

With a powerful blend of mulch, seed and fertilizer, Encap’s Lawn Patch Kit achieves excellent results with minimal effort. Simply rake your lawn, spread the specialized formula, water and you’re done. The fertilizer goes to work at the source, invigorating roots to help develop more robust grass, while the biodegradable mulch maintains a moist, nurturing environment. It’s a straightforward way to enhance the lush, natural beauty of your yard.

Contains mulch, seed & fertilizer
Easily blends new growth into existing lawn
Covers & repairs bare spots
Safe for people & pets

Coverage: 100 sq. ft.


 Maximize Results



Prepare the seed bed with a rake by loosening the top 2-3 inches of soil; break up large dirt clods so soil particles are pea sized
Apply Lawn Patch Kit right from the bag spreading it out to no more than 1/8 inch thick on top of the prepared seed bed; you can use a fan rake to help spread it around
Water throughly! This is the most important step
Make sure the first 1/2 inch of soil is moist, which may require watering twice a day, and continue to water for at least 3 weeks after planting until the grass has completely filled in and blended into your existing lawn
Grass seed should germinate in 7-18 days depending on variety

Tall Oak focused its operations in the Mid-Continent, where the company developed and expanded two natural gas gathering and processing systems: the CNOW System and the STACK system. Tall Oak established an impressive footprint of gathering, processing and compression assets in Oklahoma’s STACK and CNOW plays that included more than 500 miles of planned pipeline (375 miles in service), multiple compressor stations and 175 MMcf/d in processing capacity. The company also developed a crude oil system to serve producers in the STACK play.Based in Oklahoma City, Tall Oak Midstream is led by its four founders; Ryan D. Lewellyn, CEO; Max J. Myers, CFO; Carlos P. Evans, CCO; and Lindel R. Larison, COO. The founders formed Tall Oak Midstream II in 2015. The team is pursuing midstream opportunities in other basins across North America.Nuevo Midstream, November 2014In November 2014 Western Gas Partners, LP (NYSE: WES) completed the acquisition of Nuevo Midstream for $1.5 billion. Nuevo focused on developing, acquiring, owning and operating natural gas midstream assets in growing production areas to provide services to producers such as natural gas gathering, compression, transportation, measurement, treating/conditioning and processing. Nuevo's business strategy focused on building strong, effective partnerships with customers and purchasers of the products delivered from its systems. The company's growth was be driven by organic growth from its existing asset base and asset acquisitions as well as grassroots development projects. Nuevo focused on established producing basins where its management team has prior experience and established relationships and those basins experiencing significant activity. The Nuevo management team has extensive experience developing, owning and operating midstream assets throughout the United States, including west Texas, the Gulf Coast, Midcontinent, Midwest and California.Nuevo focused on the operation and expansion of its significant natural gas gathering processing footprint in the rapidly developing Delaware Basin in west Texas and southeast New Mexico, with particular focus on the production from the Avalon Shale trend and the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp formations. This region of the Permian Basin is generating strong demand for midstream infrastructure and the marketing services producers require to rapidly deliver liquids to high value markets.Cardinal Midstream, December 2012Headquartered in Dallas, Cardinal Midstream provides oil and gas producers with a complete array of midstream services including natural gas gathering, transportation, processing and treating. Cardinal’s growth strategy centered on building a full-service midstream business through acquisition and grassroots development projects. The company was founded in 2008 by Mack Lawrence, Jim Bryant, Doug Dormer and Marc Lyons.On December 20, 2012, Atlas Pipeline Partners (NYSE: APL) completed the acquisition of substantially all of Cardinal Midstream's assets for $600 million. These assets include three operated cryogenic processing plants located in the Arkoma region of Oklahoma’s Woodford Shale totaling 220 million cubic feet per day in processing capacity, approximately 66 miles of gathering pipelines, treating and compression facilities, and a natural gas contract treating business. Cardinal’s management team is currently assessing opportunities for the continued pursuit of midstream development in unconventional resource plays across North America.Rangeland Energy, December 2012Founded in 2009, Rangeland Energy targeted development and acquisition opportunities in North Dakota's emerging Bakken oil-shale play in North Dakota. The company developed the COLT Hub, North Dakota's largest open-access crude oil loading terminal. On December 7, 2012, Inergy Midstream, L.P. (NYSE: NRGM) completed the acquisition of the COLT Hub and related assets, for $425 million.Rangeland's management team has a strong track record of developing, constructing, acquiring, operating, optimizing and expanding both greenfield and existing crude oil, refined products and associated natural gas midstream assets. Construction of the COLT Hub began in May 2011. With six 120,000-barrel storage tanks and two 8,700-foot rail loops, the COLT Hub accommodates large 120-car unit trains and is capable of moving more than 120,000 barrels of crude oil per day out of the Bakken Shale. The COLT Connector, a 21-mile bidirectional pipeline connects the COLT Hub to Rangeland’s terminal at Dry Fork near the Beaver Lodge/Ramberg junction. The COLT Connector is capable of transporting an additional 70,000 barrels per day by pipeline. At the time of sale, The COLT system served four large crude oil refiners/marketers including Tesoro Corporation and Flint Hills Resources. Rangeland established inbound gathering connection agreements with Bear Tracker Energy, the Hiland Crude Market Center and the Tesoro High Plains Pipeline as well as outbound connections with Enbridge and Tesoro at its terminal near Beaver Lodge/Ramberg.Rangeland Energy will continue to pursue crude oil logistics opportunities, leveraging its extensive experience and expertise to pursue opportunities in the refined products arena. Complementary to Rangeland’s crude oil gathering strategy in areas of growing crude oil production there also exists the need for additional refined products facilities. Rangeland will target acquisition and development opportunities to provide transportation, storage and terminal services for petroleum products.Caiman Energy, April 2012On April 27, 2012, Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ) completed the acquisition of Caiman Energy’s wholly owned subsidiary, Caiman Eastern Midstream LLC, for approximately $2.5 billion. In 2009 EnCap Flatrock Midstream joined with EnCap Investments L.P. to support the formation of Caiman Energy with initial equity commitments. EnCap Flatrock made additional commitments to Caiman as the company expanded its footprint in the Marcellus Shale. Williams' acquisition of Caiman Eastern Midstream resulted in a very positive return for our investors. EnCap Flatrock is proud to re-back the Caiman management team and Caiman Energy II as the company develops similar infrastructure in the Utica Shale.Caiman's senior management team has more than 120 years of experience in designing, building, owning, operating and acquiring midstream assets in shale plays including the Barnett, Haynesville and Marcellus and has a strong reputation for superior producer service, the ability to quickly design and build midstream infrastructure and a track record of operational safety and reliability. Caiman's mission is to leverage its partners' deep industry experience to become a premier provider of midstream services to oil and gas producers and end users. Consistent with management’s past business success, Caiman’s strategy centers around building a natural gas midstream business focused on the acquisition and development of gathering, transportation, processing and treating assets in established producing basins where the team can successfully leverage its experience and relationships.The acquisition of Caiman Eastern Midstream will provide Williams Partners with a significant footprint and growth potential in the natural gas liquids-rich portion of the Marcellus Shale. Caiman Eastern Midstream is an independent gathering and processing business located in northern West Virginia, southwestern Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. Caiman Eastern's physical assets include a gathering system, two processing facilities and a fractionator. Caiman Energy will participate in a new joint venture with Williams Partners to develop midstream infrastructure in the NGL and oil-rich areas of the Utica Shale, primarily in Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania.Meritage Midstream Services, April 2012On April 12, 2012, Howard Energy Partners (HEP) acquired substantially all of Meritage Midstream Services' natural gas gathering assets in south Texas.
