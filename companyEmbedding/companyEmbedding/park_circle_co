Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

What Will Be the Lasting Impact of Brexit on US Mortgages?
Steve Cook
 Although Britain will not actually implement June’s Brexit referendum to leave the European Union until next March at the earliest, it has already made a major impact on US mortgage rates. Will the long term impact of Brexit be as significant?
Within days of the referendum, uncertainty about the potential impact of Brexit on European economies caused investors to sell riskier global stocks and buy safer...

Welcome to the end of masonry restoration failures


After over 30 years in the laboratory, Cathedral Stone has got masonry restoration down to a science.
As the world’s premier manufacturer of masonry restoration mortar systems, and more recently a manufacturer of masonry restoration cleaning, stripping, coating and repellent systems, we put every one of our products to the test. Day after day. Year after year.
The result? A complete line of integrated systems that have been tried, tested, and scientifically proven to be completely compatible with the unique physical properties of all masonry substrates – and each other.
That’s why our systems work. That’s why our restorations last. The first time. Every time.
No wonder Cathedral Stone has become the partner of choice for architects, preservationists and historic building owners charged with restoring and preserving some of the most treasured architectural structures.
Want to know more? Contact us today to find out how Cathedral Stone can put an end to masonry restoration failures on your next project.

Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

What Will Be the Lasting Impact of Brexit on US Mortgages?
Steve Cook
 Although Britain will not actually implement June’s Brexit referendum to leave the European Union until next March at the earliest, it has already made a major impact on US mortgage rates. Will the long term impact of Brexit be as significant?
Within days of the referendum, uncertainty about the potential impact of Brexit on European economies caused investors to sell riskier global stocks and buy safer...

                    Woodland Park is a town of 12,000 people at 8450 feet. It has its own grocery stores and amenities, some nice restaurants and several surreal views of Pike's Peak. Single family homes are the rule, with values ranging from mobiles and modulars on the land at $100,000, to executive community subdivisions in the $350,000 to $1,000,000 range, to magnificent multi-million-dollar mountain estates on acreage (typically 35+ acres). "Woodland" is 25 minutes from downtown Colorado Springs.

                    It was great to work with Jim and Rhea to make their vision of moving from Colorado Springs to the more tranquil and serene life of Woodland Park a reality.  They are looking forward to settling into their new home over the holidays in Woodland Park while being close enough to Colorado Springs for professional reasons, yet able to get away to a much more calm and private atmosphere with their new home in Woodland Park.
