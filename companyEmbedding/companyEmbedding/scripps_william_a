Biography[edit]
He was born on May 6, 1882 to James E. Scripps, the founder of Detroit’s Evening News. His uncle (father's half-brother) Edward W. Scripps, founded the E.W. Scripps Company; and his aunt (father's half-sister), Ellen Browning Scripps, was a noted philanthropist. He was a great uncle to Samuel H. Scripps. His brother-in-law, George Gough Booth, worked alongside him in the newspaper and radio industry. His nephew (George's son) was James Scripps Booth, an artist and automotive engineer.
Scripps married Nina Amenda Downey and had four children. A one-room schoolhouse on the family property was named for his wife.[1] When his son James Edmund II died of appendicitis in 1925 at 22, Scripps and his wife donated a painting to the Detroit Art Museum in his memory.
He died in 1952.
Estate[edit]
See also: Scripps Mansion
In 1916, he began purchasing large tracts of farmland in Lake Orion, Michigan with an ambition to raise livestock and show animals, including Angus cattle, swine, cows, and poultry. The estate, called Wildwood Farms, grew in size to 3,830 acres (15.5 km2).[2]
In the mid-1920s Scripps hired his brother-in-law, architect Clarence E. Day, to build a new home for his family on the northwest quadrant of the property. Scripps Mansion, a magnificent Norman and Tudor style dwelling, was completed in 1927. It has served as a guest house and retreat center for the Catholic church since the 1950s and is not open to the public, except on scheduled guided tours showcasing the interior design and garden.[3]
Many of the European paintings from the estate were later donated to the Detroit Institute of Arts.[4] William was an active contributor to the DIA, and his father James was an original founder of the permanent collection building.
After his death in 1952, the farm livestock and equipment was auctioned off, and the land was sold or donated for parkland to Orion Township, Oakland County, and the state of Michigan (Bald Mountain Recreation Area).[3] The farm buildings and employee housing were later developed in the Canterbury Village shopping center.[5]
In 2007 the estate was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[citation needed]
Aviation and boating[edit]
Scripps was an avid aviator and promoted aviation through his father's newspaper, The Detroit News, which he helped run from 1929–1952. In 1913, Scripps flew a Curtis Model F flying boat underneath the original Belle Isle Bridge.[6]
Scripps invited Amelia Earhart to Lake Orion in 1929, where she successfully tested an experimental glider.
In 1904, Scripps helped found the Gold Cup boat racing series on the Detroit River.
Media[edit]
William had a role with the News after his father's death, although the paper was primarily run by George Gough Booth; William's brother in law.
William and his brother John Scripps were original founders of WWJ (AM) radio in 1920. Worried that radio might interfere with newspaper sales, the Scripps family invested in the new medium. Housed in The Detroit News Building, it began limited broadcasts that same year. During the 1940s, William established the first radio broadcasting of Alcoholics Anonymous. The station remained under News ownership until 1987, when U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations mandated a sale to prevent cross ownership. WWJ is currently broadcasting as a popular all-news format.
In 1947 the News also founded a television station, WWJ TV. That station remains on the air, however it is now known as WDIV-TV. A new and separate station known as WWJ-TV began operations in 1978.

Research Focus
In the 20th century the art and science of complex natural product total synthesis defined the frontiers of organic chemistry. Throughout these decades fundamental insights into reactivity and selectivity principles were achieved by these numerous synthetic endeavors. The capability and power of organic synthesis has thus experienced a dramatic increase putting today’s synthetic chemists in the position to construct molecules of more or less any degree of structural complexity. The perception defining “art” in organic synthesis has therefore changed with time and in our opinion is described best by Hendrickson when he addressed the “ideal synthesis” as one which: “…creates a complex molecule… in a sequence of only construction reactions involving no intermediary refunctionalizations, and leading directly to the target, not only its skeleton but also its correctly placed functionality” (Hendrickson, J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975, 97, 5784). This prescient statement truly encompasses and epitomizes the “economies” of synthesis design many years before ideas of atom, step, and redox-economy were formally galvanized. Now, in 2010, the field has reached an awe-inspiring level, with many proclaiming that synthesis has matured. But before one declares the science of synthesis an endeavor in engineering, one only needs to reflect on the inspiring ease with which Nature crafts large quantities of her most complex molecules (e.g. vancomycin and taxol). Total synthesis in this century must therefore be keenly aware of this ultimate challenge – to be able to provide large quantities of complex natural products with a minimum amount of labor and material expenses. The natural consequence of pursuing such a goal is to embrace the Hendrickson dictum (vide supra). Pursuing synthesis in such a way forces the practitioner into the role of an inventor. It naturally also leads to explorations into biology since multiple collaborations can be forged with ample materials.

William E. Scripps in a Curtiss Model F in 1914


William Edmund Scripps (May 6, 1882 – 1952) was a pioneer aviator and the publisher of The Detroit News. He was also an original founder of the WWJ radio station.

Biography[edit]
He was born on May 6, 1882 to James E. Scripps, the founder of Detroit’s Evening News. His uncle (father's half-brother) Edward W. Scripps, founded the E.W. Scripps Company; and his aunt (father's half-sister), Ellen Browning Scripps, was a noted philanthropist. He was a great uncle to Samuel H. Scripps. His brother-in-law, George Gough Booth, worked alongside him in the newspaper and radio industry. His nephew (George's son) was James Scripps Booth, an artist and automotive engineer.
Scripps married Nina Amenda Downey and had four children. A one-room schoolhouse on the family property was named for his wife.[1] When his son James Edmund II died of appendicitis in 1925 at 22, Scripps and his wife donated a painting to the Detroit Art Museum in his memory.
He died in 1952.
Estate[edit]
See also: Scripps Mansion
In 1916, he began purchasing large tracts of farmland in Lake Orion, Michigan with an ambition to raise livestock and show animals, including Angus cattle, swine, cows, and poultry. The estate, called Wildwood Farms, grew in size to 3,830 acres (15.5 km2).[2]
In the mid-1920s Scripps hired his brother-in-law, architect Clarence E. Day, to build a new home for his family on the northwest quadrant of the property. Scripps Mansion, a magnificent Norman and Tudor style dwelling, was completed in 1927. It has served as a guest house and retreat center for the Catholic church since the 1950s and is not open to the public, except on scheduled guided tours showcasing the interior design and garden.[3]
Many of the European paintings from the estate were later donated to the Detroit Institute of Arts.[4] William was an active contributor to the DIA, and his father James was an original founder of the permanent collection building.
After his death in 1952, the farm livestock and equipment was auctioned off, and the land was sold or donated for parkland to Orion Township, Oakland County, and the state of Michigan (Bald Mountain Recreation Area).[3] The farm buildings and employee housing were later developed in the Canterbury Village shopping center.[5]
In 2007 the estate was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[citation needed]
Aviation and boating[edit]
Scripps was an avid aviator and promoted aviation through his father's newspaper, The Detroit News, which he helped run from 1929–1952. In 1913, Scripps flew a Curtis Model F flying boat underneath the original Belle Isle Bridge.[6]
Scripps invited Amelia Earhart to Lake Orion in 1929, where she successfully tested an experimental glider.
In 1904, Scripps helped found the Gold Cup boat racing series on the Detroit River.
Media[edit]
William had a role with the News after his father's death, although the paper was primarily run by George Gough Booth; William's brother in law.
William and his brother John Scripps were original founders of WWJ (AM) radio in 1920. Worried that radio might interfere with newspaper sales, the Scripps family invested in the new medium. Housed in The Detroit News Building, it began limited broadcasts that same year. During the 1940s, William established the first radio broadcasting of Alcoholics Anonymous. The station remained under News ownership until 1987, when U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations mandated a sale to prevent cross ownership. WWJ is currently broadcasting as a popular all-news format.
In 1947 the News also founded a television station, WWJ TV. That station remains on the air, however it is now known as WDIV-TV. A new and separate station known as WWJ-TV began operations in 1978.

Research Summary: Marine Natural Products Drug Discovery
Dr. Gerwick's research focuses on exploring the unique natural products of marine algae and cyanobacteria for useful biomedical properties. These chemically prolific organisms are sources of numerous highly unusual metabolites, and the Gerwick group has been involved in their discovery and evaluation in the areas of cancer, inflammation, infectious disease including tropical diseases such as malaria, chagasâ disease, leishmaniasis, neurochemical pathways, as well as agricultural uses. The Gerwick group has also examined the pathways of biosynthesis of many of the compounds they have discovered over the years, and pioneered the characterization of their origins at the molecular genetic and genomic levels. More recently, his group has also applied their chemical and genetic approaches to the goal of obtaining biofuels from cultured microalgae.
Dr. Gerwick's group uses SCUBA to collect marine samples from around the world, such as Panama, Madagascar and Papua New Guinea, and grows many of these life forms in the laboratory in La Jolla. Extracts of these organisms are tested for bioactivity, and the active compounds are isolated and structures defined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). Highly interesting metabolites are developed through collaboration with academic and industrial researchers, and biosynthetic pathways determined using gene cloning and other molecular biological methods.

Biography[edit]
He was born on May 6, 1882 to James E. Scripps, the founder of Detroit’s Evening News. His uncle (father's half-brother) Edward W. Scripps, founded the E.W. Scripps Company; and his aunt (father's half-sister), Ellen Browning Scripps, was a noted philanthropist. He was a great uncle to Samuel H. Scripps. His brother-in-law, George Gough Booth, worked alongside him in the newspaper and radio industry. His nephew (George's son) was James Scripps Booth, an artist and automotive engineer.
Scripps married Nina Amenda Downey and had four children. A one-room schoolhouse on the family property was named for his wife.[1] When his son James Edmund II died of appendicitis in 1925 at 22, Scripps and his wife donated a painting to the Detroit Art Museum in his memory.
He died in 1952.
Estate[edit]
See also: Scripps Mansion
In 1916, he began purchasing large tracts of farmland in Lake Orion, Michigan with an ambition to raise livestock and show animals, including Angus cattle, swine, cows, and poultry. The estate, called Wildwood Farms, grew in size to 3,830 acres (15.5 km2).[2]
In the mid-1920s Scripps hired his brother-in-law, architect Clarence E. Day, to build a new home for his family on the northwest quadrant of the property. Scripps Mansion, a magnificent Norman and Tudor style dwelling, was completed in 1927. It has served as a guest house and retreat center for the Catholic church since the 1950s and is not open to the public, except on scheduled guided tours showcasing the interior design and garden.[3]
Many of the European paintings from the estate were later donated to the Detroit Institute of Arts.[4] William was an active contributor to the DIA, and his father James was an original founder of the permanent collection building.
After his death in 1952, the farm livestock and equipment was auctioned off, and the land was sold or donated for parkland to Orion Township, Oakland County, and the state of Michigan (Bald Mountain Recreation Area).[3] The farm buildings and employee housing were later developed in the Canterbury Village shopping center.[5]
In 2007 the estate was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[citation needed]
Aviation and boating[edit]
Scripps was an avid aviator and promoted aviation through his father's newspaper, The Detroit News, which he helped run from 1929–1952. In 1913, Scripps flew a Curtis Model F flying boat underneath the original Belle Isle Bridge.[6]
Scripps invited Amelia Earhart to Lake Orion in 1929, where she successfully tested an experimental glider.
In 1904, Scripps helped found the Gold Cup boat racing series on the Detroit River.
Media[edit]
William had a role with the News after his father's death, although the paper was primarily run by George Gough Booth; William's brother in law.
William and his brother John Scripps were original founders of WWJ (AM) radio in 1920. Worried that radio might interfere with newspaper sales, the Scripps family invested in the new medium. Housed in The Detroit News Building, it began limited broadcasts that same year. During the 1940s, William established the first radio broadcasting of Alcoholics Anonymous. The station remained under News ownership until 1987, when U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations mandated a sale to prevent cross ownership. WWJ is currently broadcasting as a popular all-news format.
In 1947 the News also founded a television station, WWJ TV. That station remains on the air, however it is now known as WDIV-TV. A new and separate station known as WWJ-TV began operations in 1978.

Research Focus
Over many years the major focus of our research effort has focused on the synthesis of stereochemically complex, biologically active natural products and the development of new synthetic methodology. Significant emphasis is placed on the discovery, development, and/or illustration of new reactions and synthetic methods in this research. Some of these synthesis projects have involved intramolecular cycloaddition reactions. Others make use of acyclic diastereoselective or enantioselective stereochemical techniques. We are increasingly pursuing research programs in bioorganic chemistry, chemical biology and medicinal chemistry, including the design and synthesis of inhibitors of cysteine proteases isolated from tropical parasites.  Additional projects focus on the develop potent, selective inhibitors of several kinases and proteases, inhibitors of certain epigenetic targets, inhibitors (inverse agonists) or activators of nuclear receptors, the design and synthesis of selective CYP51 inhibitors, and small molecule inhibotors of carboxylic acid transporters as potential therapeutic agents, among others.  Studies focusing on the development of new technology for synthesis of antibody-crug conjugates are also in progress.

Proposal Abstract: 


	Bacteria belonging to the Order Actinomycetales, commonly called actinomycetes, account for  approximately 75% of the microbial natural products used in human therapy. While major  pharmaceutical companies have moved en masse away from natural products as a resource for small molecule drug discovery, it has recently become recognized that actinomycetes derived  from marine sources represent an important new source of structurally diverse natural products. 

	In particular, marine actinomycetes belonging to the genus Salinispora have proven to be a rich  source of biologically active secondary metabolites including salinosporamide A, which recently  completed phase I clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. The compounds produced by this  chemically prolific genus span virtually all known biosynthetic classes and have led to the  characterization of a growing number of unprecedented biosynthetic paradigms. After more than 

	two decades of extensive marine sampling, we have amassed a collection of more that 5,000 diverse Salinispora strains. This collection provides unprecedented opportunities to further explore the biosynthetic potential of this extraordinary taxon and to address fundamental questions about mechanistic biochemistry and the evolutionary processes that generate new structural diversity. Here we propose the continuation of a genome-mining project that was initiated less than four years ago to analyze six Salinispora genome sequences. 

	 

	This renewal application builds upon the productive collaboration established between the Moore (biosynthesis/genome mining), Jensen (bioinformatics/microbiology) and William Fenical (natural product chemistry) laboratories. In this renewal, we specifically address five major aims: 1) the bioinformatic analysis of 101 Salinispora genome sequences, 2) the genome guided isolation and characterization of new, biologically active Salinispora natural products, 3) the expression of Salinispora biosynthetic gene clusters by transformation-associated recombination cloning, 4) the activation of ‘silent’ biosynthetic pathways by regulatory manipulation, and 5) the biosynthetic analysis of the Salinispora mTOR inhibitor lymphostin. These aims address fundamentally important questions related to the diversity and distributions of secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways in a well-defined taxon and the evolutionary processes that generate new small molecule diversity.
