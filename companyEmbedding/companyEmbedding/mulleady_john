Mulleady also worked for Wal-Mart International in Argentina and Home Depot in the United States, Argentina, Chile, and Mexico.
"I'm excited to be part of such a dynamic brand, particularly one with such tremendous growth potential," said Mulleady. "I look forward to helping to bring the Dave & Buster's experience to more customers and markets across the nation and, in the process, continuing to build value for our investors."

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.
