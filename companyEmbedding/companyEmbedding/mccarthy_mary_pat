SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 24, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Palo Alto Networks® (NYSE: PANW), the next-generation security company, today announced the appointment of Mary Pat McCarthy to the company's board of directors. She also will be joining the board's audit committee.

Ms. McCarthy is a member of the Risk Advisory Committee of the National Association of Corporate Directors. She also co-chaired the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) Blue Ribbon Commission on talent development and co-authored multiple books on risk, strategy and business transformation.
In addition to this new appointment to the board of directors for Palo Alto Networks, Ms. McCarthy currently serves on the boards and audit committees for Tesoro Corporation and Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company.
