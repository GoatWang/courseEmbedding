The Obama administration did all they could to keep it out of the press.   

"After the Fawnbrook case, the Refugee Center partnered with a behavioral agency to hold therapy groups with school-aged refugee children who’d recently arrived in Twin Falls “so they understand that type of behavior isn’t acceptable,” Rwasama said.

It was part of a program children regularly attend on Wednesdays after school.

Our response is to bring hoards of immigrants who think rape is OK, then we retrain them to USA norms?   They don't come to be americans, they come as invaders would.Join the Conversation1 / 5269
