Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

                                            Your Retirement Big Picture: Where Do Annuities Fit?

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

What is a Select Variable Annuity?
When accumulating savings for your retirement, you know that saving in a tax-deferred account lets you save more over time and get the most benefit from the power of compounding. The Select Variable Annuity from Northwestern Mutual provides an additional way to save money for retirement and enjoy tax-deferred growth.1 You can start with a small balance and make additional payments over time or roll over funds from other retirement savings plans. Either way, the Select Variable Annuity offers investment choices that provide you the opportunity to engage a select team of investment professionals at Northwestern Mutual.
When you’re ready to retire, you can receive income through either withdrawals or as a lifetime income plan that you can’t outlive.
Is a Select Variable Annuity right for you?
This variable annuity may be right for you if you:

Have contributed the maximum allowed to your 401(k), 403(b), or IRA and would like the potential for additional tax-deferred growth with your savings or taxable investments.
Want to take advantage of the potential for tax-deferred growth for funds that don’t qualify for other retirement accounts.
Are looking for fee-free, tax-free transfers among a wide range of diverse, professionally managed investment funds including:
    
Fixed, bond, equity, international, emerging market and real estate funds
Hybrid and specialty funds
Active and passive (index) managed funds
Value, growth and blended styles
Small-, mid- and large-cap equities


Want the option to simplify your fund selection by choosing a prepackaged solution for an asset allocation model that matches your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.
Are interested in automatic portfolio rebalancing to maintain your desired asset allocation and ensure that your investment best meets your overall financial objectives.

Our exclusive fee options save you money.
The Select Variable Annuity offers you two purchase options for maximum flexibility and cost savings:

With the front-load design, you pay the sales charge up front, but your annual expense charges will be lower and you’ll have access to your funds with no withdrawal charges.1
The back-load design lets you put 100 percent of your money to work for you right away, but it is subject to withdrawal charges and higher costs initially.
Northwestern Mutual is one of the few companies that provide a unique conversion feature. When you purchase the back-load plan, we’ll convert you to front-load pricing once we have covered our expenses — sometimes in as little as a few years, depending on the value of your annuity.2 This conversion feature helps you reduce your mortality and expense costs and may enhance the long-term value of your annuity.

Profile of the Mason Street/SM/ Variable Annuity Contract                       

This Profile is a summary of some of the more important points that you should  
consider and know before purchasing the Contract. We describe the Contract more 
fully in the prospectus which accompanies this Profile. Please read the         
prospectus carefully.                                                           

1. The Annuity Contract  The Contract provides a means for you, the owner, to   
invest on a tax-deferred basis in your selection of twenty-four investment      
choices. The Contract also allows investment on a fixed basis in a guaranteed   
account. The Contract is issued by The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance       
Company.                                                                        

The Contract is intended for retirement savings or other long-term investment   
purposes. The Contract provides for a death benefit during the years when funds 
are being accumulated and for a variety of income options following retirement. 

We offer the Contract for use in these situations:                              

..  Traditional Individual Retirement Annuities (IRAs).                         

..  Roth IRAs.                                                                  

..  Other situations that do not qualify for special tax treatment.             

The twenty-four investment choices are listed in Section 4. These choices bear  
varying amounts of investment risk. Those with more risk are designed to        
produce a greater long-term return than those with less risk. But this result   
is not guaranteed. You can also lose your money.                                

The amounts you invest on a fixed basis earn interest at a rate we declare from 
time to time. We guarantee principal and we guarantee the interest rate for     
each amount for at least one year.                                              

You may invest in any or all of the twenty-four investment choices. Subject to  
certain limitations designed to deter short-term and excessive trading, you may 
move money among these choices without charge. Transfers of amounts invested on 
a fixed basis are also subject to restrictions.                                 

During the years when funds are being paid into your Contract, known as the     
accumulation phase, the earnings accumulate on a tax-deferred basis. The        
earnings are taxed as income if you make a withdrawal. The income phase begins  
when you start receiving annuity payments from your Contract. Monthly Annuity   
Payments begin on the date you select.                                          

The amount you accumulate in your Contract, including the results of investment 
performance, will determine the amount of your monthly annuity payments.        

2.  Annuity Payments  If you decide to begin receiving monthly annuity payments 
from your Contract, you may choose one of three payment plans: (1) monthly      
payments for a specified period of five to thirty years, as you select; (2)     
monthly payments for your life (assuming you are the annuitant), and you may    
choose to have payments continue to your beneficiary for the balance of ten or  
twenty years if you die sooner; or (3) monthly payments for your life and for   
the life of another person (usually your spouse) selected by you. After you     
begin receiving monthly annuity payments you cannot change your selection if    
the payments depend on your life or the life of another.                        

These payment plans are available to you on a variable or fixed basis. Variable 
means that the amount accumulated in your Contract will continue to be invested 
in one or more of the twenty-four investment portfolios as you choose. Your     
monthly Annuity Payments will vary up or down to reflect continuing investment  
performance. Or you may choose a fixed annuity payment plan which guarantees    
the amount you will receive each month.                                         

3. Purchase  The Contract can be purchased by an individual through a Financial 
Representative of The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. The minimum   
initial purchase payment is $50,000. Your Northwestern Mutual Financial         
Representative will help you complete a Contract application form.              

4. Investment Choices  You may invest in any or all of twenty-four divisions,   
which correspond with the following Portfolios described in the attached        
prospectuses.

You may also invest all or part of your funds on a fixed basis in the           
Guaranteed Interest Fund (GIF).                                                 

5. Expenses  The Contract has insurance and investment features, and there are  
costs related to them. Each year we deduct a $30 Contract fee. Currently this   
fee is waived if the value of your Contract is $25,000 or more.                 

We also deduct mortality and expense risk charges for the guarantees associated 
with your Contract. These charges are at the annual rate of 0.35%. We may       
increase these charges to a maximum rate of 0.75%. We will not increase the     
charges for at least five years from the date of the prospectus.                

If your Contract includes the enhanced death benefit which we offer at extra    
cost, we will deduct from your Contract value on each Contract anniversary a    
charge based on the amount of the enhanced death benefit in effect and the age  
of the Annuitant when the Contract was issued. The charge is 0.10% of the       
amount of the benefit for issue age 45 or less, 0.20% for issue ages 46-55, and 
0.40% for issue ages 56-65.                                                     

The Portfolios also bear investment charges that range from an annual rate of   
0.20% to 1.28% of the average daily value of the Portfolio, without regard to   
fee waivers or expense limits or reimbursements, depending on the Portfolio you 
select. The following chart is designed to help you understand the charges for  
the Contract. The first three columns show the annual expenses as a percentage  
of assets including the insurance charges, the portfolio charges and the total  
charges. Portfolio charges are based on 2004 expenses for the Portfolios.       
Expenses for the Portfolios reflect fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The 
last two columns show you examples of the expenses, in dollars, you would pay.  
The examples reflect the impact of the asset based charges and the $30 Contract 
fee calculated by dividing the annual Contract fees collected by the average    
assets of the sub-account. The examples assume that you invested $10,000 in a   
Contract which earns 5% annually and that you withdraw your money at the end of 
year one, and at the end of year ten. Both of these examples reflect aggregate  
charges on a cumulative basis to the end of the 1 or 10-year period using the   
current mortality and expense risk charges for years one through five at a rate 
we guarantee and the maximum permitted mortality and expense risk charges for   
years six through ten.                                                          

We do not make any charges for sales expenses. Your Northwestern Mutual         
Financial Representative who offers the Contract represents a broker-dealer or  
a registered investment adviser. You will pay the broker-dealer a fee in lieu   
of sales commissions or you will pay a fee for investment advisory services. In 
either case your Northwestern Mutual Financial Representative will disclose the 
fees to you and receive a portion of the fees you pay.                          

For more detailed information, see "Fee and Expense Tables--Expense Table and   
Annual Fund Operating Expenses" in the attached Contract prospectus.

*  The $30 Contract fee is reflected as 0.00% of the assets based on actual     
  fees collected divided by average assets of the sub-account. We may increase
the insurance charges to a maximum rate of 0.75%. We will not increase the
charges for at least five years from the date of the prospectus.          
** Total Annual Portfolio Charges for each of the Russell Investment Funds,     
 other than the Real Estate Securities Fund, reflect contractual fee waivers
and expense reimbursements in effect through April 30, 2006. These waivers
 and reimbursements also are reflected in the Examples. A fee waiver applied

*  The $30 Contract fee is reflected as 0.00% of the assets based on actual     
  fees collected divided by average assets of the sub-account. We may increase
the mortality and expense risk charges from 0.35% to a maximum rate of    
0.75%. We will not increase the charges for at least five years from the  
  date of the prospectus. The insurance charges include 0.40% for the enhanced
death benefit at the maximum charge for issue ages 56-65. The charge is   
0.10% for issue ages 45 or less, and 0.20% for issue ages 46-55.          
** Total Annual Portfolio Charges for each of the Russell Investment Funds,     
 other than the Real Estate Securities Fund, reflect contractual fee waivers
and expense reimbursements in effect through April 30, 2006. These waivers
 and reimbursements also are reflected in the Examples. A fee waiver applied
to the Money Market Portfolio during 2004. Without this waiver the Total  
Annual Portfolio Charges would have been higher. The waiver ended on      
December 31, 2004. Total Annual Portfolio Charges for the Money Market    
Portfolio have been restated in the table to reflect expenses without the 
fee waiver. See also "Fee and Expense Tables" in the Contract prospectus. 

6. Taxes  A Contract may be issued as an individual retirement annuity (IRA),   
Roth IRA, or nontax-qualified annuity. The Contracts will be subject to certain 
contribution limits and/or other requirements depending on their tax            
classification. For Roth IRAs and nontax-qualified annuities, purchase payments 
are not excluded from income, while for individual retirement annuities (IRAs)  
they are excluded from income. In all cases, earnings on your Contract are not  
taxed as they accrue. If the Contract is purchased as an IRA, the entire amount 
of monthly annuity payments, and any withdrawals, will generally be taxed as    
income. If the Contract is purchased as a Roth IRA, certain distributions after 
5 years will be tax-free. Finally, if the Contract is purchased as a            
nonqualified annuity, amounts withdrawn prior to the income phase will be taxed 
as income to the extent of earnings. During the income phase, monthly Annuity   
Payments will be considered partly a return of your investment which is not     
taxed and partly a distribution of earnings which is taxed as income. In all    
cases, a 10% federal penalty tax may apply if you make taxable withdrawals from 
the Contract before you reach age 59 1/2.

7. Access To Your Money  You may take money out of your Contract at any time    
before monthly Annuity Payments begin. You may have to pay income tax and a tax 
penalty on amounts you take out.                                                

8. Performance  The value of your Contract will vary up or down reflecting the  
performance of the investment portfolios you select. The chart below shows      
total returns for each of the investment portfolios that was in operation, and  
used with NML Variable Annuity Account B, during the years shown. These numbers 
reflect the asset-based charges for mortality and expense risks without the     
enhanced death benefit, the annual Contract fees and investment expenses for    
each portfolio. The amount for the Contract fee for 2004 was 0.00%.             

The performance numbers have been calculated based on the actual performance of 
the Portfolios and the expense charges for the Contracts. Past performance does 
not guarantee future results.

9. Death Benefit  If you die before age 75, and before monthly Annuity Payments 
begin, your beneficiary will receive a death benefit. The amount will be the    
value of your Contract or, if greater, the amount you have paid in.             

We offer an enhanced death benefit at extra cost. We increase the enhanced      
death benefit on each Contract anniversary, up to age 80, if the Contract value 
has increased. The death benefit is payable if you die while the contract is in 
force.                                                                          

The death benefit will be adjusted, of course, for any purchase payments or     
withdrawals you have made. The death benefit may be paid as a lump sum, or your 
beneficiary may select a monthly Annuity Payment plan, or the Contract may be   
continued in force with a contingent Annuitant, subject to the minimum          
distribution requirements discussed under "Federal Income Taxes--Taxation of
Contract Benefits--Minimum Distribution Requirements" in the attached Contract

10. Other Information                                                           

Free Look  If you return the Contract within ten days after you receive it (or  
whatever period is required in your state), we will send your money back. There 
is no charge for our expenses but the amount you receive may be more or less    
than what you paid, based on actual investment experience following the date we 
received your purchase payment.                                                 

Avoid Probate  In most cases, when you die, your beneficiary will receive the   
full death benefit of your Contract without going through probate.              

Automatic Dollar-Cost Averaging  With our Dollar-Cost Averaging Plan, you can   
arrange to have a regular amount of money ($100 minimum) automatically          
transferred from the Money Market Division into the division or divisions you   
have chosen on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis.                       

Dollar cost averaging does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a     
declining market. Carefully consider your willingness to continue payments      
during periods of low prices.                                                   

Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)  Another convenient way to invest using the     
dollar-cost averaging approach is through our EFT plan. These automatic         
withdrawals allow you to add to the divisions(s) within your nontax-qualified   
Contract on a regular monthly basis through payments drawn directly on your     
checking account.                                                               

A program of regular investing cannot assure a profit or protect against loss   
in a declining market.                                                          

Systematic Withdrawal Plan  You can arrange to have regular amounts of money    
sent to you while your Contract is still in the accumulation phase. Our         
Systematic Withdrawal Plan allows you to automatically redeem Accumulation      
Units to generate monthly payments. Of course you may have to pay taxes on      
amounts you receive.                                                            

Automatic Required Minimum Distributions (RMD)  For IRAs, you can arrange for   
annual required minimum distributions to be sent to you automatically once you  
turn age 70 1/2.                                                                

Portfolio Rebalancing  To help you maintain your asset allocation plan over     
time we offer a rebalancing service. This will automatically readjust your      
current investment option allocations, on a periodic basis, back to the         
allocation percentages you have selected.                                       

Portfolio rebalancing may only be used with the investment divisions, not the   
Guaranteed Interest Fund, and may not be used in conjunction with dollar cost   
averaging.                                                                      

A program of regular investing cannot assure a profit or protect against a loss 
in a declining market.                                                          

Interest Sweeps  If you select this service we will automatically sweep or      
transfer interest from the Guaranteed Interest Fund to any combination of       
investment divisions. Interest earnings can be swept monthly, quarterly,        
semi-annually or annually. The Guaranteed Interest Fund ("GIF") is not          
available in the state of MA.

The following Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing   
in the Contract with the cost of investing in other variable annuity contracts. 
These costs include Contract owner transaction expenses, Contract fees,         
separate account annual expenses, and fees and expenses for the Portfolios of   
Northwestern Mutual Series Fund, Inc., Fidelity(R) VIP Mid Cap Portfolio and    
Russell Investment Funds (the "Portfolios and Funds"). Although the minimum     
initial purchase payment for a Contract is $50,000, the Examples assume that    
you invest $10,000 in the Contract for the time periods indicated. The Examples 
also assume that your investment has a 5% return each year and reflect Total    
Net Operating Expenses (including Contractual Waivers, Limitations and          
Reimbursements) for the individual Portfolios and Funds as shown in the         
preceding Annual Fund Operating Expenses Table. Your actual costs may be higher 
or lower. Based on these assumptions, your costs would be as shown below for a  
$10,000 investment or the numbers in the Examples multiplied by five for a      
$50,000 investment.

The purpose of the tables above is to assist a Contract Owner in understanding  
the expenses paid by the Account and the Portfolios and Funds and borne by      
investors in the Contracts. We guarantee the current mortality and expense risk 
charges for five years from the date of this prospectus. Thereafter, we reserve 
the right to increase the mortality and expense risk charges to a maximum       
annual rate of 0.75%. The tables reflect the current mortality and expense risk 
charges at the guaranteed rate for the first five years, and the maximum        
permitted mortality and expense risk charges after five years. The $30 annual   
Contract fee is reflected as 0.00% based on estimated annual contract fees we   
will collect divided by the estimated corresponding average assets of the       
division. The Contract provides for charges for transfers between the divisions 
of the Account and for premium taxes, but we are not currently making such      
charges. See "Transfers Between Divisions and Payment Plans" and "Deductions"   
for additional information about expenses for the Contract. Expense numbers     
also reflect the annual expenses for each Portfolio and Fund, as a percentage   
of average net assets, based on 2004 operations. Expenses for each of the       
Russell Investment Funds, other than the Real Estate Securities Fund, reflect   
fee waivers and expense reimbursements that the Fund's adviser has              
contractually agreed to make through April 30, 2006. Absent the fee waivers and 
expense reimbursements the expenses would be higher. Expenses for the Money     
Market Portfolio have been restated to reflect expenses without a fee waiver    
which terminated on December 31, 2004.                                          

The example should not be considered a representation of past or future         
expenses. Actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown, subject to   
the guarantees of the Contract.

We established the Account on February 14, 1968 by action of our Board of       
Trustees in accordance with the provisions of the Wisconsin insurance law. The  
Account is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a unit     
investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940.                      

The Account has twenty-four divisions. The money you invest to provide variable 
benefits under your Contract is placed in one or more of the divisions as you   
direct, each of which corresponds with one of the Portfolios of the Funds       
described below.                                                                

Under Wisconsin law, the investment operations of the Account are kept separate

the rest of our business. The assets in the Account are reserved for you and    
other Contract Owners, although the assets belong to us and we do not hold the  
assets as a trustee. We and our creditors cannot reach those assets to satisfy  
other obligations until our obligations under your Contract have been           
satisfied. But all of our assets (except those we hold in some other separate   
accounts) are available to satisfy our obligations under your Contract.

Janus Capital Appreciation Portfolio  The investment objective of the Janus     
Capital Appreciation Portfolio is long-term growth of capital. Normally, the    
Portfolio invests in equity securities of companies of any market               
capitalization selected for their growth potential using a "bottom up" approach 
that involves considering companies one at a time. The Portfolio also may       
invest in special situations, meaning investments in securities of issuers that 
management believes will appreciate in value due to developments specific to    
the issuers.

is long-term growth of capital. Normally, the Portfolio invests primarily in    
the equity securities of well-established, medium and large capitalization      
companies that are selected for their above-average earnings growth potential,  
with an emphasis on high quality companies that have strong financial           
characteristics. Companies are identified using a "top down" approach that      
involves considering the economic outlook, identifying growth-oriented          
industries based on that outlook, and evaluating individual companies           
considering factors such as management, product outlook, global exposure,       
industry leadership position and financial characteristics.                     

Large Cap Core Stock Portfolio  The investment objective of the Large Cap Core  
Stock Portfolio is long-term growth of capital and income. Normally, the        
Portfolio invests at least 80% of net assets (plus any borrowings for           
investment purposes) in equity securities of large capitalization companies     
that may include both "growth" and "value" stocks, and may represent high       
quality companies across all market sectors. The Portfolio seeks a dividend     
yield of at least 75% of the dividend yield of the Standard & Poor's 500        
Composite Stock Price Index ("S&P 500(R) Index"). Because of the importance of  
current income and growth of income, dividend paying stocks are favored, but    
the Portfolio also may invest in non-dividend paying stocks.                    

Capital Guardian Domestic Equity Portfolio  The investment objective of the     
Capital Guardian Domestic Equity Portfolio is long-term growth of capital and   
income. Normally, the Portfolio invests at least 80% of net assets (plus any    
borrowings for investment purposes) in the equity securities of U.S. issuers    
and securities whose principal markets are in the U.S., including American      
Depository Receipts (ADRs) and other U.S. registered securities. The Portfolio  
focuses on companies with records of growing earnings selling at attractive     
prices relative to their market and peers. In selecting investments, the        
Portfolio stresses companies with below market price/earnings and price/book    
ratios and above market dividend yields. Generally, the companies in which the  
Portfolio invests will have a market value of $1 billion dollars or more.       

T. Rowe Price Equity Income Portfolio  The investment objective of the T. Rowe  
Price Equity Income Portfolio is long-term growth of capital and income.        
Normally, the Portfolio invests at least 80% of net assets (plus any borrowings 
for investment purposes) in common stocks, with 65% in the stocks of            
well-established companies paying above-average dividends. Typically a value    
approach in selecting investments is employed, meaning that companies are       
selected based on management's belief that they are undervalued based on such   
measures as, for example, company book or asset values, earnings, cash flows    
and business franchises.                                                        

Index 500 Stock Portfolio  The investment objective of the Index 500 Stock      
Portfolio is investment results that approximate the performance of the S&P     
500(R) Index. Normally, the Portfolio invests in stocks included in the S&P     
500(R) Index in proportion to their Index weightings to capture broad market    
performance using a computer program to determine which stocks should be        
purchased or sold.

reasonable investment risk. Normally, the Portfolio invests not more than 75%   
of net assets in either equity securities or debt securities with maturities    
greater than one year, and as much as 100% of net assets in cash or high        
quality short term debt securities. The Portfolio is actively managed to        
capitalize on changing financial markets and economic conditions, following a   
flexible policy for allocating assets according to a benchmark of 45-75%        
equities; 20-50% debt, and 0-20% cash or cash equivalents. Up to 50% of net     
assets may be invested in foreign stocks and up to 20% of net assets may be     
invested in non-investment grade obligations.                                   

Balanced Portfolio  The investment objective of the Balanced Portfolio is to    
realize as high a level of total return as is consistent with prudent           
investment risk. Normally, the Portfolio invests in the stock, bond and money   
market sectors as described for the Index 500 Stock, Select Bond and Money      
Market Portfolios. Management attempts to capitalize on the variation in return 
potential produced by the interaction of changing financial markets and         
economic conditions, while maintaining a balance over time between investment   
opportunities and their associated potential risks by following a flexible      
policy of allocating assets across the three market sectors. Management also    
may adjust the percentage of assets in each market sector in response to        
changing market and economic conditions.                                        

High Yield Bond Portfolio  The investment objective of the High Yield Bond      
Portfolio is to achieve high current income and capital appreciation. Normally, 
the Portfolio invests at least 80% of net assets (plus any borrowings for       
investment purposes) in non-investment grade debt securities. The Portfolio     
invests in both domestic and foreign debt securities that are rated below       
investment grade by at least one major rating agency or, if unrated, determined 
by management to be of comparable quality. Securities are selected primarily    
based upon rigorous industry and credit analysis performed by management to     
identify companies that are believed to be attractively priced, or which have   
stable or improving fundamental financial characteristics, relative to the      
overall high yield market. High yield debt securities are often called "junk    
bonds."

Select Bond Portfolio  The investment objective of the Select Bond Portfolio is 
to realize as high a level of total return as is consistent with prudent        
investment risk; a secondary objective is to seek preservation of shareholders' 
capital. Normally, the Portfolio invests at least 80% of net assets (plus any   
borrowings for investment purposes) in a diversified portfolio of investment    
grade debt securities with maturities exceeding one year. The Portfolio invests 
in both domestic and foreign debt securities that are rated investment grade by 
at least one major rating agency or, if unrated, determined by management to be 
of comparable quality. Up to 20% of net assets may be invested in below         
investment grade securities. The Portfolio is actively managed to take          
advantage of changes in interest rates, credit quality and maturity based on    
management's outlook for the economy, the financial markets and other factors.  
This will increase portfolio turnover and may increase transaction costs and    
the realization of tax gains and losses.                                        

Money Market Portfolio  The investment objective of the Money Market Portfolio  
is maximum current income consistent with liquidity and stability of capital.   
Normally, the Portfolio invests in high quality, short term money market        
instruments that present minimal credit risks as determined by management.      
Management will seek to maximize returns by trading to take advantage of        
changing money market conditions and trends and what they believe are           
disparities in yield relationships between different money market instruments.

The investment objective of the Fidelity(R) VIP Mid Cap Portfolio is to seek    
long term growth of capital. Normally, the Portfolio invests at least 80% of    
its assets in securities of companies with medium market capitalization. These  
are companies with market capitalizations similar to companies in the Russell   
Midcap(R) Index or the Standard & Poor's(R) MidCap 400 Index. The Portfolio     
normally invests primarily in common stocks.                                    

Russell Investment Funds                                                        

The assets of each of the Portfolios comprising the Russell Investment Funds    
are invested by one or more investment management organizations researched and  
recommended by Frank Russell Company ("Russell"), and an affiliate of Russell,  
Frank Russell Investment Management Company ("FRIMCo"). FRIMCo also advises,    
operates and administers the Russell Investment Funds. Russell is our           
majority-owned subsidiary.                                                      

Multi-Style Equity Fund  The investment objective of the Multi-Style Equity     
Fund is to provide long term capital growth. The Multi-Style Equity Fund        
invests primarily in common stocks of medium and large capitalization           
companies, most of which are U.S. based. While market capitalization changes    
over time and there is not one universally accepted definition of the lines     
between large, medium and small capitalization companies, the Portfolio         
generally defines large and medium capitalization stocks as stocks of the       
largest 1,000 companies in the U.S.                                             

Aggressive Equity Fund  The investment objective of the Aggressive Equity Fund  
is to provide long term capital growth. The Aggressive Equity Fund invests      
primarily in common stocks of small and medium capitalization companies, most   
of which are U.S. based. While market capitalization changes over time and      
there is not one universally accepted definition of the lines between large,    
medium and small capitalization companies, the Portfolio generally defines      
medium and small capitalization stocks as stocks of all but the largest 500     
companies in the U.S. The Portfolio's investments may include companies that    
have been publicly traded for less than five years and smaller companies such   
as companies not listed in the Russell 2000(R) Index.                           

Non-U.S. Fund  The investment objective of the Non-U.S. Fund is to provide long 
term capital growth. The Non-U.S. Fund invests primarily in equity securities   
issued by companies domiciled outside the U.S. and in depositary receipts,      
which represent ownership of securities of non-U.S. companies. The Portfolio's  
investments span most of the developed nations of the world (particularly       
Europe and the Far East) to maintain a high degree of diversification among     
countries and currencies, and the Portfolio may invest up to approximately 5%   
of its net assets in emerging markets. This Portfolio may be appropriate for    
investors who want to reduce their investment portfolio's overall volatility by 
combining an investment in this Portfolio with investments in U.S. equity funds.

Core Bond Fund  The investment objective of the Core Bond Fund is to provide    
current income and the preservation of capital. The Core Bond Fund invests      
primarily in fixed-income securities. In particular, the Portfolio holds fixed  
income securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government and, to a lesser  
extent by non-U.S. governments, or by their respective agencies and             
instrumentalities. It also holds mortgage-backed securities, including          
collateralized mortgage obligations. The Portfolio also invests in corporate    
debt securities and dollar-denominated obligations issued in the U.S. by        
non-U.S. banks and corporations ("Yankee bonds"). The Portfolio may invest up   
to 25% of its assets in debt securities that are rated below investment grade.  
These securities are commonly referred to as "junk bonds." The Portfolio may    
invest in derivatives as a substitute for holding physical securities or to     
implement its investment strategies.

Securities Fund is to provide current income and long term capital growth. The

The Contract                                                                    
Purchase Payments Under the Contract                                            

Amount and Frequency  A purchase payment is the money you give us to pay for    
your Contract. You may make purchase payments monthly, quarterly, semiannually, 
annually or on any other frequency acceptable to us.                            

The minimum initial purchase payment is $50,000. The minimum amount for each    
subsequent purchase payment is $25. Minimum amounts for payments by             
preauthorized check depend on payment frequency. We will accept larger purchase 
payments than due, or payments at other times, but total purchase payments      
under any Contract may not exceed $5,000,000 without our consent.               

Purchase payments may not exceed the applicable federal income tax limits. (See 
"Federal Income Taxes.")                                                        

Application of Purchase Payments  We credit your purchase payments, less any    
premium taxes for which we make a deduction, to the Account and allocate them   
to one or more divisions as you direct. We then invest those assets in shares   
of the Portfolio which corresponds to that division.                            

We apply purchase payments to provide "Accumulation Units" in one or more       
divisions. Accumulation Units represent your interest in the Account. The       
number of Accumulation Units you receive for your initial purchase payment is   
determined by dividing the amount of the purchase payment to be allocated to a  
division by the value of an Accumulation Unit in that division, based upon the  
next valuation of the assets of the division we make after we receive your      
purchase payment at our Home Office, provided your application is in good       
order. Your application will be considered to be in "good order" if it is       
complete and accurate and all applicable requirements are satisfied. If your    
application is not in good order, we may take up to five business days to       
resolve the problem. If we are unable to resolve the problem within that time,  
we will notify you in writing of the reasons for the delay and hold your        
purchase payment until the problem is resolved unless you request that we       
return it. If your application is not in good order, the number of Accumulation 
Units you receive for your net purchase payment is determined by dividing the   
amount of the initial purchase payment to be allocated to a division by the     
value of an Accumulation Unit in that division, based upon the next valuation   
of the assets of that division we make after the problem is resolved and your   
application is put in good order. The number of Accumulation Units you receive  
for each net purchase payment after the initial purchase payment is determined  
by dividing the amount of the purchase payment to be allocated to a division by 
the value of an Accumulation Unit in that division, based upon the next         
valuation of the assets of that division we make after we receive your purchase 
payment at our Home Office in good order.                                       

We will also accept your purchase payment if you send it to a lockbox facility  
we have designated. We value assets as of the close of trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange for each day the Exchange is open, and at any other time         
required by the Investment Company Act of 1940.                                 

The number of your Accumulation Units will be increased by additional purchase  
payments or transfers into the Account and decreased by withdrawals or          
transfers out of the Account. The investment experience of the Account does not 
change the number (as distinguished from the value) of your Accumulation Units. 

The value of an Accumulation Unit in each division varies with the investment   
experience of the division (which in turn is determined by the investment       
experience of the corresponding Portfolio). We determine the value by           
multiplying the value on the immediately preceding valuation date by the net    
investment factor for the division. The net investment factor takes into        
account the investment experience of the Portfolio, the deduction for mortality 
and expense risks we have assumed and a deduction for any applicable taxes or   
for any expenses resulting from a substitution of securities. (See "Net
Investment Factor.") Since you bear the investment risk, there is no guarantee  
as to the aggregate value of your Accumulation Units. That value may be less    
than, equal to, or more than the cumulative net purchase payments you have made.

You may direct all or part of a purchase payment to the Guaranteed Interest     
Fund. Amounts you direct to the Guaranteed Interest Fund will be invested on a  
fixed basis. (See "The Guaranteed Interest Fund.")                              

Net Investment Factor                                                           

For each division the net investment factor for any period ending on a          
valuation date is 1.000000 plus the net investment rate for the division for    
that period. Under the Contract the net investment rate is related to the       
assets of the division. However, since all amounts are simultaneously invested  
in shares of the corresponding Portfolio when allocated to the division,        
calculation of the net investment rate for each of the                          

                                  Mason Street/SM/ Variable Annuity Prospectus

                                                                            11

P-->49720th�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
divisions may also be based upon the change in value of a single share of the   
corresponding Portfolio.                                                        

Thus, for example, in the case of the Balanced Division the net investment rate 
is equal to (a) the change in the net asset value of a Balanced Portfolio share 
for the period from the immediately preceding valuation date up to and          
including the current valuation date, plus the per share amount of any          
dividends and other distributions made by the Balanced Portfolio during the     
valuation period, less a deduction for any applicable taxes or for any expenses 
resulting from a substitution of securities, (b) divided by the net asset value 
of a Balanced Portfolio share on the valuation date immediately preceding the   
current valuation date, (c) less an adjustment to provide for the deduction for 
mortality rate and expense risks that we have assumed. (See "Deductions.")      

The Portfolios will distribute investment income and realized capital gains to  
the Account divisions. We will reinvest those distributions in additional       
shares of the same Portfolio. Unrealized capital gains and realized and         
unrealized capital losses will be reflected by changes in the value of the      
shares held by the Account.                                                     

Benefits Provided Under the Contract                                            

The benefits provided under the Contract consist of a withdrawal amount, a      
death benefit and a maturity benefit. Subject to the restrictions noted below,  
we will pay all of these benefits in a lump sum or under the payment plans      
described below.                                                                

Withdrawal Amount  On or prior to the maturity date you are entitled to         
withdraw the Accumulation Units credited to your Contract and receive the value 
thereof. The value, which may be either greater or less than the amount you     
paid is based on the Accumulation Unit value next determined after we receive   
your written request for withdrawal on a form we provide. The forms are         
available from our Home Office and our Financial Representatives. You may       
withdraw a portion of the Accumulation Units on the same basis, except that we  
will not grant a partial withdrawal which would result in a Contract value of   
less than $2000 remaining; we will treat a request for such a partial           
withdrawal as a request to surrender the entire Contract. You may instruct us   
how to allocate your partial withdrawal request among your investments in the   
divisions and Guaranteed Interest Fund. If no direction is received, your       
withdrawal will be deducted proportionately from each of your investments.      

Amounts distributed to you upon withdrawal of all or a portion of Accumulation  
Units may be subject to federal income tax. (See "Federal Income Taxes.") A     
penalty tax will apply to premature payments of Contract benefits. A penalty    
tax of 10% of the amount of the payment which is includible in income will be   
imposed on non-exempt withdrawals. Payments which are exempt from the penalty   
tax include payments upon disability, after age 59 1/2, and certain             
substantially equal periodic payments for life. Additional exceptions for       
certain large medical expenses, reimbursement of health insurance premiums paid 
while the Owner was unemployed, qualified education expenses and first time     
home purchases apply to IRAs and Roth IRAs.                                     

Required minimum distributions must be taken from your IRA, after you attain    
age 70 1/2 or, in certain cases, retire. (See "Minimum Distribution             
Requirements").                                                                 

If annuity payments are being made under Payment Plan 1 (Payments for a Certain 
Period) the payee may surrender the Contract and receive the value of the       
Annuity Units credited to his Contract. Upon death during the certain period of 
the payee under Plan 2 (Life Annuity With or Without Certain Period) or both    
payees under Plan 3 (Joint and Survivor Life Annuity With Certain Period), the  
beneficiary may surrender the Contract and receive the withdrawal value of the  
unpaid payments for the certain period. The withdrawal value is based on the    
Annuity Unit value on the withdrawal date, with the unpaid payments discounted  
at the Assumed Investment Rate. (See "Description of Payment Plans.")           

Death Benefit                                                                   

1. Amount of the Death Benefit.  If the Annuitant dies before the maturity      
date, the death benefit will not be less than the Contract value next           
determined after we receive proof of death at our Home Office. If the Primary   
Annuitant dies before his or her 75th birthday, the death benefit, where        
permitted by state law, will not be less than the amount of purchase payments   
we received, less an adjustment for every withdrawal. For each withdrawal we    
reduce the minimum death benefit by the percentage of the Contract value        
withdrawn. There is no death benefit after annuity payments begin. (See         
"Maturity Benefit" and "Variable Payment Plans.")                               

An enhanced death benefit is available at extra cost. Prior to the first        
Contract anniversary the enhanced death benefit is equal to the total purchase  
payments received less an adjustment for every withdrawal as described above.   
On any Contract anniversary prior to the Primary Annuitant's 80th birthday, the 
enhanced death benefit is the Contract value on that date, but not less than    
what the enhanced death benefit was on the last preceding valuation date. On    
any other valuation date before the Primary Annuitant's 80th birthday, the      
enhanced death benefit will be the amount determined on the most recent         
Contract anniversary, plus purchase payments we receive since that Contract     
anniversary less an adjustment for every withdrawal made since that Contract    
anniversary. For each withdrawal we reduce the enhanced death benefit by the    
percentage of the Contract value withdrawn. On any valuation date on or after   
the Primary Annuitant's 80th birthday the enhanced death benefit will be the    
enhanced death benefit on the Contract anniversary immediately prior to the     
Primary Annuitant's 80th birthday increased by purchase payments we received    
since that Contract anniversary and decreased by an adjustment for every        
withdrawal made since that Contract anniversary. We deduct the extra cost for   
the enhanced death benefit from the Contract value on each Contract anniversary 
while the enhanced death benefit is in effect. (See "Enhanced Death Benefit     
Charge.") The enhanced death benefit is available for issue ages up to 65 and   
must be elected when the Contract is issued. The enhanced death benefit will    
remain in effect until the maturity date or the                                 

12

death of the Primary Annuitant or you ask us to remove it from your Contract.   
You cannot add it to your Contract again after it has been removed.             

2. Distribution of the Death Benefit.                                           

Owner is the Annuitant.  If the Owner is the Annuitant and the Owner dies       
before the maturity date, the beneficiary becomes entitled to the death         
benefit. The beneficiary automatically becomes the new Owner and Annuitant and  
the Contract continues in force unless the beneficiary elects to receive the    
death benefit in a lump sum or under a variable payment plan. The beneficiary   
must take distributions from the Contract pursuant to the applicable minimum    
distribution requirements. (See "Minimum Distribution Requirements")            

Owner is not the Annuitant.  If the Owner is not the Annuitant and the          
Annuitant dies before the maturity date, the Contingent Annuitant automatically 
becomes the new Annuitant and the Contract continues in force. If no Contingent 
Annuitant is named within 60 days after we receive proof of death of the        
Annuitant, we pay the death benefit to the Owner.                               

Adjustment of Contract Value.  On the date when the death benefit becomes       
payable, if the Contract continues in force we will set the Contract value at   
an amount equal to the death benefit. If this results in an addition to the     
Contract Value, we will place the additional amount in the Money Market         
Division and you may transfer it to the divisions you choose. (See "Transfers   
Between Divisions and Payment Plans.")                                          

Maturity Benefit  Purchase payments under the Contract are payable until the    
maturity date specified in the Contract. You may select any date up to age 90   
as the maturity date, subject to applicable tax and state law requirements,     
including the minimum distribution requirements (See "Minimum Distribution      
Requirements"). On the maturity date, if you have not elected any other         
permissible payment plan, we will change the maturity date to the Contract      
anniversary nearest the Annuitant's 90th birthday. On that date, if you have    
not elected any other permissible payment plan, we will pay the value of the    
Contract in monthly payments for life under a variable payment plan with        
payments certain for ten years.                                                 

Variable Payment Plans                                                          

We will pay part or all of the benefits under a Contract under a variable       
payment plan you select. The payment plan starts on the maturity date. (See     
"Maturity Benefit.") Under a variable plan, you bear the entire investment      
risk, since we make no guarantees of investment return. Accordingly, there is   
no guarantee of the amount of the variable payments, and you must expect the    
amount of such payments to change from month to month.                          

For a discussion of tax considerations and limitations regarding the election   
of payment plans, see "Federal Income Taxes."                                   

Description of Payment Plans  The following payment plans are available:        

1. Payments for a Certain Period.  An annuity payable monthly for a specified   
period of up to 30 years. If you select a payment plan which begins during the  
first five Contract years the minimum specified period is 10 years. If you      
select a payment plan which begins during the sixth Contract year or thereafter 
the minimum specified period is 5 years.                                        

2. Life Annuity with or without Certain Period.  An annuity payable monthly     
until the payee's death, or until the expiration of a selected certain period,  
whichever is later. After the payee's death during the certain period, if any,  
we will make payments as they come due to the designated contingent             
beneficiary. You may select a certain period of either 10 or 20 years, or you   
may choose a plan with no certain period.                                       

3. Joint and Survivor Life Annuity with Certain Period.  An annuity payable     
monthly for a certain period of 10 years and thereafter to two persons for      
their joint lives. On the death of either payee, payments continue for the      
remainder of the 10 years certain or the remaining lifetime of the survivor,    
whichever is longer.                                                            

We may limit the election of a payment plan to one that results in an initial   
payment of at least $50. A payment plan will continue even if payments fall to  
less than $50 after the payment plan begins.                                    

From time to time we may establish payment plan rates with greater actuarial    
value than those stated in the Contract and make them available at the time of  
settlement. We may also make available other payment plans, with provisions and 
rates we publish for those plans.                                               

Amount of Annuity Payments  We will determine the amount of the first annuity   
payment on the basis of the particular payment plan you select, the annuity     
payment rate and, for plans involving life contingencies, the Annuitant's       
adjusted age and sex. (A Contract with annuity payment rates that are not based 
on sex is also available.) We will calculate the amount of the first annuity    
payment on a basis that takes into account the length of time over which we     
expect annuity payments to continue. The first payment will be lower for an     
Annuitant who is younger when payments begin, and higher for an Annuitant who   
is older, if the payment plan involves life contingencies. The first payment    
will be lower if the payment plan includes a longer certain period. Variable    
annuity payments after the first will vary from month to month to reflect the   
fluctuating value of the Annuity Units credited to your Contract. Annuity Units 
represent the interest of the Contract in each division of the Account after    
annuity payments begin.                                                         

Assumed Investment Rate  The variable annuity rate tables for the Contract are  
based upon an Assumed Investment Rate of 3 1/2%. Variable annuity rate tables   
based upon an Assumed Investment Rate of 5% are also available where permitted  
by state law.                                                                   

                                  Mason Street/SM/ Variable Annuity Prospectus

                                                                            13

P-->49722nd�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
The Assumed Investment Rate affects both the amount of the first variable       
payment and the amount by which subsequent payments increase or decrease. The   
Assumed Investment Rate does not affect the actuarial value of the future       
payments as of the date when payments begin, though it does affect the actual   
amount which may be received by an individual Annuitant.                        

Over a period of time, if each division achieved a net investment result        
exactly equal to the Assumed Investment Rate applicable to a particular payment 
plan, the amount of annuity payments would be level. However, if the division   
achieved a net investment result greater than the Assumed Investment Rate, the  
amount of annuity payments would increase. Similarly, if the division achieved  
a net investment result smaller than the Assumed Investment Rate, the amount of 
annuity payments would decrease.                                                

A higher Assumed Investment Rate will result in a larger initial payment but    
more slowly rising and more rapidly falling subsequent payments than a lower    
Assumed Investment Rate.                                                        

Additional Information                                                          

Transfers Between Divisions and Payment Plans  Subject to the short term and    
excessive trading limitations described below and any frequent trading policies 
adopted by the Funds that are described in their prospectuses, you may change   
the allocation of purchase payments among the divisions and transfer values     
from one division to another both before and after annuity payments begin. In   
order to take full advantage of these features, you should carefully consider,  
on a continuing basis, which division or apportionment is best suited to your   
long-term investment needs.                                                     

You may at any time change the allocation of purchase payments among the        
divisions by written notice to us. Purchase payments we receive at our Home     
Office on and after the date on which we receive notice will be applied to      
provide Accumulation Units in one or more divisions on the basis of the new     
allocation.                                                                     

Before the effective date of a payment plan you may, upon written request,      
transfer Accumulation Units from one division to another. After the effective   
date of a payment plan the payee may transfer Annuity Units from one division   
to another. We will adjust the number of Accumulation or Annuity Units to be    
credited to reflect the respective value of the Accumulation and Annuity Units  
in each of the divisions. For Accumulation Units the minimum amount which may   
be transferred is the lesser of $100 or the entire value of the Accumulation    
Units in the division from which the transfer is being made. We currently make  
no charge for transfers.                                                        

You may transfer amounts which you have invested on a fixed basis to any        
division of the Account, and you may transfer the value of Accumulation Units   
in any division of the Account to the Guaranteed Interest Fund for investment   
on a fixed basis, subject to the restrictions described in the Contract. (See   
"The Guaranteed Interest Fund.")                                                

After the effective date of a payment plan which does not involve a life        
contingency (i.e., Plan 1) a payee may transfer to either form of life annuity  
at no charge. We will apply the value of the remaining payments to the new plan 
selected. We will determine the amount of the first annuity payment under the   
new plan on the basis of the particular plan selected, the annuity payment rate 
and the Annuitant's adjusted age and sex. Subsequent payments will vary to      
reflect changes in the value of the Annuity Units credited.                     

We permit other transfers between payment plans subject to such limitations as  
we may reasonably determine. Generally, however, we do not permit transfer from 
a payment plan involving a life contingency to a payment plan which does not    
involve the same life contingency. You may make transfers from the Money Market 
Division at any time while a payment plan is in force. The Contract provides    
that transfers between the other divisions and transfers between payment plans  
may be made after the payment plan has been in force for at least 90 days and   
thereafter whenever at least 90 days have elapsed since the date of the last    
transfer. We will make the transfer based upon the next valuation of            
Accumulation Unites in the affected divisions that we make after we receive     
your request for transfer at our Home Office, provided it is in good order.     

Short Term and Excessive Trading  Short term and excessive trading (sometimes   
referred to as "market timing") may present risks to a Portfolio's long-term    
investors because it can, among other things, disrupt Portfolio investment      
strategies, increase Portfolio transaction and administrative costs, require    
higher than normal levels of cash reserves to fund unusually large or           
unexpected redemptions, and adversely affect investment performance. These      
risks may be greater for Portfolios that invest in securities that may be more  
vulnerable to arbitrage trading including foreign securities and thinly traded  
securities, such as small cap stocks and non-investment grade bonds. These      
types of trading activities also may dilute the value of long-term investors'   
interests in a Portfolio if it calculates its net asset value using closing     
prices that are no longer accurate. Accordingly, we discourage market timing    
activities.                                                                     

To deter short term and excessive trading, we have adopted and implemented      
policies and procedures which are designed to control abusive trading           
practices. We seek to apply these policies and procedures uniformly to all      
Contract Owners, except to the extent we are prevented from doing so under      
applicable state or federal law or regulation. Any exceptions must be either    
expressly permitted by our policies and procedures or subject to an approval    
process described in them. Because exceptions are permitted, it is possible     
that investors may be treated differently and, as a result, some may be allowed 
to engage in trading activity that might be viewed as market timing.            

Among the steps we have taken to reduce the frequency and effect of these       
practices are monitoring trading activity and imposing trading restrictions     
including the prohibition of more than twelve transfers among divisions under a 
single Contract                                                                 

14

during a Contract year. Further, an investor who is identified as having made a 
transfer in and out of the same division ("round trip transfer") in an amount   
in excess of $10,000 within fourteen calendar days will be restricted from      
making additional transfers after the third such round trip transfer until      
after the next Contract anniversary date, and sent a letter informing him of    
the restriction. Thereafter, the same investor will be similarly restricted     
after the second such round trip transfer. An investor who is identified as     
having made one or more round trip transfers within thirty calendar days        
aggregating more than one percent (1%) of the total assets of the Portfolio     
underlying a division will be sent a warning letter after the first such round  
trip transfer and will be restricted from making additional transfers until     
after the next Contract anniversary date after the second such round trip       
transfer. Thereafter, the same investor will be similarly restricted after the  
first such round trip transfer. These limitations do not apply to automatic     
asset transfers, scheduled or systematic transactions involving portfolio       
rebalancing, dollar cost averaging, interest sweeps, or to initial allocations  
or changes in allocations.                                                      

These policies and procedures may change from time to time in our sole          
discretion without notice; provided, however, Contract Owners would be given    
advance, written notice if the policies and procedures were revised to          
accommodate market timing. Additionally, the Funds may have their own policies  
and procedures described in their prospectuses that are designed to limit or    
restrict frequent trading.                                                      

If we believe your trading activity is in violation of, or inconsistent with,   
our policies and procedures or otherwise is potentially disruptive to the       
interests of other investors, you may be asked to stop such activities and      
future investments, allocations or transfers by you may be rejected without     
notice. Because we retain discretion to determine what action is appropriate in 
a given situation, investors may be treated differently and some may be allowed 
to engage in activities that might be viewed as market timing.                  

We intend to monitor events and the effectiveness of our policies and           
procedures in order to identify whether instances of potentially abusive        
trading practices are occurring. However, we may not be able to identify all    
instances of abusive trading practices, nor completely eliminate the            
possibility of such activities, and there may be technological limitations on   
our ability to impose restrictions on the trading practices of Contract Owners. 

Owners of the Contract  The Owner of the Contract has the sole right to         
exercise all rights and privileges under the Contract, except as the Contract   
otherwise provides. The Owner is ordinarily the Annuitant, but may be an        
employer or other entity. The Annuitant is the person upon whose life the       
Contract is issued and Contract benefits depend. The Primary Annuitant is the   
person upon whose life the Contract is initially issued. The Contingent         
Annuitant is the person who becomes the Annuitant upon the death of the         
Annuitant. In this prospectus, "you" means the Owner or a prospective purchaser 
of the Contract.                                                                

Deferment of Benefit Payments  We reserve the right to defer determination of   
the withdrawal value of the Contract, or the payment of benefits under a        
variable payment plan, until after the end of any period during which the right 
to redeem shares of a Portfolio is suspended, or payment of the redemption      
value is postponed, pursuant to the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 
1940 because: (a) the New York Stock Exchange is closed, except for routine     
closings on holidays or weekends; (b) the Securities and Exchange Commission    
has determined that trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted; (c)   
the Securities and Exchange Commission permits suspension or postponement and   
so orders; (d) an emergency exists, as defined by the Securities and Exchange   
Commission, so that valuation of the assets of the funds or disposal of         
securities they hold is not reasonably practical; or (e) such suspension or     
postponement is otherwise permitted by the Act.                                 

Free Look  If you return the Contract within ten days after you receive it (or  
whatever period is required in your state), we will send your money back. There 
is no charge for our expenses but the amount you receive may be more or less    
than what you paid, based on actual investment experience following the date we 
received your purchase payment.                                                 

Avoid Probate  In most cases, when you die, your beneficiary will receive the   
full death benefit of your Contract without going through probate.              

Automatic Dollar-Cost Averaging  With our Dollar-Cost Averaging Plan, you can   
arrange to have a regular amount of money ($100 minimum) automatically          
transferred from the Money Market Division into the division or divisions you   
have chosen on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis.                       

Dollar cost averaging does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a     
declining market. Carefully consider your willingness to continue payments      
during periods of low prices.                                                   

Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)  Another convenient way to invest using the     
dollar-cost averaging approach is through our EFT Plan. These automatic         
withdrawals allow you to add to the division(s) within your nontax-qualified    
Contract on a regular monthly basis through payments drawn directly on your     
checking account.                                                               

A program of regular investing cannot assure a profit or protect against loss   
in a declining market.                                                          

Systematic Withdrawal Plan  You can arrange to have regular amounts of money    
sent to you while your Contract is still in the accumulation phase. Our         
Systematic Withdrawal Plan allows you to automatically redeem Accumulation      
Units to generate monthly payments. Of course you may have to pay taxes on      
amounts you receive.                                                            

Automatic Required Minimum Distributions (RMD)  For IRAs, you can arrange for   
annual required minimum distributions to be sent to you automatically once you  
turn age 70 1/2.

Portfolio Rebalancing  To help you maintain your asset allocation plan over     
time we offer a rebalancing service. This will automatically readjust your      
current investment option allocations, on a periodic basis, back to the         
allocation percentages you have selected.                                       

Portfolio rebalancing may only be used with the investment divisions, not the   
Guaranteed Interest Fund, and may not be used in conjunction with dollar cost   
averaging.                                                                      

A program of regular investing cannot assure a profit or protect against loss   
in a declining market.                                                          

Interest Sweeps  If you select this service we will automatically sweep or      
transfer interest from the Guaranteed Interest Fund to any combination of       
investment divisions. Interest earnings can be swept monthly, quarterly,        
semi-annually or annually.                                                      

The GIF is NOT available in the state of MA.                                    

Dividends  The Contract shares in our divisible surplus, to the extent we       
determine annually, except while payments are being made under a variable       
payment plan. Distributions of divisible surplus are commonly referred to as    
"dividends". Any contributions to our divisible surplus would result from more  
favorable expense experience than we have assumed in determining the            
deductions. We do not expect the Contract to make a significant contribution to 
our divisible surplus and we do not expect to pay dividends on the Contract.    

Voting Rights  As long as the Account continues to be registered as a unit      
investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and Account assets   
are invested in shares of a given Portfolio, we will vote the shares of that    
Portfolio held in the Account in accordance with instructions we receive from   
the Owners of Accumulation Units or payees receiving payments under variable    
payment plans. Each Owner or payee will receive periodic reports relating to    
the Portfolios, proxy material and a form with which to give instructions with  
respect to the proportion of shares of the Portfolio held in the Account        
corresponding to the Accumulation Units credited to his Contract, or the number 
of shares of the Portfolio held in the Account representing the actuarial       
liability under the variable annuity Payment Plan, as the case may be. The      
number of shares will increase from year to year as additional purchase         
payments are made by the Contract Owner; after a variable annuity Payment Plan  
is in effect the number of shares will decrease from year to year as the        
remaining actuarial liability declines. We will vote shares for which no        
instructions have been received in the same proportion as the shares for which  
instructions have been received from Contract Owners and payees.                

Substitution and Change  We may take any of the following actions, so long as   
we comply with all of the requirements of the securities and insurance laws     
that may apply. A vote of Contract owners, or of those who have an interest in  
one or more of the divisions of the Account, may be required. Approval by the   
Securities and Exchange Commission or another regulatory authority may be       
required. In the event that we take any of these actions, we may make an        
appropriate endorsement of your Contract and take other actions to carry out    
what we have done.                                                              

1. We may invest the assets of a division in securities of another mutual fund  
  or another issuer, instead of the Portfolio in which you have invested, as a
substitute for the shares you already have or as the securities to be     
purchased in the future.                                                  

2. We may operate the Account or a division as a mutual fund itself, instead of 
  investing its assets in a mutual fund, if our Board of Trustees decides that
this would be in the best interest of our Contract Owners.                

3. We may deregister the Account under the Investment Company Act of 1940 if    
registration is no longer required.                                       

4. We may change the provisions of the Contract to comply with federal or state 
 laws that apply, including changes to comply with federal tax laws in order
to assure that your Contract qualifies for tax benefits relating to       
retirement annuity or variable annuity contracts.                         

Fixed Annuity Payment Plans  We will also pay Contract benefits under fixed     
annuity payment plans which are not described in this prospectus. If you select 
a fixed annuity, we will cancel the Accumulation Units credited to your         
Contract, we will transfer the withdrawal value of the Contract to our general  
account, and you will no longer have any interest in the Account.               

Performance Data  We may publish advertisements containing performance data for 
the divisions of the Account from time to time. This performance data may       
include both standardized and non-standardized total return figures, although   
standardized figures will always accompany non-standardized figures.            

Standardized performance data will consist of quarterly return quotations,      
which will always include quotations for recent periods of one, five and ten    
years or, if less, the entire life of a division. These quotations will be the  
average annual rates of return based on the minimum $50,000 initial purchase    
payment. The standardized performance data will reflect all applicable charges. 

Non-standardized performance data may also not reflect the annual Contract fee  
of $30, since the impact of the fee varies by Contract size. The                
non-standardized data may also be for other time periods.                       

We will base all of the performance data on actual historical investment        
results for the Portfolios, including all expenses they bear. The data are not  
intended to indicate future performance. We may construct some of the data      
hypothetically to reflect expense factors for the Contracts we currently offer. 

We have included additional information about the performance data in the       
Statement of Additional Information.                                            

Legal Proceedings  We are engaged in litigation of various kinds which, in our  
judgment, is not of material importance in                                      

16

relation to our total assets. There are no pending legal proceedings to which   
the Account is a party.                                                         

Financial Statements  Financial statements of the Account are incorporated by

Annual Report to Contract Owners. The financial statements of Northwestern      
Mutual appear in the Statement of Additional Information. To receive a copy of

The Guaranteed Interest Fund                                                    
You may direct all or part of your purchase payments to the Guaranteed Interest 
Fund for investment on a fixed basis. You may transfer amounts previously       
invested in the Account divisions to the Guaranteed Interest Fund, prior to the 
maturity date, and you may transfer amounts in the Guaranteed Interest Fund to  
the Account divisions. In each case, these transfers are subject to the         
restrictions described in the Contract.                                         

Amounts you invest in the Guaranteed Interest Fund become part of our general   
assets. In reliance on certain exemptive and exclusionary provisions, we have   
not registered interests in the Guaranteed Interest Fund under the Securities   
Act of 1933 and we have not registered the Guaranteed Interest Fund as an       
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Accordingly,       
neither the Guaranteed Interest Fund nor any interests therein are generally    
subject to these Acts. We have been advised that the staff of the Securities    
and Exchange Commission has not reviewed the disclosure in this prospectus      
relating to the Guaranteed Interest Fund. This disclosure, however, may be      
subject to certain generally applicable provisions of the federal securities    
laws relating to the accuracy and completeness of statements made in            
prospectuses.                                                                   

Amounts you invest in the Guaranteed Interest Fund earn interest at rates we    
declare from time to time. We will guarantee the interest rate for each amount  
for at least one year. The interest rate will not be less than an annual        
effective rate of at least 1.0%. Some states may require an interest rate       
higher than 1.0%. At the expiration of the period for which we guarantee the    
interest rate, we will declare a new interest rate. We credit interest and      
compound it daily. We determine the effective date for a transaction involving  
the Guaranteed Interest Fund in the same manner as the effective date for a     
transaction involving a division of the Account.                                

Investments in the Guaranteed Interest Fund are subject to a maximum limit of   
$100,000 without our prior consent. In states where the annual effective        
interest rate may not be less than 3% in all years, the maximum limit without   
our consent is $50,000. To the extent that a purchase payment or transfer from  
a division of the Account causes the Contract's interest in the Guaranteed      
Interest Fund to exceed this maximum limit, we will place the amount of the     
excess in the Money Market division and it will remain there until you instruct 
us otherwise.                                                                   

Transfers from the Guaranteed Interest Fund to the Account divisions are        
subject to limits. After a transfer from the Guaranteed Interest Fund, we will  
allow no further transfers from the Guaranteed Interest Fund for a period of    
365 days; in addition, we will allow no further transfers back into the         
Guaranteed Interest Fund for a period of 90 days. The maximum amount that you   
may transfer from the Guaranteed Interest Fund in one transfer is the greater   
of (1) 25% of the amount that you had invested in the Guaranteed Interest Fund  
as of the last Contract anniversary preceding the transfer and (2) the amount   
of your most recent transfer from the Guaranteed Interest Fund. But in no event 
will this maximum transfer amount be less than $1,000 or more than $50,000.     
(The $50,000 limit does not apply in New York.)                                 

The deduction for mortality rate and expense risks, as described below, is not  
assessed against amounts in the Guaranteed Interest Fund, and amounts in the    
Guaranteed Interest Fund do not bear any expenses of any of the mutual funds.   
Other charges under the Contract apply for amounts in the Guaranteed Interest   
Fund as they are described in this prospectus for amounts you invest on a       
variable basis. (See "Deductions.") For purposes of allocating and deducting    
the annual Contract fee, we consider any investment in the Guaranteed Interest  
Fund as though it were an investment of the same amount in one of the Account   
divisions.

2. Roth IRAs pursuant to the provisions of Section 408A of the Code.            

We also offer the Contract for use in non tax-qualified situations (i.e.,       
contributions are taxable).

Contribution Limitations and General Requirements Applicable to Contract        

The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, enacted on June
7, 2001, made substantial changes to the contribution limits and withdrawal and 
portability restrictions of tax qualified plans. These changes are reflected    
below. Although the Act generally became effective on January 1, 2002, many     
provisions are phased in over a ten-year period. Also all of these changes will 
sunset (be repealed) in 2011, unless extended or made permanent.                

Traditional IRA  If an individual has earned income, the individual and the     
individual's spouse are each permitted to make a maximum contribution of $4,000 
for years 2005 through 2007 and $5,000 in 2008 and the limit is indexed         
thereafter. The contribution limit is reduced by contributions to any Roth IRAs 
of the Owner. A catch up contribution of $500 for years 2003 through 2005 and   
$1,000 thereafter is allowed for owners who are age 50 or older. Contributions  
cannot be made after age 70 1/2. Annual contributions are generally deductible  
unless the Owner or the Owner's spouse is an "active participant" in another    
qualified plan during the taxable year. If the Owner is an "active participant" 
in a plan, the deduction phases out at an adjusted gross income ("AGI") of      
between $34,000--$44,000 (indexed through 2005) for single filers and between   
$54,000--$64,000 (indexed through 2007) for married individuals filing jointly. 
If the Owner is not an "active participant" in a plan but the Owner's spouse    
is, the Owner's deduction phases out at an AGI of between $150,000--$160,000.   

The Owner may also make tax free rollover and direct transfer contributions to  
an IRA from the Owner's other IRAs or contracts purchased under tax qualified   
plans. The surviving spouse can also roll over the deceased Owner's IRA, tax    
deferred annuity or qualified plan to the spouse's own IRA or any other plan in 
which the spouse participates that accepts rollovers.                           

An IRA is nonforfeitable and generally cannot be transferred.                   

Roth IRA  If an individual has earned income, the individual and the            
individual's spouse are each permitted to make a maximum contribution of $4,000 
for years 2005 through 2007, $5,000 for 2008 and is indexed thereafter. The     
contribution limit is reduced by contributions to any traditional IRAs of the   
Owner. A catch up contribution of $500 for years 2003 through 2005 and $1,000   
for each year thereafter is allowed for Owners who are age 50 or older. The     
maximum contribution is phased out at an adjusted gross income ("AGI") of       
between $95,000 and $110,000 for single filers, between $150,000 and $160,000   
for married individuals filing jointly and between $0 and $10,000 for married   
individuals filing separately. Regular contributions to a Roth IRA are not      
deductible.                                                                     

An IRA, SEP or SIMPLE IRA (after two years of participation in a SIMPLE IRA     
plan) may be rolled over or converted to a Roth IRA if the Owner has an AGI of  
$100,000 or less for the year (not including the rollover amount) and is not    
married filing a separate tax return. A rollover to a Roth IRA is fully taxable 
but is not subject to a 10% premature withdrawal penalty.                       

Nontax-qualified Contract  There are no limitations on who can purchase a       
nontax-qualified annuity or the amount that can be contributed to the Contract. 
Contributions to nontax-qualified Contracts are not deductible. For the         
Contract to qualify as a nontax-qualified annuity, the Contract death proceeds  
must be distributed to any nonspouse beneficiary either within five years of    
the Owner's death or as substantially periodic payments over the beneficiary's  
life or life expectancy commencing within one year of the Owner's death. The    
surviving spouse is entitled to continue deferral under the Contract.           

Taxation of Contract Benefits                                                   

For Contracts held by individuals, no tax is payable as a result of any         
increase in the value of a Contract. Except for qualified distributions from    
Roth IRAs, Contract benefits will be taxable as ordinary income when received   
in accordance with Section 72 of the Code.                                      

IRAs  As a general rule, benefits received as annuity payments or upon death or 
withdrawal from these contracts will be taxable as ordinary income when         
received.                                                                       

Where nondeductible contributions are made to individual retirement annuities,  
the Owner may exclude from income that portion of each benefit payment which    
represents a return of the Owner's "investment in the contract" as defined in   
Section 72 until the entire "investment in the contract" is recovered. Benefits 
paid in a form other than an annuity will be taxed as ordinary income when      
received except for that portion of the payment which represents a return of    
the employee's "investment in the contract." After the Owner attains age        
70 1/2, a 50% penalty may be imposed on payments made from individual           
retirement annuities to the extent the payments are less than certain required  
minimum amounts. (See "Minimum Distribution Requirements"). With certain        
limited exceptions benefits from individual retirement annuities Contracts are  
subject to the tax-free roll-over provisions of the Code.                       

A loan transaction, using a Contract purchased under a tax-qualified plan as    
collateral, will generally have adverse tax consequences. For example, such a   
transaction destroys the tax status of the individual retirement annuity and    
results in taxable income equal to the Contract value.                          

Roth IRAs  Qualified distributions from a Roth IRA are not taxable. A qualified 
distribution is a distribution (1) made at least 5 years after the issuance of  
the Owner's first Roth IRA, and (2) made after the Owner has attained age       
59 1/2, made to a beneficiary after the Owner's death, attributable to the      
Owner being disabled, or used to pay acquisition expenses of a qualified first  
time home purchase. A nonqualified distribution is taxable as ordinary income   
only to the extent it exceeds the "investment in the contract" as defined in    
Section 72. Distributions are not required to be made from a Roth IRA before    
the Owner's death.                                                              

18

A withdrawal from a Roth IRA of part or all of an IRA rollover contribution     
within 5 years of the rollover is subject to a 10% premature withdrawal penalty 
(unless an exception applies). Rollover contributions are treated as withdrawn  
after regular contributions for this purpose.                                   

A regular or conversion contribution to a Roth IRA can be recharacterized to an 
IRA in a trustee-to-trustee transfer provided the transfer includes the net     
income or loss allocable to the contribution and is completed by the due date   
for filing the Owner's federal income tax return for the year the contribution  
was made. The recharacterized amount will be treated for tax purposes as        
originally made from the IRA. Recharacterized amounts can be reconverted to a   
Roth IRA once each calendar year. Benefits from a Roth IRA can be rolled over   
or transferred directed only to another Roth IRA.                               

Nonqualified Contracts  Benefits received as annuity payments from              
nontax-qualified Contracts will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent     
they exceed that portion of each payment which represents a return of the       
"investment in the contract" as defined in Section 72 until the entire          
"investment in the contract" is recovered. Benefits received in a lump sum from 
these Contracts will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent they exceed    
the "investment in the contract." A partial withdrawal or collateral assignment 
prior to the Maturity Date will result in the receipt of gross income by the    
Owner to the extent that the amounts withdrawn or assigned do not exceed the    
excess (if any) of the total value of Accumulation Units over total purchase    
payments paid under the Contract less any amounts previously withdrawn or       
assigned. Thus, any investment gains reflected in the Contract values are       
considered to be withdrawn first and are taxable as ordinary income. Investment 
gains will be determined by aggregating all nontax-qualified deferred Contracts 
we issue to the Owner during the same calendar year.                            

One or more nontax-qualified Contracts can be wholly or partially exchanged for 
one or more other annuity contracts under Section 1035 of the Code without      
recognition of gain or loss. Certain nonqualified Contracts not held by         
individuals, such as Contracts purchased by corporate employers in connection   
with deferred compensation plans, will not be taxed as annuity Contracts and    
increases in the value of the Contracts will be taxable in the year earned.     

Premature Withdrawals  A penalty tax will apply to premature payments of        
Contract benefits. A penalty tax of 10% of the amount of the payment which is   
includible in income will be imposed on non-exempt withdrawals under individual 
retirement annuities, Roth IRAs, and nonqualified deferred annuities. Payments  
which are exempt from the penalty tax include payments upon disability, after   
age 59 1/2 and for certain substantially equal periodic payments for life.      
Additional exceptions for certain large medical expenses, reimbursement of      
health insurance premiums paid while the Owner was unemployed, qualified        
education expenses and first time home purchases apply to IRAs and Roth IRAs.   

Minimum Distribution Requirements  All of the Contracts are required to satisfy 
some form of minimum distribution requirement. A 50% excise tax applies for     
each violation of these requirements (except under nonqualified Contracts).     

1. IRAs  As a general rule, the Owner of these Contracts is required to take    
certain distributions during the Owner's life and the beneficiary designated by 
the Owner is required to take the balance of the Contract value within certain  
specified periods following the Owner's death.                                  

The Owner must take the first required distribution by the "required beginning  
date" and subsequent required distributions by December 31 of that year and     
each year thereafter. Payments must be made according to the Uniform Lifetime   
Table provided in IRS regulations, which calculates life expectancy of the      
Owner and an assumed beneficiary who is ten years younger. The required         
beginning date for IRAs is April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar  
year the Owner attains age 70 1/2.                                              

Upon the death of the Owner, the Owner's beneficiary must take distributions    
under one of two main rules: (1) the life expectancy rule, or (2) the five year 
rule.                                                                           

(1) Life Expectancy Rule:  A beneficiary may take distributions based on the    
beneficiary's life or life expectancy. Generally, distributions must commence   
by December 31 of the year following the year of the Owner's death. (See below  
for exception for spouse beneficiary.)                                          

(2) Five Year Rule:  If the Owner dies before the required beginning date, a    
beneficiary may elect to withdraw the entire account balance over five years,   
completing distribution no later than December 31 of the year containing the    
fifth anniversary of the Owner's death.                                         

If the Owner dies on or after the required beginning date, a minimum            
distribution must be made for the year of death, to the extent not already paid 
to the Owner.                                                                   

Spousal Exceptions:  If the designated beneficiary is the Owner's spouse elects 
the life expectancy rule, distributions do not need to begin until the end of   
the year following the year of the Owner's death or, if later, by the end of    
the year the Owner would have attained age 70 1/2. Alternatively, the spouse    
may roll over the Contract into an IRA owned by the spouse or to any other plan 
in which the spouse participates that accepts rollovers. The spouse may then    
defer distributions until the spouse's own required beginning date.             

2. Roth IRAs  The Owner of a Roth IRA is not required to take required minimum  
distributions during the Owner's lifetime. However, after the Owner's death,    
the beneficiary designated by the Owner is required to take distributions       
pursuant to the minimum distribution requirements discussed above.              

3. Nonqualified Contracts  The Owner of a nontax-qualified Contract is not      
required to take required minimum distributions during the Owner's lifetime.    
However, the designated beneficiary is required to take distributions pursuant  
to rules similar to the at death minimum distribution requirements for IRAs,    
except that the first minimum distribution is due within 12 months of the       
Owner's death, instead of by December 31 of the calendar year following the     
year of death.

Taxation of Northwestern Mutual                                                 

We may charge the appropriate Contracts with their shares of any tax liability  
which may result from the maintenance or operation of the divisions of the      
Account. We are currently making no charge. (See "Net Investment Factor" and    
"Deductions.")                                                                  

Other Considerations                                                            

You should understand that the tax rules for annuities and qualified plans are  
complex and cannot be readily summarized. The foregoing discussion does not     
address special rules applicable in many situations, rules governing Contracts  
issued or purchase payments made in past years, current legislative proposals   
or state or other law. We do not intend this discussion as tax advice. Before   
you purchase a Contract, we advise you to consult qualified tax counsel.        
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deductions                                                                      
We will make the following deductions:                                          

Mortality Rate and Expense Risk Charges                                         

Amount of Mortality Rate and Expense Risks Charges.  The net investment factor  
(see "Net Investment Factor") we use in determining the value of Accumulation   
and Annuity Units reflects a deduction on each valuation date for mortality     
rate and expense risks we have assumed. The deduction from Accumulation Units   
and Annuity Units is at a current annual rate of 0.35% of the assets of the     
Account. Our Board of Trustees may increase or decrease the deduction, but in   
no event may the deduction exceed an annual rate of 0.75%. We will not increase 
the deduction for mortality and expense risks for at least five years from the  
date of this prospectus.                                                        

Risks and Expenses.  The risks we assume are (a) the risk that annuity payments 
will continue for longer periods than anticipated because the Annuitants as a   
group live longer than expected, and (b) the risk that the charges we make may  
be insufficient to cover the actual costs we incur in connection with the       
Contracts. We assume these risks for the duration of the Contract. The          
deduction for these risks is the only expense item paid by the Account to date. 
The mutual funds pay expenses which are described in the attached prospectuses  
for the mutual funds.                                                           

The net investment factor also reflects the deduction of any reasonable         
expenses which may result if there were a substitution of other securities for  
shares of the Portfolios as described under "Substitution and Change" and any   
applicable taxes, i.e., any tax liability we have paid or reserved for          
resulting from the maintenance or operation of a division of the Account, other 
than applicable premium taxes which we may deduct directly from considerations. 
We do not presently anticipate that we will make any deduction for federal      
income taxes (see "Taxation of Northwestern Mutual"), nor do we anticipate that 
maintenance or operation of the Account will give rise to any deduction for     
state or local taxes. However, we reserve the right to charge the appropriate   
Contracts with their shares of any tax liability which may result under present 
or future tax laws from the maintenance or operation of the Account or to       
deduct any such tax liability in the computation of the net investment factor   
for such Contracts. Our right to make deductions for expenses resulting from a  
substitution of securities may be restricted by the Investment Company Act of   
1940.                                                                           

Contract Fee  On each Contract anniversary prior to the maturity date we make a 
deduction of $30 for administrative expenses relating to a Deferred Contract    
during the prior year. We make the charge by reducing the number of             
Accumulation Units credited to the Contract. For purposes of allocating and     
deducting the annual Contract fee, we consider any investment in the Guaranteed 
Interest Fund as though it were an investment of the same amount in one of the  
Account divisions. We cannot increase this charge. The charge is intended only  
to reimburse us for our actual administrative expenses. We currently are        
waiving the charge if the Contract value on the Contract anniversary is $25,000 
or more.                                                                        

Enhanced Death Benefit Charge  On each Contract anniversary on which the        
enhanced death benefit is in effect, we deduct from the Contract value a charge 
based on the amount of the enhanced death benefit on the Contract Anniversary   
and the age of the Annuitant when the Contract was issued. The charge is 0.10%  
of the amount of the enhanced death benefit for issue age 45 or less, 0.20% for 
issue age 46-55, and 0.40% for issue age 56-65. This charge is for the risks we 
assume in guaranteeing the enhanced death benefit. We deduct the charge from    
the divisions of the Account and the Guaranteed Interest Fund in proportion to  
the amounts you have invested.                                                  

Premium Taxes  The Contract provides for the deduction of applicable premium    
taxes, if any, from purchase payments or from Contract benefits. Various        
jurisdictions levy premium taxes. Premium taxes presently range from 0% to 3.5% 
of total purchase payments. Many jurisdictions presently exempt from premium    
taxes annuities such as the Contract. As a matter of current practice, we do    
not deduct premium taxes from purchase payments received under the Contract or  
from Contract benefits. However, we reserve the right to deduct premium taxes   
in the future.                                                                  

Expenses for the Portfolios and Funds  The expenses borne by the Portfolios and 
Funds in which the assets of the Account are invested are shown in the          
prospectuses for Northwestern Mutual Series Fund, Inc., the Fidelity(R) VIP Mid 
Cap Portfolio and the Russell Investment Funds which are attached to this       
prospectus.                                                                     

20

Distribution of the Contract                                                    
We sell the Contract through individuals who are licensed insurance agents      
appointed by Northwestern Mutual and are registered representatives of          
Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC ("NMIS") our wholly-owned company, 
which was organized under Wisconsin law in 1998 and is located at 611 East      
Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202. NMIS registered as a              
broker-dealer with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a member of the   
National Association of Securities Dealers, is the distributor of the           
Contracts. Where state law requires, its registered representatives will also   
be licensed securities salespersons.                                            

NMIS will not pay commissions on sales of the Contracts, but will offer the     
Contracts to purchasers who pay quarterly fees to the broker/dealer based on    
the value of the assets in their accounts with the broker/dealer, including the 
Contracts. NMIS will pay a portion of the fees to its registered                
representatives who sell the Contracts and provide other services to the owners 
of the Accounts. The Contract is also offered by Northwestern Mutual agents who 
are advisory representatives of registered investment advisers. The investment  
advisers charge fees for investment advisory services and pay a portion of      
those fees to the advising representatives. We may also offer the Contracts     
through other distribution arrangements.

 DETERMINATION OF ANNUITY PAYMENTS

The following discussion of the method for determining the amount of  
monthly annuity payments under a variable payment plan is intended to be read in
conjunction with these sections of the prospectus for the Contracts: "Variable
Payment Plans," including "Description of Payment Plans," "Amount of Annuity    
Payments," and "Assumed Investment Rate"; "Dividends"; "Net Investment Factor"; 
and "Deductions."                                                               

    Amount of Annuity Payments The amount of the first annuity payment under a
variable Payment Plan will be determined on the basis of the particular Payment 
Plan selected, the annuity payment rate and, for plans involving life           
contingencies, the Annuitant's adjusted age and sex. The amount of the first    
payment is the sum of the payments from each Division of the Account determined 
by applying the appropriate annuity payment rate to the product of the number of
Accumulation Units in the Division on the effective date of the Payment Plan and
the Accumulation Unit value for the Division on that date. Annuity rates        
currently in use are based on the 1983 a Table with Projection Scale G and age  
adjustment.                                                                     

     Variable annuity payments after the first will vary from month to month and
will depend upon the number and value of Annuity Units credited to the          
Annuitant. After the effective date of a Payment Plan a Contract will not share 
in the divisible surplus of Northwestern Mutual.                                

    The number of Annuity Units in each Division is determined by dividing the
amount of the first annuity payment from the Division by the value of an Annuity
Unit on the effective date of the Payment Plan. The number of Annuity Units thus
credited to the Annuitant in each Division remains constant throughout the      
annuity period. However, the value of Annuity Units in each Division will       
fluctuate with the investment experience of the Division.                       

   The amount of each variable annuity payment after the first is the sum of
payments from each Division determined by multiplying this fixed number of      
Annuity Units each month by the value of an Annuity Unit for the Division on (a)
the fifth valuation date prior to the payment due date if the payment due date  
is a valuation date, or (b) the sixth valuation date prior to the payment due   
date if the payment due date is not a valuation date. To illustrate, if a       
payment due date falls on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, the amount of the       
payment will normally be based upon the Annuity Unit value calculated on the    
preceding Friday. The preceding Friday would be the fifth valuation date prior  
to the Friday due date, and the sixth valuation date prior to the Saturday or   
Sunday due dates.                                                               

Annuity Unit Value The value of an Annuity Unit for each Division is  
established at $1.00 as of the date operations begin for that Division. The     
value of an Annuity Unit on any later date varies to reflect the investment     
experience of the Division, the Assumed Investment Rate on which the annuity    
rate tables are based, and the deduction for mortality rate and expense risks   
assumed by Northwestern Mutual.                                                 

The Annuity Unit value for each Division on any valuation date is     
determined by multiplying the Annuity Unit value on the immediately preceding   
valuation date by two factors: (a) the net investment factor for the current    
period for the Division; and (b) an adjustment factor to neutralize the Assumed 
Investment Rate used in calculating the annuity rate tables.

Illustrations of Variable Annuity Payments To illustrate the manner in
which variable annuity payments are determined consider this example. Item (4)  
in the example shows the applicable monthly payment rate for a male, adjusted   
age 65, who has elected a life annuity Payment Plan with a certain period of 10 
years with an Assumed Investment Rate of 3-1/2% (Plan 2, as described in the    
prospectus). The example is for a Contract with sex-distinct rates.             

(1)  Assumed number of Accumulation Units in                          
          Balanced Division on maturity date........................      25,000

(2)  Assumed Value of an Accumulation Unit in                         
          Balanced Division at maturity.............................   $2.000000

     (3)  Cash Value of Contract at maturity, (1) X (2).............   $  50,000

(4)  Assumed applicable monthly payment rate per                      
          $1,000 from annuity rate table............................   $    5.35

(5)  Amount of first payment from Balanced Division,                  
          (3) X (4) divided by $1,000...............................   $  267.50

(6)  Assumed Value of Annuity Unit in                                 
          Balanced Division at maturity.............................   $1.500000

(7)  Number of Annuity Units credited in                              
          Balanced Division, (5) divided by (6).....................      178.33

The $50,000 value at maturity provides a first payment from the Balanced        
Division of $267.50, and payments thereafter of the varying dollar value of     
178.33 Annuity Units. The amount of subsequent payments from the Balanced       
Division is determined by multiplying 178.33 units by the value of an Annuity   
Unit in the Balanced Division on the applicable valuation date. For example, if 
that unit value is $1.501000, the monthly payment from the Division will be     
178.33 multiplied by $1.501000, or $267.68.                                     

   However, the value of the Annuity Unit depends entirely on the investment
performance of the Division. Thus in the example above, if the net investment   
rate for the following month was less than the Assumed Investment Rate of       
3-1/2%, the Annuity Unit would decline in value. If the Annuity Unit value      
declined to $1.499000 the succeeding monthly payment would then be 178.33 X     
$1.499000, or $267.32.                                                          

  For the sake of simplicity the foregoing example assumes that all of the
Annuity Units are in the Balanced Division. If there are Annuity Units in two or
more Divisions, the annuity payment from each Division is calculated separately,
in the manner illustrated, and the total monthly payment is the sum of the      
payments from the Divisions.                                                    

VALUATION OF ASSETS OF THE ACCOUNT

    The value of Portfolio or Fund shares held in each Division of the Account
at the time of each valuation is the redemption value of such shares at such    
time. If the right to redeem shares of a Portfolio or Fund has been suspended,  
or payment of redemption value has been postponed, for the sole purpose of      
computing annuity payments the shares held in the Account (and Annuity Units)   
may be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board of Trustees
of Northwestern Mutual.

TRANSFERABILITY RESTRICTIONS

Ownership of a Contract purchased as an individual retirement annuity 
pursuant to Section 408(b) of the Code cannot be transferred except in limited  
circumstances involving divorce.                                                

PERFORMANCE DATA

Standardized performance data in advertisements will show the average 
annual total return for each Division of the Account, according to the following
formula prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission:                   

P(1 + T)/n/ = ERV                     

Where:                                                              
P   = a hypothetical initial payment of $1000                                   
T   = average annual total return                                               
n   = number of years                                                           
ERV = ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $1000                           
payment made at the beginning of the 1, 5 or 10                     
year periods at the end of the 1, 5, or 10 year                     
periods (or fractional portion thereof)                             

Average annual total return is the annual compounded rate of return that would  
have produced the ending surrender value under a Contract if the owner had      
invested in a specified Division over the stated period and investment          
performance had remained constant throughout the period. The calculation assumes
a single $1,000 purchase payment made at the beginning of the period and        
surrender of the Contract at the end of the period. It reflects a deduction for 
all Account, Fund and Contract level charges. The $30 annual Contract fee is    
reflected as 0.00% of the assets based on actual fees collected divided by      
average assets of the sub-account. The data will assume a minimum initial       
purchase payment of $50,000 and the amounts will be divided by 50 to conform the
presentation to the $1,000 purchase payment assumption required by the          
prescribed formula.                                                             

The following table shows the standardized average total return data for each   
Division of the Account for the period ended December 31, 2004.                 

                                                                [Download Table]

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company                                  
Notes to Consolidated Statutory Financial Statements                            
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002                                               
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   Basis of Presentation and Changes in Accounting Principles                 

  The accompanying consolidated statutory financial statements include the
accounts of The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and its    
wholly-owned subsidiary, Northwestern Long Term Care Insurance Company
    (together, "the Company"). All intercompany balances and transactions have
  been eliminated. The Company offers life, annuity, disability income and
long-term care insurance products to the personal, business and estate
markets.                                                              

The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Office of the     
  Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin ("statutory basis of
accounting"). See Notes 2 and 11. Financial statements prepared on the
    statutory basis of accounting differ from financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"),    
     primarily because on a GAAP basis: (1) certain policy acquisition costs are
deferred and amortized, (2) investment valuations and policy benefit  
reserves are established using different methods and assumptions, (3) 
  deposit-type contracts, for which premiums, benefits and reserve changes
 are not included in revenue or benefits as reported in the statement of
operations, are defined differently, (4) majority-owned, non-insurance
   subsidiaries are consolidated, (5) changes in deferred taxes are reported
 as a component of net income and (6) no deferral of realized investment
   gains and losses is permitted. The effects on the financial statements of
    the Company attributable to the differences between the statutory basis of
accounting and GAAP are material.                                     

2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies                                 

  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with the statutory
  basis of accounting requires management to make estimates or assumptions
   that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the periods then ended. Actual future results could differ from
these estimates and assumptions.                                      

Investments                                                           

    See Note 3 regarding the reported statement value and estimated fair value
of the Company's investments in bonds, common and preferred stocks,   
mortgage loans and real estate.                                       

Policy Loans                                                          

    Policy loans primarily represent amounts borrowed from the Company by life
    insurance policyowners, secured by the cash value of the related policies,
   and are reported in the financial statements at unpaid principal balance.

Other Investments                                                     

   Other investments consist primarily of partnership investments (including
real estate, venture capital and leveraged buyout fund limited        
partnerships), real estate joint ventures, leveraged leases and       
  unconsolidated non-insurance subsidiaries organized as limited liability
companies. These investments are valued based on the equity method of 
accounting. Other investments also include derivative financial       
instruments. See Note 4 regarding the Company's use of derivatives and
their presentation in the financial statements.                       

     Other investments include $104 million and $103 million of interests in oil
 and natural gas production at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     These oil and gas interests are accounted for using the full cost method, a
method permitted by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance of the
   State of Wisconsin. The NAIC "Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual"
does not provide accounting guidance for oil and gas interests.

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company                                  
Notes to Consolidated Statutory Financial Statements                            
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002                                               
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Temporary Investments                                                 

    Temporary investments represent securities that had maturities of one year
    or less at purchase and are reported at amortized cost, which approximates
fair value.                                                           

Net Investment Income                                                 

    Net investment income primarily represents interest and dividends received
     or accrued on bonds, mortgage loans, policy loans and other investments. It
  also includes amortization of any purchase premium or discount using the
interest method, adjusted prospectively for any change in estimated   
    yield-to-maturity. Accrued investment income more than 90 days past due is
nonadmitted and reported as a direct reduction of surplus. Accrued    
    investment income that is ultimately deemed uncollectible is reported as a
     reduction of net investment income in the period that such determination is
 made. Net investment income also includes dividends paid to the Company
from accumulated earnings of joint ventures, partnerships and         
    unconsolidated non-insurance subsidiaries and prepayment fees on bonds and
mortgages. Net investment income is reduced by investment management  
    expenses, real estate depreciation, depletion related to energy assets and
interest costs associated with securities lending.                    

Interest Maintenance Reserve                                          

The Company is required to maintain an interest maintenance reserve   
    ("IMR"). The IMR is used to defer realized gains and losses, net of income
   tax, on fixed income investments and derivatives that are attributable to
  changes in interest rates. Net realized gains and losses deferred to the
    IMR are amortized into investment income over the estimated remaining term
 to maturity of the investment sold or the asset/liability hedged by the
derivative.                                                           

Investment Capital Gains and Losses                                   

Realized capital gains and losses are recognized based upon specific  
 identification of securities sold. Realized capital losses also include
     valuation adjustments for impairment of bonds, stocks, mortgage loans, real
    estate and other investments that have experienced a decline in fair value
     that management considers to be other-than-temporary. Factors considered in
    evaluating whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary include: (1)
     whether the decline is substantial, (2) the Company's ability and intent to
retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an 
 anticipated recovery in value, (3) the duration and extent to which the
 fair value has been less than cost, and (4) the financial condition and
   near-term prospects of the issuer in relation to the anticipated recovery
   period. Realized capital gains and losses as reported in the consolidated
 statement of operations exclude any IMR deferrals. See Note 3 regarding
realized capital gains and losses.                                    

Unrealized capital gains and losses primarily represent changes in the
   reported fair value of common stocks and changes in valuation adjustments
made for bonds in or near default. Changes in the Company's share of  
   undistributed earnings of joint ventures, partnerships and unconsolidated
 non-insurance subsidiaries are also classified as changes in unrealized
capital gains and losses. See Note 3 regarding changes in unrealized  
capital gains and losses.                                             

Asset Valuation Reserve                                               

     The Company is required to maintain an asset valuation reserve ("AVR"). The
 AVR represents a reserve liability for invested asset valuation using a
   formula prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
     ("NAIC"). The AVR is designed to protect surplus against potential declines
  in the value of the Company's investments. Increases or decreases in AVR
are reported as direct adjustments to surplus.                        

Separate Accounts                                                     

  See Note 7 regarding separate account assets and liabilities reported by
the Company.

Premium Revenue                                                       

    Life insurance premiums are recognized as revenue at the beginning of each
policy year. Annuity, disability income and long-term care insurance  
premiums are recognized as revenue when received by the Company.      
   Considerations received on supplementary insurance contracts without life
contingencies are deposit-type transactions and thereby excluded from 
 revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Premium revenue is
reported net of ceded reinsurance, see Note 9.                        

Other Income                                                          

    Other income primarily represents ceded reinsurance expense allowances and
various insurance policy charges.                                     

Benefit Payments to Policyowners and Beneficiaries                    

Benefit payments to policyowners and beneficiaries include death,     
surrender, disability and long-term care benefits, as well as matured 
   endowments and payments on supplementary insurance contracts that include
   life contingencies. Benefit payments on supplementary insurance contracts
without life contingencies are deposit-type transactions and thereby  
     excluded from benefits in the consolidated statement of operations. Benefit
payments are reported net of ceded reinsurance recoveries, see Note 9.

Reserves for Policy Benefits                                          

See Note 5 regarding the methods and assumptions used to establish the
Company's reserves for future insurance policy benefits.              

Commissions and Operating Expenses                                    

 Commissions and other operating costs, including costs of acquiring new
insurance policies, are generally charged to expense as incurred.     

Electronic Data Processing Equipment and Software                     

The cost of electronic data processing ("EDP") equipment and operating
     system software used in the Company's business is generally capitalized and
    depreciated over three years using the straight-line method. Non-operating
    system software is generally capitalized and depreciated over a maximum of
    five years. EDP equipment and operating software assets of $37 million and
    $25 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are classified as
  other assets in the consolidated statement of financial position and are
net of accumulated depreciation of $68 million and $56 million,       
respectively. Non-operating software costs, net of accumulated        
 depreciation, are nonadmitted assets and thereby excluded from reported
 assets and surplus in the consolidated statement of financial position.
  Depreciation expense for EDP equipment and software totaled $56 million,
     $42 million and $27 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.                                                   

Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment                                     

The cost of furniture, fixtures and equipment, including leasehold    
     improvements, is generally capitalized and depreciated over the useful life
of the assets using the straight-line method. Furniture, fixtures and 
  equipment costs, net of accumulated depreciation, are nonadmitted assets
   and thereby excluded from reported assets and surplus in the consolidated
statement of financial position. Depreciation expense for furniture,  
  fixtures and equipment totaled $7 million, $6 million and $6 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.       

Policyowner Dividends                                                 

Almost all life insurance and disability income policies and certain  
 annuity contracts and long-term care policies issued by the Company are
     participating. Annually, the Company's Board of Trustees approves dividends
payable on participating policies during the subsequent fiscal year,

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company                                  
Notes to Consolidated Statutory Financial Statements                            
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002

  which are accrued and charged to operations when approved. Participating
     policyowners generally have the option to direct their dividends to be paid
    in cash, used to reduce future premiums due or used to purchase additional
    insurance. Dividends used by policyowners to purchase additional insurance
   are reported as premiums in the consolidated statement of operations, but
are not included in premiums received or benefit payments in the      
consolidated statement of cash flows.                                 

Nonadmitted Assets                                                    

Certain assets are designated as nonadmitted on the statutory basis of
  accounting. Such assets, principally related to pension funding, amounts
 advanced to or due from the Company's field representatives, furniture,
fixtures, equipment and non-operating software (net of accumulated    
depreciation) are excluded from reported assets and surplus in the    
     consolidated statement of financial position. Changes in nonadmitted assets
are reported as a direct adjustment to surplus.                       

3.   Investments                                                                

Bonds                                                                 

    Investments in bonds are reported in the financial statements at amortized
cost, less any valuation adjustment. The interest method is used to   
   amortize any purchase premium or discount. Use of the interest method for
  loan-backed bonds and structured securities includes estimates of future
   prepayments obtained from independent sources. Prepayment assumptions are
     updated at least annually. During 2004, the retrospective adjustment method
     was used to recognize related changes in the estimated yield-to-maturity of
     such securities. Prior to 2004, the prospective adjustment method was used.
  The cumulative effect of this change in method as of January 1, 2004 was
immaterial.                                                           

Valuation adjustments are made for bonds in or near default, which are
    reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, or for bonds with a
     decline in fair value that management considers to be other-than-temporary.
    See Note 2. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the reported value of bonds was
reduced by $42 million and $277 million, respectively, in valuation   
adjustments.                                                          

Estimated fair value is based upon values published by the Securities 
Valuation Office ("SVO") of the NAIC. In the absence of SVO-published 
values, estimated fair value is based upon quoted market prices, if   
    available. For bonds without quoted market prices, fair value is estimated
    using independent pricing services or internally developed pricing models.

    Statement value and estimated fair value of bonds at December 31, 2004 and
2003 were as follows:

Common and Preferred Stocks                                           

  Common stocks are generally reported in the financial statements at fair
   value, which is based upon quoted market prices, if available. For common
stocks without quoted market prices, fair value is estimated using    
  independent pricing services or internally developed pricing models. The
 equity method is generally used to value investments in common stock of
unconsolidated non-insurance subsidiaries. See note 11 regarding the  
statement value of the Company's investment in Frank Russell Company. 

  Preferred stocks rated "1" (highest quality), "2" (high quality), or "3"
 (medium quality) by the SVO are reported in the financial statements at
amortized cost. All other preferred stock is reported at the lower of 
 amortized cost or fair value. Estimated fair value is based upon quoted
market prices, if available. For preferred stock without quoted market
prices, fair value is estimated using independent pricing services or 
internally developed pricing models.

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company                                  
Notes to Consolidated Statutory Financial Statements                            
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002                                               
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Valuation adjustments are made for preferred stocks rated 4 or less, which
are reported at the lower of cost or fair value, or for common and    
    preferred stocks with a decline in fair value that management considers to
    be other-than-temporary. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the reported value
     of common and preferred stocks was reduced by $74 million and $182 million,
respectively, in valuation adjustments.                               

Mortgage Loans                                                        

     Mortgage loans are reported in the financial statements at unpaid principal
balance, less any valuation allowance or unamortized commitment or    
origination fee. Such fees are generally deferred upon receipt and    
    amortized into investment income using the interest method. Mortgage loans
   are collateralized by properties located throughout the United States and
   Canada. The Company attempts to minimize mortgage loan investment risk by
    diversification of borrowers, geographic locations and types of collateral
properties.                                                           

     The maximum and minimum interest rates for mortgage loans originated during
   2004 were 8.8% and 2.3%, respectively, while these rates during 2003 were
   8.5% and 3.6%, respectively. The aggregate ratio of amounts loaned to the
     value of collateral for mortgage loans originated during 2004 and 2003 were
65% and 66%, respectively, with a maximum of 100% for any single loan 
during each of 2004 and 2003.                                         

    Mortgage loans are considered impaired when, based on current information,
     management considers it probable that the Company will be unable to collect
  all principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the
   loan. If necessary, a valuation adjustment is made to reduce the carrying
value of an impaired loan to the lower of unpaid principal balance or 
estimated net realizable value based on appraisal of the collateral   
  property. If the impairment is considered to be temporary, the valuation
 adjustment is reported as an unrealized loss. Valuation adjustments for
    impairments considered to be other-than-temporary are reported as realized
     losses. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the reported value of mortgage loans
    was reduced by $1 and $13 million, respectively, in valuation adjustments.

Real Estate                                                           

   Real estate investments are reported in the financial statements at cost,
     less any valuation adjustment, encumbrances and accumulated depreciation of
buildings and other improvements using a straight-line method over the
     estimated useful lives of the improvements. An investment in real estate is
    considered impaired when, based on current information, the estimated fair
  value of the property is lower than depreciated cost. The estimated fair
  value is primarily based upon the present value of future cash flow (for
  commercial properties) or the capitalization of stabilized net operating
income (for multi-family residential properties). When the Company    
determines that an investment in real estate is impaired, a valuation 
  adjustment is made to reduce the carrying value to estimated fair value,
     net of encumbrances. Valuation adjustments are reported as a realized loss.
At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the reported value of real estate      
  investments was reduced by $4 million and $0, respectively, in valuation
adjustments.                                                          

   At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the reported value of real estate included
$190 million and $180 million, respectively, of real estate properties
occupied by the Company.                                              

Leveraged Leases                                                      

    Leveraged leases primarily represent investments in commercial aircraft or
real estate property that are leased to third parties and serve as    
    collateral for non-recourse borrowings. Leveraged leases are valued at the
    present value of future minimum lease payments, plus the residual value of
  the leased asset and classified as other investments in the consolidated
statement of financial

  position. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the reported value of leveraged
  leases was $458 million and $513 million, respectively. During 2004, the
   Company reported realized capital losses of $4 million upon renegotiation
 of leveraged leases on certain commercial aircraft and realized capital
     losses of $14 million upon a change in the estimated timing of tax benefits
  for certain real property leases. During 2002, the Company utilized $108
  million in existing valuation allowances to absorb losses on declines in

Securities Lending                                                    

    The Company has entered into securities lending agreements whereby certain
investment securities are loaned to third parties, primarily major    
 brokerage firms. The aggregate statement value of loaned securities was
    $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
  The Company's policy requires a minimum of 102% of the fair value of the
   loaned securities, calculated on a daily basis, as collateral in the form
    of either cash or securities held by the Company or a trustee. At December
31, 2004 and 2003, unrestricted cash collateral held by the Company of $2.6
    billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, is classified as cash and invested
 assets and the offsetting collateral liability of $2.6 billion and $2.5
billion, respectively, is classified as other liabilities in the      
consolidated statement of financial position. At December 31, 2004 and
2003, additional non-cash collateral of $359 million and $482 million 
respectively, was held on the Company's behalf by a trustee and is not
included in the consolidated statement of financial position.

4.   Derivative Financial Instruments                                           

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into derivative  
 transactions, generally to mitigate the risk to assets and surplus from
   fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other
market risks.                                                         

Cash flow and fair value hedges that qualify for hedge accounting are 
reported in a manner consistent with the item being hedged (e.g., at  
    amortized cost or fair value). Cash flow and fair value hedges that do not
qualify for hedge accounting are reported at fair value. Fair value is
 estimated as the amount that the Company would expect to receive or pay
   upon termination of the derivative contract as of the reporting date. The
    reported statement value of derivatives is classified as other investments
in the consolidated statement of financial position.                  

Gains or losses realized upon maturity or termination of derivative   
   positions are generally reported as realized capital gains or losses, net
    of tax. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, gains or losses
   realized due to changes in market interest rates are deferred to the IMR,
net of tax, and amortized into investment income over the estimated   
remaining term to maturity of the item being hedged. Gains or losses  
resulting from reporting open derivative positions at fair value are  
reported as unrealized capital gains or losses.                       

  In addition to cash flow and fair value hedges, the Company entered into
     replication transactions during 2004 and 2003. A replication transaction is
    a derivative transaction entered into in conjunction with other investment
transactions to replicate the investment characteristics of otherwise 
permissible investments.                                              

  The Company does not take positions in derivatives for income generation
purposes.                                                             

The Company implemented Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles  
("SSAP") No. 86, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging    
Activities, which superceded SSAP 31 effective January 1, 2003. Upon  
    implementation, the Company had the option of applying the new guidance to
 all derivatives as of January 1, 2003 or continuing to use the existing
   guidance of SSAP 31 for all derivatives held as of December 31, 2002. The
   Company chose to apply SSAP 86 guidance retroactively to derivatives held
   prior to January 1, 2003. The impact on surplus from the adoption of SSAP
86 was immaterial.                                                    

  The Company held the following derivative positions at December 31, 2004
and 2003:

     The notional or contractual amounts of derivative financial instruments are
used to denominate the transactions and do not represent the amounts  
exchanged between the parties.                                        

  Foreign currency swaps are cash flow hedges used to mitigate exposure to
   variable U.S. dollar cash flows from certain bonds denominated in foreign
    currencies. A foreign currency swap is a contractual agreement to exchange
   the currencies of two different countries at a specified rate of exchange
in the future.                                                        

Interest rate swaps are cash flow hedges used to mitigate exposure to 
  interest rate risk on certain floating and fixed rate bonds. An interest
     rate swap is a contractual agreement to pay a rate of interest based upon a
     reference index in exchange for a fixed rate of interest established at the
origination of the contract.                                          

   Interest rate basis swaps are cash flow hedges used to mitigate the basis
    risk on certain hedges of variable rate preferred stocks. An interest rate
  basis swap is a contractual agreement to pay a rate of return based upon
     one reference index in exchange for receiving a rate of return based upon a
different reference index.                                            

  Commodity swaps are cash flow hedges used to mitigate exposure to market
    fluctuations for the forward sale of crude oil and natural gas production.
Commodity swaps are contractual agreements whereby one party pays a   
     floating commodity price in exchange for a specified fixed commodity price.

   Swaptions are cash flow hedges used to mitigate the asset/liability risks
of a significant and

sustained increase or decrease in interest rates for certain of the   
     Company's insurance products. A swaption is a contractual agreement whereby
    one party holds an option to enter into an interest rate swap with another
party on predefined terms.                                            

Interest rate floors are cash flow hedges used to mitigate the        
   asset/liability risks of a significant and sustained decrease in interest
   rates for certain of the Company's insurance products. Floors entitle the
    Company to receive settlement payments from the counterparties if interest
rates decline below a specified level.                                

    Short equity index futures are fair value hedges used to mitigate exposure
to market fluctuations for the Company's portfolio of common stocks.  
Futures contracts obligate the Company to buy or sell a financial     
instrument at a specified future date for a specified price.          

   Fixed income futures are fair value hedges used to mitigate interest rate
  risk for a portion of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio.
 These futures contracts obligate the Company to buy or sell a financial
 instrument at a specified future date for a specified price. Unrealized
 losses of $2 million and unrealized gains of $8 million were recognized
  during 2004 and 2003, respectively, on contracts that were excluded from
the assessment of hedge effectiveness.                                

Foreign currency forwards are fair value hedges used to mitigate the  
    foreign exchange risk for portfolios of investments denominated in foreign
currencies. Foreign currency forward contracts obligate the Company to
deliver a specified amount of foreign currency at a future date at a  
   specified exchange rate. Unrealized losses of $29 million and $24 million
    were recognized during 2004 and 2003, respectively, on contracts that were
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.                  

    Foreign currency covers are fair value hedges used to mitigate the foreign
   exchange risk on trades of investments denominated in foreign currencies.
     Foreign currency forward contracts obligate the Company to pay or receive a
specified amount of foreign currency at a future date at a specified  
exchange rate.                                                        

     Credit default swaps are fair value hedges used to mitigate the credit risk
    associated with investments in bonds of specific issuers. A credit default
 swap allows the Company to put the bond to a counterparty at par upon a
   "credit event" sustained by the bond issuer. A credit event is defined as
bankruptcy, failure to pay or obligation acceleration.                

   Fixed income replications are used to replicate a bond investment through
the use of credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and cash market  
instruments. These replication transactions, including the derivative 
   components, are reported at amortized cost. During each of 2004 and 2003,
the average fair value of such contracts was less than $1 million. No 
realized gains or losses were recognized during 2004 or 2003 on the   
termination of these contracts.                                       

   Long fixed income futures replications are used to manage the duration of
    the fixed income portfolio and mitigate exposure to interest rate changes.
    These replication transactions are reported at fair value, with changes in
  fair value reflected as a component of unrealized gains and losses until
  such time as the contracts are terminated. During each of 2004 and 2003,
     the average fair value of such contracts was less than $1 million. Realized
     gains of $6 million and $29 million were recognized during 2004 and 2003 on
the termination of these contracts.                                   

    Long equity futures replications are used to gain equity market investment
   exposure. These replication transactions are reported at fair value, with
changes in fair value reflected as a component of unrealized gains and
     losses until such time as the contracts are terminated. During each of 2004
and 2003, the average fair value of such contracts was less than $1   
million.

5.   Reserves for Policy Benefits                                               

Reserves for policy benefits represent the net present value of future
 policy benefits, less future policy premiums, estimated using actuarial
  methods based on mortality and morbidity experience tables and valuation
     interest rates prescribed or permitted by the Office of the Commissioner of
 Insurance of the State of Wisconsin ("OCI"). These actuarial tables and
methods include assumptions regarding future mortality and morbidity. 
 Actual future experience could differ from the assumptions used to make
these reserve estimates.                                              

    General account reserves for policy benefits at December 31, 2004 and 2003
are summarized below:

     Life insurance reserves on substantially all policies issued since 1978 are
 based on the Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method ("CRVM") using the
   1958 or 1980 CSO mortality tables with interest rates ranging from 3 1/2%
 to 5 1/2%. Other life insurance reserves are primarily based on the net
level premium method, using various mortality tables at interest rates
  ranging from 2% to 4 1/2%. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had $870
  billion of total life insurance in-force, including $7.7 billion of life
 insurance in-force for which gross premiums were less than net premiums
   according to the standard valuation methods and assumptions prescribed by
the OCI.                                                              

     Tabular cost has been determined from the basic data for the calculation of
policy reserves. Tabular cost less actual reserves released has been  
     determined from the basic data for the calculation of reserves and reserves
    released. Tabular interest has been determined from the basic data for the
 calculation of policy reserves. Tabular interest on funds not involving
  life contingencies is calculated as the product of the valuation rate of
     interest times the mean of the amount of funds subject to such rate held at
the beginning and end of the year of valuation.                       

   Additional premiums are charged for substandard lives for policies issued
     after January 1, 1956. Net level premium or CRVM mean reserves are based on
multiples of mortality tables or one-half the net flat or other extra 
mortality charge. The Company waives deduction of fractional

     premium beyond the date of death. Cash values are not promised in excess of
the legally computed reserves.                                        

Deferred annuity reserves on contracts issued since 1985 are primarily
    based on the Commissioner's Annuity Reserve Valuation Method with interest
  rates ranging from 3 1/2% to 6 1/4%. Other deferred annuity reserves are
  based on contract value. Immediate annuity reserves are based on present
    value of expected benefit payments with interest rates ranging from 3 1/2%
 to 7 1/2%. Changes in future policy benefits on supplementary contracts
    without life contingencies are classified as deposit-type transactions and
thereby excluded from net additions to policy benefit reserves in the 
consolidated statement of operations.                                 

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the withdrawal characteristics of the  
    Company's general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities were as
follows:

   Unpaid claims and claim reserves for disability income policies are based
     on the present value of expected benefit payments, primarily using the 1985
     Commissioner's Individual Disability Table A ("CIDA"), modified for Company
experience in the first four years of disability, with interest rates 
   ranging from 3% to 5 1/2%. Unpaid claims and claim reserves for long-term
   care policies are based on the present value of expected benefit payments
     using industry-based long-term care experience with a 4 1/2% interest rate.

Reserves for unpaid claims, losses and loss adjustment expenses on    
   disability income and long-term care insurance were $3.2 billion and $3.1
billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The table below  
 provides a summary of the changes in these reserves for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003.

The changes in reserves for incurred claims related to prior years are
     generally the result of ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends.

   Active life reserves for disability income policies issued since 1987 are
     primarily based on the two-year preliminary term method using the 1985 CIDA
   for morbidity with a 4% interest rate and. Active life reserves for prior
     disability income policies are based on the net level premium method, using
    the 1964 Commissioner's Disability Table for morbidity with interest rates
ranging from 3% to 4%.                                                

  Active life reserves for long-term care policies consist of mid-terminal
reserves and unearned premium. Mid-terminal reserves are based on the 
one-year preliminary term method, industry-based morbidity experience,
 total terminations based on the 1983 Individual Annuity Mortality table
    without lapses or the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality table with lapses, with
an interest rate of either 4% or 4.5%. For reserves using lapse       
assumptions, a separate calculation is performed using interest rates 
     ranging from 5.2% to 6.0% and excluding lapses. Reserves resulting from the
     separate calculation are compared in the aggregate to the statutory minimum
and the greater of the two is held.                                   

6.   Premium and Annuity Considerations Deferred and Uncollected                

    Gross deferred and uncollected insurance premiums represent life insurance
   premiums due to be received from policyowners through the next respective
   policy anniversary dates. Net deferred and uncollected premiums represent
only the portion of gross premiums related to mortality charges and   
interest.

Separate account assets and related policy liabilities represent the  
segregation of balances attributable to variable life insurance and   
 variable annuity products. Policyowners bear the investment performance
risk associated with variable products. Separate account assets are   
  invested at the direction of the policyowner in a variety of mutual fund
    options. Variable annuity policyowners also have the option to invest in a
   fixed interest rate annuity issued by the general account of the Company.
Separate account assets are reported at fair value based primarily on 
quoted market prices.                                                 

Following is a summary of separate account liabilities by withdrawal  
characteristic at December 31, 2004 and 2003:

    While separate account liability values are not guaranteed by the Company,
  the variable annuity and variable life insurance products represented in
the separate accounts do include guaranteed minimum death benefits    
     underwritten by the Company. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, general account
reserves for policy benefits included $8 million and $11 million,     
respectively, that were attributable to these benefits.               

    Premiums and other considerations received from variable life and variable
     annuity policyowners during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were
    $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. These amounts are reported as
premiums in the consolidated statement of operations. The subsequent  
transfer of these receipts to the separate accounts is reported in    
     transfers to separate accounts in the consolidated statement of operations,
  net of amounts received from the separate accounts to provide for policy
benefit payments to variable product policyowners.

8.   Employee and Representative Benefit Plans                                  

   The Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans for
   all eligible employees and field representatives ("Plans"). These include
     tax-qualified plans, as well as nonqualified plans that provide benefits to
 certain participants in excess of ERISA limits for qualified plans. The
 Company's policy is to fully fund the obligations of qualified plans in
     accordance with ERISA requirements. The Company contributed $38 million and
     $28 million to the qualified employee retirement plan during 2004 and 2003,
respectively, and expects to contribute $37 million in 2005.          

In addition to defined pension benefits, the Company provides certain 
health care and life insurance benefits ("postretirement benefits") to
retired employees, field representatives and eligible dependents.     
    Substantially all employees and field representatives will become eligible
for these benefits if they reach retirement age while working for the 
Company.                                                              

   Aggregate assets and projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit
  plans and for postretirement benefits at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and
changes in assets and obligations for the years then ended, were as   
follows:

Plan assets are invested primarily in common stocks and corporate debt
securities through a separate account of the Company. The investment  
objective of the Plan is to maximize long-term total rate of return,  
   consistent with prudent investment risk management and in accordance with
ERISA requirements. Investments are made for the sole interest of the 
  beneficiaries of the Plan. While significant exposure to publicly traded
    equity securities is warranted by the long-term nature of expected benefit
   payments, diversification across asset classes is maintained to provide a
risk/reward profile consistent with the objectives of the Plan        
   beneficiaries. Diversified equity investments are subject to an aggregate
   maximum exposure of 75%, with holdings in any one corporate issuer not to
   exceed 3% of total assets. Asset mix is re-balanced regularly to maintain
  holdings within target asset allocation ranges. The measurement date for
plan assets is December 31, with the fair value of plan assets based  
primarily on quoted market values.                                    

    Plan assets by asset class at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 were

The projected benefit obligation ("PBO") represents the actuarial net 
     present value of future benefit obligations. For defined benefit plans, PBO
includes assumptions as to future salary increases. This measure is   
consistent with the ongoing concern assumption and is mandated for    
   measuring pension obligations. The accumulated benefit obligation ("ABO")
is similar to the calculation of the PBO, but is based only on current
    salaries, with no assumption of future salary increases. The aggregate ABO
 for the defined benefit plans of the Company were $1.6 billion and $1.4
billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.                  

Projected benefit obligations included $37 million and $28 million for
non-vested employees at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.     

     The following table summarizes assumptions used in estimating the projected
benefit obligations at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:

The long term rates of return on plan assets are estimated assuming an
    allocation of plan assets among asset classes consistent with December 31,
2004. Returns are estimated by asset class based on the current risk free
     interest rate environment plus a risk premium. The risk premium is based on
    historical returns and other factors such as expected reinvestment returns
and asset manager performance.

  The projected benefit obligation for postretirement benefits at December
31, 2004 and 2003 also assumed an annual increase in future retiree medical
costs of 10%, grading down to 5% over 5 years and remaining level     
   thereafter. A further increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend of 1%
in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit    
obligation as of December 31, 2004 by $22 million and net periodic    
     postretirement benefit expense during 2004 by $4 million. A decrease in the
assumed healthcare cost trend of 1% in each year would reduce the     
   accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2004 and
net periodic postretirement benefit expense during 2004 by the same   
amounts.                                                              

On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and  
 Modernization Act of 2003 ("the Act") was enacted. The Act introduces a
  prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D beginning in 2006. Under
the Act, employers who sponsor postretirement plans that provide      
prescription drug benefits that are actuarially equivalent to Medicare
qualify to receive subsidy payments from the federal government. The  
Company has not determined whether the benefits under its existing    
     postretirement plan are actuarially equivalent to the new Medicare benefit.
As such, neither the projected benefit obligation nor the net periodic
 benefit cost for postretirement benefits reflects any amount associated
with this Medicare subsidy.                                           

    Following is an aggregate reconciliation of the funded status of the plans
 to the related financial statement liability reported by the Company at

     Unrecognized net experience gains or losses represent cumulative amounts by
    which plan experience for return on plan assets or service costs have been
   more or less favorable than assumed. These differences accumulate without
     recognition in the Company's financial statements unless they exceed 10% of
    plan assets or projected benefit obligation, whichever is greater. If they
    exceed this limit, they are amortized into net periodic benefit costs over
the remaining average years of service until retirement of the plan   
participants, which is currently fourteen years for employee plans and
twelve years for field representative plans.                          

Unrecognized initial net assets represent the amount by which the fair
   value of plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation for funded
  pension plans upon the adoption of the statutory basis of accounting for
  pensions as of January 1, 2001. The Company has elected not to record an
  initial asset for this excess, electing instead to amortize this initial
     asset as a credit to net periodic benefit cost in a systematic manner until
exhausted.                                                            

 Any net pension assets for funded plans are nonadmitted and are thereby
    excluded from reported assets and surplus in the consolidated statement of
financial position.

     The Company also sponsors a contributory 401(k) plan for eligible employees
    and a noncontributory defined contribution plan for field representatives.
   For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 the Company expensed
total contributions to these plans of $24 million, $23 million and $22
million, respectively.

    The Company limits its exposure to life insurance death benefits by ceding
    insurance coverage to various reinsurers. The Company retains a maximum of
     $30 million of coverage per individual life and a maximum of $45 million of
   coverage per joint life. The Company also cedes a portion of its exposure
to group disability benefits on a coinsurance basis and has an excess 
reinsurance contract for certain individual disability income policies
issued prior to 1999 with retention limits varying based upon coverage
 type. The Company also participates in catastrophic risk sharing pools.

    Amounts shown in the consolidated financial statements are reported net of
 the impact of reinsurance. Reserves for policy benefits at December 31,
2004 and 2003 were reported net of ceded reserves of $1.2 billion and $1.0
billion, respectively.

In addition, the Company reported $207 million, $184 million and $172 
     million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
  in allowances from reinsurers for reimbursement of commissions and other
     expenses on ceded business. These amounts are classified as other income in
the consolidated statement of operations.                             

  Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to
     policyowners. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result
 in losses to the Company. The Company attempts to minimize this risk by
 diversifying its reinsurance coverage among a number of reinsurers that
meet its standards for strong financial condition. There were no      
     reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2004 and 2003 that were considered
by management to be uncollectible.

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Company accounts for deferred tax assets and liabilities, which reflect
    the financial statement impact of cumulative temporary differences between
the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. The  
   significant components of the net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2004
and 2003 were as follows:

   The statutory basis of accounting limits the amount of gross deferred tax
  assets that can be included in Company surplus. This limit is based on a
  formula that takes into consideration available loss carryback capacity,
expected timing of reversal for existing temporary differences, gross 
    deferred tax liabilities and the level of Company surplus. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, the Company's gross deferred tax assets did not exceed this
limitation.                                                           

    Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities related to unrealized gains
and losses on investments are reported as a component of changes in   
unrealized capital gains and losses in the consolidated statement of  
changes in surplus. Other net changes in deferred tax assets and      
  liabilities are direct adjustments to surplus and separately reported in
the consolidated statement of changes in surplus.                     

The major components of current income tax expense (benefit) were as

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL 

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company                                  
Notes to Consolidated Statutory Financial Statements                            
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002                                               
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company's taxable income can vary significantly from gain from    
operations before taxes due to temporary and permanent differences in 
revenue recognition and expense deduction between book and tax.       

   The Company is subject to an "equity tax" that is assessed only on mutual
   life insurance companies. In March 2002, Congress passed legislation that
   suspended assessments of equity tax for tax years 2001 through 2003. As a
    result, the related liability was released as a current tax benefit during
    2002. While the Company was subject to the equity tax in 2004, legislation
was enacted in April 2004 that permanently repealed the equity tax    
effective January 1, 2005.                                            

The Company's effective tax rates were 12%, 13% and 299% for the years
     ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The effective rate is
   not the statutory rate applied to the Company's taxable income or loss by
     the Internal Revenue Service. It is a financial statement relationship that
   represents the ratio between the sum of total taxes, including those that
   affect net income and changes in deferred taxes not related to unrealized
    gains and losses on investments, to the sum of gain from operations before
  taxes and pretax net realized gains or losses. These financial statement
    effective rates were different than the applicable federal tax rate of 35%
due primarily to differences between book and tax recognition of net  
investment income and realized capital gains and losses, prior year   
adjustments and the impact the of equity tax during 2002.             

Income taxes paid in the current and prior years of $1.3 billion are  
  available at December 31, 2004 for recoupment in the event of future tax
losses.                                                               

11.  Frank Russell Company Acquisition and Goodwill                             

     The Company acquired Frank Russell Company ("Russell") effective January 1,
1999. Russell, a global leader in multi-manager investment services,  
  provides investment products and services in more than 35 countries. The
initial purchase price of approximately $1.0 billion was funded with a
combination of cash, senior notes issued by Russell and bank debt. The
   purchase agreement also called for additional contingent consideration to
be paid to the former owners of Russell based upon the financial      
     performance of Russell during the five year period ended December 31, 2003.

The acquisition was accounted for using the statutory purchase method,
    whereby the excess of the acquisition price over the fair value of Russell
net assets at the time of the acquisition was attributed to goodwill  
     reported in the accounts of Russell. Further, the statutory purchase method
required that the Company's cost basis of its investment in Russell be
   reduced, through a direct reduction of Company surplus, for the amount by
     which Russell goodwill exceeded 10% of the Company's surplus at the time of
the acquisition.                                                      

The Company applied for, and was granted, permission by the OCI for an
alternative accounting treatment ("permitted practice"), whereby all  
    Russell goodwill, including any subsequent additions to goodwill resulting
from payment of contingent purchase consideration, be charged off as a
   direct reduction of Company surplus. This permitted practice differs from
 that required by the NAIC "Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual,"
which requires that any goodwill not in excess of 10% of the Company's
  surplus be amortized using a straight-line method over the period during
     which the acquiring entity benefits economically or ten years, whichever is
shorter.                                                              

    At December 31, 2004, the Company had made cumulative direct reductions of
  its surplus for goodwill associated with the Russell acquisition of $981
million. These charge-offs exceeded the

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL 

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company                                  
Notes to Consolidated Statutory Financial Statements                            
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002                                               
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Company's equity basis investment in Russell by $581 million, which is
classified as a reduction of the Company's total investment in common 
stocks at that date.                                                  

    If the Company had not received permission for this alternative accounting
treatment, Company surplus as reported in the statement of financial  
 position would have been greater by $320 million, $358 million and $335
   million at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and net income
 as reported in the statement of operations would have been lower by $61
million, $53 million and $52 million for the years then ended,        
respectively.                                                         

12.  Contingencies and Guarantees                                               

 The Company has unconditionally guaranteed repayment of $350 million of
senior notes and up to $50 million of bank borrowings owed by Russell.

In the normal course of business, the Company has guaranteed certain  
    obligations of other affiliates and made guarantees of operating leases or
     future minimum compensation payments on behalf of its field management. The
    maximum exposure under these guarantees totaled approximately $406 million
  at December 31, 2004. The Company believes that the likelihood is remote
     that payments will be required under these guarantees and therefore has not
   accrued a contingent liability in the consolidated statement of financial
position. In addition, the Company routinely makes commitments to fund
     mortgage loans or other investments in the normal course of business. These
commitments aggregated to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2004 and were  
extended at market interest rates and terms.                          

     The Company is engaged in various legal actions in the normal course of its
   investment and insurance operations. In the opinion of management, losses
that may ultimately result from such actions would not have a material
effect on the Company's financial position at December 31, 2004.      

13.  Related Party Transactions                                                 

 On May 13, 2004 the Company sold its majority interest in Baird Holding
 Company ("Baird") to Baird management and employees. At the time of the
     sale, the Company owned approximately 51% of Baird common stock, with Baird
   management and employees owning the remainder. The Company realized a $30
million gain on the sale of its remaining interest in Baird, which is 
reported in realized capital gains in the consolidated statement of   
   operations. The Company financed a substantial portion of the sales price
   through the purchase, at par, of $240 million of subordinated notes, with
 attached warrants, issued by Baird. Notes in the amount of $215 million
    remain outstanding at December 31, 2004 and are classified as bonds in the
consolidated statement of financial position.                         

   During 2004, the Company refinanced a credit facility owed by Russell and
   provided additional capital through the purchase, at par, of $258 million
of notes issued by Russell. Notes in the amount of $218 million remain
outstanding at December 31, 2004 and are classified as bonds in the   
consolidated statement of financial position.                         

During 2004, the Company transferred investments to a wholly-owned    
  subsidiary as a capital contribution. The fair value of these securities
was $222 million at the time of transfer. Realized capital gains of $2
million were recognized during 2004 upon the transfer of these assets.

During 2003, the Company transferred investments to a majority-owned  
  investment subsidiary as a capital contribution. The fair value of these
securities was $219 million at the time of the

   Investment-type insurance reserves   $ 4,023    $ 3,824    $ 3,989    $ 3,759

   Fair value of bonds, common and preferred stocks and derivative financial
    instruments are based upon quoted market prices, when available. For those
not actively traded fair value is estimated using independent pricing 
    services or internally developed pricing models. See Note 11 regarding the
   statement value of the Company's investment in Russell. The fair value of
mortgage loans is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows
using market interest rates for debt with comparable credit risk and  
   maturities. Real estate fair value is determined by discounting estimated
  future cash flows using market interest rates. Policy loan fair value is
  estimated based on discounted projected cash flows using market interest
 rates and assumptions regarding future loan repayments based on Company
     experience. Other investments include real estate joint ventures, which are
 valued by discounting estimated future cash flows using market interest
rates, as well as other joint ventures and partnerships, for which the
equity accounting basis approximates fair value.                      

The fair value of investment-type insurance reserves is estimated by  
discounting estimated future cash flows at market interest rates for  
similar instruments with comparable maturities.

The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company                        

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of
The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and its subsidiary ("the
Company") as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated        
statements of operations, of changes in surplus and of cash flows for each of   
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These consolidated       
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our    
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial         
statements based on our audits.                                                 

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards of the Public     
Company Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes       
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting       
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as        
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our    
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                              

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company prepared these  
consolidated financial statements using accounting practices prescribed or      
permitted by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of        
Wisconsin (statutory basis of accounting), which practices differ from          
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.       
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements are not intended to represent
a presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in   
the United States of America. The effects on the consolidated financial         
statements of the variances between the statutory basis of accounting and       
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,       
although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material.              

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements audited by us (1) do not  
present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, the 
financial position of The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and its    
subsidiary as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, or the results of their operations 
or their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2004 because of the effects of the variances between the statutory basis of     
accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America referred to in the preceding paragraph, and (2) do present fairly, in   
all material respects, the financial position of The Northwestern Mutual Life   
Insurance Company and its subsidiary as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the   
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended December 31, 2004, on the basis of accounting described in Note
1.

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

Annuities




Building a brighter future begins with knowing what you’ll have in retirement. Annuities can help you grow and protect what you’ve saved.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Total assets includes certain adjustments for transactions associated with the separation from MetLife, Inc.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

Earn Uncorrelated Returns of up to 5% In Shorter Term Maturities
Fixed annuity payment streams offer the opportunity for “yield alpha.” Because the periodic payments from annuities are unrated cashflows, they can be purchased at a discount. However, these same payment streams are backed by insurance companies rated A or better by A.M. Best Company.
Combined, these two features enable our clients to realize above average, risk adjusted returns of up to 5% annually.
Fixed annuities fund a variety of obligations including lotteries, personal injury settlements and investments. These secondary market annuities enable investors to capitalize on cashflows from a variety of diversified sources.
Structured Settlement Benefits

Higher Yields. Opportunities in structured settlements offer significantly higher yields than comparable fixed rate products.
Uncorrelated. Because structured settlement cashflows are long term insurance company obligations, they are generally considered to be uncorrelated to the economy at large.
Proven. Historically, defaults on annuity payments have been a fraction of the defaults typically associated with commercial loans.
Safer. Structured settlement cashflows are backed by insurance companies rated A or better. Even insurance companies that have merged, acquired or ceased operations are backed by runoff insurance which pays outstanding obligations such as payment streams.
Regulated. Insurance companies are subject to extensive regulation which includes federal oversight in addition to state-by-state insurance commissions.
Steady. Buyers of structured settlement payment streams receive regular, monthly payments following their initial investment.




"In addition to introducing me to solutions that fit my wealth-creation needs, the company puts its money where its mouth is. Woodbridge puts its own capital right alongside that of its clients, in exactly the same products. With an experienced firm’s skin in the game, I sleep much better at night." – Leonard Shemtob

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
