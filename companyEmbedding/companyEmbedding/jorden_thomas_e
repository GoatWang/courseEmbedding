Michele R
Featured review


I frequent JT and would normally give 5 stars but my experience with my make up appointment was just average. My artist Kelly seemed very unorganized and the outcome was just okay. She didn't know where to set up the airbrush compressor and ultimately, I had to hold it during application. Also, after airbrushing she continued to cake on more product. I have had airbrush makeup before and never experienced this. Toward the end she hands me the lipstick and goes "Here you go. Do you want to put it on or should I?" For the amount of money paid, I would expect her to - even more so because when I arrived, I handed her my lipstick and spoke about how I have such a hard time because of a scar on my lip. Also, the lashes were very overpriced at $20 and didn't even last through my event. Knowing the typical standard, I would still recommend the spa to friends but would advise they stay away from the makeup service.

 Jordan Thomas Salon and Spa replied:

Hi Michele, I am very sorry to hear that your makeup appointment was just average. Kelly has been doing makeup with us for many years and has retained an excellent clientele as well as many referrals from brides. After speaking with Kelly, she used a mineral powder after she applied the makeup to set the makeup and eliminate any shine that may occur, especially in warmer weather. As for the lashes, the feedback we have received on that particular brand has been positive, lasting into the next day. We apologize in this case that they didn't last that long on your lashes. We do hope that you were pleased with the overall outcome of the makeup, as we heard that it was stunning on you. If you wouldn't mind sending a picture to jtnorth@jordanthomassalonandspa.com so that we can review it, we would greatly appreciate it.

Your business is growing and you do fabulous work but your wait times are growing exponentially with this. 
My time from entry 3:50 pm (4 pm appointment) to actually seeing Dr. Block -5:20 , was a lot longer then it should be. 
Having a second doctor team up doesn't seem to alleviated any of this wait time either, I'm afraid to say. 
I'm hoping to see an improvement in that regard. 
Otherwise, the knowledge and experience shown by everyone from the front desk, the p/a's to the doctors themselves has been wonderful. 
Thank you. 
Keep up the good work.
