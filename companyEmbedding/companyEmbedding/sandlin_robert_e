Item Description: iUniverse, United States, 2004. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****. Harriett Bentley, President of the United States, courageously leads a crusade to establish world order through a Non Aggression Pact based on economic reality. There are those supporting her and those demanding impeachment. Unfortunately, there are those wanting her dead. The threat of a nuclear holocaust is ever present. Nations large and small have access to nuclear weapons of mass destruction. The United States is no longer the melting pot for those seeking refuge. Political, religious, ethnic and international unrest contribute to a sense of desperation. A voluntary war is waged as a surrogate to global conflict. War Island is the arena chosen for the voluntary conflict. Israeli news correspondent, Rachel Solomon Al Amed, driven to avenge her father s death, swears to disrupt the voluntary war. Aided by two young scientists, she succeeds and lives are lost. There are moments of intrigue, sexual passion, violence, and conflict. Two televangelists seeking diametrically opposed goals personify religious bigotry. Can this first woman president succeed in spite of the forces working against her? As one of the world s most powerful individuals, her odds are better than even.  Bookseller Inventory # AAV9780595310999

Overview



Harriett Bentley, President of the United States, courageously leads a crusade to establish world order through a Non Aggression Pact based on economic reality. There are those supporting her and those demanding impeachment. Unfortunately, there are those wanting her dead.The threat of a nuclear holocaust is ever present. Nations large and small have access to nuclear weapons of mass destruction. The United States is no longer the melting pot for those seeking refuge. Political, religious, ethnic and international unrest contribute to a sense of desperation. A voluntary war is waged as a surrogate to global conflict.. War Island is the arena chosen for the voluntary conflict.Israeli news correspondent, Rachel Solomon Al Amed, driven to avenge her father's death, swears to disrupt the voluntary war. Aided by two young scientists, she succeeds and lives are lost.There are moments of intrigue, sexual passion, violence, and conflict. Two televangelists seeking diametrically opposed goals personify religious bigotry.Can this first woman president succeed in spite of the forces working against her?As one of the world's most powerful individuals, her odds are better than even.
