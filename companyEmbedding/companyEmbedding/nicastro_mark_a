Job Details
               Please allow me to introduce myself, I am Warren Nix; owner of Littleton Painters. Listed below are a few reasons why I feel our painting work is superior. Proper preperation of surfaces: First we thoroughly pressure wash your home to remove dirt and chalky build up. This allows the paint a clean surface to adhere to. Then the entire surface is inspected for scraping, caulking, priming as needed, and nailing loose wood. After 18 years: Littleton Painters remains a small company of craftsman who enjoy what we do and it shows with the pride in our work. Paint and products we use: The paint we use KWAL Premium Grade Liquid Vinyl. Kwal formulates and tests all paint products right here in Colorado for our extreme climate. We also use top of the line caulking products to ensure against premature cracking. Application - Brush vs. Spray: All the best products and careful preparation will be in vain with improper painting applications. We brush and roll all rough and porous area (i.e. trim and windows). We often elect to apply two coats of paint on badly weathered siding (i.e. rough siding, recessed nails). The first coat is sprayed on thickly and worked into these damaged areas using a 3/4" nap roller to seal the siding. A second coat is then applied for the best possible coverage. Using a sprayer we are able to apply a thicker and smoother coating than any other method. Our sprayers are capable of putting out up to a gallon a minute without thinning of the paint. Check our references and customer testimonials: We specialize in repainting homes. As you can see from our customer testimonials, we have become very popular in a few neighborhoods. We have continuously provided excellent service and quality paint jobs in these areas. I have personally dealt with each homeowner as always and they would be happy to discuss their satisfaction with Littleton Painter's. All work is Done by US!: We refuse to sub-contract any of our work and do all jobs ourselves to your satisfaction. We believe this is the only way to maintain Littleton Painter's quality standards.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
