LSB’s Nitrogen Fertilizers Help Meet the World’s Growing Demand for Crops and Livestock

Agrochemical BusinessIndustrial Acids BusinessMining Products BusinessFacilities 











	LSB produces nitrogen based fertilizers, which play a vital role in agriculture today. Our fertilizers are used to grow food crops, biofuel feedstock crops, pasture land for grazing livestock and forage production. Our products are used in diverse areas, ranging from the corn belt in the north to the central part of the US to the southern plains region.





	 

	Products
LSB’s Agrochemical Business produces urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), agricultural grade high-density ammonium nitrate (AN) and anhydrous ammonia (NH3), all of which are nitrogen-based fertilizers.
UAN is a high nitrogen content fertilizer used to grow corn, wheat and other crops with a high nitrogen demand. It is also used for crops requiring longer nitrogen release, such as cotton, small grains, vegetables and orchards.
AN is a pelletized solid fertilizer and is used for grains, forage and many specialty crops such as citrus and vegetables, and it is the primary nitrogen component in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) blends.
Anhydrous ammonia is a high nitrogen content fertilizer from which all other agricultural nitrogen products are derived. It is primarily used for wheat and corn production.
Typically, farmers and ranchers decide which type of nitrogen-based fertilizer to apply based on the crop planted, soil and weather conditions, regional farming practices and relative nitrogen fertilizer prices.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
