Support Organizations
The Whitacre College of Engineering has developed a panel of industry experts, known
                     as the Dean's Council. This Council acts as a sounding board for the Dean and helps with external relations
                     for the college. Our student body also plays a significant role in the planning and
                     execution of events around the college. Our Engineering Ambassadors organize campus visits, assist with awards ceremonies and job fairs, and provide
                     other assistance.
                  
Career Assistance
We understand that the success of our students depends both on their experience at
                     school, and their ability to gain employment and apply their knowledge in the real
                     world. This requires more than just hosting job fairs, and our Engineering Opportunities Center offers students and employers the resources to turn the education received at the
                     Whitacre College of Engineering into real-world accomplishments.
                  
Outreach
Works to promote equity and access to quality STEM programming for K-12 students,educators,
                     and members of the community through outreach efforts.
                  
Giving Opportunities
The Whitacre College of Engineering has always depended on the support of our alumni
                     and friends to create and maintain our culture of excellence. Several of our endowed chairs and professorships and research facilities would not exist without your generous contributions. If you
                     would like to assist us, help continue our long tradition of educating some of America's
                     finest engineers, or just see how your contribution has made an impact, please visit
                     our College Development page.
