Energy Efficiency Experts
E3 is an Energy Services Company (ESCO) formed by PRHL to provide the best-of-breed energy reduction solutions for its clients. By maintaining a vendor independent approach, and after careful survey and analysis, E3’s experts prescribe the best solution for the unique circumstance of each client.. Through its ever-growing acquisitions and alliances, E3 strives to provide the most current, fully-vetted solutions in energy reduction technologies, as well as management tools which capture the client for future opportunities.
Many companies only provide stand-alone solutions and only address one area of energy efficiency. E3 looks at its clients’ entire energy footprint and develops custom solutions that fit their distinct requirements. E3 prescribes the most appropriate solutions for its clients’ facilities and operations and as importantly, their budgets. In addition, E3’s experts facilitate the entire process from assessment of needs to planning and implantation to ensure that all expectations for energy reduction and technology performance are met. E3 and its partners are able to provide financing, allowing our customers to experience savings and in many cases, additional cash flow in month one.

e3 – The Opportunity
First and foremost: Current TPC clients are looking for additional ways in which to lower their energy costs, therefore E3 is a perfect enhancement to an already satisfied established client base. The model of having multiple solutions for our clients, while at the same time helping our clients save money and be more energy efficient, is a win-win situation. With TPC’s client base, E3 will prosper for a significant amount of time without the exclusive need to cold-call for a new prospect, allowing for the E3 business to grow faster than the average Energy Efficiency business. In addition, being able to analyze and service multiple aspects of energy efficiency gives E3 a competitive advantage over other single-solution companies and provides multiple needs being met within the same client.
Energy efficiency’s largest players grew, even as the economy lagged in recent years. And they show no signs of slowing down, says a report distributed by the National Association of Energy Service Companies, according to the report, prepared by the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. After significantly outpacing US GDP, energy efficiency companies are poised to double revenues by 2020. The report speculates that the reason that ESCOs did so well during the economic slump is because of their business model, which spares customers from making large upfront outlays for energy efficiency retrofits. Payment to the ESCOs comes from the energy savings they achieve for a facility.
With E3 projects, typically the cost of the project is less than what E3 is saving its clients, allowing for immediate additional cash flow. This model allows for companies to embrace energy efficiency projects, without having to outlay a large capital expense.
In addition, qualified companies are receiving tax credits, utility rebates, and/or favorable lease terms that make their energy efficiency efforts cash positive from day one. State and federal agencies are providing significant tax incentive and most local utility companies are providing rebates based on proven documented reduction solutions.
Today’s competitive companies know that “Going Green” is not just beneficial to the environment and their communities – it’s also beneficial to their company’s reputation, value proposition and, when done right, it is beneficial to their bottom line. The positive cash flow characteristics combined with the incentives and tax deductions available make investments in energy efficiency one of the safest and highest-yielding investments available in this and any economic climate.

Premier Holding Corporation Signs Non-Binding LOI to Include TPC in Larger Energy Rollup

TUSTIN, CA--(Marketwired - Jun 12, 2017) -  Premier Holding Corporation (OTCQB: PRHL) announces the signing of a non-binding LOI with Ridgefield Partners, LLC, to participate in a newly created energy roll-up. PRHL intends to contribute its subsidiary, The Power Company (TPC), and certain other assets, in exchange for an interest in a combined company that has entered into three LOIs prior to the LOI with PRHL. We believe the combined company will be able to meet the listing standards of the major exchanges following consummation of the roll-up. We believe that the roll-up of these diversified yet integrated energy companies will maximize the future value of each company and thus the combined company.
PRHL will receive approximately 20% ownership of the combined company. We intend to promptly distribute a portion of these shares to our existing shareholders and then distribute the remaining shares over the course of the year following completion of the transaction, allowing PRHL shareholders to reap the benefits of holding shares in both Premier and in the combined company.
The LOI contemplates that TPC, a reseller of deregulated power, would be combined with a licensed national energy supplier that has one of the larger footprints in the deregulated energy space. This supplier has contracted with utilities in 9 out of the 11 top states for deregulated power. PRHL CEO Randall Letcavage stated: "In going through this process, I met with some of the larger suppliers in the US and there was a tremendous interest in our subsidiary, TPC. As we have reported to the public in the past, we believe TPC on its own has been severely undervalued -- our argument to support this goes back to our record sales months and eventually selling more than 5,000 customers a month (more than 60,000 customers per year) and the fact that TPC has sold over 200,000 energy contracts since inception. We believe that when teamed with a supplier, the value of TPC could be increased significantly.
Letcavage continued: "PRHL bought a supplier earlier this year to pursue our own integration. As a result we uncovered an attractive opportunity to acquire additional suppliers. This led us to begin talks with suppliers with as much as $100,000,000 in annual revenues and we came to understand our real value and how critical it is to enter the market quickly and in more states. During this process we also held discussions in earnest with Ridgefield -- who was acquiring companies including energy suppliers -- and this recently culminated in the announced LOI."
In addition, PRHL's other subsidiary, Energy Efficiency Experts (E3), is expected to enter into an exclusive sales agreements with the combined company to distribute their various lines of energy efficient products and services. E3 continues to perform well with limited manpower, and we believe that E3's previously announced partner program will increase its operations and financial results. A material advantage is that E3 has contracted a financing program that we believe is more competitive than anything in the industry. We expect this program will allow E3 customers to have all of their energy efficiency products bought for them on a basis that rivals other financing structures as clients will have no equipment cost or liability for any of the equipment. We believe that this process will represent a material change in the way energy efficiency is adopted, and we could potentially receive a commission from all efficiency technology (HVAC, windows, water, etc.) which is greater than just the lighting. We believe we can ultimately attract much larger clients while creating more cross selling opportunities. 
The company cautions readers that this is a non-binding LOI and the transaction remains subject to shareholder approval, and entry into a formal definitive agreements will have to be negotiated and signed, with customary representations and warranties and closing conditions. There can be no assurance that this transaction will be consummated.

Premier Holding Corp. Subsidiary The Power Company launches another successful pilot program, expanding its offerings

TUSTIN, CA–(Marketwired – Mar 22, 2017) – Premier Holding Corporation (OTCQB: PRHL) today announces that its subsidiary, The Power Company (TPC) successfully launched another pilot program to sell home automation along with deregulated power.
Premier’s motto of “Everything Energy” continues with its success by helping homeowners reduce energy with automation. The corporation’s mission is to help its clients reduce and manage their energy expenses, whether for a large corporation or an individual homeowner.
TPC has been in negotiation with several home automation companies and ran its first test starting in January of 2017. Since then, approximately 65% of TPC’s new residential client sales have benefited by including a smart home technology which enables them to control their home lighting directly from their cell phones or desktops. This percentage of adoption is much larger than expected and indicates the expertise possessed by the team at TPC.
“We recognize that peoples’ lives are busier than ever and our goal is to make our customers’ homes easier to manage. We are able to put people in control of the lighting in their homes at anytime and anywhere from their mobile devices. This is just the beginning. As we expand into additional product offerings, our clients will be able to monitor and control other aspects of their energy usage, such as appliances, heating and hot water”, stated Patrick Farah, Managing Partner of The Power Company.
With the continued addition of “smart home” products and services, Premier Holding is helping to make people’s lives easier and reduce their energy bills, while providing them insight into their energy usage.
Chairman and CEO of Premier, Randall Letcavage, said: “The positive reception from clients regarding our supplemental energy efficiency products and services demonstrates that our corporate model of expanding our offerings is extremely effective and will allow us to continue to enhance our growth pattern. We are very impressed with this program and plan to expand it.”

PRHL CEO Randall Letcavage stated: "In going through this process, I met with some of the larger suppliers in the US and there was a tremendous interest in our subsidiary, TPC. As we have reported to the public in the past, we believe TPC on its own has been severely undervalued -- our argument to support this goes back to our record sales months and eventually selling more than 5,000 customers a month (more than 60,000 customers per year) and the fact that TPC has sold over 200,000 energy contracts since inception. We believe that when teamed with a supplier, the value of TPC could be increased significantly.Letcavage continued: "PRHL bought a supplier earlier this year to pursue our own integration. As a result we uncovered an attractive opportunity to acquire additional suppliers. This led us to begin talks with suppliers with as much as $100,000,000 in annual revenues and we came to understand our real value and how critical it is to enter the market quickly and in more states. During this process we also held discussions in earnest with Ridgefield -- who was acquiring companies including energy suppliers -- and this recently culminated in the announced LOI."In addition, PRHL's other subsidiary, Energy Efficiency Experts (E3), is expected to enter into an exclusive sales agreements with the combined company to distribute their various lines of energy efficient products and services. E3 continues to perform well with limited manpower, and we believe that E3's previously announced partner program will increase its operations and financial results. A material advantage is that E3 has contracted a financing program that we believe is more competitive than anything in the industry. We expect this program will allow E3 customers to have all of their energy efficiency products bought for them on a basis that rivals other financing structures as clients will have no equipment cost or liability for any of the equipment. We believe that this process will represent a material change in the way energy efficiency is adopted, and we could potentially receive a commission from all efficiency technology (HVAC, windows, water, etc.) which is greater than just the lighting. We believe we can ultimately attract much larger clients while creating more cross selling opportunities.The company cautions readers that this is a non-binding LOI and the transaction remains subject to shareholder approval, and entry into a formal definitive agreements will have to be negotiated and signed, with customary representations and warranties and closing conditions. There can be no assurance that this transaction will be consummated.About Premier Holding Corporation  Under the corporate motto, "Everything Energy," Premier is an energy holding company focused on acquiring and integrating energy companies as synergistic subsidiaries.
