Apartments for rent in Texas
Interested in moving to Texas where everything's bigger? Texas has a variety of apartments (big and small) for rent in Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio and many other great cities.

Austin, Texas is home to big music with more music venues per capita than any other city across the nation. Along 6th Street, you'll find Austin apartments near bars, clubs, art galleries and cafes where live music is regularly featured in every genre you can imagine. Austin also hosts popular music festivals, such as South by Southwest (SXSW), Austin City Limits Music Festival and many others.

There's more to enjoy in Austin than music, though. With more than 250 parks, preserves and greenbelts in Austin, you'll have easy access to greenspace for walks, picnics, tennis matches and more. The University of Texas at Austin adds a feeling of livelihood and a youthful spirit that many Texas apartment dwellers find very appealing.

If you're more interested in living close to beaches, head southwest to Houston, where you'll find Texas apartments within an hour's drive to beaches such as Galveston Beach. Houston is also home to the Johnson Space Center, The University of Houston and a great museum district.

You'll also find great apartments in Dallas, Texas. In this city of more than a million residents, there are plenty of options for work and play. Whether you're looking for a night on the town, a variety of restaurant options or something fun for your kids to do, you can find all these things and more near Dallas apartments.

If you rent an apartment in San Antonio, you'll see that this city has a lot to offer, including the Paseo del Rio (the San Antonio River Walk), numerous theme parks and charming neighborhoods that not only attract visitors, but keep long-time residents in the area. And it's perhaps most known for its Tejano culture, the historic Alamo and the 16-time NBA Champions, the San Antonio Spurs. San Antonio also boasts a cost of living that's significantly lower than the national average. As a result, San Antonio apartments are available across a wide range of price points.

From the inexpensive to the luxurious, you can find just the right apartment for your taste and budget in Texas cities like Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, as well as in smaller cities throughout the state. Find your next apartment in Texas on ApartmentGuide.com, where you can search by apartment features, community features, price range and more.
