Mutual Funds involve risk including the possible loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results.The Funds’ ethical values screening criteria could cause it to under-perform similar funds that do not have such screening criteria. The Funds can have risk related to option investing. There are special risks associated with investments in foreign companies including exposure to currency fluctuations, less efficient trading markets, political instability and differing auditing and legal standards. Because of ongoing market volatility, the Funds performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes.
The Eventide Gilead Fund & Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund can invest in smaller-sized companies which may experience higher failure rates than larger companies and they normally have a lower trading volume than larger companies. The Funds can also have risk associated with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry in which these companies may be heavily dependent on clinical trials with uncertain outcomes and decisions made by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Funds can invest in private companies. Private investments include various risks including but not limited to lack of liquidity, capital commitment risk, and valuation risk. Private companies may not be financially profitable and have uncertain futures, subjecting them to additional risks. Investors in the Gilead Fund should be aware that companies in the technology industries have different risks including but not limited to products becoming obsolete, and entrance of competing products. Companies in the Industrial Sector also carry various risks including, but not limited to, risk related to debt loads and intense competition.
Investors in the Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund should be aware that interest rates are at historic lows and may change at any time based on government policy.  In general, the price of a fixed income security falls when interest rates rise. A rise in interest rates may result in volatility and increased redemptions, which in turn could result in the fund being forced to liquidate portfolio securities at disadvantageous prices. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates. The intermediate-term bond portion of the Fund’s portfolio may represent 0% to 100% of the Fund’s portfolio with an average duration of between two and eight years.
The Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund may invest in other funds. If other funds are utilized, such underlying funds are subject to investment advisory and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. As a result, your cost of investing in the Fund will be higher than the cost of investing directly in underlying funds and may be higher than other mutual funds that do not invest in underlying funds. The Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in “junk bonds.” Such securities are speculative investments that carry greater risks than higher quality debt securities. There are unique risks associated with REITs, MLPs, preferred stocks, convertible bonds, BDCs, and yieldcos that are covered in the Fund's prospectus and SAI. The Fund is a new mutual fund and has a limited history of operations for investors to evaluate. 
An investor should consider a fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing or sending money. This and other important information can be found in the prospectus, which can be obtained at www.eventidefunds.com or by calling 1-877-771-EVEN (3836). Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

Eventide | About Us





































About Us

Eventide Asset Management, LLC is a Boston-based Registered Investment Advisor* and serves as the Advisor to Eventide Mutual Funds. Founded in 2008 with a vision to provide high performance values-based investments** for individuals, financial advisors, and institutions, Eventide has become a leader in faith-based and socially responsible investing. Eventide is the Advisor to the Eventide Gilead Fund, the Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund, and the Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund, and manages more than $1.7 billion in net assets.



Leadership
Investment Team
Sales and Marketing
Our Investment Philosophy
Purpose and Values




We believe high-quality companies where we have a differentiated view from the market and that trade at a discount to intrinsic value offer superior long-term risk-adjusted returns.
The Adviser's judgment about the quality and intrinsic value of particular companies may prove to be incorrect. There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate positive returns, or avoid losses.




Eventide strives to honor God and serve its clients by investing in companies that create compelling value for the global common good.
We seek to invest shareholder capital in ways that enable our investors to meet their financial endpoints while enlarging the locus of flourishing in the world.
We believe value creation is the essential mark of great companies – those companies that are both attractive for investment and truly admirable. Our goal is to invest in such companies.
We take a broad stakeholder perspective on value creation – seeking to invest in those companies that excel at serving their customers, employees, suppliers, host communities, the environment, and society broadly.



EventideValues
Constantly improving
Eventide people are those with a sense of the ideal in every aspect of their work. As a result, we take the posture of learners and constantly and indefatigably work to grow in knowledge, discernment, and competence.
Teachable
In an industry often characterized by self-aggrandizement, Eventide people seek to have an accurate self-assessment, to be open to critique, and teachable. Recognizing our perspectives can be incomplete and our weaknesses often transparent, we seek to have the humility required to learn from others and thereby truly advance.
Bold
Eventide people have the boldness to stand apart. Whether in our resolve to always select for investments that conduce to the human good, our focus on long-term success, or our willingness to depart from consensus opinion, we have the boldness to be singularly different.
Content only with excellence
Eventide people prefer the artisan to the industrial. We pay attention to craft and detail, and seek to be rightly proud of everything we do.
Thoughtful
Eventide people seek to be disciplined and rational. We seek to read broadly, contemplate from diverse vantage points, and to act thoughtfully and for good reason.
High integrity
Eventide people seek to be persons of high integrity. We want to act virtuously, speak candidly, and live our authentic selves before others.
Collaborative
Eventide people believe that together they can achieve more than they can independently. Therefore, we value diversity of thought, and seek to foster a working environment that is collaborative and where each contribution is important.

Mutual Funds involve risk including the possible loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results.The Funds’ ethical values screening criteria could cause it to under-perform similar funds that do not have such screening criteria. The Funds can have risk related to option investing. There are special risks associated with investments in foreign companies including exposure to currency fluctuations, less efficient trading markets, political instability and differing auditing and legal standards. Because of ongoing market volatility, the Funds performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes.
The Eventide Gilead Fund & Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund can invest in smaller-sized companies which may experience higher failure rates than larger companies and they normally have a lower trading volume than larger companies. The Funds can also have risk associated with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry in which these companies may be heavily dependent on clinical trials with uncertain outcomes and decisions made by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Funds can invest in private companies. Private investments include various risks including but not limited to lack of liquidity, capital commitment risk, and valuation risk. Private companies may not be financially profitable and have uncertain futures, subjecting them to additional risks. Investors in the Gilead Fund should be aware that companies in the technology industries have different risks including but not limited to products becoming obsolete, and entrance of competing products.

Investors in the Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund should be aware that interest rates are at historic lows and may change at any time based on government policy.  In general, the price of a fixed income security falls when interest rates rise. A rise in interest rates may result in volatility and increased redemptions, which in turn could result in the fund being forced to liquidate portfolio securities at disadvantageous prices. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates. The intermediate-term bond portion of the Fund’s portfolio may represent 0% to 100% of the Fund’s portfolio with an average duration of between two and eight years.
The Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund may invest in other funds. If other funds are utilized, such underlying funds are subject to investment advisory and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. As a result, your cost of investing in the Fund will be higher than the cost of investing directly in underlying funds and may be higher than other mutual funds that do not invest in underlying funds. The Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in “junk bonds.” Such securities are speculative investments that carry greater risks than higher quality debt securities. There are unique risks associated with REITs, MLPs, preferred stocks, convertible bonds, BDCs, and yieldcos that are covered in the Fund's prospectus and SAI. The Fund is a new mutual fund and has a limited history of operations for investors to evaluate.

Eventide | About Us





































About Us

Eventide Asset Management, LLC is a Boston-based Registered Investment Advisor* and serves as the Advisor to Eventide Mutual Funds. Founded in 2008 with a vision to provide high performance values-based investments** for individuals, financial advisors, and institutions, Eventide has become a leader in faith-based and socially responsible investing. Eventide is the Advisor to the Eventide Gilead Fund, the Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund, and the Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund, and manages more than $1.7 billion in net assets.

Our Investment Philosophy
Purpose and Values




We believe high-quality companies where we have a differentiated view from the market and that trade at a discount to intrinsic value offer superior long-term risk-adjusted returns.
The Adviser's judgment about the quality and intrinsic value of particular companies may prove to be incorrect. There is no guarantee that any investment will achieve its objectives, generate positive returns, or avoid losses.




Eventide strives to honor God and serve its clients by investing in companies that create compelling value for the global common good.
We seek to invest shareholder capital in ways that enable our investors to meet their financial endpoints while enlarging the locus of flourishing in the world.
We believe value creation is the essential mark of great companies – those companies that are both attractive for investment and truly admirable. Our goal is to invest in such companies.
We take a broad stakeholder perspective on value creation – seeking to invest in those companies that excel at serving their customers, employees, suppliers, host communities, the environment, and society broadly.



EventideValues
Constantly improving
Eventide people are those with a sense of the ideal in every aspect of their work. As a result, we take the posture of learners and constantly and indefatigably work to grow in knowledge, discernment, and competence.
Teachable
In an industry often characterized by self-aggrandizement, Eventide people seek to have an accurate self-assessment, to be open to critique, and teachable. Recognizing our perspectives can be incomplete and our weaknesses often transparent, we seek to have the humility required to learn from others and thereby truly advance.
Bold
Eventide people have the boldness to stand apart. Whether in our resolve to always select for investments that conduce to the human good, our focus on long-term success, or our willingness to depart from consensus opinion, we have the boldness to be singularly different.
Content only with excellence
Eventide people prefer the artisan to the industrial. We pay attention to craft and detail, and seek to be rightly proud of everything we do.
Thoughtful
Eventide people seek to be disciplined and rational. We seek to read broadly, contemplate from diverse vantage points, and to act thoughtfully and for good reason.
High integrity
Eventide people seek to be persons of high integrity. We want to act virtuously, speak candidly, and live our authentic selves before others.
Collaborative
Eventide people believe that together they can achieve more than they can independently. Therefore, we value diversity of thought, and seek to foster a working environment that is collaborative and where each contribution is important.

Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80 percent of its net assets in equity and equity-related securities of companies in the healthcare and life sciences sectors.

 Healthcare and life sciences companies include those companies that derive or are expected to derive 50% or more of their revenue from healthcare and life science products and services including, but not limited to, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, life science tools, medical devices, healthcare information technology, healthcare services, synthetic biology, agricultural and environmental management, and pharmaceutical manufacturing products and services.

The secondary index for the Fund changed from the Healthcare Blended Index to the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index on April 1, 2017.

Investment Objective: The Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund seeks current income while maintaining the potential for capital appreciation.  The Fund has significant flexibility to achieve its investment objective by primarily investing in a broad universe of income-producing securities. These securities include debt and equity securities of companies in the U.S. and other markets around the world.  
These securities may include but are not limited to common stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs), business development companies, yieldcos, master limited partnerships (MLPs), preferred stocks, corporate bonds, government agency bonds, certificates of deposit, municipal bonds, inflation-linked bonds, mortgage-backed securities, options, exchange traded notes, exchange traded funds and other investment companies (including mutual funds and closed-end funds). The Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in companies whose securities may have legal or contractual restrictions on resale or are otherwise illiquid.
Investment Strategy: Eventide uses a two step process to select securities for the Fund. The investment process begins with a “top down” analysis to select a variety of asset classes that are believed to offer the best opportunity for current income and/or capital appreciation.  Factors considered include an assessment of current income opportunities, the potential for income growth, valuation, capital appreciation potential and/or portfolio risk/return attributes.  The second step is a fundamental “bottom-up” analysis to evaluate specific securities for inclusion in the portfolio. Eventide favors securities that, in its opinion, are attractively valued, provide attractive current income, provide income appreciation potential, provide capital appreciation potential, and/or help to reduce overall portfolio volatility.
Sub-Adviser: Eventide has retained Boyd Watterson Asset Management, LLC to manage some or all of the Fund’s assets allocated for investment in the intermediate-term bond portion of the portfolio. In selecting securities for investment by the Fund, Boyd Watterson employs a top-down approach to determine how to structure the bond allocation taking in to consideration duration, maturity, and sector allocation. Boyd Watterson then initiates a process of security analysis based on several factors including, but not limited to, economic trends, industry assessments and issuer specific credit fundamentals.
Values-based investing: Eventide aims to analyze each potential investment’s ability to operate with integrity and create value for customers, employees, the environment, and other key stakeholders.  While few companies may reach these ideals in every area of their business, these principles articulate the Advisor’s ideal characteristics of good corporate behavior.  The Advisor makes no guarantee that fund investments will meet any or all of these characteristics.

Mutual Funds involve risk including the possible loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results.The Funds’ ethical values screening criteria could cause it to under-perform similar funds that do not have such screening criteria. The Funds can have risk related to option investing. There are special risks associated with investments in foreign companies including exposure to currency fluctuations, less efficient trading markets, political instability and differing auditing and legal standards. Because of ongoing market volatility, the Funds performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes.
The Eventide Gilead Fund & Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund can invest in smaller-sized companies which may experience higher failure rates than larger companies and they normally have a lower trading volume than larger companies. The Funds can also have risk associated with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry in which these companies may be heavily dependent on clinical trials with uncertain outcomes and decisions made by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Funds can invest in private companies. Private investments include various risks including but not limited to lack of liquidity, capital commitment risk, and valuation risk. Private companies may not be financially profitable and have uncertain futures, subjecting them to additional risks. Investors in the Gilead Fund should be aware that companies in the technology industries have different risks including but not limited to products becoming obsolete, and entrance of competing products. Companies in the Industrial Sector also carry various risks including, but not limited to, risk related to debt loads and intense competition.
Investors in the Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund should be aware that interest rates are at historic lows and may change at any time based on government policy.  In general, the price of a fixed income security falls when interest rates rise. A rise in interest rates may result in volatility and increased redemptions, which in turn could result in the fund being forced to liquidate portfolio securities at disadvantageous prices. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates. The intermediate-term bond portion of the Fund’s portfolio may represent 0% to 100% of the Fund’s portfolio with an average duration of between two and eight years.
The Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund may invest in other funds. If other funds are utilized, such underlying funds are subject to investment advisory and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. As a result, your cost of investing in the Fund will be higher than the cost of investing directly in underlying funds and may be higher than other mutual funds that do not invest in underlying funds. The Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in “junk bonds.” Such securities are speculative investments that carry greater risks than higher quality debt securities. There are unique risks associated with REITs, MLPs, preferred stocks, convertible bonds, BDCs, and yieldcos that are covered in the Fund's prospectus and SAI. The Fund is a new mutual fund and has a limited history of operations for investors to evaluate. 
An investor should consider a fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing or sending money. This and other important information can be found in the prospectus, which can be obtained at www.eventidefunds.com or by calling 1-877-771-EVEN (3836). Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

Mutual Funds involve risk including the possible loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results.The Funds’ ethical values screening criteria could cause it to under-perform similar funds that do not have such screening criteria. The Funds can have risk related to option investing. There are special risks associated with investments in foreign companies including exposure to currency fluctuations, less efficient trading markets, political instability and differing auditing and legal standards. Because of ongoing market volatility, the Funds performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes.
The Eventide Gilead Fund & Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund can invest in smaller-sized companies which may experience higher failure rates than larger companies and they normally have a lower trading volume than larger companies. The Funds can also have risk associated with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry in which these companies may be heavily dependent on clinical trials with uncertain outcomes and decisions made by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Funds can invest in private companies. Private investments include various risks including but not limited to lack of liquidity, capital commitment risk, and valuation risk. Private companies may not be financially profitable and have uncertain futures, subjecting them to additional risks. Investors in the Gilead Fund should be aware that companies in the technology industries have different risks including but not limited to products becoming obsolete, and entrance of competing products. Companies in the Industrial Sector also carry various risks including, but not limited to, risk related to debt loads and intense competition.
Investors in the Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund should be aware that interest rates are at historic lows and may change at any time based on government policy.  In general, the price of a fixed income security falls when interest rates rise. A rise in interest rates may result in volatility and increased redemptions, which in turn could result in the fund being forced to liquidate portfolio securities at disadvantageous prices. Longer-term securities may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates. The intermediate-term bond portion of the Fund’s portfolio may represent 0% to 100% of the Fund’s portfolio with an average duration of between two and eight years.
The Eventide Multi-Asset Income Fund may invest in other funds. If other funds are utilized, such underlying funds are subject to investment advisory and other expenses, which will be indirectly paid by the Fund. As a result, your cost of investing in the Fund will be higher than the cost of investing directly in underlying funds and may be higher than other mutual funds that do not invest in underlying funds. The Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in “junk bonds.” Such securities are speculative investments that carry greater risks than higher quality debt securities. There are unique risks associated with REITs, MLPs, preferred stocks, convertible bonds, BDCs, and yieldcos that are covered in the Fund's prospectus and SAI. The Fund is a new mutual fund and has a limited history of operations for investors to evaluate. 
An investor should consider a fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing or sending money. This and other important information can be found in the prospectus, which can be obtained at www.eventidefunds.com or by calling 1-877-771-EVEN (3836). Please read the prospectus carefully before investing. Eventide Mutual Funds are distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC, Member FINRA, which is not affiliated with Eventide Asset Management, LLC.

PRESS RELEASE:
Eventide Asset Management, LLC, a Boston-based investment advisory firm that is committed to biblically responsible investing, has launched the Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund on December 27, 2012. The Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund is a non-diversified fund that uses bottom-up fundamental research to find healthcare and life sciences companies with the potential to appreciate in value as positive data is released regarding clinical trials and FDA feedback, and market acceptance of products. The Fund has four share classes: ETNHX -0.27% (N), ETIHX -0.27% , (I), ETAHX -0.18% (A), and ETCHX -0.18% Copyright.
Healthcare and life sciences companies include those companies that derive or are expected to derive 50% or more of their revenue from healthcare and life science products and services including, but not limited to, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, life science tools, medical devices, healthcare information technology, healthcare services, synthetic biology, agricultural and environmental management, and pharmaceutical manufacturing products and services. These companies include smaller development-stage companies. 





According to lead portfolio manager Finny Kuruvilla, MD PhD, despite revolutionary advances in biology, we’ve only witnessed its nascency. Dr. Kuruvilla commented: “There is what I call an ‘opportunity vacuum’ for health and life sciences, as scientific understanding significantly outpaces approved treatments it the marketplace. This highly addressable pipeline, combined with the deepening pockets and growing appetites of large biopharma, promise exciting investment opportunities well into the future.” In support of this investment thesis, Kuruvilla cited a recent report from Morgan Stanley and Thomson Reuters indicating a widening gap between the free cash flow of large biopharma companies and the entire US smid-cap biotech market capitalization. In other words, “Large biopharma has more money to spend than there are opportunities to buy, and the gap is widening, not closing,” said Kuruvilla.
In addition to a compelling investment thesis, investors should be attracted to the Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund because of the expectation of diversification benefits in broad investment portfolios. According to the Morgan Stanley Strategy team, biotechnology has the most non-correlation of any industry group. This is especially true of small-cap biotechnology companies, where risks are typically more tied to company-specific events — such as, clinical trial data releases and FDA feedback — than to macro-economic forces. 





The Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund will be managed by Eventide’s lead portfolio manager, Finny Kuruvilla, MD PhD. Dr. Kuruvilla has been primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Eventide Gilead Fund since its inception on July 8, 2008. The Eventide Gilead Fund is a diversified mutual fund that primarily invests in small and mid-cap growth companies. Under his leadership, the Eventide Gilead Fund’s no-load class has returned an annualized performance of 11.08% from July 8, 2008 to December 31, 2012 net of all fees, while the S&P 500 has returned 4.88% and the Russell Midcap Growth Index 6.00%. The fund has garnered numerous awards from the Wall Street Journal for its outperformance since inception in July 2008.
Along with his role as portfolio manager at Eventide, Dr. Kuruvilla also serves as Principal at Clarus Ventures, a health care venture capital firm with $1.2 billion under management. He represents Clarus on the Board of Directors of Nanostring, and is also a Board Observer for Catabasis, Lycera, Tetralogic, and Virdante. He has cared for adult and pediatric patients suffering from a wide variety of hematologic, oncologic, and autoimmune disorders at the Brigham & Women’s Hospital, Children’s Hospital Boston, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, the Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, and the Massachusetts General Hospital. He has also conducted research at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT in medical genetics from 2006 to 2008. Dr. Kuruvilla did his residency at the Brigham & Women’s Hospital from 2003 to 2006 and his fellowship in transfusion medicine at Harvard Medical School from 2006 to 2007. He received his MD from Harvard Medical School, his PhD in chemistry and chemical biology from Harvard University, his master’s degree in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT, and his bachelor’s degree from Caltech.

The S&P 500 is an index created by Standard & Poor’s Corp considered to represent the performance of the stock market generally. The Russell Midcap Growth Index measures the performance of the U.S. equity mid-cap growth segment. It includes mid-cap companies with higher price-to-book ratios and forecasted growth. Neither index is an investment product available for purchase.
Mutual Funds involve risk including the possible loss of principal. Both the Eventide Gilead Fund and Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund can invest in smaller-sized companies which may experience higher failure rates than larger companies and they normally have a lower trading volume than larger companies. The Funds’ ethical values screening criteria could cause it to underperform similar funds that do not have such screening criteria. The Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences fund is non-diversified and its performance largely depends on the overall condition of the healthcare sector. The Eventide Gilead Fund and Eventide Healthcare & Life Sciences Fund can both have risk associated with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry in which these companies may be heavily dependent on clinical trials with uncertain outcomes and decisions made by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The funds can have risk related to option investing. There are special risks associated with investments in foreign companies including exposure to currency fluctuations, less efficient trading markets, political instability and differing auditing and legal standards. The fund can have risk associated with a higher portfolio turnover which could result in higher transactional costs. 





An investor should consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing or sending money. This and other important information about the Eventide Gilead Fund can be found in the Fund’s prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

What are analysts saying about TESARO stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about TESARO stock: 
1. FBR & Co analysts commented, "We received our first data snapshot from the RX-3117 Phase 2a study in advanced muscle invasive bladder cancer at ASCO this weekend with data coming from 10 patients in stage 1 of the study. The study achieved the predefined efficacy criteria (two of ten patients achieving a PFS of at least four months or a partial or complete tumor response), where 22% of patients have experienced PFS for a minimum of six months. One of the two aforementioned patients is still on study, achieving 175 days of stable disease. While only stage 1 of this study, we believe it is important to point out that patients who have reached this stage of disease are usually limited to palliative or best supportive care." (6/5/2017)
2. Cann analysts commented, "On Saturday, June 3, 2017, Tesaro provided a corporate update that described initial data from the TOPACIO trial of niraparib (Zejula) plus Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and results of a phase I trial of TSR-042, and provided an update on the commercial launch of Zejula and its commercial businesses in the US and Europe. The launch is exceeding our expectations, and management reiterated plans to advance Zejula into the front-line ovarian cancer setting and to expand into other tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer. We are adjusting our Zejula outlook based on the current status of the launch." (6/5/2017)
3. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "TSRO reported 1Q financials, provided a pipeline update and commented on Zejula’s." (5/11/2017)
4. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Tesaro, Inc. is an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company for cancer patients. The Company's product portfolio consists of Rolapitant, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, TSR-011, an orally available anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and other cancer indications, and Niraparib, an orally active and potent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with solid tumors. Tesaro, Inc. is based in Waltham, Massachusetts.   " (3/31/2017)
5. Wedbush analysts commented, "With first-mover advantage in the maintenance setting, a lack of requirement for a diagnostic, as well clinical data that is at least as good as Lynparza in gBRCA patients, we continue to believe that TSRO remains an attractive acquisition candidate." (3/28/2017)
