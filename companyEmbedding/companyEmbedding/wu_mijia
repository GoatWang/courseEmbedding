History[edit]
NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was founded by Ron Najafi, an organic chemist who had previously worked for several pharmaceutical, chemical and biotech companies in the U.S. Najafi became intrigued by HOCl, hypochlorous acid, an antimicrobial substance produced by White Blood Cells while investigating the chemical reaction of White Blood Cells during oxidative burst cycle. HOCl and other chlorine-containing chemicals fight invading microbes. These natural substances rapidly oxidize the cell walls of bacteria and the protein coats of viruses, rendering them inactive.
Najafi started NovaBay Pharmaceuticals in 2000 to create a stable version of HOCl.[4][citation needed]
Najafi, chemistry Nobel Laureate Herbert C. Brown, and Purdue University Professor Dale Margerum recruited Dr. Lu Wang to NovaBay, where she is now Director of Product Development. She was able to develop the stable version of pure hypochlorous acid, without bleach impurities, which became NovaBay’s first product, NeutroPhase[5]"Hypochlorous Acid as a Potential Wound Care Agent Part II" (PDF).  "NeutroPhase® in chronic non-healing wounds" (PDF).  "Treatment of Acute Necrotizing Fasciitis Using Negative Pressure Wound Therapy and Adjunctive NeutroPhase Irrigation Under the Foam". [not in citation given] and cleared by the Food and Drug Administration in 2010. The product successfully treats a variety of chronic non-healing wounds without the use of standard antibiotics. NovaBay announced two new products named CelleRx™ for Plastic Surgery and i-Lid™ Cleanser (Now Avenova) that was cleared by FDA for lid and lash cleansing as part of a regimen for Blepharitis. "NovaBay Avenova has a low toxicity but kills eyelid bacteria in dry eye or blepharitis patients.". 
Corporate Governance[edit]
As of April 1, 2016[update], the members of the board of directors of NovaBay Pharmaceuticals were: Paul E. Freiman, Xinzhou LI (Paul Li), Gail Maderis, T. Alex McPherson, M.D., Ph.D., Massimo Radaelli, Ph.D., Mark Sieczkarek, Mijia WU (Bob Wu) and Xiaoyan LIU (Henry Liu).
Products[edit]
Products on the market[edit]
Avenova (formerly known as i-Lid Cleanser) [6] NeutroPhase [7] CelleRx, for Plastic Surgery
Products under development[edit]
NovaBay developed a method for making a stable pure form of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a substance produced by the immune system as an effective first defense against microbial invaders. The company calls their proprietary formulation Neutrox. The company's chemists also created a related family of compounds which the company calls Aganocides.
The company is currently developing compounds with anti-bacterial and anti-viral action. Potential applications include flesh-eating disease, problems related to in-dwelling urinary catheters, and common eye conditions. Compounds are also being developed for the veterinary market.[8]

Najafi started NovaBay Pharmaceuticals in 2000 to create a stable version of HOCl.[4][citation needed]
Najafi, chemistry Nobel Laureate Herbert C. Brown, and Purdue University Professor Dale Margerum recruited Dr. Lu Wang to NovaBay, where she is now Director of Product Development. She was able to develop the stable version of pure hypochlorous acid, without bleach impurities, which became NovaBay’s first product, NeutroPhase[5]"Hypochlorous Acid as a Potential Wound Care Agent Part II" (PDF).  "NeutroPhase® in chronic non-healing wounds" (PDF).  "Treatment of Acute Necrotizing Fasciitis Using Negative Pressure Wound Therapy and Adjunctive NeutroPhase Irrigation Under the Foam". [not in citation given] and cleared by the Food and Drug Administration in 2010. The product successfully treats a variety of chronic non-healing wounds without the use of standard antibiotics. NovaBay announced two new products named CelleRx™ for Plastic Surgery and i-Lid™ Cleanser (Now Avenova) that was cleared by FDA for lid and lash cleansing as part of a regimen for Blepharitis. "NovaBay Avenova has a low toxicity but kills eyelid bacteria in dry eye or blepharitis patients.".

Products under development[edit]
NovaBay developed a method for making a stable pure form of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a substance produced by the immune system as an effective first defense against microbial invaders. The company calls their proprietary formulation Neutrox. The company's chemists also created a related family of compounds which the company calls Aganocides.
The company is currently developing compounds with anti-bacterial and anti-viral action. Potential applications include flesh-eating disease, problems related to in-dwelling urinary catheters, and common eye conditions. Compounds are also being developed for the veterinary market.[8]
