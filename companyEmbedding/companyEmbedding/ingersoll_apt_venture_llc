Des Moines, IA
Des Moines, the capital of Iowa, is located smack-dab in the middle of the prototypical Midwestern state. It is regarded as one of the best Midwestern cities in which to live and do business. The city was founded in 1843 at the confluence of the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers. Its population is just under 200,000.NEIGHBORHOODS AND DISTRICTSThe central neighborhoods of Des Moines are clustered near the Des Moines River:The Downtown Core houses the central business district, with its historical edifices and modern office towers, the tallest buildings in Iowa. The 45-story headquarters of the Principal Financial Group was constructed in 1991. A four-mile network of skywalks between the buildings makes it possible to navigate downtown Des Moines without coming down to earth. The city's Civic Center of Greater Des Moines and Des Moines Art Center Downtown are among the public spaces in the city's hub.The Court Avenue neighborhood, just east of downtown, dates back to the city's founding years. It houses the original post office and many historic buildings, some of which have been converted to restaurants and nightspots. This pedestrian-friendly neighborhood rewards the urban walker with period details like street lamps and benches. A recreational trail called the Principal Riverwalk is nearing the end of its first phase of construction.Across the river, the East Village neighborhood houses the State Capitol along with an eclectic mix of retail sites, restaurants, and offices. This historic neighborhood has recently come into its own as a creative cultural site and a destination for the city's younger residents.Sherman Hill is the oldest residential neighborhood in Des Moines and features its most attractive housing stock, with many older Victorian and Queen Anne homes.The Western Gateway, just west of downtown, contains several major office buildings, including the headquarters of Meredith Corporation and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. The Western Gateway Park and Sculpture Garden is the community's primary gathering place.ECONOMY AND INDUSTRIESDes Moines ranks with Hartford, Connecticut, as a center of the insurance industry in the United States, and indeed the world. The city is also home to many financial services companies.

Debates, town meetings, and photo opportunities take place daily in Des Moines during campaign season, as visiting journalists and campaign staffs crisscross the state. The 2008 caucuses were especially vigorous. Barack Obama's speech in Des Moines on November 10, 2007, at the state Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner was a key event in his historic campaign, presaging his victory in the caucus two months later.EDUCATIONTwo four-year colleges have their central campuses within Des Moines:Drake University, a private coeducational institution with the oldest law school west of the Mississippi RiverGrand View University, affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in AmericaSPORTS TEAMSDes Moines has a triple-A minor league baseball team, the Iowa Cubs, part of the Chicago Cubs farm system.
