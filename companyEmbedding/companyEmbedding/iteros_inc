Fully Functioning Microgrid Displayed At EnerBlü Grid Services & Iteros Connected ™ Microgrid Lab During 3rd Annual Sun Valley Forum On Resilience, July 5-8, 2017, Ketchum, ID.
Posted: 

Monday, July 3, 2017 4:06 PM EDT




EnerBl and Iteros will familiarize Forum guests with our innovative hybridized power generation platform and Smart Grid Energy Management Solutions to help build and spread approaches at speed and scale in support of leaders everywhere to accelerate the transformation to resilience.RIVERSIDE, CA - 06-29-2017 (Press Release Jet) -- EnerBlu, Inc. (EnerBlü) and Iteros, Inc. (Iteros) today announced that the companies will be presenting a collaborative solution for integrating and orchestrating large-scale energy storage systems and other distributed energy resources (DERs) from July 5-8, 2017, during the Sun Valley Forum in Sun Valley, ID. Together, the EnerBlu and Iteros teams will be educating Forum guests and the Sun Valley community about building energy resilience utilizing the companies’ respective hardware and software technologies in a “hands-on”  Microgrid Lab.“Presented by the Sun Valley Institute, an organization focused on advancing resilience via policy leadership, public engagement, and targeted investments, the Sun Valley Forum brings together innovators, governments, and business leaders from around the globe to accelerate the transformation to a more prosperous, equitable, and sustainable world.” said Aimée Christensen, Executive Director of the Sun Valley Institute.On display at the event will be EnerBlü’s Advanced Energy Storage Unit (AESU), which combines a traditional fossil fuel powered generator (like those used globally to generate power) with onboard energy storage to provide a mobile energy delivery system ideal for military, rural and commercial electrification applications.  When integrated with a genset(s), the AESU, which also has the ability to incorporate renewable energy sources (i.e., solar, PV, or wind), provides customers with dramatic reductions in both genset fuel usage and emissions while ensuring access to reliable energy when and where they need it.  Also on display during the Forum will be EnerBlü’s zero emission, Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), which is a Class 4/5 commercial model that is also produced as both a shuttle bus and as a Class A/B/C school bus. With the Iteros software platform, AESU owners gain access to real-time information and systemwide performance data, demand-side management capabilities, and the ability to respond to market signals and participate in ancillary services. The platform includes templated controls and code-free engineering features that reduce integration costs and provide access to valuable energy data within minutes of interconnection.Daniel Elliott, EnerBlü’s CEO stated, “The quality of the people and their intimate level of understanding of the challenges ahead of us constitute the perfect venue to bolster the fact that transformational power generation systems and innovative clean vehicles are viable solutions that can impact tomorrow’s future today, and empower consumers to create cleaner, sustainable communities not only in the United States but also in countries that are in the process of building their infrastructure.  EnerBlü is involved in all those fronts.”   Jennifer Worrall, co-founder, President, and CEO of Iteros added, “We are thrilled for the opportunity to showcase our smart-grid enabling energy management capabilities with EnerBlu’s innovative products.” About Sun Valley Institute:The Sun Valley Institute advances policy leadership, public engagement and targeted investments to ensure economic prosperity, environmental protection and human wellbeing in its home community of Idaho’s Wood River Valley and beyond. Sun Valley leaders founded the Institute in the spring of 2015 to protect and enhance local quality of place for future generations of residents and visitors alike, and to serve as a resource for communities everywhere. From the original Native American inhabitants to the miners and ranchers of the valley’s early days, from the Union Pacific engineers who built the world’s first chairlift to those who challenge themselves in its mountains and rivers today, Sun Valley is about history and tradition, grit and perseverance, well-being and quality of life. The risks, assets and values of Sun Valley make it the perfect home for an institute dedicated to resilience. For more information, please visit: www.sunvalleyinstitute.org.About EnerBlü, Inc.The merging of our electrification value chain with both our automotive value chain and our advanced battery value chain creates new capability requirements that are essential to the success of business development initiatives for our partners and clients. EnerBlü provides unique business and technical support platforms to OEMs targeting the various and numerous EV markets in the United States while leveraging tremendous technical and marketing expertise for a wide range of stationary and mobile energy storage applications globally. EnerBlü offers unique technical and manufacturing capabilities as well as front line technology development in all aspects of thermal engine hybridization, DC/DC and DC/AC converter expertise, PV diesel hybrid microgrids, battery management systems and intelligent power control management technology.  The EnerBlü team passionately embraces the challenge of impacting society today with smart and clean power on a global scale.EnerBlu, Inc. also known as EnerBlü is the parent company of;EnerBlü Grid Services (EGS)EnerBlü Power Products (EPP)EnerBlü e-Transport  (EET aka SEVI)For more information, please visit www.enerblu.net.About Iteros, Inc.A software design and development firm headquartered in San Diego, CA, offers project developers, owners, and operators a scalable software platform to rapidly model, deploy, and optimize advanced energy systems, accelerating the path to a more sustainable, resilient and smarter electric grid.  For more information, please visit www.iteros.com.

Fully Functioning Microgrid Displayed At EnerBlü Grid Services & Iteros Connected ™ Microgrid Lab During 3rd Annual Sun Valley Forum On Resilience, July 5-8, 2017, Ketchum, ID.






























Fully Functioning Microgrid Displayed At EnerBlü Grid Services & Iteros Connected ™ Microgrid Lab During 3rd Annual Sun Valley Forum On Resilience, July 5-8, 2017, Ketchum, ID.

EnerBlü and Iteros will familiarize Forum guests with our innovative hybridized power generation platform and Smart Grid Energy Management Solutions to help build and spread approaches at speed and scale in support of leaders everywhere to accelerate the transformation to resilience.
RIVERSIDE, CA - 06/29/2017 (PRESS RELEASE JET) — EnerBlu, Inc. (EnerBlü) and Iteros, Inc. (Iteros) today announced that the companies will be presenting a collaborative solution for integrating and orchestrating large-scale energy storage systems and other distributed energy resources (DERs) from July 5-8, 2017, during the Sun Valley Forum in Sun Valley, ID. Together, the EnerBlu and Iteros teams will be educating Forum guests and the Sun Valley community about building energy resilience utilizing the companies’ respective hardware and software technologies in a “hands-on”  Microgrid Lab.
“Presented by the Sun Valley Institute, an organization focused on advancing resilience via policy leadership, public engagement, and targeted investments, the Sun Valley Forum brings together innovators, governments, and business leaders from around the globe to accelerate the transformation to a more prosperous, equitable, and sustainable world.” said Aimée Christensen, Executive Director of the Sun Valley Institute.
On display at the event will be EnerBlü’s Advanced Energy Storage Unit (AESU), which combines a traditional fossil fuel powered generator (like those used globally to generate power) with onboard energy storage to provide a mobile energy delivery system ideal for military, rural and commercial electrification applications.  When integrated with a genset(s), the AESU, which also has the ability to incorporate renewable energy sources (i.e., solar, PV, or wind), provides customers with dramatic reductions in both genset fuel usage and emissions while ensuring access to reliable energy when and where they need it.  Also on display during the Forum will be EnerBlü’s zero emission, Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), which is a Class 4/5 commercial model that is also produced as both a shuttle bus and as a Class A/B/C school bus. 
With the Iteros software platform, AESU owners gain access to real-time information and systemwide performance data, demand-side management capabilities, and the ability to respond to market signals and participate in ancillary services. The platform includes templated controls and code-free engineering features that reduce integration costs and provide access to valuable energy data within minutes of interconnection.
Daniel Elliott, EnerBlü’s CEO stated, “The quality of the people and their intimate level of understanding of the challenges ahead of us constitute the perfect venue to bolster the fact that transformational power generation systems and innovative clean vehicles are viable solutions that can impact tomorrow’s future today, and empower consumers to create cleaner, sustainable communities not only in the United States but also in countries that are in the process of building their infrastructure.  EnerBlü is involved in all those fronts.”   Jennifer Worrall, co-founder, President, and CEO of Iteros added, “We are thrilled for the opportunity to showcase our smart-grid enabling energy management capabilities with EnerBlu’s innovative products.”
