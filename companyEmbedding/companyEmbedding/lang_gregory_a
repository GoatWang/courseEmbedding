ITEM#: 13278442
A contemporary interpretation of a cityscape with urban appeal. This artist grade canvas has natural colored edges and is stretched using a high end spline finish. 
Artist: Gregory LangTitle: Metropolitan AfternoonProduct Type: Canvas ArtStyle: ContemporaryFormat: SquareSize: Extra LargeSubject: CityscapesOutside Dimensions: 35 inches high x 35 inches wide x 0.75 inches deepThis canvas is being custom built for you. Please allow 10 business days for the product to leave our warehouse.This canvas artwork is created individually by hand to your order. By combining the best materials, handmade methods and preservation an accurate and detailed representations of the artist's original has been developed, complete with subtle shading, color tones, and lighting. Though a more time-consuming and labor intensive method, the final result is a superb high-resolution artwork presented on the texture of natural canvas. Considered far superior to a paper print in both the visual perspective and the lasting durability, breathable cotton canvas art has remained virtually ageless over decades and centuries, as the preferred media by both the Masters and contemporary artists alike. Without the potential for fading, yellowing, and warping experienced with many poster prints This canvas artwork continues to stand the test of time. Each canvas artwork order is created from start to finish by a experienced artisans within a shop to the highest standards. Beginning with the high-resolution image from the artist's publisher, proprietary handmade methods are applied to fuse the image to artist-quality cotton canvas with multiple clear coatings of UV, moisture, and color protectants. The protectants are allowed to air dry, without applying heat, preserving the integrity of the canvas art beyond industry standards. The entire process is completed by traditional methods using hand-tools and brushes, without any mechanization. Each artwork order is carefully inspected prior to shipment to ensure customer satisfaction. The final product has been praised by both famous artists and loyal customers as closely matching the original artwork. As with a canvas original, this canvas artwork was created to provide a lifetime of beauty and pleasure.

It's a lovely picture. What does not come across online is that the yellow tones have a rather greenish cast. The reds are a dark brick shade and they are complimentary to the rest of the painting.

About the Designer

Gregory Lang 
"My cityscapes are composites from years of drafting, sketching and photographing the urban landscape. I love creating a composition and then recreating it using different methods and techniques. I particularly enjoy the impressionistic and abstract elements in my paintings as I feel these attributes allow the viewer the most freedom for interpretation."

ITEM#: 13642221
A contemporary interpretation of the city, this artist grade canvas has natural colored edges and is stretched using a high end spline finish. Each canvas is ready to hang and UV coated to prevent fading.Artist: Gregory LangTitle: Bridges and TowersProduct Type: Canvas ArtStyle: ContemporaryFormat: HorizontalSize: Extra largeSubject: CityscapesOutside dimensions: 30 inches high x 40 inches wide x 0.75 inches deepThis canvas is being custom built for you. Please allow 10 business days for the product to leave our warehouse.This canvas artwork is created individually by hand to your order. By combining the best materials, handmade methods and preservation an accurate and detailed representations of the artist's original has been developed, complete with subtle shading, color tones, and lighting. Though a more time-consuming and labor intensive method, the final result is a superb high-resolution artwork presented on the texture of natural canvas. Considered far superior to a paper print in both the visual perspective and the lasting durability, breathable cotton canvas art has remained virtually ageless over decades and centuries, as the preferred media by both the Masters and contemporary artists alike. Without the potential for fading, yellowing, and warping experienced with many poster prints This canvas artwork continues to stand the test of time. Each canvas artwork order is created from start to finish by a experienced artisans within a shop to the highest standards. Beginning with the high-resolution image from the artist's publisher, proprietary handmade methods are applied to fuse the image to artist-quality cotton canvas with multiple clear coatings of UV, moisture, and color protectants. The protectants are allowed to air dry, without applying heat, preserving the integrity of the canvas art beyond industry standards. The entire process is completed by traditional methods using hand-tools and brushes, without any mechanization. Each artwork order is carefully inspected prior to shipment to ensure customer satisfaction. The final product has been praised by both famous artists and loyal customers as closely matching the original artwork. As with a canvas original, this canvas artwork was created to provide a lifetime of beauty and pleasure.

Looks better in person!
















Verified Purchase


The colors are more vibrant in person and it looks great with our blue couch.  The only thing I don't love is that the edges of the picture are white.  I think it would have looked better if they were a tan color.  Overall we are very happy with our purchase!!

          © Gregory Lang About the ArtistGregory Lang is an American painter best known for his urban landscape paintings.  A New England native, Gregory was influenced by the region's industrial surroundings and began sketching and painting harbors, bridges and buildings at a young age. His earliest recognition in the arts came at age 9, after a storybook written and illustrated by Gregory was exhibited at the Museum of Art, Science and Industry (Museum of Discovery) of Bridgeport, Connecticut. He briefly studied painting and drawing at the Silvermine School of Art in New Canaan, Connecticut and mechanical drafting and design in secondary school. At 19, Gregory moved to Berlin, Germany to pursue studies in architecture. Arriving only fourteen months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, he was exposed to a great deal of underground, outsider art that was emerging from the East.  During this period he created architectural renderings from his travels throughout Europe and explored photography and plein air painting.  In 1993 Gregory returned to the US briefly working in New York City and eventually moving to San Francisco, California. Over the next decade Gregory worked as a fine art consultant for galleries representing established and notable artists in addition to co-founding a publishing company for emerging artists in the Bay Area.  In 2002 Gregory introduced his first series of urban abstract paintings at a solo show in San Francisco and in 2004 and 2008 signed exclusive publishing contracts with fine art and graphic industry leaders. Today, editions of his urban landscape paintings are printed and distributed to over 70 countries world-wide.
