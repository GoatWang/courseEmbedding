                        Bahia - 99 MW, Brazil
                    SunEdison RestructuringOn April 21, 2016, SunEdison Inc. (NYSE: SUNE) and certain of its domestic and international subsidiaries  voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.  TerraForm Global, Inc. (Nasdaq: GLBL) and its sister company, TerraForm Power, Inc. (Nasdaq: TERP), are NOT part of the SunEdison bankruptcy filing and have no plans to file for bankruptcy themselves. 
TerraForm Global and TerraForm Power are publicly listed companies that are separate legal entities and are traded separately on Nasdaq. The equity interests of TerraForm Global and TerraForm Power in their respective wind and solar power plants that are legally owned by their respective subsidiaries are not available to satisfy the claims of creditors of SunEdison. Accordingly, we expect that TerraForm Global's fleet of wind and solar power plants will continue to operate and continue to deliver clean electricity to its customers in Brazil, India, China, South Africa, Uruguay, Thailand, and Malaysia.                

TerraForm Global believes that it has sufficient liquidity to operate its business. Although SunEdison’s bankruptcy will present challenges, TerraForm Global expects to continue to operate in the ordinary course and to meet its financial obligations on a timely basis. In addition, TerraForm Global intends to coordinate with SunEdison so that the Company’s facilities and their operations continue to perform uninterrupted.

SunEdison has been, and is expected to continue to be, an important partner for TerraForm Global, as SunEdison affiliates provide asset management and operations and maintenance ("O&M") services to many of TerraForm Global's power plants. TerraForm Global anticipates that SunEdison will continue to provide these asset management and O&M services for TerraForm Global's power plants following the filing. In addition, TerraForm Global expects that SunEdison generally will continue to fulfill its obligations to provide corporate-level support to TerraForm Global under the Management Services Agreement between SunEdison and TerraForm Global. Even if certain of those obligations were not fulfilled, TerraForm Global expects to be able to continue operating its business pursuant to contingency plans it has been developing.

Better Buy: TerraForm Global Inc vs. 8point3 Energy Partners LP
In the battle of two yieldcos, there's only one clear winner right now.











                Travis Hoium
            

                (TMFFlushDraw)



            
            Feb 9, 2017 at 3:04PM
            
            





8point3 Energy Partners LP (NASDAQ:CAFD) and TerraForm Global Inc (NASDAQ:GLBL) were supposed to be two of the renewable energy industry's leading yieldcos. 8point3 Energy Partners was supposed to be a way for First Solar and SunPower to fund solar projects in the U.S. and TerraForm Global was central to SunEdison's growth plans abroad.
But since their launch, both yieldcos have been a disappointment for investors. 8point3 Energy Parters has plunged from a launch price of $21 per share to $13.50 as I'm writing and TerraForm Global has genuine concerns it will end up in bankruptcy. Given the current state of these companies, here's a look at which stock investors should throw out and which one they should take another look at.

Image source: Getty Images.

What's the point of a yieldco?
The point of a yieldco is to own renewable energy projects that spit off cash and pay that cash to investors in the form of a dividend. They intend to use their stock as a source of funding, along with debt, to buy projects and add to their dividends in the future.
This structure requires a relatively low dividend yield so that projects can be acquired accretively. If projects are bought with a rate of return of 8% and the company has a dividend yield of 10%, the shares issued to fund acquisitions wouldn't be additive to future dividends, they would be harmful. So, yieldcos with dividend yields over 7% have typically not been able to grow because they can't acquire products accretively.
This is the predicament 8point3 Energy Partners and TerraForm Global find themselves in. 8point3's dividend yield is a lofty 7.3% and management recently said it would only grow its dividend 12% in 2017, below the 15% growth the dividend has had since the yieldco launched. And TerraForm Global is in so much flux its dividend is suspended altogether. So, both companies have to be valued based on what they are today with little growth built in.
The worst case scenario for these yieldcos
If growth isn't likely, then we should look at the downside risk for both stocks. 8point3 Energy Partners currently has a dividend yield of 7.3% and 20.3 years of weighted average life retaining on asset contracts with offtakers. The worst that can happen, outside of the stock falling, is investors taking their dividend over the next two decades and getting no growth in the payout.
TerraForm Global is in much worse shape. It's still possible the company could be dragged into bankruptcy by SunEdison, although the likelihood of that now is small. Instead, a buyout is being discussed with Brookfield Asset Management, which could take the entire company private. But the highest offer that's been put on the table is $4.35 per share, below where shares are trading now. If TerraForm Global's range of possibilities are $0 to less than where shares trade now, with no dividend on the horizon, what is there to like about the stock?





The better yieldco today?
Given the sheer upheaval at TerraForm Global, 8point3 Energy Partners is definitely the better stock. It has a solid dividend and long contracts that will keep cash flowing in. And if the stock recovers and the dividend yield falls it could eventually be a growth stock, which would be good for the yieldco's future.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.29      Net Money Flow ($)  -108,804    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

                    TerraForm Global objective is to own high-quality clean renewable energy projects around the world and generate attractive returns for investors. Superior operations and maintenance (O&M), which is usually provided by SunEdison, is crucial to achieving these objectives.
                
                                Preventative and corrective maintenance programs operate 24/7 to ensure maximum efficiency of electricity generation. O&M plays a vital role in guaranteeing that all plants and installations continue to run long into the future and deliver secure returns from reliable and proven assets.
                            
                                Meeting the extremely demanding quality and service criteria required to succeed is supported by access to a global network of highly-specialized and experienced technical staff through SunEdison, who is best-in-class at operating and maintaining many of the world’s leading power plants. SunEdison’s three Renewable Operations Centers (ROCs), strategically located in Chennai (India), Madrid (Spain), and San Francisco (USA), continuously monitor our entire portfolio of projects around the world, 24/7.
                            
                                The network of teams in the field ensures that any issues that arise are responded to rapidly and effectively, mitigating the potential for lost production.
                            
On April 21, 2016, SunEdison Inc. (NYSE: SUNE) and certain of its domestic and international subsidiaries voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. TerraForm Global, Inc. (Nasdaq: GLBL) and its sister company, TerraForm Power, Inc. (Nasdaq: TERP), are NOT part of the SunEdison bankruptcy filing and have no plans to file for bankruptcy themselves. TerraForm Global and TerraForm Power are publicly listed companies that are separate legal entities and are traded separately on Nasdaq. TerraForm Global expects to continue to operate in the ordinary course. Importantly, TerraForm Global believes that it has sufficient liquidity to operate its business. Click HERE to learn more.
