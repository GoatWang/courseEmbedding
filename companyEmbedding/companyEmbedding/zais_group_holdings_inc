Experience.  Innovation.  Leadership.
































Company Description
ZAIS Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZAIS) is a publicly traded holding company conducting substantially all of our operations through our principal operating subsidiary, ZAIS Group, LLC (“ZAIS Group”), an investment advisory and asset management firm focused on specialized credit. ZAIS Group invests across both corporate and mortgage-related structured credit strategies. 
Since its inception in 1997, ZAIS Group has built long-term relationships with an international investor base, including public and private pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, family offices, funds of funds, sovereign wealth funds and investment advisors. 
 
Our Approach to Investing
ZAIS Group's approach to disciplined opportunistic credit investing focuses on investing in cash flowing assets and structures that offer liquidity-complexity premiums. ZAIS Group defines the liquidity-complexity premium of a particular instrument as the increased loss-adjusted yield or return relative to a more liquid, less complex instrument of similar credit risk. ZAIS Group is an active investor across a broad range of product sectors, including securitized credit and related investments. ZAIS Group’s investments have traditionally included CLOs, Non-Agency RMBS, CMBS and other credit opportunities throughout North America and Europe.  
ZAIS Group manages complexity with institutional depth of experience and expertise. Based in Red Bank, New Jersey, with an office in London, ZAIS Group employs professionals across investment management, client relations, information technology, analytics, law, compliance, risk management, finance and operations. The investment team at ZAIS Group is led by Christian Zugel, Chairman of ZAIS Group Holdings Inc. and ZAIS Group’s Founder and Chief Investment Officer.
We believe we offer several distinct competitive advantages in the specialized credit space:
1. Significant Investment Experience
ZAIS Group's senior team has, on average, over 20 years(1)  of industry experience, covering investment management, fixed income trading, research, investment banking and financial services.
2. Distinguished Investment Track Record Across Multiple Market Cycles   
Since inception, ZAIS Group has designed investment portfolios to perform well across a range of macroeconomic scenarios or capitalize on specific market opportunities.
3. Broad Credit Investment Products Platform
ZAIS Group is an active investor across a broad range of product sectors, including securitized credit and related investments. ZAIS Group’s investments have traditionally included CLO, Non-Agency RMBS, CMBS and other credit opportunities throughout North America and Europe.
4. Diverse Client Base and Product Mix   
Since our inception in 1997, ZAIS Group has built long-term relationships with an international investor base, including public and private pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, family offices, funds of funds, sovereign wealth funds and investment advisors. ZAIS Group manages assets using a range of strategies and investment vehicles, including hedge funds, separately managed accounts and structured vehicles.
ZAIS has an established track record of investing through multiple market cycles and believes that its performance across these cycles and the credit spectrum in which it invests is largely attributable to several distinguishing elements of its platform:
Disciplined Investing:
ZAIS Group maintains a disciplined approach to credit investing coupled with robust risk mitigation.
Broad Credit Expertise: 
ZAIS Group’s proficiency at evaluating every level of the capital structure, in both mortgage and corporate credit assets and related derivative securities, enables us to assess relative value effectively and deploy capital opportunistically in what we view as the most attractive investment opportunities.
Flexible Approach:
ZAIS Group’s significant infrastructure and technical experience allow us to manage various types of investment vehicles, including separate accounts, commingled funds, permanent capital vehicles and structured credit products, depending on the characteristics of the investment opportunity.
 
(1) As of March 10, 2016. Senior team members include Investment Committee and Management Advisory Committee members.

The consolidated financial statements include non-controlling interests of the members of ZAIS Group Parent, LLC ("ZGP") (the "ZGP Founder Members") which represent Class A Units of ZGP held by the ZGP Founder Members.  ZGP, a majority-owned consolidated subsidiary of ZAIS, is the sole member, and owns all of the equity, of ZAIS Group.
CONSOLIDATED GAAP RESULTS
The Company recorded GAAP net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $(5.4) million compared with a GAAP net loss of $(6.4) million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  The decrease of $1.0 million in GAAP net loss was primarily driven by a decrease in expenses of $1.1 million offset by a decrease in other income of $0.3 million.  The GAAP results include the results of funds and structured financing entities which are consolidated by the Company (the "Consolidated Funds"). 
Total expenses decreased by $1.1 million primarily due to a $2.4 million decrease in salaries, bonuses, severance and associated payroll taxes and other employee benefits due to a reduction in force that occurred in 2016, offset by a $0.8 million increase in equity compensation expense relating to a reduction in the forfeiture rate on ZGP's Class B-0 units due to lower employee turnover.  General, administrative and other expenses increased by $0.5 million primarily due to an increase of $0.7 million in the cost of research and data services borne by ZAIS Group and paid directly by ZAIS Group to vendors relating to the management of the ZAIS Managed Entities, offset by $0.2 million of expense reductions with regard to professional fees, occupancy and utilities, information systems, and travel and entertainment.
Other income decreased by $0.3 million primarily due to a decrease of $0.5 million relating to an insurance reimbursement for legal costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 which was received in 2016 and a $0.4 million decrease in net gains (losses) on Consolidated Funds' investments related to ZAIS Zephyr A-6, LP, a Consolidated Fund ("Zephyr A-6").  This was offset by a $0.6 million increase in net gain (loss) on Zephyr A-6's investment in ZAIS CLO 5, Limited, which is also a Consolidated Fund.
CONSOLIDATED NON-GAAP RESULTS
Please see the discussion of "Non-GAAP Financial Measures", including the definitions of net income (loss) (excluding Consolidating Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA, and reconciliations of such Non-GAAP financial measures to the respective GAAP net income (loss) and pre-tax GAAP net income (loss) measures for the periods discussed above at the end of this press release.
The Company's GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP measures of income (loss) may fluctuate materially depending upon the performance of ZAIS Managed Entities as well as other factors. Accordingly, the GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP measures of income (loss) in any particular period should not be expected to be indicative of future results.
LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of March 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, on an unconsolidated basis, of $25.5 million and no debt obligations.
FIRST QUARTER 2017 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  
The Company's First Quarter 2017 Supplemental Information – March 31, 2017, is available on ZAIS's website at www.zaisgroupholdings.com. To access the information, go to the "ZAIS Shareholders" section of the website. 
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
In addition to the results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial information, including net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA (and per share measures).  Net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the consolidating effects of the Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group.  Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as GAAP net income (loss), excluding consolidating effects of Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group, compensation expense related to a portion of net operating income of ZAIS Group payable to certain employees of ZAIS Group, compensation expense related to incentive income in the form of percentage interests being recorded before related incentive income is recognized, equity-based compensation, severance, taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, goodwill impairment, foreign currency and certain other non-cash and non-operating items.
The Company believes that providing investors with this non-GAAP financial information, in addition to the related GAAP measures, gives investors greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. However, because net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA are incomplete measures of the Company's financial performance and involve differences from net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, the Company's net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of the Company's financial performance.  In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.

Reports Fourth Quarter And Full Year 2016 ResultsPR NewswireMarch 24, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareRED BANK, N.J., March 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ZAIS Group Holdings, Inc. (ZAIS) ("ZAIS"), today reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016.  ZAIS conducts substantially all of its operations through ZAIS Group, LLC ("ZAIS Group").  ZAIS Group provides investment advisory and asset management services to private funds, separately managed accounts, structured vehicles and, until October 31, 2016, to ZAIS Financial Corp. ("ZFC REIT"), a publicly traded real estate investment trust (collectively, the "ZAIS Managed Entities").  References to the "Company" herein refer to ZAIS, together with (where the context requires) its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates. Michael F. Szymanski, Chief Executive Officer, said "In 2016, we produced strong investment performance for our clients across our Securitized Credit, Leveraged Finance, and Credit Trading products and platforms.  Our fourth quarter results, while positive, reflect one material non-recurring item, our receipt of an $8.0 million termination fee as a result of the termination of our investment management agreement with ZFC REIT in connection with the merger of ZFC REIT with Sutherland Asset Management Corp. ("SAM").  We believe that we are making progress with our fund raising activities as a result of our investment in business development staffing and our strong investment performance.  Our return to sustained profitability remains challenging and will depend on our success in attracting and retaining assets under management." FOURTH QUARTER 2016 HIGHLIGHTSA summary of the Company's results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are below.  All dollar amounts are presented in millions, with the exception of figures presented on a per share basis.

The Company does not intend to provide updates on any of these matters unless and until there is a definitive agreement or action by the Board of Directors with respect thereto.CONSOLIDATED GAAP RESULTSOperating Results – Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2016The Company recorded GAAP net income for the three months ended December 31, 2016 of $5.9 million compared with a GAAP net loss of $(11.8) million for the three months ended December 31, 2015.  The increase of $17.7 million in net income was driven by an increase in revenues of $11.7 million, an increase in other income of $2.0 million and a decrease in tax expense of $4.3 million, offset by an increase in expenses of $0.3 million.The $11.7 million increase in revenues was comprised of a net increase of $7.4 million in management fee income and $4.3 million in incentive income. The net increase in management fee income was primarily due to receiving an $8.0 million termination fee as a result of terminating the management agreement with ZFC REIT upon completion of the merger between ZFC REIT and SAM on October 31, 2016, partially offset by a decrease in management fee income resulting from a year-over-year reduction in average AUM.  The net increase of $4.3 million in incentive income was primarily driven by increased performance results during the three months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015 for certain funds and accounts, offset by incentive income recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2015 that was not recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2016 for certain accounts which liquidated during 2015. Read MoreThe $2.0 million increase in other income was primarily due to a $2.7 million decrease in impairment loss on goodwill relating to an impairment loss recognized in 2015 as a result of the decline in fair value of ZAIS Group which was not recognized in 2016 and a $0.2 million increase in net gain on investments as a result of gains on the Company's investments.  These amounts totaling $2.9 million are offset by $0.8 million of loss due to a change in net gain (loss) on beneficial interest that the Company's Consolidated Fund, ZAIS Zephyr A-6, LP ("Zephyr A-6"), has in ZAIS CLO 5 Limited, a structured vehicle for which a wholly owned subsidiary of ZAIS Group serves as the collateral manager.The $4.3 million decrease in tax expense was primarily the result of a full valuation allowance recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 on deferred tax assets as the Company did not project taxable income for the next several years.Operating Results – Year Ended December 31, 2016For the full year 2016, GAAP net loss was $(3.8) million compared with GAAP net loss of $(23.9) million for the full year of 2015.  The year over year decrease in the Company's net loss of $20.1 million was driven primarily by an $8.4 million increase in revenues, a $1.0 million decrease in expenses, a $10.5 million increase in other income/(loss), and a $0.2 million increase in income tax benefit. The $8.4 million increase in revenues was comprised of a net increase of $6.2 million in management fee income and $2.2 million in incentive income. The net increase in management fee income was primarily due to receiving an $8.0 million termination fee as a result of terminating the management agreement with ZFC REIT upon completion of the merger between ZFC REIT and SAM on October 31, 2016, partially offset by a decrease in management fee income resulting from a year-over-year reduction in average AUM.  The net increase of $2.2 million in incentive income was primarily driven by increased performance results during 2016 as compared to 2015 for certain funds and accounts, offset by incentive income recognized during 2015 that was not recognized during 2016 for certain accounts which liquidated during 2015 and residual incentive income received during 2015 which related to 2014 fund performance. The $1.0 million decrease in expenses was primarily due to a $4.4 million increase in compensation and benefits, a $4.8 million decrease in general, administrative and other expenses and a $0.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization.   The $4.4 million increase in compensation and benefits was primarily due to a $9.6 million increase in incentive compensation relating to the accrual for the year-end and guaranteed bonuses in 2016 and the payment of retention and sign-on bonuses during 2016.  This was offset by a $3.9 million decrease in salaries and associated payroll taxes and other employee benefits due to a reduction in force and other restructuring during 2016 and a $0.8 million decrease in equity compensation relating to an increase in the estimated forfeiture rate on ZGP Class B-0 Units.  Employee holders cancelled all outstanding ZGP Class B-0 Units on December 30, 2016 in consideration, at the election of the employee, of cash paid by ZGP or restricted stock units of the Company provided by the Company.  The $4.8 million decrease in general, administrative and other expenses was due to a $3.3 million decrease in professional fees and a $1.5 million decrease primarily related to a focused expense reduction during 2016.  The $0.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization was due to a change in the useful life assumptions for leasehold improvements in 2015.The $10.5 million increase in other income/(loss) was primarily comprised of a net increase of $7.8 million in net gain on Consolidated Funds' investments related to a Consolidated Fund, Zephyr A-6, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2015 and a $2.7 million decrease in impairment loss on goodwill relating to an impairment loss recognized in 2015 due to the decline in fair value of ZAIS Group which was not recognized in 2016. CONSOLIDATED NON-GAAP RESULTSPlease see the discussion of "Non-GAAP Financial Measures", including the definitions of net income (loss) (excluding Consolidating Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA, and reconciliations of such Non-GAAP financial measures to the respective GAAP net income (loss) and pre-tax GAAP net income (loss) measures for the periods discussed above at the end of this press release.The Company's GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP measures of income (loss) may fluctuate materially depending upon the performance of ZAIS Managed Entities as well as other factors. Accordingly, the GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP measures of income (loss) in any particular period should not be expected to be indicative of future results.LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCESAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $38.7 million and debt obligations of $1.3 million.FOURTH QUARTER 2016 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION The Company's Fourth Quarter 2016 Supplemental Information – December 31, 2016, is available on ZAIS's website at www.zaisgroupholdings.com. To access the information, go to the "ZAIS Shareholders" section of the website.USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATIONIn addition to the results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial information, including net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA (and per share measures).  Net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as GAAP net income (loss) excluding the consolidating effects of the Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group.  Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as GAAP net income (loss), excluding consolidating effects of Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group, compensation expense related to a portion of net operating income of ZAIS Group payable to certain employees of ZAIS Group, compensation expense related to incentive income in the form of percentage interests being recorded before related incentive income is recognized, equity-based compensation, severance, taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, goodwill impairment, foreign currency and certain other non-cash and non-operating items.The Company believes that providing investors with this non-GAAP financial information, in addition to the related GAAP measures, gives investors greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. However, because net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA are incomplete measures of the Company's financial performance and involve differences from net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, the Company's net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of the Company's financial performance.  In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of net income (loss) (excluding Consolidated Funds of ZAIS Group) and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.      ZAIS GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.
