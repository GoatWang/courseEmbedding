 View Additional Information


	The event will include a presentation and discussion of updated clinical data for the company's CD122-biased agonist, NKTR-214.  

	Data from two studies of NKTR-214 will be reviewed at the event, including the Phase 1 dose-escalation study of NKTR-214 in combination with nivolumab in patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer (PIVOT-02); and the Phase 1 study of monotherapy NKTR-214 in patients with advanced solid tumors (EXCEL).

	Presenters will include Dr. Adi Diab, Assistant Professor, Melanoma Medical Oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Dr. Nizar Tannir, Professor, Genitourinary Medical Oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Dr. Michael Hurwitz, Assistant Professor of Medicine (Medical Oncology) at Yale Cancer Center.

	NKTR-214 is an investigational immuno-stimulatory therapy designed to expand specific cancer-fighting CD8+ effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells directly in the tumor micro-environment and increase expression of PD-1 on these immune cells. NKTR-214 targets CD122 specific receptors found on the surface of these cancer-fighting immune cells in order to stimulate their proliferation.  In preclinical studies, treatment with NKTR-214 resulted in a rapid expansion of these cells and mobilization into the tumor micro-environment.1,2 NKTR-214 has an antibody-like dosing regimen similar to the existing checkpoint inhibitor class of approved medicines.

	For those interested in attending this event in person, please contact jsievers@nektar.com. Please RSVP in advance as seating is limited.

Nektar has a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AZN under which, the latter was granted a worldwide, exclusive, license to develop, market and sell Movantik and fixed-dose combination products.The company also has a licensing, collaboration and manufacturing agreement with Shire plc SHPG for Adynovate. It receives royalties and sales milestones related to both the drugs. Nektar has made a significant progress with its lead candidate, Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102). The candidate is currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treating adults with advanced breast cancer as well as brain metastases. A response is anticipated by the end of first-half 2017.Nektar has also initiated a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) on Onzeald, compared to the single-agent chemotherapy of physician’s choice, in patients with advanced breast cancer who shortly complain of brain metastases. Positive results from the study could support a regulatory filing in the U.S.The comapny is further developing several other candidates across important therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives and immunology. Interesting ones include NKTR-181 (phase III – chronic pain), NKTR-214 (phase I/II – solid tumor) and NKTR-358 (phase I-autoimmune disease).Successful development and commercialization of these candidates will in turn boost the company’s top line, considering the lucrative markets they are targeting.Nektar’s proprietary market products as well as the candidates currently under development are subject to stiff competition from various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.Players in PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry technology space include Biogen BIIB, Savient Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Reddy’s and Novo Nordisk among others.Nektar however heavily relies on partners for revenues.

INDIANAPOLIS and SAN FRANCISCO, July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:   LLY) and Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ:   NKTR) have announced a strategic collaboration to co-develop NKTR-358, a novel immunological therapy discovered by Nektar. NKTR-358, which achieved first human dose in Phase 1 clinical development in March of 2017, has the potential to treat a number of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory conditions. 
NKTR-358 is a potential first-in-class resolution therapeutic that may address an underlying immune system imbalance in patients with many autoimmune conditions. It targets the interleukin (IL-2) receptor complex in the body in order to stimulate proliferation of powerful inhibitory immune cells known as regulatory T cells. By activating these cells, NKTR-358 may act to bring the immune system back into balance. This could lead to a profound clinical impact and healthy organ function in autoimmune conditions. 
"We look forward to working with Nektar to study this novel approach to treating a number of autoimmune conditions," said Thomas F. Bumol, Ph.D., Senior Vice President of Biotechnology and Immunology Research at Lilly. "NKTR-358 is an exciting addition to our immunology portfolio and reinforces Lilly's commitment to sustain a flow of innovative medicines in our pipeline."
Under the terms of the agreement, Nektar will receive an initial payment of $150 million and is eligible for up to $250 million in additional development and regulatory milestones. Lilly and Nektar will co-develop NKTR-358 with Nektar responsible for completing Phase 1 clinical development. The parties will share Phase 2 development costs 75 percent Lilly and 25 percent Nektar. Nektar will have the option to participate in Phase 3 development on an indication-by-indication basis. Nektar has the opportunity to receive double-digit royalties that increase commensurate with their Phase 3 investment and product sales. Lilly will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization. Nektar will have an option to co-promote in the U.S. under certain conditions.
"We are very pleased to enter into this collaboration with Lilly as they have strong expertise in immunology and a successful track record in bringing novel therapies to market," said Howard W. Robin, Nektar's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Importantly, this agreement enables the broad development of NKTR-358 in multiple autoimmune conditions in order to achieve its full potential as a first-in-class resolution therapeutic."
This transaction is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. Subject to the closing of this transaction, Lilly expects to incur an acquired in-process research and development charge to earnings in 2017 of approximately $0.09 per share. The company's reported earnings per share guidance in 2017 is expected to be reduced by the amount of the charge. There will be no change to the company's non-GAAP earnings per share guidance as a result of this transaction.

Lilly Forward-Looking Statement
This press release contains forward-looking statements (as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) about the benefits of a strategic alliance between Lilly and Nektar Therapeutics, and the potential benefits of NKTR-358, and reflects Lilly's current beliefs.  However, as with any such undertaking, there are substantial risks and uncertainties in the process of drug development and commercialization. Among other things, there can be no guarantee that Lilly will realize the expected benefits of the collaboration, or that NKTR-358 will yield commercially successful products. For a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from Lilly's expectations, please see Lilly's most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Lilly undertakes no duty to update forward-looking statements.
Nektar Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
This press release contains forward-looking statements which can be identified by words such as: "potential," "plan," "expect," "should," "will" and similar references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding: (i) the therapeutic and commercial potential of NKTR-358; (ii) development plans related to NKTR-358; and (iii) the potential of our technology and drug candidates in our research and development pipeline.  Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others: (i) NKTR-358 is in early-stage clinical development and the risk of failure remains high and failure can unexpectedly occur; (ii) the timing of the commencement or end of clinical trials and the availability of clinical data may be delayed or unsuccessful due to many factors; (iii) patents may not issue from our patent applications for NKTR-358, patents that have issued may not be enforceable, or additional intellectual property licenses from third parties may be required; and (iv) certain other important risks and uncertainties set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 10, 2017. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

Eli Lilly will co-develop autoimmune disease therapy under $150 million deal with Nektar

Jul. 24, 2017 at 11:33 a.m. ET
by Emma Court









Nektar Therapeutics surges 10% on $150 mln Eli Lilly deal
Nektar Therapeutics  shares surged as much as 10% in premarket trade Monday after the company announced a $150 million deal with Eli Lilly & Co.  to co-develop its immunological therapy NKTR-358. The deal also includes up to $250 million in additional development and regulatory milestone payments. Eli Lilly expects an charge of about 9 cents per share to 2017 earnings, and expects to reduce its reported earnings per share guidance for 2017 by that amount. Nektar plans to complete phase 1 clinical development, after which Eli Lilly will shoulder 75% of the cost of phase 2 development, with Nektar responsible for the remaining 25%. Eli Lilly will pay for all costs of global commercialization. Nektar has the option to participate in late-stage development on an indication-by-indication basis, could receive royalties that increase depending on its phase 3 investment and product sales and will have the option to co-promote the drug in the U.S., the company said. NKTR-358 may address immune system imbalance for many kinds of autoimmune conditions, Nektar said, and the therapy had its first human dose in early-stage clinical development in March. Eli Lilly shares were not active in premarket trade on Monday. Nektar shares have surged 17.9% over the last three months, compared with a 1.5% rise in Eli Lilly shares and a 4.1% rise in the S&P 500 .

Show Your DAW Who's Boss
Take control of your DAW with the Nektar Impact LX61+ USB MIDI controller. Based on their award-winning Panorama, Nektar's Impact LX61+ uses intelligent mapping to give you hands-on control over your session immediately. Switch between Mixer, Instrument, and Preset modes for a fast workflow. The labeled faders and encoders show default instrument parameter assignments, helping you keep your eyes off your computer screen. The Impact LX61+'s 61 synth-action keys give you a smooth, precise feel, as do its pitch and mod wheels. In fact, all controls on the LX61+ - including the knobs, faders, and performance pads - feel great. 


Nektar Impact LX61+ 61-key USB MIDI Controller at a Glance:
The keyboard controller done right
Ample control capabilities
Includes Bitwig 8-Track DAW software
The keyboard controller done right
The Impact LX61+'s 61-note velocity-sensitive keyboard sports a silky synth action with medium tension. This makes it perfect for playing just about any type of part. To suit your playing style, you get four velocity curves that gradually increase in dynamics. For certain types of synth parts requiring consistent output, there are three fixed velocities. Pitch bend and modulation wheels are properly placed to your left, with the octave and transpose buttons above them.
Ample control capabilities
Nektar hit it big with their Panorama range. Now they've done it again - at a more affordable price. The streamlined Impact series of controllers offers intelligent mapping and tight integration with most popular DAWs, preset mixer and plug-in modes, transport and navigation controls, MIDI programming capabilities, and five user presets.
Includes Bitwig 8-Track DAW software
From sketching and arranging musical ideas to final mixdown and even live performance, Bitwig DAW software gives you a powerful toolset and fast workflow. The Nektar Impact LX25+ comes with Bitwig 8-Track DAW software, which features the entire collection of Bitwig Studio devices for use on up to eight project tracks with audio or MIDI. Take it from Sweetwater - when you're looking for a streamlined, distraction-free work platform, Bitwig is hard to beat.
Nektar Impact LX61+ 61-key USB MIDI Controller Features:
61-key USB MIDI controller with intelligent mapping for major DAWs
Comes pre-mapped and configured so you don't have to spend hours assigning MIDI controls
DAW integration with Bitwig Studio, Cubase, Digital Performer, Garageband, Logic Pro, Nuendo, Reason, SONAR, Studio One, FL Studio, and Reaper (includes Bitwig 8-Track)
8 performance pads (assignable Green/Orange/Yellow/Red) can easily be assigned to MIDI notes or messages
9 control faders and 8 control pots give you lots of hands-on control
Faders and encoders show default parameter assignments for easier visual navigation
Full transport controls
The Nektar Impact LX61+ is an excellent controller and a great value!

5/5

Very Nice Midi Controller


		I previously owned the Roland A800 controller and this controller is as good as that one. I like this one better because of the separate mod/pitchbend wheels. The keyboard also has the same size keys and nice velocity curves. I also like the pads alot more because they are bigger and much more sensitive. It's well built as well. Works great with SONAR. Great Buy!	

 




5/5

Nektar LX61


		I initially purchased an LX61 and LX88 as stage controllers for a MainStage 3 setup for a pop/dance band.  I was attracted to the size, weight, look, cost and features of the controllers.  I have a K&M Spider Pro stand and so the cost of the stand almost equals the cost of the keyboards!

So... what to you get for $500 retail?  More than you can imagine.  The respective feels are as good as or better than every other controller in its class.  I've tried them all and the semi-weighted action of the LX88 is more solid than any 88 key non-weighted keyboard currently available.  The same is true for the LX61, the action is very light, but still solid enough to give enough feedback to make it fun to play.  They are not the same as a $1,000 controller, but they are also not the weight or size.  If you need real piano feel or real B3 waterfall keys, these are not the choice.  But if you need sturdy, light and easy to use... this is the ticket!

Quick story... I was playing an outside wedding a few weeks ago.  The cover for the band was not adequate and the sky opened up about halfway through the reception.  The EZ-up had a leak and water poured into the LX61.  I quickly unplugged it.  As I tipped it to put it in the case, water poured out!!  I dried it out and fired it up for another wedding the next day.  There were a few oddities  (a mod wheel that was giving erratic values) but it worked.  I emailed Nektar and got a response the next day.  We exchanged a few emails and they offered to fix it or ship me the parts to fix it free of charge.  I elected to try to fix it and got the parts in a few days.  I put them in and everything is back to normal!

I've owned a lot of controllers including a Yamaha KX88, a Roland A88 and a Roland A800PRO.  These keyboards and this company have no peer.  

If the Nektar LX61+ is as good as the older LX61, I'm getting one as soon as it is available!	

 




4.5/5

Great Ergonomics


		When I first played this keyboard, the keyboard action felt very cheap, especially compared to the smooth synth action of my old Roland A800 (which died after about 6 years). But I got used to it very quickly, and now I find it's not bad at all. 

I don't love any of the velocity curves.  I'd like the default curve to be weighted even more toward the middle and higher velocities. But again, not bad.

The pads are sensitive, flexible and easy to program.

Overall construction is just solid enough to not feel cheap. It's super lightweight and very thin.

The LX61+ really shines as a controller though.  It has the most ergonomic control layout I've EVER used, and this is a big deal.

DAW and VST synth integration is really well done, too.  I use Cubase.  This is the first controller I've owned where I might actually prefer the keyboard over the mouse for some functions.  Time will tell.  

Advanced MIDI functions are all present.

Not for use in the dark.

Overall, the LX61+ gets top marks for ergonomics and offers great value for its asking price.	

 




3/5

My 1st Dedicated Controller


		Being primarily a bass player, not only is sound quality very important but also playability is equally important. That said my initial impression of the LX61 was that it was sturdy to hold and seemed well constructed. Connection and integration was very easy. Now, I also have a Yamaha S03 Synth/Controller but I have never used the controlling abilities of the S03. So, my review of the Nektar is based on no prior experience with a dedicated controller. The LX61 controlling layout is well thought out and makes sense even for me. Everything works well and I can control my DAW (CUBASE 7.5) like a pro and have to remind myself I don't have to use the mouse much if at all. The mixer is easy to call up and close, the faders are substantial and don't feel weak in my digits. The transport bar is awesome and the multi function buttons are a plus. I created a page just to learn the controller and that proved to be a great idea, so much so that when I am in songs that are in various stages of production I can blaze right thru. The Nektar is pretty easy to learn and is well worth the money but and this is where I must shift from praise to the thing that makes the Nektar a good controller instead of a great controller. The keys are weak. I would be willing to pay an additional $ for more substantial keys. I find it hard to believe they put so much thought into designing a good board and stop at okay on the keys. I must honestly say I think the key's will break of go out before anything else does.	

 




3/5

Not Bad At All


		It is a nice controller for my home studio.
Very easy to assign to Cubase 9 and VSTs.
Worth the money.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
