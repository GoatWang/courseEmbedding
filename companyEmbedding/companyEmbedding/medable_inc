                    Medable Launches Synapse                

                    JUNE 09TH, 2017                

Medable’s next generation disease management solution seeks to significantly improve health outcomes through provider and patient directed apps that track and trend patient health in real-time
 
PALO ALTO, JUNE 9— Medable Inc.–the leading app and analytics platform for healthcare–today announced the release of Synapse, the first cloud solution to enable Apple’s new CareKit Bridge APIs for real time health management on iOS.
Synapse enables healthcare organizations to seamlessly launch CareKit apps for not only their patients but now for their care teams. Synapse allows providers and patients to track and trend health in real-time, addressing the massive cost issues from poor communication, including preventable readmissions.  In addition to app creation, Synapse provides user and data management, HIPAA compliance, EMR interoperability, and outcomes analytics.  Early use cases include clinical trials, chronic disease management, and post-op care. For example, a post-operative care app for hip replacement that enables a patient to track pain medication usage, monitor for surgical site infection, track mobility metrics, and communicate with the care team, all from the comfort of the patient’s own home. 
“Too often the care delivered within the walls of hospitals is undermined by a lack of clear guidance for patients after visits,” said Dr. Michelle Longmire, Medable CEO.  “Medable’s platform, built using CareKit, allows healthcare organizations to open the door for clear and continuous care, anytime, anywhere.”
Longmire said Medable is working with leading healthcare institutions to bring its advanced technology to the forefront of patient management.
“CareKit is a powerful tool for improving health outcomes and is a practical solution for harnessing innovation to address huge, long standing problems in healthcare,” said Longmire.  “As an industry, healthcare is realizing the power of mobile as a conduit for better healthcare.”

We’ve covered Medable before, including Cerebrum and Axon, both of which make it easier to navigate Apple’s “Kit” software. Axon, for example, makes it easier to develop ResearchKit apps without ever having to write or know code.With their newest venture, Synapse, the company hopes to mitigate cost issues and readmissions from poor communication and also allow patients and their providers a chance to track their health in real time.Synapse enables healthcare organizations to seamlessly launch CareKit apps for not only their patients, but now for their care teams. Synapse allows providers and patients to track and trend health in real-time, addressing the massive cost issues from poor communication, including preventable readmissions. Medable offers the example of a post-op hip replacement patient having the ability to track pain, adherence, communicate with providers, and monitor for infection from anywhere.Synapse is HIPAA compliant and will also offer real-time analytics as well as active notifications for management of a patient population. Additionally, it reports that it will be interoperable with electronic medical records, though there’s not much detail on which ones and how.Medable’s CEO Dr. Michelle Longmire points out the benefits of her company’s product in a press release stating:“Too often the care delivered within the walls of hospitals is undermined by a lack of clear guidance for patients after visits … Medable’s platform, built using CareKit, allows healthcare organizations to open the door for clear and continuous care, anytime, anywhere.”      ADVERTISEMENT   ADVERTISEMENT  Find apps by specialty AnesthesiologyCardiologyCritical CareEmergency MedicineFamily MedicineGastroenterology appsHematologyHospitalistInfectious DiseaseInternal MedicineNephrologyNeurologyObgynOncologyOphthalmologyOrthopedic SurgeryPathologyPediatricsPhysical medicinePlastic SurgeryPsychiatryPulmonologyRadiologyRheumatologySports MedicineSurgeryToxicologyUrologyVascular  Best apps of the month Best iPhone apps Best Android apps Visit Our Forums Register / Login ADVERTISEMENT  Recent Topics EMR / EHR Forum Infinite Dose Calculator Artificial Intelligence Meets The Self Tracker In Healthmatica App Review Request: The Life Coach RVUcalcForumsMedical and Healthcare apps you want to see reviewed by iMedicalApps physiciansAsk the EditorsApple (iPhone & iPad) medical appsAndroid medical appsMedical apps for practicing PhysiciansResidency medical appsMedical Student appsMedical Specialty appsFROM MEDPAGE TODAYCombo Tx Fares Well in HIV-Positive Patients with HCV (CME/CE)Delayed Weight Loss Surgery Tied to Worse Outcomes (CME/CE)Early Post-op Hyperglycemia Tied to Increased Readmission (CME/CE)South African Child Appears to Beat HIV (CME/CE)How Well Do You Really Know MACRA?Academic Cardiologists: Who Needs Them?Morning Break: Senate Rejects Bill; GSK Retrenches; You Can Buy HappinessChoose IOLs Wisely in Certain Patients: Ophthalmology TimesAnother Physician Pleads: Stop Diagnosing TrumpMcCain Urges Bipartisan Process on Health Bill  Login or register on iMedicalApps, the registration process is free.Login on the left or click the register button below to proceed.
