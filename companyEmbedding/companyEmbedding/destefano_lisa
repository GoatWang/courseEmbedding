About Us

         Lisa Nothardt and Diane DeStefano





















Lisa Nothardt


Lisa Nothardt is a licensed Cosmetologist who has been working
exclusively in the Hair Replacement industry for more than 25 years. She began
her career training in Boston, Mass with a well renowned company, HRS (Hair
Replacement Systems).  Lisa’s intense training
led her to be the most requested stylist and top technician in a very short
time.


Relocating to California led her to a major player in the hair
replacement world near the Los Angeles/West Hollywood area where she continued
to train in advanced hair cutting techniques, training new stylists and
advancing in her career. Lisa's most inspiring moments were when she was
selected to create hairstyles for A-List celebrities. Lisa's passion for the
industry was fueled by learning more about the construction of human hair
systems, seeking the best possible quality human and synthetic hair, and
researching top quality manufactures throughout the industry.


Blending and creating the most natural look for people on and off
camera was her main focus. "Working with celebrities was most challenging
and most rewarding at the same time", Lisa claims.


Moving to Ft. Lauderdale in 1993 not only brought her closer to her
family, but also gave her the opportunity to work side by side with Charles
Alfieri, world renowned creator and patent holder of the Natural Lace Hairline.


For the next 18 years, Lisa proved her skills again and again by
leading the company in sales and service for 17 consecutive years.


Now, Lisa is the #1 Hair Replacement Technician at Hair Solutions in
Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  Her long-time
leadership and professional skills are executed every time she designs a new
system for her clientele. "Anyone can put a hair replacement on someone,
but the design and haircut must be perfect for it to look and feel like it's
really their own hair", Lisa says.


Her clients will say the same. "No one can do my hair like Lisa,
before I felt like people were always looking at me and noticing that I wore a
hair system, now I have the confidence knowing that it looks like it's growing
from my scalp." (E.R, client) 


Additionally, Lisa is a specialist in hair color. For 20 years, the
Redken color line has been her product of choice. Lisa says, “When it comes to
human Hair Replacement Systems, we need to have a color that will last and look
natural.”


Lisa currently resides in South Florida where she enjoys spending time
with her daughter, Lizett, cruising along Ft. Lauderdale beach on her Vespa and
taking long walks with her three dogs. 

Diane DeStefano



Diane DeStefano obtained
her Cosmetology license 27 years ago in New Jersey where she began her career
in Hair Replacement.  While studying at Montclair State University, Diane
worked as a hair replacement technician for JA Alternatives under the tutelage
of Jane Genesi owner of the nationally known company, JA Alternatives. 
Learning the business from the inside out allowed her to earn her title as
Manager of one of the largest and most successful hair replacement companies in
New York and New Jersey.  During the course of her career, Diane travelled
all over the USA doing stage work at International Beauty Expo’s in
major cities including Chicago, Long Beach, Sacramento, New Orleans, Miami, New
York, Dallas, Nashville and Boston.  Diane was exposed to the most
innovative hair replacement techniques and intense, advanced Hair cutting
classes.  Her training from Jingles international NYC was “the most
challenging and exciting training class I ever attended”.


Shortly after earning her
Bachelor’s degree in English and Journalism, Diane was promoted to Operations
Manager and exceeded sales and service quotas for more than 6 years. 
Diane has been in the position to train and mentor stylists in New York and New
Jersey and now in South Florida.


A move to South Florida
brought Diane to Charles Alfieri Studios where she further honed her skills in
the art of expertly tailoring and customizing Hair Replacement Systems. Trained
by Charles Alfieri, Diane was able to enhance her resume by adding seven years
of providing expert handling of clients in south Florida. Her desire to make
people feel comfortable in their personal decision to improve their appearance
as well as her long-time experience is what separates her from the competition.


 “I believe this is
such a personal choice when a client wishes to improve their appearance by
adding hair. They deserve to have a compassionate approach while making that
decision. Once they feel comfortable with me, they will feel even more
comfortable with themselves,” Diane says.


Watching the
transformation of thinning hair to a natural looking full head of hair is what
motivates Diane. Providing the best possible solution by listening to the
client’s request and then choosing the most appropriate style based on the
person’s age, lifestyle and personality are all considered when designing the
perfect look. 


“From the initial
consultation to the completion of the service, it is my main goal to achieve
not only the right look, but to restore someone’s confidence that may have been
lost due thinning hair. Adding a little hair can make all the difference in
someone’s life and it is my responsibility to help them regain that confident
feeling,” Diane says.


Diane lives in South
Florida with her husband, Santo, and their two daughters.  During her time
outside of the salon, Diane enjoys cooking, reading and spending time with her
family.
