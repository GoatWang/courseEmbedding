Apollo Management’s quest to buy amusement park company Cedar Fair has turned into a rather unpleasant roller-coaster ride thanks to a little-known Texas hedge fund. 
  Q Investments, a $2.5 billion hedge fund founded by former Bass family investor Geoffrey Raynor, holds a 17 percent stake in Cedar Fair and has demanded that Apollo sweeten its $2.4 billion offer or take a hike. 
  Raynor’s demand for a higher offer has thrown a wrench into what was a friendly deal, signed off on by Cedar Fair’s management. Apollo in December offered $11.50 a share for the Ohio-based company, whose 18-park assets include Knott’s Berry Farm in California. Shareholders are set to vote on the deal March 16. 
  While shareholders demanding higher takeover offers is nothing new, Q’s ability to get into the middle of Apollo’s deal has surprised many, including the people at Apollo, sources familiar with the matter said. 
  “It’s a funny situation,” a banker said. “It’s David vs. Goliath, and Apollo is the establishment.” 
  Matters have been made more complicated by mutual-fund company Neuberger Berman siding with Q on the deal. Neuberger holds a 10 percent stake in Cedar Fair, and combined the two dissident shareholders hold a 27 percent stake, posing a big threat to Apollo getting the two-thirds investor support it needs to approve the deal. 
  Sources familiar with the matter said Apollo could win over the dissidents if it raised its offer to around $16 a share, but a person close to the parties said getting to that price would be tough. 
  “There is not a lot of wiggle room,” this person said. “The numbers are pretty tight [now to reach the expected return].” 
  What’s more, sources said financially struggling Cedar Fair is expected to report earnings today that won’t justify a higher offer. 
  Neuberger, Q and Apollo all declined to comment. 
  Apollo, the $50 billion private-equity titan founded by Leon Black, is the latest big fish taken on by Raynor. Q currently has three lawsuits pending against billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn involving Federal-Mogul and XO Communications.

Geoffrey Raynor

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Geoffrey Vincent Raynor FRS[1] (2 October 1913 – 20 October 1983) was an English metallurgist and university academic.
Life[edit]
Raynor was educated at Nottingham High School before studying Chemistry at Keble College, Oxford, obtaining a first-class degree in 1936.[2] He then worked as a research assistant at the University of Oxford, working with William Hume-Rothery, and carried out metallurgical research for the Ministry of Supply and Ministry of Aircraft Production during the Second World War.[3] In 1945, he moved to the University of Birmingham as a research fellow, with the course that he taught in structural and theoretical metallurgy becoming "the forerunner for the development of metallurgical teaching all over the world".[3] He was made Reader of Theoretical Metallurgy in 1947 and Professor of Metal Physics in 1949. He was the Feeney Professor of Physical Metallurgy from 1955 to 1969, and was also head of the Department of Physical Metallurgy and Science of Materials during this latter period. He also served the university as Dean of the Faculty of Science and Engineering and then Deputy Principal for four years. He retired from the university in 1981, and was made an Emeritus Professor.[3]
Raynor was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1959[1] and a Fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1961; he was made an Honorary Fellow of Keble in 1972. He was a visiting professor at various times at Chicago University, Ohio State University, Witwatersrand University, and the University of New South Wales.[2]
The Times said of him that his research gained "international acclaim" and that he had "played a leading part in the development of the chemistry of alloy phases", with his contributions to the subject "likely to be included in the teaching of metallurgy and to be of practical value for many decades."[3]
