Jana Targets Juniper, Plans to Close Nirvana to New Investors


					January 24, 2014

					 
                    
				



Barry Rosenstein’s Jana Partners has
    identified a new activist target—Juniper Networks, a
    provider of telecom networking infrastructure products and
    services.

     

    The New York City-based hedge fund firm
    says in its year-end letter sent to clients that it has already
    engaged the company "on the multiple avenues" it believes could
    unlock shareholder value. The firm says it is attracted to the
    company’s "undemanding valuation, the tailwind of
    a favorable telecom spending cycle on required network upgrades
    a frustrated shareholder base and the potential for a change of
    perspective and sense of urgency from new CEO 
    Shaygan 
    Khereadpir."

     
In the letter, Jana also told clients it plans to
    close its Nirvana Fund to new investors on or around April
    1. In addition, it said it may close Jana Partners to new
    investors "sometime in the future, depending on the
    opportunity set."

     
Jana is not the first activist to move in on
    Juniper.

     

    We reported on January 14 that Paul
    Singer’s Elliott Management disclosed a 6.2
    percent stake in the company and sent a 27-page presentation to
    the board of directors laying out how it would unlock value.
    The plan includes cutting costs, buying back $3.5 
    million  of stock
    and undertaking a "review" of the security and switching
    businesses. Elliott said these moves could boost the stock
    price to $35 to $40 per share.

     
On Thursday, Juniper reported revenues that came in
    above consensus analyst forecasts.

    In the letter, Jana also disclosed new
    positions in  Equinix, Airbus and Cameron
    International.

     

    In fact, it seemed to hint of a possible
    activist campaign down the road against Cameron, a provider of
    fluid control products to the energy sector. In the letter Jana
    says management has taken several steps to "rationalize" its
    portfolio, but adds "there remains still more portfolio pruning
    to be done" and that asset sales, balance sheet capacity
    and future free cash flow "provide considerable powder for even
    more share repurchases."
In 2013, Jana Master Fund posted a 20.4 percent gain
    compared with 32.4 percent for the S&P 500.

     

    In the letter Rosenstein laments a
    number of missed opportunities amid a bull market whose
    ferocity he admits took him by surprise. He admits he
    "under-sized" some large winners so he could wait for lower
    prices that never came; exited too early from
    other  winners that overshot
    Jana’s target price; and passed on some activist
    situations that were on its radar because management took
    actions to drive returns or other activists beat Jana to the
    opportunity.

     

    Its largest gains came from 
    Groupon, Energy
    Transfer Equity and Liberty Ventures.

    As we reported several weeks ago, all
    five of its new activist positions in 2013 were
    successful—Ashland, Oil States International, Safeway,
    QEP Resources andOuterwall.
Jana Nirvana Fund, L.P. generated a 31.8 percent
    return last year while Jana Nirvana Offshore Fund, Ltd. gained
    31.4 percent.

     

    The Nirvana Fund is starting 2014 with
    $3.9 billion. Altogether  Jana has about $7
    billion under management.

     

    Nirvana was launched in April 2007 to
    co-invest in select ideas of Jana Master Fund in a more concentrated
    portfolio. The fund has fewer positions, and each position is 1½ times or more the size in Jana
    Master.

     
In 2013, its long portfolio generated a 60 percent
    gross return.

HedgeZ Fund Profile
































JANA Nirvana Offshore Fund,
Ltd.

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        JANA Partners LLC follows a value-oriented, event driven investment strategy focusing on companies considering or implementing strategic change.  Every investment must be fundamentally undervalued on the long side or overvalued on the short side and be involved in an extraordinary corporate transaction which acts as a catalyst to drive the price toward a valuation target. In select circumstances, where the team perceives significant underlying value and where management is unwilling to act to realize that value for shareholders, it may pursue a corporate activist strategy to bring about such action.

FIGURES ARE FOR JANA NIRVANA OFFSHORE FUND, LTD. PERFORMANCE IS QUOTED NET OF ALL CLASS A FEES AND EXPENSES. 2014 PERFORMANCE NUMBERS ARE ESTIMATED. 2009 PERFORMANCE REFLECTS A REDUCED INCENTIVE LLOCATION/FEE. INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS' EXPERIENCE MAY VARY DEPENDING ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: THE TIMING OF SUBSCRIPTIONS AND REDEMPTIONS; DIFFERING FEE STRUCTURES; AND DIFFERING TAX TREATMENT.
