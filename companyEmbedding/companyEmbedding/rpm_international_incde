                            Current Dividend
                        



A Dividend Record Few Can Match
With a 43-year track record of continuously increasing cash dividend, RPM joins only 44 of more than 19,000 publicly traded U.S. companies (less than three tenths of one percent) that have paid a higher annual cash dividend for this period of time or longer, according to the Mergent Handbook of Dividend Achievers.
Dividend Growth Drives Total Return
In an era of extremely low interest rates on savings account and other interest-bearing investment options, RPM's dividend yield, coupled with the stock price appreciation possible in a growing business, make RPM attractive to both institutional and individual investors.  Since beginning its focus on an annually growing dividend in 1973, RPM has grown from $25 million in annual sales to more than $4 billion, while delivering $1.9 billion in after-tax capital to its shareholders through its cash dividend program.

History[edit]
In May 1947, Frank C. Sullivan founded Republic Powdered Metals, the forerunner to RPM International Inc. The company manufactured and sold a heavy-duty aluminum roof coating called Alumanation, which is still sold today. Sales in the first year reached $90,000. From the beginning Sullivan determined that the success of the business would rest with its people. “Hire the best people you can find,” he said. “Create an atmosphere that will keep them. Then, let them do their jobs.” RPM operates under this same philosophy today. Every year under his leadership, the company attained sales and earnings increases.[8]
In August 1971, Frank Sullivan died suddenly. Later that same year, RPM, Inc. was formed to become a holding company to develop a more aggressive acquisition program in a rapidly consolidating paint and coatings industry. Frank’s son, Thomas C. Sullivan, who was previously president of Republic Powdered Metals, became chairman and chief executive officer of the holding company. He and James A. Karman, who was elected president and chief operating officer in 1978, led RPM for more than three decades.[8]
After more than 30 years at the company’s helm, Sullivan and Karman retired as executive officers of the company in 2002. During their tenure, net sales increased to $2 billion from $11 million, net income increased to $101.6 million from $0.6 million, cash dividends per share increased to $0.50 from $0.0035 (split-adjusted), and a $1,000 investment in RPM shares in 1971 would have been worth more than $100,000.[9]
Tom was succeeded by his son, Frank C. Sullivan, who became president and chief executive officer in 2002. He has continued to lead the company in a manner consistent with the legacy created by his father and grandfather before him. RPM’s strategy for growth remains to: establish and maintain brand leadership in the markets it serves, strike a balance between industrial and consumer markets, generate growth both organically and through acquisitions, and to maintain an entrepreneurial operating culture.
Recent legal problems[edit]
In August 2013, RPM paid $61 million to settle U.S. General Services Administration claims regarding a subsidiary's overcharging the U.S. government on roofing contracts.[10]
In June 2014, the SEC launched an investigation into the timing of RPM’s disclosure and accrual of loss reserves involving the GSA settlement. The company subsequently restated its results for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2013. The restatements had no impact on its audited results for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013.[11]
On September 9, 2016, the SEC charged RPM and its general counsel, Edward W. Moore, with violating antifraud provisions of Federal securities laws by failing to disclose a material loss. According to the SEC's complaint Moore did not inform RPM's CEO, CFO, audit committee and independent auditors of material facts about the U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the GSA issue.[12] The company believes the allegations are without merit and intends to defend itself in court.[13]

History[edit]
In May 1947, Frank C. Sullivan founded Republic Powdered Metals, the forerunner to RPM International Inc. The company manufactured and sold a heavy-duty aluminum roof coating called Alumanation, which is still sold today. Sales in the first year reached $90,000. From the beginning Sullivan determined that the success of the business would rest with its people. “Hire the best people you can find,” he said. “Create an atmosphere that will keep them. Then, let them do their jobs.” RPM operates under this same philosophy today. Every year under his leadership, the company attained sales and earnings increases.[8]
In August 1971, Frank Sullivan died suddenly. Later that same year, RPM, Inc. was formed to become a holding company to develop a more aggressive acquisition program in a rapidly consolidating paint and coatings industry. Frank’s son, Thomas C. Sullivan, who was previously president of Republic Powdered Metals, became chairman and chief executive officer of the holding company. He and James A. Karman, who was elected president and chief operating officer in 1978, led RPM for more than three decades.[8]
After more than 30 years at the company’s helm, Sullivan and Karman retired as executive officers of the company in 2002. During their tenure, net sales increased to $2 billion from $11 million, net income increased to $101.6 million from $0.6 million, cash dividends per share increased to $0.50 from $0.0035 (split-adjusted), and a $1,000 investment in RPM shares in 1971 would have been worth more than $100,000.[9]
Tom was succeeded by his son, Frank C. Sullivan, who became president and chief executive officer in 2002. He has continued to lead the company in a manner consistent with the legacy created by his father and grandfather before him. RPM’s strategy for growth remains to: establish and maintain brand leadership in the markets it serves, strike a balance between industrial and consumer markets, generate growth both organically and through acquisitions, and to maintain an entrepreneurial operating culture.
Recent legal problems[edit]
In August 2013, RPM paid $61 million to settle U.S. General Services Administration claims regarding a subsidiary's overcharging the U.S. government on roofing contracts.[10]
In June 2014, the SEC launched an investigation into the timing of RPM’s disclosure and accrual of loss reserves involving the GSA settlement. The company subsequently restated its results for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2013. The restatements had no impact on its audited results for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013.[11]
On September 9, 2016, the SEC charged RPM and its general counsel, Edward W. Moore, with violating antifraud provisions of Federal securities laws by failing to disclose a material loss. According to the SEC's complaint Moore did not inform RPM's CEO, CFO, audit committee and independent auditors of material facts about the U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the GSA issue.[12] The company believes the allegations are without merit and intends to defend itself in court.[13]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
