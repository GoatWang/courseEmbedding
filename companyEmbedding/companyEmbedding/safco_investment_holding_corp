	a one-for-one hundred (1-for-100) reverse stock split whereby every one hundred (100) shares of the Company’s common stock,
	$0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), shall be converted into one (1) share of Common Stock. The filing
	of the Amendment followed (i) the approval by the Company’s stockholders holding a majority of the Common Stock by unanimous
	written consent in lieu of a special meeting of shareholders of an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation
	to effect a reverse stock split of its Common Stock, at a ratio of 1-for-100and (ii) the approval by the Company’s

	No
	fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who otherwise would be
	entitled to receive a fractional share in connection with the reverse stock split will receive one whole share
	of common stock by virtue of rounding up such fractional share to the next highest whole share.




	 




	The
	Company’s transfer agent is acting as exchange agent for the reverse stock split and will send instructions
	to stockholders of record regarding the exchange of certificates for common stock.




	 





	Increase
	in Authorized Shares






	 




	On December 16,
	2016, the Company, filed the Amendment to increase the total authorized stock which the Company shall have the authority to issue
	from one hundred million (100,000,000) to two hundred million (200,000,000) shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share.

	Effective
	December 16, 2016, the Company, acting pursuant to authority received on December 14, 2016, by unanimous written consent in lieu
	of a special meeting of the Board and the approval by the Company’s stockholders holding a majority of the Common Stock
	by unanimous written consent in lieu of a special meeting of shareholders, filed the Amendment with the Secretary of State of

	Safco Investment Corp




	June
	30, 2016 and 2015




	Notes
	to the Condensed Financial Statements




	(unaudited)




	 







	Note
	1 - Organization and Operations





	 




	Safco
	Investment Corp (formerly “ACE Consulting Management, Inc.” or the “Company”) was incorporated on September
	19, 2003 under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company engages in consulting to corporations to improve growth strategies,
	performance enhancement and maximization of shareholder value.





	 





	Our
	objective is to become a leader of small to medium sized business-consulting services. Our business strategy for accomplishing
	this objective includes attracting and retaining outstanding professionals on an as-needed basis, develop long-term client relationships,
	enhancing and extending our service offerings and building our corporate image. Our mission is to bridge U.S. and Chinese businesses
	in various fields to grow our consulting business. Our motto is to deliver reliable service and to provide value to our clients.



	 



	We
	look to assist Chinese companies in utilizing U.S. knowhow and technology in order to enhance their local competitiveness in China.  Likewise,
	we seek to enhance the global competitiveness of Chinese and American firms seeking to establish a presence overseas.




	 




	Meanwhile,
	we have not generated meaningful revenues and our limited assets consist solely of cash.




	 




	The
	unaudited condensed financial statements of the Company for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared
	in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for
	interim financial information, applied on a consistent basis, and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and
	the requirements of Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
	“Securities Act”) . Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for
	complete audited financial statements. However, the information included in these financial statements reflects all
	adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments), which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the
	fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and the results of operations. Results shown for interim periods
	are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for a full fiscal year or any future annual or interim period.
	The balance sheet information as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited financial statements as of and for the
	year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 14, 2016. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with
	that report.




	 





	Note
	2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies





	 




	The
	Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness
	of accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important
	to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult, subjective,
	or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
	The Company’s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted
	accounting principles.




	 






	Management
	Estimates






	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant
	estimates reflected in the financial statements include, but are not limited to, valuation of deferred tax asset and share-based
	compensation costs. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates. Actual results could differ from those
	estimates.

	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments






	 




	The
	Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to
	measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for
	disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
	in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value
	measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37
	establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
	(3) broad levels. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:




	 








	Level
	1




	 




	Quoted
	market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.






	 




	 




	 






	Level
	2




	 





	Pricing
	inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as
	of the reporting date.







	 




	 




	 






	Level
	3




	 




	Pricing
	inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.







	 




	Financial
	assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
	similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.




	 




	The
	fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
	more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
	measurement of the instrument.




	 




	The
	carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their
	fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.




	 




	Transactions
	involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
	free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the
	related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
	representations can be substantiated.




	 






	Revenue
	Recognition






	 




	The
	Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will
	recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned
	when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped
	or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is
	reasonably assured. The Company derived no revenue during six months periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.




	 






	Stock-Based
	Compensation






	 




	The
	Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in capital raising transactions, for services
	and for financing costs. The Company accounts for share-based payments under the guidance as set forth in the Share-Based Payment
	Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for
	all share-based payment awards made to employees, officers, directors, and consultants, including employee stock options, based
	on estimated fair values. The Company estimates the fair value of share-based payment awards to employees and directors on the
	date of grant using an option-pricing model, and the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is
	recognized as expense over the required service period in the Company's Statements of Operations. The Company accounts for stock
	option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance where the value of
	the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment
	is reached, or b) the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Stock-based compensation
	is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time
	of grant and revised, as necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.




	  











	 



	7



	 







	 





	 





	The
	fair value of the Company’s stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing
	model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options
	or warrants, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton
	Option Pricing model, and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could
	materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.





	 






	Income
	Taxes






	 




	The
	Company uses an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes that allows recognition and
	measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and
	liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
	of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance
	is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to
	realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and/or
	penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.




	 






	Net
	Income (Loss) per Common Share






	 




	Basic
	earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average
	number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net
	income (loss) applicable to Common Stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of
	additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common shares had been issued, using the treasury
	stock method. Potential common shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive.




	 




	There
	were no potentially outstanding dilutive common shares for the reporting period ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.




	  






	Recently
	Issued Accounting Pronouncements






	 




	In
	May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,

	Revenue from
	Contracts with Customers

	. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing
	revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition.
	ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in
	the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and
	cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from
	costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
	15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
	therein. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of
	the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company’s financial statements
	and disclosures.




	 




	In
	August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,

	Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability
	to Continue as a Going Concern

	, which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties
	in the financial statements. ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability
	to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.  An entity must provide certain
	disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.  ASU
	2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted.
	The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company’s financial statements and disclosures.

	February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02,

	Leases

	. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to
	record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12
	months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption
	is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at,
	or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical
	expedients available. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company’s financial statements
	and disclosures.

	In
	January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
	Liabilities.  The new guidance will impact the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value
	option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. All equity investments in unconsolidated entities
	(other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) will generally be measured at fair value with changes in
	fair value recognized through earnings. There will no longer be an available-for-sale classification for equity securities
	with readily determinable fair values in which changes in fair value are currently reported in other comprehensive income. 
	In addition, the FASB clarified the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on
	available-for-sale debt securities.  In general, the new guidance will require modified retrospective application to all
	outstanding instruments, with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings. This guidance will be
	effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on our financial statements and related disclosures.




	 




	In
	March 2016, the FASB issued the ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
	Payment Accounting. The amendments in this ASU require, among other things, that all income tax effects of awards be recognized
	in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The ASU also allows for an employer to repurchase more of an employee's
	shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and allows for a policy election
	to account for forfeitures as they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
	2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual
	period. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and related
	disclosures.




	  





	Note
	3 - Going Concern





	 




	These
	financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its
	assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. As reflected in the
	financial statements, the Company had a stockholders deficit of $53,751 at June 30, 2016, and incurred a net loss of $19,543
	and used cash in operating activities of $17,103 for the reporting period then ended. These and other factors raise
	substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company's independent
	certified public accounting firm in its report to the December 31, 2015 financial statements has raised substantial doubt
	about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
	might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 




	 




	The
	Company is attempting to generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support
	its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenue and in its ability to raise
	additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent
	upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds.

	4 - Related Party Transactions





	 






	Advances
	from Shareholder






	 




	From
	time to time, a shareholder of the Company advance funds to the Company for working capital purpose. Those advances are unsecured,
	non-interest bearing and due on demand.




	 




	As
	of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance of amounts advanced by a stockholder to the Company, used for working capital
	purposes, amounted to $54,880 and $39,218, respectively.




	 






	Free
	Office Space






	 




	The
	Company has been provided office space by an officer of the Company at no cost. The management determined that such cost is nominal
	and did not recognize the rent expense in its financial statements.

	Item

	Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.







	 





	The
	information set forth in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of  Operations (“MD&A”)
	contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
	amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
	including, among others (i) expected changes in our revenue and profitability, (ii) prospective business opportunities and (iii)
	our strategy for financing our business. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements
	of current condition. Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of terms such as “believes”, “anticipates”,
	“intends” or “expects”. These forward-looking statements relate to our plans, liquidity, ability to complete
	financing and purchase capital expenditures, growth of our business including entering into future agreements with companies,
	and plans to successfully develop and obtain approval to market our product. We have based these forward-looking statements largely
	on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial
	condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs.






	 






	Although
	we believe that our expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the
	bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections,
	the inclusion of forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report should not be regarded as a representation by us
	or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved.





	 





	We
	assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions
	affecting forward-looking statements.





	 





	Our
	revenues and results of operations could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result
	of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the risk of significant natural disaster, the inability of
	our company to insure against certain risks, inflationary and deflationary conditions and cycles, currency exchange rates, and
	changing government regulations domestically and internationally affecting our products and businesses.






	 






	You
	should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes attached hereto, and
	the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.

	Business
	Overview





	 




	We
	are a business consulting firm that applies our services to a broad range of clients that will enable companies to effectively
	increase profitability as well as advance the development of their businesses. We provide advice for clients involved in many
	matters and general corporate strategies.




	 




	We
	derive revenues principally from professional services rendered by our employee. In most instances, we charge clients on a time-and-materials
	basis and recognize revenues in the period when we provide our services. We charge consultants’ time at hourly rates and
	on a per project basis. However, in the future, as we retain the services of additional outside employee consultants with differing
	skills, our hourly rates may vary from consultant to consultant depending on a consultant’s position, experience and expertise,
	and other factors. Outside experts will not bill clients directly for their services, all of the billing will be done through
	our office. As a result, we will generate substantially all of our own professional services fees from the work of our own full-time
	consultants. Factors that affect our professional services fees include the number and scope of client engagements, the number
	of consultants employed by us, the consultants’ billing rates, and the number of hours worked by the consultants.




	  




	On
	July 30, 2014, the Company, the former majority shareholders of the Company (the “Sellers”) and certain buyers (the
	“Purchasers”) entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), whereby the Purchasers
	purchased from the Sellers, 29,316,924 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company, representing approximately
	90% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of $500,000 (the “Purchase Price”).
	As of the date hereof, $300,000 has been paid and the balance to pay before December 31, 2016 or sooner at a mutually agreed date. 




	 




	In
	connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, on July 30, 2014, Alex Jen submitted to the Company a resignation letter pursuant
	to which he resigned as the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company effectively immediately.
	He remains as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, Gary A. Tickel resigned from the Board of Directors
	of the Company. Mr. Jen’s and Mr. Tickel’s resignations were not a result of any disagreements relating to the Company’s
	operations, policies or practices.




	 




	On
	July 30, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company accepted the resignations of Mr. Jen and Mr. Tickel and appointed Henry Lee
	to serve as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Board of Directors.




	 




	On
	September 30, 2014, we filed an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to change the Company’s name to Safco Investment
	Holding Corp., and to increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock to 100,000,000 shares of common stock; $0.001
	par value and 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock S0.001 par value.




	 




	Our

	We
	look to assist Chinese companies in utilizing U.S. knowhow and technology in order to enhance their local competitiveness in China.  Likewise,

	of Operation





	 




	We
	have commenced limited operations and will require additional capital to recruit personnel to operate business and to implement
	our business plan.

	On November 10, 2010, we entered into
	a business consultant agreement with Shanghai Tongao Investment Consulting Co, Ltd. for general business advisory services. The
	term of the agreement is for a period of two years, which can be cancelled by either party on a 30-day written notice to the other
	party. The compensation for this agreement shall be paid at the rate of $80/hour for work performed in accordance with this agreement.
	However, we shall be paid at least $12,000 per year regardless of the amount of time spent in accordance with this agreement. The
	business consultant agreement with Shanghai Tongao Investment Consulting Co, Ltd. has expired.







	 




	On
	August 30, 2011, we terminated the service agreements with Beijing Poly Design Ltd. and Shanghai Gaogo Design and Construction
	Ltd. due to the change of business environment in China which has caused difficulties to us in conducting businesses contemplated
	under these service agreements in reasonable profit margin. Subsequently, we made a strategic decision to no longer provide services
	to clients in connection with the food processing industry.




	   




	On
	December 2, 2011 we entered into a business consultant agreement with Vivid Spa Corp. Vivid Spa Corp is a company specializing
	in health care, specifically skin care and massage therapy, located in Los Angeles, California. We assist Vivid Spa with its selection
	and export of U.S. made essential oils and aroma therapy products. We also provide consulting assistance regarding opening Spa
	facilities in Shanghai & Beijing and regarding introducing U.S. made products - including essential oils and aroma formula
	therapies - in China. During this engagement, we provide a site analysis and rent comparison study for select locations in Shanghai
	and Beijing. We also provide Vivid Spa Corp. analysis for licensing the business and obtaining permits for local facilities and
	outdoor signage in China. Consulting services has included container and airfreight shipping options, customs duties, and advice
	on clearing customs and product inspections upon arrival in China as well as providing market data on pricing, on brand positioning,
	and on customer acquisition.




	 




	In
	the next 12 months if we are unable to satisfy our cash requirements, our major shareholders have indicated that they are willing
	to loan additional funds to the Company to cover any shortfalls, although there is no written agreement or guarantee.




	 




	We
	plan to raise funds through equity financing in the next 12 months. If we successfully raise the funds, it will be used for our
	operations and to invest in potential joint venture or acquisition.




	  





	Results
	of Operation





	 





	For
	the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015





	 




	For
	the three months ended June 30, 2016, we generated no revenue as compared to no revenue for the same period ended June 30, 2015.




	 




	Expenses
	for the three months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $9,140 resulting in a net loss of $9,962. Expenses for the three months ended
	June 30, 2016 consisted of $194 in general and administrative expenses and $8,946 in professional fees. In comparison, expenses
	for the same period ended June 30, 2015 totaled $9,157 resulting in a net loss of $9,157. Expenses for the period ended June 30,
	2015 consisted of $104 in general and administrative expenses and $9,053 in professional fees. The slight decrease in the expenses
	for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was a result of slight decrease in professional fees offset by slight increase
	in general and administrative expenses.

	For
	the six months ended June 30, 2016, we generated no revenue as compared to no revenue for the same period ended June 30, 2015.




	 




	Expenses
	for the six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $18,721 resulting in a net loss of $19,543. Expenses for the six months ended June

	the same period ended June 30, 2015 totaled $20,379 resulting in a net loss of $20,379. Expenses for the six months ended June
	30, 2015 consisted of $182 in general and administrative expenses and $20,197 in professional fees. The decrease in the expenses
	for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was a result of a decrease in professional expenses offset by slight increase
	in general and administrative expenses.




	  







	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	The
	following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the
	six months ended June 30, 2016:




	 





	 


	 


	For the six months

	ended 

	June 30,

	2016


	 




	Net Cash (Used in) Operating Activities


	 


	$


	(17,103


	)




	Net Cash (Used in) Investing Activities


	 


	$


	-


	 




	Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities


	 


	$


	15,662


	 






	 




	For
	the six months ended June 30, 2016, the net cash used in operating activities was $17,103. For the six months ended June 30, 2016,
	the net cash used in investing activities was $0. The net cash provided by financing activities was $15,662 for the six months
	ended June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, we had $8,776 cash on hand. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital
	investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan. If continued funding and capital
	resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able to implement its plan of operations.




	 




	As
	reflected in the accompanying condensed financial statements, we have minimal operations and had stockholders’ deficit
	at June 30, 2016. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company
	to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital and implement our business plan. In
	addition, the Company’s independent certified public accounting firm in its report to the December 31, 2015 financial
	statements raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The
	financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going
	concern.




	 




	Management
	believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity
	for the Company to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to satisfy our cash requirements, our major shareholders have
	indicated their willingness to provide additional funds to the Company to cover any shortfalls, however, no written agreement
	or guarantee exists to this effect.




	 





	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Estimates






	 






	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments

	 



	 




	The
	Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to
	measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for
	disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
	in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value
	measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37
	establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three
	(3) broad levels. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:






	 








	Level
	1





	 





	Quoted
	market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.






	 








	 



	13



	 







	 




	 








	Level
	2





	 






	Pricing
	inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as
	of the reporting date.








	 




	 




	 







	Level
	3





	 





	Pricing
	inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.









	 






	Financial
	assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or
	similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.




	 




	The
	fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within
	more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
	measurement of the instrument.




	 




	The
	carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their
	fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.




	 




	Transactions
	involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
	free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the
	related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
	representations can be substantiated.




	 




	Revenue
	Recognition

	 



	 




	The
	Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will
	recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned
	when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped
	or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is
	reasonably assured.






	 








	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements




	 



	In
	May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,

	Revenue from
	Contracts with Customers

	. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing
	revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition.
	ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in
	the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and
	cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from
	costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December
	15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
	therein. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of
	the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company’s financial statements
	and disclosures.

	In
	June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-12,

	Compensation – Stock Compensation

	. The pronouncement
	was issued to clarify the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could
	be achieved after the requisite service period. The pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December
	15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 will not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position
	or results of operations.




	 




	In
	August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,

	Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability
	to Continue as a Going Concern

	, which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties
	in the financial statements. ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability
	to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.  An entity must provide certain
	disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.  ASU
	2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted.
	The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company’s financial statements and disclosures.




	 




	In
	February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02,

	Leases

	. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to
	record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12
	months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption

	Disclosure
	controls and procedures





	 




	Pursuant
	to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), the Company carried out an evaluation,
	with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)
	and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) (the Company’s principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness
	of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end
	of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s
	disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of June 30, 2016 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
	the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
	within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
	to the Company’s management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
	required disclosure for the reason described below.




	 




	Because
	of our limited operations, we have limited number of employees which prohibits a segregation of duties. In addition, we lack a
	formal audit committee with a financial expert. As we grow and expand our operations we will engage additional employees and experts
	as needed. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will expand.




	   





	Changes
	in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting





	 




	There
	were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have
	materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	(a)

	(b)





	Any
	fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The information set forth in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") contains certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, among others (i) expected changes in our revenue and profitability, (ii) prospective business opportunities and (iii) our strategy for financing our business. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition. Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of terms such as "believes", "anticipates", "intends" or "expects". These forward-looking statements relate to our plans, liquidity, ability to complete financing and purchase capital expenditures, growth of our business including entering into future agreements with companies, and plans to successfully develop and obtain approval to market our product. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs.  Although we believe that our expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections, the inclusion of forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved.  We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting forward-looking statements.  Our revenues and results of operations could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the risk of significant natural disaster, the inability of our company to insure against certain risks, inflationary and deflationary conditions and cycles, currency exchange rates, and changing government regulations domestically and internationally affecting our products and businesses.  You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes attached hereto, and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.  US Dollars are denoted herein by "USD", "$" and "dollars".  Business Overview  We are a business consulting firm that applies our services to a broad range of clients that will enable companies to effectively increase profitability as well as advance the development of their businesses. We provide advice for clients involved in many matters and general corporate strategies.  We derive revenues principally from professional services rendered by our employee. In most instances, we charge clients on a time-and-materials basis and recognize revenues in the period when we provide our services. We charge consultants' time at hourly rates and on a per project basis. However, in the future, as we retain the services of additional outside employee consultants with differing skills, our hourly rates may vary from consultant to consultant depending on a consultant's position, experience and expertise, and other factors. Outside experts will not bill clients directly for their services, all of the billing will be done through our office. As a result, we will generate substantially all of our own professional services fees from the work of our own full-time consultants. Factors that affect our professional services fees include the number and scope of client engagements, the number of consultants employed by us, the consultants' billing rates, and the number of hours worked by the consultants.  On July 30, 2014, the Company, the former majority shareholders of the Company (the "Sellers") and certain buyers (the "Purchasers") entered into a stock purchase agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), whereby the Purchasers purchased from the Sellers, 29,316,924 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company, representing approximately 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of $500,000 (the "Purchase Price"). As of the date hereof, $300,000 has been paid and the balance to pay before December 31, 2016 or sooner at a mutually agreed date.  In connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, on July 30, 2014, Alex Jen submitted to the Company a resignation letter pursuant to which he resigned as the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company effectively immediately. He remains as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. In addition, Gary A. Tickel resigned from the Board of Directors of the Company. Mr. Jen's and Mr. Tickel's resignations were not a result of any disagreements relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices.  On July 30, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company accepted the resignations of Mr. Jen and Mr. Tickel and appointed Henry Lee to serve as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Board of Directors.  On September 30, 2014, we filed an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to change the Company's name to Safco Investment Holding Corp., and to increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock to 100,000,000 shares of common stock; $0.001 par value and 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock S0.001 par value.  Our objective is to become a leader of small to medium sized business-consulting services. Our business strategy for accomplishing this objective includes attracting and retaining outstanding professionals on an as-needed basis, develop long-term client relationships, enhancing and extending our service offerings and building our corporate image. Our mission is to bridge U.S. and Chinese businesses in various fields to grow our consulting business. Our motto is to deliver reliable service and to provide value to our clients.  We look to assist Chinese companies in utilizing U.S. knowhow and technology in order to enhance their local competitiveness in China. Likewise, we seek to enhance the global competitiveness of Chinese and American firms seeking to establish a presence overseas.  Plan of Operation  We have commenced limited operations and will require additional capital to recruit personnel to operate business and to implement our business plan.  Our objective is to become a leader of small to medium sized business-consulting services. Our business strategy for accomplishing this objective includes attracting and retaining outstanding professionals on an as-needed basis, develop long-term client relationships, enhancing and extending our service offerings and building our corporate image. Our mission is to bridge U.S. and Chinese businesses in various fields to grow our consulting business. Our motto is to deliver reliable service and to provide value to our clients.  We look to assist Chinese companies in utilizing U.S. knowhow and technology in order to enhance their local competitiveness in China. Likewise, we seek to enhance the global competitiveness of Chinese and American firms seeking to establish a presence overseas.  Our current business is generated through referrals. We plan to initiate marketing efforts through a variety of venues for our future business including trade associations, chambers of commerce and alumni associations.  We seek to become a bridge between China and the U.S., with our business background and extensive knowledge we can assist China companies to acquire U.S. technology or equipment to facilitate and implement their existing business in China.  On November 10, 2010, we entered into a business consultant agreement with Shanghai Tongao Investment Consulting Co, Ltd. for general business advisory services. The term of the agreement is for a period of two years, which can be cancelled by either party on a 30-day written notice to the other party. The compensation for this agreement shall be paid at the rate of $80/hour for work performed in accordance with this agreement. However, we shall be paid at least $12,000 per year regardless of the amount of time spent in accordance with this agreement. The business consultant agreement with Shanghai Tongao Investment Consulting Co, Ltd. has expired.  On August 30, 2011, we terminated the service agreements with Beijing Poly Design Ltd. and Shanghai Gaogo Design and Construction Ltd. due to the change of business environment in China which has caused difficulties to us in conducting businesses contemplated under these service agreements in reasonable profit margin. Subsequently, we made a strategic decision to no longer provide services to clients in connection with the food processing industry.  On December 2, 2011 we entered into a business consultant agreement with Vivid Spa Corp. Vivid Spa Corp is a company specializing in health care, specifically skin care and massage therapy, located in Los Angeles, California. We assist Vivid Spa with its selection and export of U.S. made essential oils and aroma therapy products. We also provide consulting assistance regarding opening Spa facilities in Shanghai & Beijing and regarding introducing U.S. made products - including essential oils and aroma formula therapies - in China. During this engagement, we provide a site analysis and rent comparison study for select locations in Shanghai and Beijing. We also provide Vivid Spa Corp. analysis for licensing the business and obtaining permits for local facilities and outdoor signage in China. Consulting services has included container and airfreight shipping options, customs duties, and advice on clearing customs and product inspections upon arrival in China as well as providing market data on pricing, on brand positioning, and on customer acquisition.  In the next 12 months if we are unable to satisfy our cash requirements, our major shareholders have indicated that they are willing to loan additional funds to the Company to cover any shortfalls, although there is no written agreement or guarantee.  We plan to raise funds through equity financing in the next 12 months. If we successfully raise the funds, it will be used for our operations and to invest in potential joint venture or acquisition.  Results of Operation  For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015  For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we generated no revenue as compared to no revenue for the same period ended June 30, 2015.  Expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $9,140 resulting in a net loss of $9,962. Expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 consisted of $194 in general and administrative expenses and $8,946 in professional fees. In comparison, expenses for the same period ended June 30, 2015 totaled $9,157 resulting in a net loss of $9,157. Expenses for the period ended June 30, 2015 consisted of $104 in general and administrative expenses and $9,053 in professional fees. The slight decrease in the expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was a result of slight decrease in professional fees offset by slight increase in general and administrative expenses.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015  For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we generated no revenue as compared to no revenue for the same period ended June 30, 2015.  Expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $18,721 resulting in a net loss of $19,543. Expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 consisted of $304 in general and administrative expenses and $18,417 in professional fees. In comparison, expenses for the same period ended June 30, 2015 totaled $20,379 resulting in a net loss of $20,379. Expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2015 consisted of $182 in general and administrative expenses and $20,197 in professional fees. The decrease in the expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was a result of a decrease in professional expenses offset by slight increase in general and administrative expenses.  Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016: For the six months ended June 30, 2016 Net Cash (Used in) Operating Activities $ (17,103 ) Net Cash (Used in) Investing Activities $ - Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities $ 15,662  For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the net cash used in operating activities was $17,103. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the net cash used in investing activities was $0. The net cash provided by financing activities was $15,662 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, we had $8,776 cash on hand. The Company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, the Company may not be able to implement its plan of operations.  As reflected in the accompanying condensed financial statements, we have minimal operations and had stockholders' deficit at June 30, 2016. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital and implement our business plan. In addition, the Company's independent certified public accounting firm in its report to the December 31, 2015 financial statements raised substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.  Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to satisfy our cash requirements, our major shareholders have indicated their willingness to provide additional funds to the Company to cover any shortfalls, however, no written agreement or guarantee exists to this effect.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("Paragraph 820-10-35-37") to measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:  Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.  Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.  Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.  The carrying amounts of the Company's financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.  Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.  Revenue Recognition  The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.  In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-12, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The pronouncement was issued to clarify the accounting for share-based payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 will not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.  In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangement  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangement.  Aug 19, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
