	Aware,
	Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and 2016






	Financial
	Results











	BEDFORD, MASS. – February 7, 2017
	–

	Aware, Inc. (NASDAQ: AWRE), a leading supplier of biometrics software and services, today reported financial results
	for its quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.


	 


	Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016
	was $3.9 million compared to $6.9 million in the same quarter last year. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $0.6
	million compared to $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $0.5 million, or $0.02
	per diluted share, which compares to $1.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago.


	 


	The decrease in revenue and operating income
	in the current three month period compared to the corresponding period last year was primarily due a strong revenue quarter in
	the prior year period. Fourth quarter 2015 revenue included: i) $1.1 million from a U.S. government hardware sale; ii) $1.1 million
	from two biometrics software license sales for commercial applications; and iii) $0.9 million from a large medical imaging license
	sale versus $0.2 million in the current period. The resulting decline in operating income was partially offset by $0.6 million
	of patent related income from an unaffiliated third party in the current period.


	 


	Revenue for the year ended December 31,
	2016 was $21.6 million compared to $19.6 million in 2015. Operating income for 2016 was $5.9 million compared to $3.9 million in
	2015. The increase in revenue and operating income in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to higher license revenue for biometrics and imaging
	software products. Higher biometrics product license sales were driven by three large sales to: i) the United States Marine Corps
	(“USMC”), ii) the United States Navy (“Navy”), and iii) a systems integrator for a U.S. government end
	user customer. Higher imaging product license sales were related to a $4.5 million license sale in 2015 that we recognized over
	the period October 2015 to October 2016. Operating income in the current year also included $0.8 million of patent related income
	from an unaffiliated third party with whom we have a patent arrangement.

	Net income for the year ended December
	31, 2016 was $4.1 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, which compared to net income of $4.6 million, or $0.20 per diluted share
	in 2015. Net income in 2015 included a $1.9 million income tax benefit related to the reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions
	we had established on federal research and development credits. The reserve was no longer required after the completion of an IRS
	examination in July 2015. Net income in 2015 would have been lower by $1.9 million were it not for the tax reserve reversal.


	 



	In April
	2016, we announced a stock repurchase plan to purchase up to $10 million of our common stock. We repurchased 263,379 shares of
	common stock under this program for a total cost of $1.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016. Since the program
	commenced in April 2016, we have repurchased 690,801 shares for a total cost of $3.7 million. Cash and investments were $52.9 million
	as of December 31, 2016.



	 


	Rick Moberg, Aware’s co-chief executive
	officer and chief financial officer, said “2016 was a year of strong financial performance for the Company. The business
	generated about $4.5 million of cash of which we used $3.7 million to repurchase stock. Looking forward, we are focused on growing
	the government, commercial, and mobile parts of our business.”
