THL Credit, Inc. Declares Dividend, Payable on June 30, 2017; Reports Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 4 17
THL Credit, Inc.’s board of directors declared a dividend of $0.27 per share payable on June 30, 2017 to stockholders of record at the date of business on June 15, 2017.

The company reported consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported total investment income of $19,804,000 against $22,572,000 a year ago. The decrease in investment income between the three month periods was primarily due to the contraction in overall investment portfolio since March 31, 2016, which led to lower interest income, and additional loans that were put on non-accrual status or were restructured into non-income producing securities. This decrease was offset primarily by an increase in dividend income related to the Logan JV. Net investment income was $9,686,000 against $13,398,000 a year ago. The decrease in net investment income between the three month periods is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest on debt investments and a higher incentive fee. This was offset by lower base management fees and an increase in dividend income related to the Logan JV. Net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $5,253,000 against $1,000 a year ago. Basic and diluted net investment income per common share was $0.29 against $0.40 a year ago. The increase in net assets resulting from operations for the respective periods is due primarily to net realized and unrealized losses in the portfolio.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

A MEASURED APPROACH TO GROWTH.
THL Credit was formed in 2007 as a credit affiliate of Thomas H. Lee Partners L.P., one of the world’s oldest and most experienced private equity firms.
In April 2010, we took THL Credit, Inc. (NASDAQ: TCRD) public as a separate direct lending fund, structured as a BDC. In January 2011, we raised our first private direct lending fund, THL Credit Greenway Fund LLC (Fund I). Fund I is an investment fund that invested alongside TCRD with $150 million of capital committed by affiliates of a single institutional investor.
In June 2012, we diversified our credit platform by acquiring Chicago-based McDonnell Investment Management, LLC’s Alternative Credit Strategies group, now run as THL Credit Senior Loan Strategies LLC (Tradable Credit). Our Tradable Credit investment strategy includes THL Credit Senior Loan Fund (NYSE: TSLF), a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.
In October 2013, we raised our second private direct lending fund, THL Credit Greenway Fund II LLC (Fund II) and a related separate account, which closed with $187 million in capital commitments in the aggregate. Fund II is an investment vehicle that also invested alongside TCRD, with capital committed primarily by institutional investors.
Since our inception in 2007, we have grown to $9.5 billion1 of assets under management. In 2015, we continued to expand our direct lending strategy in new fund vehicle formats and our Tradable Credit investment strategy raised 2 new CLOs and SMA assets totaling $1.5 billion.
(1) As of March 31, 2017 and includes AUM of THL Credit Advisors LLC and its consolidated subsidiary, THL Credit Senior Loan Strategies LLC as well as the assets under management of its affiliate, THL Credit, Inc., and its related funds and separate account.

          OVERVIEW        





THL Credit, Inc. (NASDAQ: TCRD) is an externally managed investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and as a regulated investment company, or RIC.
As a direct lender, TCRD provides debt (first and second lien secured loans, including unitranche investments, and mezzanine) and non-control equity (preferred and common stock, including warrants) financings to middle market private equity sponsors and companies. Since April 2010, after we completed our initial public offering and commenced principal operations, we have been responsible for making, on behalf of ourselves, managed funds and separately managed account, over approximately an aggregate of $1,878 million in commitments into 941 separate portfolio companies or investment vehicles through a combination of both initial and follow-on investments.
INVESTMENT STRATEGY
THL Credit’s investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation, primarily through privately negotiated investments in debt and equity securities of middle market companies. We define middle market companies to mean both public and privately-held companies with annual revenues of between $25 million and $500 million. We invest primarily in middle market companies that are located in North America in the form of senior secured loans, mezzanine debt and equity investments.
Our investment strategy relies on a proactive, comprehensive approach to transaction sourcing, a robust due diligence process, underwriting expertise supported by strong industry knowledge, and ongoing active portfolio management.
