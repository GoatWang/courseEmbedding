        Responsible investment Sustainability criteria are also used in the management of public funds. This is why funds managed by Deka Investment GmbH, as a matter of principle, do not invest in companies which produce anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions (“cluster bombs”). Also, DekaBank issues no products which track the price of basic foodstuffs.For private and institutional investors who particularly wish to consider ESG criteria, Deka Investment GmbH has launched a number of appropriate investment products in the last few years. The “Deka-Nachhaltigkeit” fund family currently comprises these three funds: Deka-Nachhaltigkeit Aktien, Deka-Nachhaltigkeit Renten and Deka-Nachhaltigkeit Balance. The offer also includes the asset management fund DekaSelect: Nachhaltigkeit as well as the equity fund Deka-UmweltInvest which exclusively invests in companies from the fields of climate and environmental protection, water management and renewable energy investments.At the end of 2015, DekaBank, in cooperation with the sustainability rating agency oekom research, created the  index fund Deka Oekom Euro Nachhaltigkeit UCITS ETF for institutional investors. The two funds Deka-Stiftungen Balance and Deka-Kirchen Balance, the last-mentioned created in December 2015, are also open to institutional investors. In the current foundation fund ranking of the fund advisor Fonds Consult, Deka-Stiftungen Balance has climbed to 3rd place of the overall rankings with an overall rating of “very good”. Detailed profiles of all funds can be found on the Deka website. In addition to the funds, DekaBank offers institutional investors individual investment solutions, in which the respective sustainability-related requirements and criteria are fully taken into account.Awards for the fund Deka-Nachhaltigkeit Renten demonstrate once again that sustainability criteria and good performance are not exclusive. At the end of 2016, the fund was awarded as the best fund in Germany and Austria at the FERI Awards 2017 in the category “European Pensions” and was also able to come ahead of conventional pension funds. The fund was also awarded a prize at the Austrian Lipper Fund Awards in 2016. In the explanatory statement, Lipper noted that the fund shows that sustainable investments does not rule out excellent investment results.Sustainable investments in securities in the DekaBank Depot are available from 25 euros. The fund Deka-Nachhaltigkeit Aktien is also particularly suitable for investing capital-forming benefits. From January 2017, it will be possible for customers, upon conclusion of the Deka- Zukunftsplan to choose a Riester fund savings plan in the Select version as a block of shares in the Deka-Nachhaltigkeit Aktien and as a pension unit in the Deka-Nachhaltigkeit Renten fund and thus to invest in sustainable funds in the savings phase.the retail customers area, Deka Investment GmbH managed a total of approximately 2.1 billion euro in sustainable products at the end of 2016, 8.9 per cent more than at the same time in the previous year. For institutional customers, the volume of sustainable investments at 31 Dec 2016 was around 8 billion euros. In total, the volume of sustainable investment products in Deka Investment GmbH is about 10.1 billion euros. The proportion of sustainable investment funds in the total assets under management in securities was around 3 per cent at the end of the year 2016.If one also considers the approximately 18.2 billion euros of proprietary investments in securities managed using the proprietary investment filter, the total volume of sustainably-managed investments of the Deka Group is approximately 28.3 billion euros. This corresponds to a share of over 20 per cent in the total of sustainably managed money in Germany according to the calculations of the Forum Nachhaltige Geldanlage (FNG) (136.6 billion euro, market report 2016). Here you find our sustainable products.






        UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UN-PRI) 

By signing up to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN-PRI), Deka Investment GmbH has undertaken to comply with the UN’s guidelines on environmental, social and governance issues relevant to financial markets. This includes actively incorporating these issues into shareholder policy, such as voting at shareholders’ meetings. Another element is a commitment to ensuring that the companies and entities being invested in disclose information on these matters in an appropriate way. Further information and the full text of the principles can be found at www.unpri.org.We regard sustainable behaviour as safeguarding the future. This attribute is essential to any attractive investment. We firmly believe that, in the long term, share prices and bond yields are as strongly influenced by environmental and social factors as they are by business and economic considerations.











        Exercise of voting rights and dialogue with companies In addition to the application of exclusion and positive criteria, the exercise of voting rights at annual general meetings and the direct dialogue with the companies whose shares and bonds an investor holds are other important instruments of sustainable investment. In the reporting period, analysts and fund managers of Deka Investment GmbH had about 1,600 contacts with companies. In these discussions, depending on the industry and business model of the company, social and environmental aspects of business activity are regularly addressed´in addition to corporate governance issues. Deka Investment GmbH wishes to make the voice of its 4 million fund investors heard at annual general meetings in the future. In 2016, Deka Investment took part in 229 annual general meetings, in a total of 2,930 agenda points, it voted against management proposals 559 times and abstained 83 times on agenda points. Experts from Deka Investment spoke at 5 annual general meetings.In 2017, the number of annual general meetings attended and verbal contributions will increase significantly. The intention here is that questions of good corporate governance are actively addressed in addition to issues of strategy and yield, such as basing the remuneration structure of the Board of Management on sustainable corporate development. Deka Investment has defined the central focal points for its voting behaviour in the “Principles of Voting Policy in Annual General Meetings”. These are based on the extensive experience of Deka as one of the largest fund providers and shareholder representatives. They take into account the applicable laws, the current analysis guidelines for general meetings of the BVI, the German Corporate Governance Code, the DVFA Score Card for Corporate Governance, international codes as well as the relevant environmental and social standards. The principles and an overview of annual general meetings at which Deka Investment GmbH has voted in 2016 can be found on the DekaBank website.
