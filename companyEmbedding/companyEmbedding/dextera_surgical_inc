					Full Description



Dextera Surgical Inc., formerly Cardica, Inc., incorporated on October 15, 1997, designs and manufactures stapling devices that enable the advancement of minimally invasive surgical procedures. The Company is engaged in commercializing and developing its MicroCutter 5/80 stapler based on its staple-on-a-strip technology for use by thoracic, pediatric, bariatric, colorectal and general surgeons. The Company designs, manufactures and markets automated anastomotic systems used by surgeons to perform anastomoses during on- or off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures. Its MicroCutter 5/80 is a commercially available cartridge-based microcutter device with approximately five millimeter shaft diameter, over 80 degrees of articulation, and an approximately 30 millimeter staple line cleared for specified indications for use in the United States, and in the European Union (EU) for a range of indications for use.As of June 30, 2016, the Company marketed three products to perform anastomoses, such as the C-Port xA system, the C-Port Flex A system and the PAS-Port Proximal Anastomosis System (PAS-Port system). Its C-Port Distal Anastomosis Systems (C-Port systems) are sold in the United States and Europe. It has developed C-Port xA system to use veins and arteries as the bypass graft vessel. The C-Port xA system is actuated by depressing a trigger, which activates a manifold powered by a cylinder of compressed carbon dioxide to provide smooth actuation. Its C-Port xA Distal Anastomosis System is designed to perform an end-to-side distal anastomosis by attaching the end of a bypass graft to a coronary artery downstream of an occlusion or narrowing.The C-Port Flex A system is designed to further enable minimally invasive CABG surgery. As of June 30, 2016, it had sold an aggregate of over 15,000 units of all the versions of its C-Port systems. The PAS-Port system automates the performance of a proximal anastomosis between a graft vessel, typically a saphenous vein, and the aorta. The PAS-Port system is marketed in the United States, Europe and Japan. As of June 30, 2016, over 44,500 PAS-Port systems have been sold, primarily in Japan and the United States. The Company's planned microcutter product line includes MicroCutter XCHANGE 45 and MicroCutter FLEXCHANGE 30. The Company's products minimize trauma to both the graft and target vessel during loading and deployment.The Company competes with Johnson & Johnson, Inc., Medtronic, Inc., JustRight Surgical, LLC, Stryker Endoscopy, Olympus, Vitalitec and Maquet Cardiovascular LLC.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Dextera Surgical: Innovation In Surgical Stapling Puts It On Path Towards Profitability - Dextera Surgical Inc. (NASDAQ:DXTR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Dextera Surgical: Innovation In Surgical Stapling Puts It On Path Towards ProfitabilityFeb.15.17 | About: Dextera Surgical (DXTR) Terry Trover Healthcare, long/short equitySummarySurgical stapling is a razor/razor blade business model.Proprietary stapler enables patients to leave hospital days sooner than present standard of care.Need for cash will likely trigger dilution or sale of company within next 90 days.Dextera Surgical (NASDAQ:DXTR) is a very small ($10.3M market cap) medical device manufacturer with a very interesting product roll-out that has the potential to radically alter the company's attractiveness to investors. Prior to August 2016, Dextera was previously named Vascular Innovations, Inc. and later Cardica, Inc., both money-losing entities racking up more than $210M in combined cumulative losses. Dextera is reinventing itself to be a surgical stapler manufacturer, transitioning away from being a cardiac products manufacturer. I believe Dextera has reached an inflection point. Dextera has now invented and introduced a manual surgical stapling device called MicroCutter 5/80 whose features are said to make it a preferred approach for video-assisted lung surgery, called VATS. 

According to management comments spoken during the Q2 2017 earnings conference call, lung surgery to remove tumors of the lung was traditionally practiced using an 8" open incision into the patient's chest. Open surgery traditionally utilized sutures to stop blood flow. Recovery from open surgery is long and painful, requiring a lengthy, ~7-day stay in a hospital. The modern use of video endoscopes and trocars subsequently enabled a minimally invasive surgery alternative called video-assisted thoracic surgery, or VATS, in which the surgeon utilizes an array of five 12mm+ incisions (ports) to access the lungs and perform a lobectomy, then suturing with trocars, or stapling with a 12mm stapler to stop blood flow.
 While VATS is less disruptive to the patient, it still requires a ~5-day stay in a hospital. Both alternatives, open and five-port VATS, are said to be painful with a slow recovery as the result of trauma to the patient's rib cage - connective tissue between ribs must be cut and ribs partially removed or stretched apart. Now, an even less invasive VATS procedure called "micro lobectomy" has been enabled by an innovation in surgical stapling technology. Dextera's new MicroCutter 5/80 stapler is smaller in diameter than traditional staplers, just 5mm, and articulates enough so that just a single 5mm incision between the ribs (and one below the ribs) can be now used instead of the five-incision technique. Early adopting surgeons have been able to practice MicroCutter-enabled VATS lobectomies that allow a patient to leave the hospital in a much shorter period of time, in as little as one day, with an average stay of three days. This surgeon's web site describes the surgery. So, Dextera's new stapler isn't just a cool toy, it creates economic savings for hospitals because the patient can be discharged more quickly. Obviously, patients also prefer to be discharged from the hospital quickly, and desire less pain during recovery, as seen in this video testimonial. Surgical staplers are the quintessential razor/razor blade business model. 

 One sells a stapling device to the hospital, thereafter hospitals purchase cartridges of staples in a recurring fashion. 38 surgeons in both the US and the EU are said to be utilizing Dextera's MicroCutter 5/80 now, with plans to double surgeon adoption by June 2017. Dextera has described a $250M market size for its stapling device in just the US, so I estimate ROW to be 2-3X the US market size. Dextera is presently manufacturing 80 manually controlled staplers a week to meet existing demand, which, along with 4-5 staple cartridges, have an ASP of $1,000. The company plans to increase production capacity to 120 staplers/week by the end of March 2017. One can infer by the increase in production that sales prospects are improving, as evidenced by the hiring of direct sales reps in the US and broadening distributor partnerships in the EU.
 During the most recent earning conference call, sales of the MicroCutter were projected to be $400-500K in Q3, growing to $700-800K in Q4, for a total of $1.4-1.6M in FY2017. Extrapolating its revenue growth based upon recent history and management's prediction for the remainder of this fiscal year, I've created this three-year forward looking table: 

In this projection, I've estimated revenue to increase 30% sequentially. Gross profit starts at 50% and increases as manufacturing expertise and supply chain efficiency are optimized. Further brightening future sales growth prospects, Dextera is also co-developing the use of its stapler for robotic applications with Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG). Intuitive has already provided engineering development funding to co-develop a "proof of concept", entering into agreements whereby it will manufacture its own version of the Dextera's stapler for use on the DaVinci robot, while Dextera will provide the staple cartridge. However, recurring revenue from its collaboration with Intuitive isn't imminent, according to comments made during the Q2 earnings conference call. Dextera is to receive additional non-recurring funding for the development of the staple cartridge used by the DaVinci in the next phase of the co-development project. If my revenue and margin projections are correct and SGA+R&D remain constant, Dextera should be cash flow neutral in late 2018 because it also has a legacy cardiac surgery product line (Dextera was formally named Cardica) that already contributes $.5-.6M revenue quarterly. However, given that the company presently expends ~$1M/mo for SGA+R&D, it needs to raise about $10M to defray my estimate of an additional 18 months of operating losses. Fortunately, Dextera only owes $4M in debt today, due in September 2018 (to its Japanese distributor, who incidentally feels that Dextera is presently in default). Dextera has a very limited amount of cash on hand today and will have to strengthen the balance sheet very shortly, likely within the next couple of months. For this reason, Dextera announced that it has enlisted JMP Securities to assist it with funding options. In a new development, JMP has also been asked to assist in an additional option - a potential sale of the company.
 Applying a Multiple Should JMP locate a buyer for the company, the multiple could be in the range of 7X sales based upon Covidien's 2009 acquisition of Power Medical Interventions, another surgical stapler manufacturer, for $65M (2.08/share + assumption of debt ~1.52/share). PMI had $9M in sales at the time it was acquired during the worst of the Great Recession. The link describes the purchase. Interestingly, Dextera's VP of worldwide sales and marketing was previously at PMI. Upside Sales Potential Not Forecast in the Table  Expand the use of MicroCutter's "Intended Use" beyond lung and general surgery to include liver surgery. Dextera anticipates FDA to respond to its request this quarter. This would open up sales of MicroCutter to a different surgeon population. Intuitive's introduction of MicroCutter and subsequent sales, which is unlikely before 2018. Dextera will receive an engineering purchase order to develop the stapling cartridge, which should help investors better understand when to anticipate the receipt of recurring revenue. Japan and Canada. Dextera has a distributor in Japan which must receive regulatory approval before it can sell the MicroCutter 5/80. Likewise, Dextera plans to submit the MicroCutter 5/80 to Health Canada for approvals. Both countries had previously approved predicate devices from Dextera, which may expedite regulatory approval.  Top 3 Things that Could Go Wrong in 2017  Cannot raise cash, or do so by diluting present shareholders by 50% (very possible). Quality of hemostasis (stopping blood flow) isn't adequate. Management is presently enrolling patients in a study named "MATCH" to document statistical outcomes. A larger, well-established company matches the performance of MicroCutter and sales cannot grow (if so, competitor's product development would be secretive).  Summary Dextera is expected to rapidly grow through the broadening commercialization of its MicroCutter stapling device, however, shareholders may see the stock price fall as a result of raising badly needed capital.
 I can speculate on three ways that JMP may be helping to allow Dextera to bridge the next ~18 months: 1) Raise cash with associated warrants that cause shareholder dilution; 2) sale of the Cardica product line to raise part of the cash that is required; and 3) sell the entire company, perhaps to a private equity concern that has the patience to wait until late 2018. Regardless of the funding approach management selects to enable the company to bridge the next 18 months, in my opinion, Dextera will likely be acquired before the end of 2018, perhaps sooner if it continues to execute and an acquiring company forecasts similar sales and gross margin projections for MicroCutter. Even if present shareholders are to be diluted by 50% to raise $10M in 2017, should Dextera realize a 7x trailing sales valuation by late 2018, the company could fetch $2.20 share ($39.4M/17.8M shares). As such, I consider the present stock price of ~$1.15 acceptable for an opening position in anticipation that Dextera has finally figured out how to be profitable and will be acquired as a result.

Dextera Surgical Strong MicroCutter Sales Growth Is a Positive Indicator Analysts Reports

Company Overview
Dextera Surgical Inc. (NASDAQ: DXTR) designs and manufactures products for the minimally invasive surgery market. The company’s lead product is the MicroCutter 5/80, a proprietary endoscopic stapler used in thoracic, pediatric, bariatric, colorectal, and other surgeries. The company also generates license revenue from its technology, and is co-developing a MicroCutter system with Intuitive Surgical for the da Vinci system.
Prior to 2009, Dextera focused on the design, manufacture, and marketing of proprietary automated anastomotic systems for coronary bypass surgeries. In June 2016, the company changed its name from Cardica to Dextera Surgical to reflect its shifting business model. Dextera is headquartered in Redwood City, California.
Products
The MicroCutter 5/80 is a cartridge-based stapling device with a five-millimeter shaft diameter, 80 degrees of articulation, and a 30-millimeter staple line cleared for certain specified uses in the United States, and a broader range of applications in the European Union.

Source: Company Presentation
The company’s device has several advantages over existing products. First and foremost is the shaft diameter, which at five millimeters is less than half the size of other endoscopic staplers. The MicroCutter’s 80-degree articulation (versus 45 degrees for competing devices) also provides better access to the surgical site, and the reduced anvil size minimizes high risk dissections. Dextera has received FDA 510(k) clearance to use the MicroCutter in thin tissue (white reload cartridges) and medium tissue (blue reload cartridges) for minimally invasive urologic, thoracic, and pediatric surgical procedures.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2017, the company generated revenue of $0.9 million related to the sale of MicroCutter products.
C-Port Distal Anastomosis Systems (C-Port Systems) are used for distal anastomosis, which is the connection between a bypass graft vessel and the target coronary artery. As of March 31, 2017, the company had sold more than 15,200 C-Port Systems in the United States and Europe.
PAS-Port Proximal Anastomosis Systems (PAS-Port Systems) are used for proximal anastomosis, which is the connection between a bypass graft vessel and the aorta or other source of blood. As of March 31, 2017, the company had sold more than 46,600 PAS-Port systems in the United States, Europe, and Japan.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2017, the company generated revenue of $1.2 million related to the sale of automated anastomotic systems.
Market Overview
There is a growing demand for minimally invasive surgeries, which typically involve less pain, shorter hospital stays, and quicker recovery. Furthermore, the early detection of cancer is causing surgeons and patients to seek less invasive procedures to treat smaller lesions. According to estimates provided by the company, the global market for minimally invasive surgical stapling products totals $2 billion, and is expected to grow at an annual rate of eight percent through 2024.
Of the estimated 2.5 million surgical procedures performed annually in the United States (representing approximately 40 percent of the global market), the MicroCutter could be used in 280,000 procedures. This equates to an estimated market opportunity of $380 million in the United States alone.
Recent Developments

On June 1, Dextera announced that it had filed a 510(k) with the FDA for expanded indications of use in liver, pancreas, kidney, and spleen surgery. These indications account for more than 80,000 procedures in the United States, and the company believes that the MicroCutter’s small size and increased articulation may contribute to less invasive surgeries. Surgeons in Europe are already successfully using the device for these applications.
On May 16, Dextera closed an $8 million convertible preferred stock offering. The 8,000 Series B convertible preferred shares are each convertible into 3,704 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.27 per share. The preferred shares also include warrants to purchase additional shares at an exercise price of $0.27.
In early May, Wedbush analyst Tao Levy reported that the Dextera was in active discussions with B. Braun / Aesculap regarding a strategic partnership agreement that would include global distribution of Dextera’s legacy cardiac products and expansion of the current distribution agreement for the MicroCutter in exchange for a private investment and a product development contract.

Third Quarter Earnings Review
Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, totaled $1.1 million compared with $1.9 million in the same period one year ago. The decline was primarily attributable to $1.4 million of license revenue from Intuitive Surgical recorded in the third quarter of 2016. This was partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in product sales.  MicroCutter sales totaled $0.5 million, up from $0.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter.
Operating expenses increased 14 percent from the same period one year ago to $5.5 million due to greater product costs and research and development expenses. Dextera’s net loss for the third quarter of 2017 totaled $4.5 million, or $0.50 per share.
At March 31, 2017, the company reported cash and equivalents of $2.5 million, down from $12.7 million at June 30, 2016. Dextera also listed long-term debt of $3.4 million. In its most recent quarterly report, the company estimated that its current balance was sufficient to fund operations through May 2017. As noted above, the company subsequently secured financing with gross proceeds totaling $8 million.
Stock Influences

Change in sales and adoption rates for the MicroCutter;
Further regulatory approvals for the use of the MicroCutter;
Licensing and royalty agreements for MicroCutter technology and reloadable cartridges; and
M&A Activity.

Risk Factors

The company is reliant on regulatory clearance and approval;
The company is also reliant on sales of C-Port and PAS-Port systems to generate revenue;
The company is currently producing the MicroCutter in small lots, and it may be unable to sufficiently scale up production;
The company’s stock price is volatile and subject to speculation;
The company is still burning cash, and may require additional financing in the future.

 
Stock Performance

As of June 21, 2017, Dextera closed at $0.27, yielding a market capitalization of approximately $7 million. In the past 12 months, the stock has traded as high as $2.94 (in August 2016) but has recently traded as low as $0.17. The stock received a boost in January after the company issued strong corporate guidance, but is down more than 70 percent year-to-date.
In the past year, the annualized daily volatility was 137 percent. Daily trading volume has increased significantly in the past month, averaging 6.8 million shares per day.

Summary
 
Dextera has a strong product offering in the MicroCutter and has made good progress growing sales and adoption rates. Management has temporarily decreased its projections due to a supply chain disruption, but is optimistic that sales will continue to grow in the long-term and eventually overtake its legacy cardiac business. Furthermore, the company’s co-development project with Intuitive Surgical could produce an attractive revenue stream.
 
Still, Dextera is running low on cash, and will need to secure additional financing and/or strategic partnerships (such as licensing agreements) within the next year to keep the company afloat. The company will also need to increase its manufacturing capabilities to reach its desired scale.
