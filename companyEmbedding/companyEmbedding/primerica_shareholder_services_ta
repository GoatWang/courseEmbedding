Business model
Primerica, Inc. is an insurance and financial services company that uses multi-level marketing[8] to sell financial products and services.
Headquartered in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia,[9][10] Primerica spun off from its former parent company Citi through an initial public offering on April 1, 2010. It is a financial services marketing organization in North America with approximately 116,827 independent representatives,[11][7] including 22,000 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Series 6 licensed[2] through Primerica's securities broker-dealer affiliate PFS Investments, Inc. in the United States, and through PFSL Investments Canada Ltd. in Canada. The company focuses on the sale of term life insurance,[2] as well as providing other financial products and services including mutual funds, annuities, segregated funds, managed accounts, long-term care insurance, pre-paid legal services, auto insurance, home insurance, credit monitoring and debt management plans. The company has more than 4.3 million life insurance clients and over 2 million client investment accounts.[11]
History
Founded in 1977 by Arthur L. Williams Jr. as A.L. Williams & Associates (A.L. Williams), the company established its base by mass-marketing the concept of "Buy Term and Invest the Difference."[5] With "BTID" the company illustrated how its mostly middle-income client base could purchase sufficient protection with term life insurance and systematically save and invest in separate investment vehicles, such as mutual fund Individual Retirement Accounts.[2] A.L. Williams was initially established as a privately held general agency, at first selling term life insurance policies underwritten by Financial Assurance, Inc. (FAI).
The company expanded, outgrowing the capacity of FAI to process its business. In 1980, A.L. Williams entered into a contract with Boston-based Massachusetts Indemnity and Life Insurance Company (MILICO), a larger underwriter of life insurance, whose parent was PennCorp Financial Services based in Santa Monica. To support A.L. Williams headquartered in Atlanta, MILICO established a regional office in that city. In 1981, the company established First American National Corporation (later renamed The A.L. Williams Corporation) as a holding company for First American Life Insurance (later renamed A.L. Williams Life Insurance Company) and First American National Securities (later renamed PFS Investments, Inc). In 1982, The A.L. Williams Corporation (ALWC) underwrote a public stock offering, listed in the Over the Counter (OTC) market under the symbol ALWC. In 1983, the company became listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the same symbol.
Origin of Primerica name
PennCorp's growth due to MILICO's underwriting caught the attention of Bill Woodside, Chairman & CEO of American Can Company, a former Dow Jones 30 blue chip can and container producing company based in Greenwich, Connecticut founded in 1901.[12] Due to the growing rise of plastic as a replacement for aluminum cans, the company looked to acquire financial services providers and move away from the dying manufacturing industry, having acquired life insurance holding company Associated Madison from Gerry Tsai Jr in 1982. With this acquisition Woodside created a new financial services division for American Can and hired Tsai, who succeeded him as Chairman & CEO, as the new head.
In September 1982, American Can and PennCorp signed a merger agreement.
In 1983, the merger was finalized, making American Can the parent company of PennCorp and MILICO, signing a new contract with ALWC through the year 2000. In 1986 Nelson Peltz's Triangle Industries bought American Can's packaging division, along with rights to the name of the company. Therefore, on March 6, 1987 American Can announced that it would change its 86-year-old name to Primerica Corporation,[13] hence giving birth to the new and currently recognized name "Primerica."
Acquisition by Commercial Credit
The newly named Primerica Corporation targeted Smith Barney as the first significant purchase that moved the company completely into financial services with the May 1987 announcement of its intent to buy the Wall Street brokerage for $750 million,[14] which would later end up as Primerica's sister company under Citigroup in 1998.[15]
In 1985, ALWC began the procedure to open business in Canada. After encountering legal and cultural roadblocks to expanding outside the United States, ALWC began selling insurance products of Pennsylvania Life Insurance Company, a Primerica subsidiary, in Canada in 1986.
On November 30, 1988, ALWC acquired MILICO from Primerica Corporation through a stock merger acquisition for 44.58 million shares of ALWC stock, making Primerica Corporation the majority shareholder of ALWC. In December 1988, Sanford Weill's Commercial Credit acquired Primerica Corporation for $1.54 billion, retaining the Primerica name. At this time, the major businesses under Primerica Corporation were A.L. Williams, Smith Barney and Commercial Credit. On February 6, 1989, Primerica Corporation began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Travelers and Citigroup era
In November 1989, Primerica purchased the remaining 30% of ALWC that it did not previously own and the privately held General Agent, A.L. Williams, Inc. In 1991, Primerica Corporation changed the name of A.L. Williams to Primerica Financial Services. The following year MILICO, Primerica's life insurance underwriter, changed its name to Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its broker-dealer FANS changed to PFS Investments, Inc.[15]
In December 1993, Primerica acquired the remaining 73% of Travelers Insurance Corporation and adopted the name Travelers Inc., which was changed to Travelers Group the following year.[15] Travelers Group included Primerica Financial Services, Smith Barney, Travelers Life and Annuity, Travelers Property/Casualty, Commercial Credit and other financial businesses.
Joe Plumeri was Chairman and CEO of Primerica Financial Services from 1995 to 1999.[16][17][18] In 1998, Primerica had net income of $398 million on net sales of $1.65 billion, compared to a 1994 $209 million net income on net sales of $1.28 billion.[19]
In December 1997, Primerica announced it was going to begin offering pre-paid legal through Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc., at the time both subsidiaries of Travelers Group, Inc.[20]
In 1998, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) censured and fined PFS Investments Inc., the securities arm for Primerica, for failure to properly supervise a group of registered representatives in Dearborn, Michigan. The SEC found that PFS Investments Inc. had failed to have in place effective policies and procedures to follow up adequately on three complaints received about the Dearborn registered representatives, "selling away" activities. Prior to the SEC's ruling, PFS Investments Inc. hired an independent consultant to review its supervisory and compliance policies and procedures to prevent and detect violations of the federal securities laws. By the date of the ruling, PFS Investments reported it had complied with the final recommendations made by the independent consultant.[21]
In 1998, Travelers Group and banking giant Citicorp merged creating Citigroup (NYSE: C). Primerica and its affiliates continued to operate as subsidiaries of Citigroup, although the Travelers insurance business was spun off in 2002. Along with Primerica, other major brand names under Citigroup included Citibank, CitiFinancial, Citicorp Trust Bank, Smith Barney, and Banamex.
Long-time veteran executives John Addison and Rick Williams, whom Art Williams quoted in his book Coach as "two true sons of A.L. Williams",[22] were hired as co-CEOs in 2000, with Glen Williams promoted to President in 2005.
Separation from Citi
Citigroup attempted to sell Primerica in 2008,[23] having received several bids from life insurance companies and private equity firms interested in buying.[24][25] At the time the market value of the company was estimated to be $7 billion, roughly 15 times its annual earnings[26] and Citi was trying to match various bidders in groups that could bid for the unit together. Initially, a sale to JC Flowers & Co. LLC and Protective Life Corp was underway until the deal was canceled last minute for publicly undisclosed reasons.[27]
In May 2009 the Primerica executive team led by co-CEOs John Addison and Rick Williams approached private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co. yet again, as well as Blackstone Group LP and TPG Inc [23] in a new attempt to have the company bought, a plan which Citigroup did not endorse.[28]
Initial public offering
On November 5, 2009 Citi announced that it intended to spin off Primerica through an initial public offering.[29] The Primerica executive and legal team filed an S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),[30] having officially publicly announced the intention of becoming a public company. Citi would claim all profit from the primary offering, as well as continue to receive income from a significant portion of existing Primerica business,[31] with Citi Holdings CEO Michael Corbit claiming the move to be "the best separation alternative for this franchise.[29]
Primerica filed[32] a final amended S-1 and preliminary prospectus with the SEC on March 17, 2010, indicating that it will offer 18 million shares[33] to the public through the IPO, with underwriters having the option to purchase an additional 2.7 million shares. The first trading occurred on April 1, 2010. Initially, the expected share price was in the $12 – $14 range, having ended up being priced $15 a share on March 31, 2010,[34] resulting in Citi raising 27 percent or $30 million more than $290 million projected through the IPO by selling 3.36 million more shares than the anticipated 18 million.[35] The first day of trading saw the stock surge 31 percent to end up closing at $19.65 a share.[36] In a separate offering, Private equity firm Warburg Pincus has bought 17.2 million shares, resulting in a 23 percent stake in Primerica, and up to 33 percent if Warburg decides to exercise warrants to purchase an additional 4.3 million shares from Citi. Following the IPO, Citi's stake was between 32 percent and 46 percent and expected to divest its interest in Primerica "as soon as possible"[37] to fulfill its original goal of raising cash by shedding assets to improve financial performance.
On December 19, 2011, Citigroup sold its remaining equity stake in Primerica (approximately 8 million shares of Primerica's common stock), completing the separation from Citi.[38]
Awards
Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its New York subsidiary, National Benefit Life, have received several awards from A. M. Best, Standard & Poor's and the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association (IMSA) for their financial strength, high standards and quality business.[39][40][41]
Primerica has also received awards for Customer Service.[42][43][44]

Business model
Primerica, Inc. is an insurance and financial services company that uses multi-level marketing[8] to sell financial products and services.
Headquartered in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia,[9][10] Primerica spun off from its former parent company Citi through an initial public offering on April 1, 2010. It is a financial services marketing organization in North America with approximately 116,827 independent representatives,[11][7] including 22,000 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Series 6 licensed[2] through Primerica's securities broker-dealer affiliate PFS Investments, Inc. in the United States, and through PFSL Investments Canada Ltd. in Canada. The company focuses on the sale of term life insurance,[2] as well as providing other financial products and services including mutual funds, annuities, segregated funds, managed accounts, long-term care insurance, pre-paid legal services, auto insurance, home insurance, credit monitoring and debt management plans. The company has more than 4.3 million life insurance clients and over 2 million client investment accounts.[11]
History
Founded in 1977 by Arthur L. Williams Jr. as A.L. Williams & Associates (A.L. Williams), the company established its base by mass-marketing the concept of "Buy Term and Invest the Difference."[5] With "BTID" the company illustrated how its mostly middle-income client base could purchase sufficient protection with term life insurance and systematically save and invest in separate investment vehicles, such as mutual fund Individual Retirement Accounts.[2] A.L. Williams was initially established as a privately held general agency, at first selling term life insurance policies underwritten by Financial Assurance, Inc. (FAI).
The company expanded, outgrowing the capacity of FAI to process its business. In 1980, A.L. Williams entered into a contract with Boston-based Massachusetts Indemnity and Life Insurance Company (MILICO), a larger underwriter of life insurance, whose parent was PennCorp Financial Services based in Santa Monica. To support A.L. Williams headquartered in Atlanta, MILICO established a regional office in that city. In 1981, the company established First American National Corporation (later renamed The A.L. Williams Corporation) as a holding company for First American Life Insurance (later renamed A.L. Williams Life Insurance Company) and First American National Securities (later renamed PFS Investments, Inc). In 1982, The A.L. Williams Corporation (ALWC) underwrote a public stock offering, listed in the Over the Counter (OTC) market under the symbol ALWC. In 1983, the company became listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the same symbol.
Origin of Primerica name
PennCorp's growth due to MILICO's underwriting caught the attention of Bill Woodside, Chairman & CEO of American Can Company, a former Dow Jones 30 blue chip can and container producing company based in Greenwich, Connecticut founded in 1901.[12] Due to the growing rise of plastic as a replacement for aluminum cans, the company looked to acquire financial services providers and move away from the dying manufacturing industry, having acquired life insurance holding company Associated Madison from Gerry Tsai Jr in 1982. With this acquisition Woodside created a new financial services division for American Can and hired Tsai, who succeeded him as Chairman & CEO, as the new head.
In September 1982, American Can and PennCorp signed a merger agreement.
In 1983, the merger was finalized, making American Can the parent company of PennCorp and MILICO, signing a new contract with ALWC through the year 2000. In 1986 Nelson Peltz's Triangle Industries bought American Can's packaging division, along with rights to the name of the company. Therefore, on March 6, 1987 American Can announced that it would change its 86-year-old name to Primerica Corporation,[13] hence giving birth to the new and currently recognized name "Primerica."
Acquisition by Commercial Credit
The newly named Primerica Corporation targeted Smith Barney as the first significant purchase that moved the company completely into financial services with the May 1987 announcement of its intent to buy the Wall Street brokerage for $750 million,[14] which would later end up as Primerica's sister company under Citigroup in 1998.[15]
In 1985, ALWC began the procedure to open business in Canada. After encountering legal and cultural roadblocks to expanding outside the United States, ALWC began selling insurance products of Pennsylvania Life Insurance Company, a Primerica subsidiary, in Canada in 1986.
On November 30, 1988, ALWC acquired MILICO from Primerica Corporation through a stock merger acquisition for 44.58 million shares of ALWC stock, making Primerica Corporation the majority shareholder of ALWC. In December 1988, Sanford Weill's Commercial Credit acquired Primerica Corporation for $1.54 billion, retaining the Primerica name. At this time, the major businesses under Primerica Corporation were A.L. Williams, Smith Barney and Commercial Credit. On February 6, 1989, Primerica Corporation began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Travelers and Citigroup era
In November 1989, Primerica purchased the remaining 30% of ALWC that it did not previously own and the privately held General Agent, A.L. Williams, Inc. In 1991, Primerica Corporation changed the name of A.L. Williams to Primerica Financial Services. The following year MILICO, Primerica's life insurance underwriter, changed its name to Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its broker-dealer FANS changed to PFS Investments, Inc.[15]
In December 1993, Primerica acquired the remaining 73% of Travelers Insurance Corporation and adopted the name Travelers Inc., which was changed to Travelers Group the following year.[15] Travelers Group included Primerica Financial Services, Smith Barney, Travelers Life and Annuity, Travelers Property/Casualty, Commercial Credit and other financial businesses.
Joe Plumeri was Chairman and CEO of Primerica Financial Services from 1995 to 1999.[16][17][18] In 1998, Primerica had net income of $398 million on net sales of $1.65 billion, compared to a 1994 $209 million net income on net sales of $1.28 billion.[19]
In December 1997, Primerica announced it was going to begin offering pre-paid legal through Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc., at the time both subsidiaries of Travelers Group, Inc.[20]
In 1998, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) censured and fined PFS Investments Inc., the securities arm for Primerica, for failure to properly supervise a group of registered representatives in Dearborn, Michigan. The SEC found that PFS Investments Inc. had failed to have in place effective policies and procedures to follow up adequately on three complaints received about the Dearborn registered representatives, "selling away" activities. Prior to the SEC's ruling, PFS Investments Inc. hired an independent consultant to review its supervisory and compliance policies and procedures to prevent and detect violations of the federal securities laws. By the date of the ruling, PFS Investments reported it had complied with the final recommendations made by the independent consultant.[21]
In 1998, Travelers Group and banking giant Citicorp merged creating Citigroup (NYSE: C). Primerica and its affiliates continued to operate as subsidiaries of Citigroup, although the Travelers insurance business was spun off in 2002. Along with Primerica, other major brand names under Citigroup included Citibank, CitiFinancial, Citicorp Trust Bank, Smith Barney, and Banamex.
Long-time veteran executives John Addison and Rick Williams, whom Art Williams quoted in his book Coach as "two true sons of A.L. Williams",[22] were hired as co-CEOs in 2000, with Glen Williams promoted to President in 2005.
Separation from Citi
Citigroup attempted to sell Primerica in 2008,[23] having received several bids from life insurance companies and private equity firms interested in buying.[24][25] At the time the market value of the company was estimated to be $7 billion, roughly 15 times its annual earnings[26] and Citi was trying to match various bidders in groups that could bid for the unit together. Initially, a sale to JC Flowers & Co. LLC and Protective Life Corp was underway until the deal was canceled last minute for publicly undisclosed reasons.[27]
In May 2009 the Primerica executive team led by co-CEOs John Addison and Rick Williams approached private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co. yet again, as well as Blackstone Group LP and TPG Inc [23] in a new attempt to have the company bought, a plan which Citigroup did not endorse.[28]
Initial public offering
On November 5, 2009 Citi announced that it intended to spin off Primerica through an initial public offering.[29] The Primerica executive and legal team filed an S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),[30] having officially publicly announced the intention of becoming a public company. Citi would claim all profit from the primary offering, as well as continue to receive income from a significant portion of existing Primerica business,[31] with Citi Holdings CEO Michael Corbit claiming the move to be "the best separation alternative for this franchise.[29]
Primerica filed[32] a final amended S-1 and preliminary prospectus with the SEC on March 17, 2010, indicating that it will offer 18 million shares[33] to the public through the IPO, with underwriters having the option to purchase an additional 2.7 million shares. The first trading occurred on April 1, 2010. Initially, the expected share price was in the $12 – $14 range, having ended up being priced $15 a share on March 31, 2010,[34] resulting in Citi raising 27 percent or $30 million more than $290 million projected through the IPO by selling 3.36 million more shares than the anticipated 18 million.[35] The first day of trading saw the stock surge 31 percent to end up closing at $19.65 a share.[36] In a separate offering, Private equity firm Warburg Pincus has bought 17.2 million shares, resulting in a 23 percent stake in Primerica, and up to 33 percent if Warburg decides to exercise warrants to purchase an additional 4.3 million shares from Citi. Following the IPO, Citi's stake was between 32 percent and 46 percent and expected to divest its interest in Primerica "as soon as possible"[37] to fulfill its original goal of raising cash by shedding assets to improve financial performance.
On December 19, 2011, Citigroup sold its remaining equity stake in Primerica (approximately 8 million shares of Primerica's common stock), completing the separation from Citi.[38]
Awards
Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its New York subsidiary, National Benefit Life, have received several awards from A. M. Best, Standard & Poor's and the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association (IMSA) for their financial strength, high standards and quality business.[39][40][41]
Primerica has also received awards for Customer Service.[42][43][44]

Business model
Primerica, Inc. is an insurance and financial services company that uses multi-level marketing[8] to sell financial products and services.
Headquartered in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia,[9][10] Primerica spun off from its former parent company Citi through an initial public offering on April 1, 2010. It is a financial services marketing organization in North America with approximately 116,827 independent representatives,[11][7] including 22,000 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Series 6 licensed[2] through Primerica's securities broker-dealer affiliate PFS Investments, Inc. in the United States, and through PFSL Investments Canada Ltd. in Canada. The company focuses on the sale of term life insurance,[2] as well as providing other financial products and services including mutual funds, annuities, segregated funds, managed accounts, long-term care insurance, pre-paid legal services, auto insurance, home insurance, credit monitoring and debt management plans. The company has more than 4.3 million life insurance clients and over 2 million client investment accounts.[11]

Williams), the company established its base by mass-marketing the concept of "Buy Term and Invest the Difference."[5] With "BTID" the company illustrated how its mostly middle-income client base could purchase sufficient protection with term life insurance and systematically save and invest in separate investment vehicles, such as mutual fund Individual Retirement Accounts.[2] A.L.

PennCorp's growth due to MILICO's underwriting caught the attention of Bill Woodside, Chairman & CEO of American Can Company, a former Dow Jones 30 blue chip can and container producing company based in Greenwich, Connecticut founded in 1901.[12] Due to the growing rise of plastic as a replacement for aluminum cans, the company looked to acquire financial services providers and move away from the dying manufacturing industry, having acquired life insurance holding company Associated Madison from Gerry Tsai Jr in 1982. With this acquisition Woodside created a new financial services division for American Can and hired Tsai, who succeeded him as Chairman & CEO, as the new head.
In September 1982, American Can and PennCorp signed a merger agreement.
In 1983, the merger was finalized, making American Can the parent company of PennCorp and MILICO, signing a new contract with ALWC through the year 2000. In 1986 Nelson Peltz's Triangle Industries bought American Can's packaging division, along with rights to the name of the company. Therefore, on March 6, 1987 American Can announced that it would change its 86-year-old name to Primerica Corporation,[13] hence giving birth to the new and currently recognized name "Primerica."
Acquisition by Commercial Credit
The newly named Primerica Corporation targeted Smith Barney as the first significant purchase that moved the company completely into financial services with the May 1987 announcement of its intent to buy the Wall Street brokerage for $750 million,[14] which would later end up as Primerica's sister company under Citigroup in 1998.[15]
In 1985, ALWC began the procedure to open business in Canada. After encountering legal and cultural roadblocks to expanding outside the United States, ALWC began selling insurance products of Pennsylvania Life Insurance Company, a Primerica subsidiary, in Canada in 1986.
On November 30, 1988, ALWC acquired MILICO from Primerica Corporation through a stock merger acquisition for 44.58 million shares of ALWC stock, making Primerica Corporation the majority shareholder of ALWC. In December 1988, Sanford Weill's Commercial Credit acquired Primerica Corporation for $1.54 billion, retaining the Primerica name. At this time, the major businesses under Primerica Corporation were A.L. Williams, Smith Barney and Commercial Credit. On February 6, 1989, Primerica Corporation began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Travelers and Citigroup era
In November 1989, Primerica purchased the remaining 30% of ALWC that it did not previously own and the privately held General Agent, A.L. Williams, Inc. In 1991, Primerica Corporation changed the name of A.L. Williams to Primerica Financial Services. The following year MILICO, Primerica's life insurance underwriter, changed its name to Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its broker-dealer FANS changed to PFS Investments, Inc.[15]
In December 1993, Primerica acquired the remaining 73% of Travelers Insurance Corporation and adopted the name Travelers Inc., which was changed to Travelers Group the following year.[15] Travelers Group included Primerica Financial Services, Smith Barney, Travelers Life and Annuity, Travelers Property/Casualty, Commercial Credit and other financial businesses.
Joe Plumeri was Chairman and CEO of Primerica Financial Services from 1995 to 1999.[16][17][18] In 1998, Primerica had net income of $398 million on net sales of $1.65 billion, compared to a 1994 $209 million net income on net sales of $1.28 billion.[19]
In December 1997, Primerica announced it was going to begin offering pre-paid legal through Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc., at the time both subsidiaries of Travelers Group, Inc.[20]
In 1998, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) censured and fined PFS Investments Inc., the securities arm for Primerica, for failure to properly supervise a group of registered representatives in Dearborn, Michigan. The SEC found that PFS Investments Inc. had failed to have in place effective policies and procedures to follow up adequately on three complaints received about the Dearborn registered representatives, "selling away" activities. Prior to the SEC's ruling, PFS Investments Inc. hired an independent consultant to review its supervisory and compliance policies and procedures to prevent and detect violations of the federal securities laws. By the date of the ruling, PFS Investments reported it had complied with the final recommendations made by the independent consultant.[21]
In 1998, Travelers Group and banking giant Citicorp merged creating Citigroup (NYSE: C). Primerica and its affiliates continued to operate as subsidiaries of Citigroup, although the Travelers insurance business was spun off in 2002. Along with Primerica, other major brand names under Citigroup included Citibank, CitiFinancial, Citicorp Trust Bank, Smith Barney, and Banamex.
Long-time veteran executives John Addison and Rick Williams, whom Art Williams quoted in his book Coach as "two true sons of A.L. Williams",[22] were hired as co-CEOs in 2000, with Glen Williams promoted to President in 2005.
Separation from Citi
Citigroup attempted to sell Primerica in 2008,[23] having received several bids from life insurance companies and private equity firms interested in buying.[24][25] At the time the market value of the company was estimated to be $7 billion, roughly 15 times its annual earnings[26] and Citi was trying to match various bidders in groups that could bid for the unit together. Initially, a sale to JC Flowers & Co. LLC and Protective Life Corp was underway until the deal was canceled last minute for publicly undisclosed reasons.[27]
In May 2009 the Primerica executive team led by co-CEOs John Addison and Rick Williams approached private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co. yet again, as well as Blackstone Group LP and TPG Inc [23] in a new attempt to have the company bought, a plan which Citigroup did not endorse.[28]
Initial public offering
On November 5, 2009 Citi announced that it intended to spin off Primerica through an initial public offering.[29] The Primerica executive and legal team filed an S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),[30] having officially publicly announced the intention of becoming a public company. Citi would claim all profit from the primary offering, as well as continue to receive income from a significant portion of existing Primerica business,[31] with Citi Holdings CEO Michael Corbit claiming the move to be "the best separation alternative for this franchise.[29]
Primerica filed[32] a final amended S-1 and preliminary prospectus with the SEC on March 17, 2010, indicating that it will offer 18 million shares[33] to the public through the IPO, with underwriters having the option to purchase an additional 2.7 million shares. The first trading occurred on April 1, 2010. Initially, the expected share price was in the $12 – $14 range, having ended up being priced $15 a share on March 31, 2010,[34] resulting in Citi raising 27 percent or $30 million more than $290 million projected through the IPO by selling 3.36 million more shares than the anticipated 18 million.[35] The first day of trading saw the stock surge 31 percent to end up closing at $19.65 a share.[36] In a separate offering, Private equity firm Warburg Pincus has bought 17.2 million shares, resulting in a 23 percent stake in Primerica, and up to 33 percent if Warburg decides to exercise warrants to purchase an additional 4.3 million shares from Citi. Following the IPO, Citi's stake was between 32 percent and 46 percent and expected to divest its interest in Primerica "as soon as possible"[37] to fulfill its original goal of raising cash by shedding assets to improve financial performance.
On December 19, 2011, Citigroup sold its remaining equity stake in Primerica (approximately 8 million shares of Primerica's common stock), completing the separation from Citi.[38]
Awards
Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its New York subsidiary, National Benefit Life, have received several awards from A. M. Best, Standard & Poor's and the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association (IMSA) for their financial strength, high standards and quality business.[39][40][41]
Primerica has also received awards for Customer Service.[42][43][44]

Business model
Primerica, Inc. is an insurance and financial services company that uses multi-level marketing[8] to sell financial products and services.
Headquartered in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia,[9][10] Primerica spun off from its former parent company Citi through an initial public offering on April 1, 2010. It is a financial services marketing organization in North America with approximately 116,827 independent representatives,[11][7] including 22,000 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Series 6 licensed[2] through Primerica's securities broker-dealer affiliate PFS Investments, Inc. in the United States, and through PFSL Investments Canada Ltd. in Canada. The company focuses on the sale of term life insurance,[2] as well as providing other financial products and services including mutual funds, annuities, segregated funds, managed accounts, long-term care insurance, pre-paid legal services, auto insurance, home insurance, credit monitoring and debt management plans. The company has more than 4.3 million life insurance clients and over 2 million client investment accounts.[11]
History
Founded in 1977 by Arthur L. Williams Jr. as A.L. Williams & Associates (A.L. Williams), the company established its base by mass-marketing the concept of "Buy Term and Invest the Difference."[5] With "BTID" the company illustrated how its mostly middle-income client base could purchase sufficient protection with term life insurance and systematically save and invest in separate investment vehicles, such as mutual fund Individual Retirement Accounts.[2] A.L. Williams was initially established as a privately held general agency, at first selling term life insurance policies underwritten by Financial Assurance, Inc. (FAI).
The company expanded, outgrowing the capacity of FAI to process its business. In 1980, A.L. Williams entered into a contract with Boston-based Massachusetts Indemnity and Life Insurance Company (MILICO), a larger underwriter of life insurance, whose parent was PennCorp Financial Services based in Santa Monica. To support A.L. Williams headquartered in Atlanta, MILICO established a regional office in that city. In 1981, the company established First American National Corporation (later renamed The A.L. Williams Corporation) as a holding company for First American Life Insurance (later renamed A.L. Williams Life Insurance Company) and First American National Securities (later renamed PFS Investments, Inc). In 1982, The A.L. Williams Corporation (ALWC) underwrote a public stock offering, listed in the Over the Counter (OTC) market under the symbol ALWC. In 1983, the company became listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the same symbol.
Origin of Primerica name
PennCorp's growth due to MILICO's underwriting caught the attention of Bill Woodside, Chairman & CEO of American Can Company, a former Dow Jones 30 blue chip can and container producing company based in Greenwich, Connecticut founded in 1901.[12] Due to the growing rise of plastic as a replacement for aluminum cans, the company looked to acquire financial services providers and move away from the dying manufacturing industry, having acquired life insurance holding company Associated Madison from Gerry Tsai Jr in 1982. With this acquisition Woodside created a new financial services division for American Can and hired Tsai, who succeeded him as Chairman & CEO, as the new head.
In September 1982, American Can and PennCorp signed a merger agreement.
In 1983, the merger was finalized, making American Can the parent company of PennCorp and MILICO, signing a new contract with ALWC through the year 2000. In 1986 Nelson Peltz's Triangle Industries bought American Can's packaging division, along with rights to the name of the company. Therefore, on March 6, 1987 American Can announced that it would change its 86-year-old name to Primerica Corporation,[13] hence giving birth to the new and currently recognized name "Primerica."
Acquisition by Commercial Credit
The newly named Primerica Corporation targeted Smith Barney as the first significant purchase that moved the company completely into financial services with the May 1987 announcement of its intent to buy the Wall Street brokerage for $750 million,[14] which would later end up as Primerica's sister company under Citigroup in 1998.[15]
In 1985, ALWC began the procedure to open business in Canada. After encountering legal and cultural roadblocks to expanding outside the United States, ALWC began selling insurance products of Pennsylvania Life Insurance Company, a Primerica subsidiary, in Canada in 1986.
On November 30, 1988, ALWC acquired MILICO from Primerica Corporation through a stock merger acquisition for 44.58 million shares of ALWC stock, making Primerica Corporation the majority shareholder of ALWC. In December 1988, Sanford Weill's Commercial Credit acquired Primerica Corporation for $1.54 billion, retaining the Primerica name. At this time, the major businesses under Primerica Corporation were A.L. Williams, Smith Barney and Commercial Credit. On February 6, 1989, Primerica Corporation began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 1991, Primerica Corporation changed the name of A.L. Williams to Primerica Financial Services. The following year MILICO, Primerica's life insurance underwriter, changed its name to Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its broker-dealer FANS changed to PFS Investments, Inc.[15]
In December 1993, Primerica acquired the remaining 73% of Travelers Insurance Corporation and adopted the name Travelers Inc., which was changed to Travelers Group the following year.[15] Travelers Group included Primerica Financial Services, Smith Barney, Travelers Life and Annuity, Travelers Property/Casualty, Commercial Credit and other financial businesses.
Joe Plumeri was Chairman and CEO of Primerica Financial Services from 1995 to 1999.[16][17][18] In 1998, Primerica had net income of $398 million on net sales of $1.65 billion, compared to a 1994 $209 million net income on net sales of $1.28 billion.[19]
In December 1997, Primerica announced it was going to begin offering pre-paid legal through Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc., at the time both subsidiaries of Travelers Group, Inc.[20]
In 1998, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) censured and fined PFS Investments Inc., the securities arm for Primerica, for failure to properly supervise a group of registered representatives in Dearborn, Michigan.

By the date of the ruling, PFS Investments reported it had complied with the final recommendations made by the independent consultant.[21]
In 1998, Travelers Group and banking giant Citicorp merged creating Citigroup (NYSE: C). Primerica and its affiliates continued to operate as subsidiaries of Citigroup, although the Travelers insurance business was spun off in 2002. Along with Primerica, other major brand names under Citigroup included Citibank, CitiFinancial, Citicorp Trust Bank, Smith Barney, and Banamex.
Long-time veteran executives John Addison and Rick Williams, whom Art Williams quoted in his book Coach as "two true sons of A.L. Williams",[22] were hired as co-CEOs in 2000, with Glen Williams promoted to President in 2005.

Business model
Primerica, Inc. is an insurance and financial services company that uses multi-level marketing[8] to sell financial products and services.
Headquartered in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia,[9][10] Primerica spun off from its former parent company Citi through an initial public offering on April 1, 2010. It is a financial services marketing organization in North America with approximately 116,827 independent representatives,[11][7] including 22,000 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Series 6 licensed[2] through Primerica's securities broker-dealer affiliate PFS Investments, Inc. in the United States, and through PFSL Investments Canada Ltd. in Canada. The company focuses on the sale of term life insurance,[2] as well as providing other financial products and services including mutual funds, annuities, segregated funds, managed accounts, long-term care insurance, pre-paid legal services, auto insurance, home insurance, credit monitoring and debt management plans. The company has more than 4.3 million life insurance clients and over 2 million client investment accounts.[11]
History
Founded in 1977 by Arthur L. Williams Jr. as A.L. Williams & Associates (A.L. Williams), the company established its base by mass-marketing the concept of "Buy Term and Invest the Difference."[5] With "BTID" the company illustrated how its mostly middle-income client base could purchase sufficient protection with term life insurance and systematically save and invest in separate investment vehicles, such as mutual fund Individual Retirement Accounts.[2] A.L. Williams was initially established as a privately held general agency, at first selling term life insurance policies underwritten by Financial Assurance, Inc. (FAI).
The company expanded, outgrowing the capacity of FAI to process its business. In 1980, A.L. Williams entered into a contract with Boston-based Massachusetts Indemnity and Life Insurance Company (MILICO), a larger underwriter of life insurance, whose parent was PennCorp Financial Services based in Santa Monica. To support A.L. Williams headquartered in Atlanta, MILICO established a regional office in that city. In 1981, the company established First American National Corporation (later renamed The A.L. Williams Corporation) as a holding company for First American Life Insurance (later renamed A.L. Williams Life Insurance Company) and First American National Securities (later renamed PFS Investments, Inc). In 1982, The A.L. Williams Corporation (ALWC) underwrote a public stock offering, listed in the Over the Counter (OTC) market under the symbol ALWC. In 1983, the company became listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the same symbol.
Origin of Primerica name
PennCorp's growth due to MILICO's underwriting caught the attention of Bill Woodside, Chairman & CEO of American Can Company, a former Dow Jones 30 blue chip can and container producing company based in Greenwich, Connecticut founded in 1901.[12] Due to the growing rise of plastic as a replacement for aluminum cans, the company looked to acquire financial services providers and move away from the dying manufacturing industry, having acquired life insurance holding company Associated Madison from Gerry Tsai Jr in 1982. With this acquisition Woodside created a new financial services division for American Can and hired Tsai, who succeeded him as Chairman & CEO, as the new head.
In September 1982, American Can and PennCorp signed a merger agreement.
In 1983, the merger was finalized, making American Can the parent company of PennCorp and MILICO, signing a new contract with ALWC through the year 2000. In 1986 Nelson Peltz's Triangle Industries bought American Can's packaging division, along with rights to the name of the company. Therefore, on March 6, 1987 American Can announced that it would change its 86-year-old name to Primerica Corporation,[13] hence giving birth to the new and currently recognized name "Primerica."
Acquisition by Commercial Credit
The newly named Primerica Corporation targeted Smith Barney as the first significant purchase that moved the company completely into financial services with the May 1987 announcement of its intent to buy the Wall Street brokerage for $750 million,[14] which would later end up as Primerica's sister company under Citigroup in 1998.[15]
In 1985, ALWC began the procedure to open business in Canada. After encountering legal and cultural roadblocks to expanding outside the United States, ALWC began selling insurance products of Pennsylvania Life Insurance Company, a Primerica subsidiary, in Canada in 1986.
On November 30, 1988, ALWC acquired MILICO from Primerica Corporation through a stock merger acquisition for 44.58 million shares of ALWC stock, making Primerica Corporation the majority shareholder of ALWC. In December 1988, Sanford Weill's Commercial Credit acquired Primerica Corporation for $1.54 billion, retaining the Primerica name. At this time, the major businesses under Primerica Corporation were A.L. Williams, Smith Barney and Commercial Credit. On February 6, 1989, Primerica Corporation began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Travelers and Citigroup era
In November 1989, Primerica purchased the remaining 30% of ALWC that it did not previously own and the privately held General Agent, A.L. Williams, Inc. In 1991, Primerica Corporation changed the name of A.L. Williams to Primerica Financial Services. The following year MILICO, Primerica's life insurance underwriter, changed its name to Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its broker-dealer FANS changed to PFS Investments, Inc.[15]
In December 1993, Primerica acquired the remaining 73% of Travelers Insurance Corporation and adopted the name Travelers Inc., which was changed to Travelers Group the following year.[15] Travelers Group included Primerica Financial Services, Smith Barney, Travelers Life and Annuity, Travelers Property/Casualty, Commercial Credit and other financial businesses.
Joe Plumeri was Chairman and CEO of Primerica Financial Services from 1995 to 1999.[16][17][18] In 1998, Primerica had net income of $398 million on net sales of $1.65 billion, compared to a 1994 $209 million net income on net sales of $1.28 billion.[19]
In December 1997, Primerica announced it was going to begin offering pre-paid legal through Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc., at the time both subsidiaries of Travelers Group, Inc.[20]
In 1998, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) censured and fined PFS Investments Inc., the securities arm for Primerica, for failure to properly supervise a group of registered representatives in Dearborn, Michigan. The SEC found that PFS Investments Inc. had failed to have in place effective policies and procedures to follow up adequately on three complaints received about the Dearborn registered representatives, "selling away" activities. Prior to the SEC's ruling, PFS Investments Inc. hired an independent consultant to review its supervisory and compliance policies and procedures to prevent and detect violations of the federal securities laws. By the date of the ruling, PFS Investments reported it had complied with the final recommendations made by the independent consultant.[21]
In 1998, Travelers Group and banking giant Citicorp merged creating Citigroup (NYSE: C). Primerica and its affiliates continued to operate as subsidiaries of Citigroup, although the Travelers insurance business was spun off in 2002. Along with Primerica, other major brand names under Citigroup included Citibank, CitiFinancial, Citicorp Trust Bank, Smith Barney, and Banamex.
Long-time veteran executives John Addison and Rick Williams, whom Art Williams quoted in his book Coach as "two true sons of A.L. Williams",[22] were hired as co-CEOs in 2000, with Glen Williams promoted to President in 2005.
Separation from Citi
Citigroup attempted to sell Primerica in 2008,[23] having received several bids from life insurance companies and private equity firms interested in buying.[24][25] At the time the market value of the company was estimated to be $7 billion, roughly 15 times its annual earnings[26] and Citi was trying to match various bidders in groups that could bid for the unit together. Initially, a sale to JC Flowers & Co. LLC and Protective Life Corp was underway until the deal was canceled last minute for publicly undisclosed reasons.[27]
In May 2009 the Primerica executive team led by co-CEOs John Addison and Rick Williams approached private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co. yet again, as well as Blackstone Group LP and TPG Inc [23] in a new attempt to have the company bought, a plan which Citigroup did not endorse.[28]
Initial public offering
On November 5, 2009 Citi announced that it intended to spin off Primerica through an initial public offering.[29] The Primerica executive and legal team filed an S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),[30] having officially publicly announced the intention of becoming a public company. Citi would claim all profit from the primary offering, as well as continue to receive income from a significant portion of existing Primerica business,[31] with Citi Holdings CEO Michael Corbit claiming the move to be "the best separation alternative for this franchise.[29]
Primerica filed[32] a final amended S-1 and preliminary prospectus with the SEC on March 17, 2010, indicating that it will offer 18 million shares[33] to the public through the IPO, with underwriters having the option to purchase an additional 2.7 million shares. The first trading occurred on April 1, 2010. Initially, the expected share price was in the $12 – $14 range, having ended up being priced $15 a share on March 31, 2010,[34] resulting in Citi raising 27 percent or $30 million more than $290 million projected through the IPO by selling 3.36 million more shares than the anticipated 18 million.[35] The first day of trading saw the stock surge 31 percent to end up closing at $19.65 a share.[36] In a separate offering, Private equity firm Warburg Pincus has bought 17.2 million shares, resulting in a 23 percent stake in Primerica, and up to 33 percent if Warburg decides to exercise warrants to purchase an additional 4.3 million shares from Citi. Following the IPO, Citi's stake was between 32 percent and 46 percent and expected to divest its interest in Primerica "as soon as possible"[37] to fulfill its original goal of raising cash by shedding assets to improve financial performance.
On December 19, 2011, Citigroup sold its remaining equity stake in Primerica (approximately 8 million shares of Primerica's common stock), completing the separation from Citi.[38]
Awards
Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its New York subsidiary, National Benefit Life, have received several awards from A. M. Best, Standard & Poor's and the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association (IMSA) for their financial strength, high standards and quality business.[39][40][41]
Primerica has also received awards for Customer Service.[42][43][44]

Primerica Review: What Is it, Is It Dangerous, Does It Work?
Home > Career and Work Articles > Primerica Review: What Is it, Is It Dangerous, Does It Work?






Considering Primerica?
I have been to quite a few multi-level marketing recruiting meetings over the years.
I consider myself to be an open-minded person, so I don’t mind meeting with the recruiters and really learning what the company is all about.
It helps that I don’t have much desire to follow the crowd and don’t have a problem saying no or leaving when I realize it is not what I was interested in.
I met with someone from Primerica a few months back, and just got a call from a different recruiter a few days ago. Since they seem to be growing, I figured I would share my thoughts and see what everyone else thinks.
Primerica Pros
I was intrigued by Primerica because, having worked in banking and currently working in the brokerage industry, I understood that they were offering a valuable service to their clients. Primerica is a divison of CITI, one of the largest banks in the world. Citi offers just about every financial product under the sun and they use Primerica as a sales force of their many products.
What I think is brilliant with Primerica is that their goal is to help their customers use their existing income and shift things around freeing up extra cash to fund retirement and other savings goals. In the example they showed (I am not sure if it was the average American’s financial situation) they refinanced the customers mortgage and switched them from a cash value life insurance policy to a term policy freeing up $500 a month. They then take this $500 and show them how to make good use of it by investing in mutual funds for retirement, saving for college, etc…




The reason they can hire anyone is because they have a computer program that does the advising for them. The Primerica rep gives the computer specific information about the customer’s financial situation and it spits out what they call an FNA (Financial Analysis). This analysis shows the rep and the customer how they can save money and what they should put that extra money towards.






I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they encourage their customers to pay their mortgages twice monthly rather than the traditional monthly payment. This results in thousands of dollars of savings over the life of the loan. In addition they sell term life insurance rather than whole life, even though insurance companies make a lot more money off of whole life than they do term. I am not naive to think that they are doing this out of the goodness of their hearts (public companies that large typically have one thing on their minds: putting money in the shareholders pockets).






Coincidentally or not, this seems to be somewhat of a win-win. CITI is willing to make a sacrifice and make a little bit less money on a few products in order to free up the client’s money that will likely be spent on other CITI products.
Primerica Cons

They are still a  multi-level marketing firm. The problem I find with many MLM’s is that many of them coerce and pressure people to join – personally, nothing turns me off quicker than when I feel like I am being pressured into something.
I did not sign up with them so I don’t have a full understanding of how they get paid. My rep said something about there being four ways, but seemed to intentionally keep it vague. From what other Primerica reps have said, most money is made from recruiting people rather than selling products – and it is difficult to make much money if you don’t recruit a bunch of people.
The commission payouts are lower than other salespeople in the industry. My assumption is that since they aren’t looking for financial expertise when hiring, they can get away paying lower commissions. Many of the reps hired wouldn’t have the credentials to work many other places in the industry.
If you do leave and stay in the industry, they have a non-compete clause for 2 years within a 50 mile radius of your address. If you leave, you must leave behind the clients that you worked so hard to get in the first place. Probably typical in the industry, but something to keep in mind nonetheless.

I am sure there are bunch more pros and cons, but honestly, since I never signed up I don’t know all of the details. I would love to hear your perspective if you heard of them, been recruited by them, worked for them, or currently work for them. I know a lot of people are very passionate about MLMs one way or another, so if you comment please keep it civil.

I work in the financial services industry as an assistant to a broker.  We have transferred quite a few clients in from Primerica.  I don’t know much about them, but their mutual funds seem to perform *really* poorly.  Just from what I’ve seen from accounts we moved over, I decided I would never open an account at Primerica.  On the plus side, when we request accounts moved over, their processing time is faster than most 🙂
I had no idea that they made a lot of their money from recruiting – very interesting.  Makes you wonder when they find time to take care of their clients.
Interesting article!

Sounds to me like there isn’t a great business in saving money for people in this way, which kind of makes sense.

@Becky
Just to clarify (from the little that I know about it) they make a lot of their money by hiring on people below them – they get a cut of whatever they make and on and on… So, it is similar to the normal multi-level marketing programs (hence the name Multi-level) 
So clearly, it is to each reps advantage to have people under him/her who are producing, so they can get that passive income.

IO looked into Primeamerica a few years ago, and what Becky reported about them having mutual funds with comparitively low returns was true then too.  It seemed to me at the time that after I sold mutual funds to all of my friends and aquaintences, I was pretty much out of leads.







 Jack

                December 17, 2007                            



I currently work for Primerica and here is my opinion:
Yes it maybe true that at the starting position of Primerica Representative that one’s commission is not that high compared to other financial institutions, but you have to take all things into consideration. My day-job is software engineer thus I have no background or experience in financial services so if I want to go and work for one of these other high paying companies then I have to go back to college and study first. Which will cost over $10K. But the bigger problem is that it will take 2 years to complete doing it full time which means I must give up my day-job and loose another 160K from my salaries. 
The main reason I’m excited about Primerica is that I have the potential to work up to RVP level where I can make 4 times the commissions on personal sales compared to starting position and at RVP level I’m pretty sure I’ll be making more or, at least similar money as these other independent brokers. 
Then there is the overrides you make in Primerica from your down line and with this none of the independents can compete. My RVP income is probably 90% from all overrides and very little from personal sales. 
Now of course someone is going to say few people make it to RVP so lets take worst case scenario where you stay at Rep. level
1) For a little registration fee of $99 my life license training, exam and insurance is covered for the two years. Obviously the company heavily subsidizes this as the books, trainer, exam and insurance does still cost lots of money, some estimates say around $2000 to $3000.
2) The amount of information you learn about finances (as ‘n non financial person such as myself) is simply unbelievable.  I never had life insurance mainly because a HUGE dislike of insurance companies and all the negative notion about life insurance in general. It was only after my upline did “training” presentation with me that I learned that there is Term insurance which is actually good value for money so I got Primerica insurance. Yes their Term wasn’t the cheapest but it was comparible than most banks but who would I rather do business with. The bank who doesn’t care about me or the person who is willing to come to my home on weekend.
3) I’m also mutual fund license so I can write my own retirement and education plans on which I’ll earn 2% commission, and I plan to add these commissions to the savings plans. Sure the 10% to 12% is not the best for mutual funds but adding 2% on top of 10% to 12% is still way better than the banks GIC crap on which you get around 3% rate of return. I had GIC before and the bank never even told me about Mutual funds, they only “highly recommended” that I put my money in GIC which gives better rates than their “savings” accounts. Now that I know what Banks do with GIC I’m tolally mad at them for taking advantage of me. 
4) Even if one does not even move up one level you still make good amount of money considering it’s a part time position. For doing a typical life insurance sale you can make around $200 and about $1000 over 10 years setting up retirement and education plans for one family. The paper work for all this takes around 5 hours so that equates to $240 per hour which is 5 times the amount I’m earning in my day-job. So even at starting position this is good paying opportunity from my point of view. 
So even at worst case scenario it is still a pretty good deal for $99 yes ?
Now lets consider a better scenario where you reach RVP level.
1) About 4 times the commissions on all personal sales.
2) Overrides from all down lines
3) Trailer fees on total investments portfolio.
4) You can sell your RVP position for about 10x annual earnings. My RVP makes 200K a year so he can sell he’s position tomorrow for $2 Million.
Some general comments about other message boards. When reading various other message boards like Ripoff-report etc then ask yourself the following. Who is the person posting? A lot of the bad posts I believe are done by upset whole life insurance agents whom has had lots of charge backs due to insurance replacements from one of the 100,000 Primerica agents. The only valid complaints I’ve really seen are ones where people complaining about posting a resume online and then being recruited by Primerica and this is highly discourage by the company. There are also some complaints about the poor presentation of some meetings done by some RVP’s. For that I would say if you really want to join the company then look for some other RVP office in yellowpages and see some of their meetings. If you find a office you like and the energy feels good and the poeple are sharp then join them. If you join a successful office you will make good money.
Lastly I would like to pose the following:
The middle class in North America is dying under debt, waist full whole life insurance and poor/no savings for retirement. If most of the middle class keep doing what they doing now then the whole North American continent will collapse in 20 to 30 years from now and it will make Russia look like a picnic. As far as I can see Primerica is the ONLY company that has the resources and sales force to try and combat this problem and help people in meaningful way. Right now Primerica only has about 2% market penetration so it’s going to take lots more effort.
Good luck
Good luck.

I don’t know much about it myself, my father-in-law worked for them for quite a while, and had quite a bit of mine and my husbands money invested with them. I know from us, my husband invested about $5000 with them, and 6 years later was only about to recoup about $2000. My father-in-law had a similar situation, but I don’t know the specifics. Granted, we invested about 2 years before 9/11 and the big market downturn that accompanied it, but when we pulled the money, most of the other funds we looked at had a much better return, ie: not negative and those that were negative were not nearly as negative. Because of that my father-in-law stopped working for Primerica and we know have all our investments with Edward Jones. That’s just my personal experience with Primerica.

                December 18, 2007                            



Bob,
I’m curious, can you list some of the reasons why you haven’t joined the company yet. I’ve analyzed this company from every angle and sure it’s not perfect but compared to ALL other part-time opportunities out there this can’t be beaten. 
I’ve tried lots of stuff like filling up surveys for hours at a time to only get paid a couple of bucks for the effort. Tried amway/quixtar for a bit until I figured out that they really make their money from all the “must have” “training” CD’s and paid seminars. 
Primerica business overview seminar is FREE. The FNA is FREE. On Monday’s and Friday’s I go to my RVP office and watch EPN (our internal training channel) for FREE. Sure my RVP pays something but he doesn’t charge me a cover fee to sit in his office and watch also. He really wants me to improve and succeed because it’s in everybody’s best interest. And I go because I’m really eager to learn more about finances (so that I can retire earlier and not work to 65 like everybody else)
Financial services is just that a service, there is no product handling so Primerica is one of the purest MLM opportunities. Other MLM fails and gets classified as scams either because of all the “add-ons”, “expensive education CD’s”, “product handling”, “paid seminars” etc. 
So please, enlighten me as a non-Primerica yet open-minded person what is stopping you from joining?

@Michell
Could you kindly mention which mutual fund you were invested in, I would like to lookup the chart on yahoo finance. That would surely be a new record for a mutual fund to drop 150% over a 6 year period. 
If not then I assume you have a made up story to make Primerica look bad and trying to get free advertising for Edward Jones.
From your website:
http://www.edwardjones.com/cgi/getHTML.cgi?page=/USA/products/mutualfunds_revenue_sharing.html
I can see you resell various mutual funds similar as Primerica, coincidently you also resell Van Kampen which Primerica does.
So if your trying to make Primerica look bad yet you resell exactly the same mutual funds? I smell a rat!
Agents from other companies are so desperate and shameless for business that they must go to the extreem of lying, making up false stories and examples to try and win some business. Thank you for adding fuel to my fire.
This example so perfectly illustrates my point of the only bad press I’ve seen on the net about Primerica is made up stories from desperate, spineless competitors.

@Bob
Sorry for getting to this post so late — as you know, I’ve been busy.  🙂
I believe the combination of what you and Jack wrote paints a fairly good picture of what Primerica is all about, and I feel that there’s not much substance I can add to it.  However, I can share my short-lived Primerica experience with you.
I was recruited here in the St. Louis area a few months ago, and I must say, I really like what they do.  They have a good business model, and the people (at the office I visited…not sure about the others) actually have a heart to help the struggling middle-class of America.  The motto of my church is “Honor God.  Help People.”  So, it was inspiring to see that same spirit on the Primerica people.
There were a couple of turn-offs for me.  First:  the fact that many of the folks (especially the higher-ups) seemed extremely over zealous.  They had a goofy air about them…like a super-hyped team spirit (You know…”Go team, go!”), and that’s not who I am.  I dreaded doing the team cheers at the meetings.  It came off as cheesy.  Now, I have no clue if they do that at other Primerica offices.  That was just my experience, but I hear a lot of MLM companies/meetings are like that anyway.  No big deal, I was slowly able to overlook that.  The second thing that turned me off was the referral/recruiting process.  For every FNA (Financial Needs Analysis) that they do for you, they will ask you to refer 10 people (preferably struggling middle-class families) to their services.  I’m a single, 26-year old guy, and I honestly don’t know that many families that fit that bill.   I know of some families like that from church, but that’s not the place to refer/recruit.  Plus, I was very uncomfortable asking my friends, who were skeptical of Primerica and other MLMs in the first place.  Nevertheless, this is a small price to pay considering they do the FNA for free (I believe its estimated value is around $1000).  
Aside from those turn-offs, I like Primerica.  Unfortunately, it didn’t work out for me.  My schedule was just too busy.  Between church activities, loved ones, and my current job, I just felt that I wasn’t able to put enough time/effort into Primerica.  Plus, with all the extra driving to the team meetings alone, my gasoline bill was really adding up.
All in all, I think Primerica is good.  If you have a heart to help others, the drive and determination to be successful, and can give it your time, then you may want to look into it.  It definitely is something that can eventually become quite lucrative by building passive income.

@Jack
I appreciate your comments, but as I mentioned at the end of the post I want to keep this civil – from reading michelle’s comments – It in no way sounds like an ad for Ed Jones, and it appeared to be a simple explanation of what she saw happen. 
As far as me joining Primerica, the reason I haven’t is because I don’t want to. It really is as simple as that. As I mentioned earlier, I do respect them as a company for a few different reasons…

For all stock lovers. There is a rumor that Primerica is going under its own ticker name. If this is the case then this will be a strong stock to purchase.

yep, I have heard of them, but just didn’t seem right for me at the time.
@ Bamboo –
Prime America with it’s own ticker symbol?  sounds great.   however, I remember Russ Whitney going public a few years back.   they quickly dropped to penny stocks and eventually was delisted.

As a Christian who tries to be his brother’s keeper and a financial/insurance trained professional with NOTHING to sell (I have a corporate home office job), I would recommend you steer a wide path around Primerica reps amd the funky cool-aid they’re selling. 
Lets examine the ‘help’ someone got from re-doing their finances:
A Primerica bi-weekly mortgage with $6,000 in points (plus closing costs)
An overpriced Primarica term life policy (save 30-50% by shopping around)
Extra money invested in loaded brokerage account funds OR company provided variable annuity accounts. 
Thanks for all the ‘help’
How do I know? I’ve had a FNA done. I’m also experienced enough to ask for all industry required disclosure forms. 
You spoke of recruiting new people?  That’s their only marketing method. The first thing they want from you is a list of 20 of your friends and family.  Since you’re new and un-licensed in the financial services world, you ‘upline’ will ‘help’ you call on your friends and family; but if sales are made, who gets the money?  If you don’t have a insurance or NASD license, they do. But don’t worry recruit some new people, call on their family and friends and keep that money.  
Why the continous recruitment of people?  Because 99% burn out making little or no money.  
You speak of Primerica spinning off of Citibank?  I’m sure Citi would love the opportunity to improve their image.  Primerica will have a more difficult time recruiting without the misleading “come work for a Citibank company” cold calls. 
Want a job in this industry? Find an entry-level job at a reputible company and learn the ropes.

I am working for Primerica and have been with my husband for 4 yrs now.  It is work. You just do not sit back and collect a paycheck because you joined the company.  Depending on the integrity of the rep you concur with depends on what you get.  Some reps I know have poor mutual funds that they set clients up with, while others stay on top the game per say, and want to do the best for their clients.  As far as pay – it firsts depends on the sales level you are at, as with any job. All companies are a pyramid.  All companies have a CEO, then VP’s, the upper mgmt, middle mgmt, and workers.  So the idea of Primerica being a pyramid scam is ridiculous.  As far as the other part of pay – yes you do recruit people.  However, you do NOT need to recruit to make a decent living, if you follow the ethical system you were taught.  You do need to recruit if you want to eventually have a decent residual income and have a business, that one day you can pass on to your children.  If that is a scam, then lets call up Sam Walton and tell him that Sam’s and Walmart are a scam.  He started something and built it from the ground up.  Yet now, he does what he wants, when he wants.  Why? Because he “recruited” people and collects a residual income.  The difference. Primerica recruits to build recruits.  Walmart recruits (hires) for employees that they control their income.  Not picking on Walmart – I admire Sam Walton – just using his success as an example.

@Misty
Thanks for sharing – you make a good point about pyramid schemes – if you draw the org chart, it would appear that most of them are a pyramid 😉  and I find it encouraging that you say that you can make a living with Primerica WITHOUT recruiting… I think many people abandon the idea because of the recruiting… It is good to hear that you can do it without…

For all you Wall St. wizards out there, let me lay it on you this way. 22 years with Primerica, plenty of money, plenty of freedom. Instead of listening to the doomsdayers, just go out and work hard, live right and find something to believe in. Somebody has to drive the bus, as long as its not me. Just go make money for you and your family. Dont be a crybaby just because it does not work for you. This opportunity is not for everybody, let me leave you with this…some will, some wont, so what.

As a Primerica Rep, the following are the facts:
1.  A pyramid scheme is based on recruiting with the intention of making money off of the entry fees.  These fees are normally pretty high.  Then they mask it with products that they know aren’t really going to sell.
Primerica- $99 = life insurance class, teacher, books/materials, AND reimbursement of fees for a passed test.  Seems like they wouldn’t stand to get rich off of this???
2.  Primerica’s financial services are competitive.  No one ever said that Primerica was the CHEAPEST, but for the families we serve, it makes their situation much better than it was or would have been.  In most cases they haven’t and never would SHOP for a better bargain.  So we educate them on how money works and allow them to make the decision.  For families who have NEVER had ANY of these products, this could only help them get to a better place financially.
3.  Recruiting – Primerica allows you to make money from marketing CITI’s services whether you recruit or not.  An employee would be happy with that.  Primerica promotes business ownership which involves recruiting in order to build an organization.  It’s methods my not be typical, but you have to admit at some level it is very effective.  EVERY business recruits and trains people in order to grow.
Now here is a point to ponder.  If I had a business in your neighborhood that only sold CITI products and services and I was successful at it.  Then I came to you and said, “hey come work for me and market these products”.  Most people that were in the market would say “you’re giving me a job, sure when do I start”.  THE MINUTE I SAY, “oh yeah and you have the opportunity to be ME and own your own shop, let me show you how to get it done.”…then it’s a scam…lol

it seems that the old timers are the one that are very happy with Primerica. The last newsletter I saw from Citigroup regarding Primerica was like 8-10 years ago. If Primerica is just a starting company, then I would 95% join, but now it seems it is top off. They say the fees are minimal, the other monthly fees are also minimal, the commission is low, but if you have thousands of people, then you do get the money. Like I mention earlier, it is at its peak. Also after speaking to a few rep, none can give me a straight answer on how they make the money. Some say through recruiting, some say through commission, and others said through the commission of the people you recruit. 
It also feels like the different between a real medical doctor and a “quack” doctor. You can’t get the full license, so you improvise. Get people with less knowledge, charge them alot less, and hopefully you will get the QUANTITY, but not the quality.
The only thing that made me think about it twice, is maybe “I Know” I can get tax except on many things that I would do with Primerica, like travel expense, entertaiment, food, lodging, etc….
Last thing,
It just doesn’t make sense when a company ask you to pay them for you to work for them. Again, like I said earlier, no one can answer me how Primerica get their income and the last info that I can find that link Primerica strongly with Citigroup was from a 8-10 years old news letter.

John,
I will try to answer your questions as best I can as a Primerica Rep.
Primerica is a subsidiary of Citigroup.  You can go to citigroup.com and see that.  Citigroup chose Primerica to market it’s services to middle income familes. With 6 million clients, Primerica has a pretty strong LINK with Citigroup.
Primerica doesn’t charge you to work WITH them.  The $99 fee covers your Life insurance class, books, etc.  As well as paperwork that needs to be filed with the state.  We are regulated just like any other company and have to pass the same exams.  They don’t make a dime off of you just joining.
We get paid just like any other financial services company.  We get commissions on each piece of business that we close.  I can make money this way without EVER recruiting ANYONE.  The recruiting aspect comes from the nature of ANY business.  You recruit to build your organization.  You recruit and train each individual to work independently just like you and the perk is that you are rewarded for training that person.  You get a percentage of each piece of business that THEY close.  No one wants to work hard forever, so you build a team.  
Also, the only way our business would TOP OFF is if the debt epidemic in the U.S. was completely solved or if people became completely happy with their current income.  Until then, the market is wide open.
Thousands of people may be necessary to make millions, but to be a six figure earner the head count is minimal as long as your team is productive.

Good evening everyone.  Im a consultant for an automotive center and was confronted by a client with information regarding Primerica.  So I went to his office this evening to hear more, because I really had no clue what services they provided.  I am so torn in what to think due to the Pro/Con listings I have found on my search on the web. I also was not given much info tonight from the gentleman I spoke with, it was a very informal interview, he was very interested in getting to know me I would guess. He did mention more than once that the money that could be made is Amazing!!  I did mention to him money does not bring my passion out but helping people does…  So my question is this to anyone that may be able to Truely answer,  Is Primerica sincer and really willing to help others??  If so, It may be something I would consider after I see how it is really ran.  Any comment would be grately appreciated.  Thank you.

                February 29, 2008                            



Scott,
First and foremost, Pro/Con listings on the web are like looking at reviews for any product that you wish to purchase.  If you look at every review, no matter how good the product is, you will find negative reviews.  The same applies with most large corporations.  So what you MUST rely on is our ratings with the entities that regulate us: ambest, NASD, SEC, etc.  Then on a representative level you need to speak with those who actually are doing well and see what their experience has been.  We often take the advice of those who the opportunity was wrong for in the first place.  Truth be told it is definitely not for everyone, but if it is a fit for YOU and your situation…no one can assess that but YOU.
Our focus is to help families get into a better financial situation than they are currently.  So we give a simple education on financial concepts….things that you could normally do on your own, but currently are not.  We understand that most of middle America is in debt because they are not aware of these concepts.  We provide the vehicle for you to get to a better financial place by mapping out where you are and how to get to where you want to be based on YOUR specific case. Next, of course we have an array of services that can help you accomplish that and that is where the commission comes in.
The key is that Primerica along with Citigroup knows that a lot of middle America cannot afford a financial planner or advisor.  We will never claim to be financial planners, but we can teach you about how money works and how to make it work for you.
The rep that you had the informal interview with more than like ly looking to peak interest and then invite you to a business opportunity meeting where most of those questions can be answered in full.

@Scott
You bring up a very valid point about reviews… There will always be bad ones and always will be good ones. There are a lot of people who always say good things, even when they are bad and vice versa. The key to looking at reviews, is spotting trends and facts that can’t be disputed. That is why I wrote this post – I was and am happy to see all of the comments from both sides of the Primerica spectrum, so hopefully people can get a better understanding of what Primerica does and doesn’t do…

I have a couple of friends who are in the company, and I too have mixed feelings. I feel that Primerica do offer “okay” products and in alot of cases, can save a family hundres of dollars on their mortage…which they should invest the difference, hence Primerica does nothing financial wise for my friends who are agents. They work hard at it EVERYDAY. Soliciting recruits (which I do not like), they approach people in a restroom, mall, parking lot, grocery store, gas stations, and even when they are out on dates. They have been conditioned into these little obsesses Primericans, And everytime I am doing my research on PFS and other financial and come back to them with hard core facts, they always use the same lines many of the agents uses on this blog and other blolgs across the net. To some degree I would even call them brainwashed. They would neglect their families precious time (even kids) to attend late night meetings ( up to midnight), and weekends. I believe it could be a great opporrtunity, but only for a small few. But I think it can be a big strain on families because people change when they join PFS, because they are fed so much BS, and they make you feel as though the job you are working is crap, and the degree you hard for in school. I am sure many of you could relate who have families and friends who joined. And my friends have no regard on the negative effect they have on their failies.

…and did i mention they make no money. I over a 10mth period one has only made about 4-500 dollars. not thousands. 400-500…and the other has made way less than that, and he has been in it for anout 11 months. And again these are little trained soldiers…you can’t find a more dedicated rep than these two.

Let me tell you……run from Primerica, I invest 1200.00 a year with them and I lose 200.00 of that money every year for the past 3 years.  Haven’t been able to get a hold of my “REP” (what a lazy POS) for 6 months.  Try moving your money out of their crap investments and you get slammed with outrageous “Redemption Fees”.  I’m finally biting the bullet taking my 20% loss over 6 years and paying my outrageous redemption fees and going to find a reputable broker who is going to sell me overpriced insurance…… $80.00 a month for a $400,000.00 life insurance policy that I got 6 years ago (when I was 24) and in great health.  
Sheesh…shame on me, and shame on you if you give them one dime….you’ve been warned 🙂
P.S. anyone can reccomend a reputable broker for me…details appreciated…
Thanks,
Aaron

They teach before selling!

I have read alot about Primerica the last few days or so. I’m really sitting on the fence at this point. My good friend and neighbor called me about it a couple of nights ago and I sat down with him and I guess a RVP. I’m a bid Dave Ramsey fan.  One thing that Dave has said is not to buy (or buy into)something you don’t understand.
I understood what they were trying to do as far as selling insurance and refi’s and other things like that. I do believe American middle-class families are in need of a financial make-over as a whole, so on that note, I believe in the system.
What I really did not understand is the business end of the deal. They gave me no clear cut answer as to how they actually make their money.
When my neighbor called me about this, he wouldn’t tell me about it, just that he wanted to talk with me about something new he was doing. That part also left a bad taste in my mouth. He is normally not that way, so I kind of wonder if maybe he was coached to say that.
The next morning, a member of my wife’s family called and said she was also working with Primerica. My wife told her I had spoken with a different rep the night before and within 1 hour they were over at my house. When they got there, they asked me who the rep was and where he was from. I told them and they seemed very angered about another rep trying to recruit me, statint that their system was much better than the other RVP. This seemed very fishy to me for some reason.
Primerica doesn’t seem like a scam, just a mediocre operation at best from a employee standpoint. I mean, if they think you’re good enough to work for them, why wouldn’t they just hire you as an employee and pay you a salary and benefits (for say 6 months to a year) to help you get off the ground?
It also seems like they want you to give them your referrals before you can actually make a profit for doing it(while you are training).
It also seems like you donate alot of your precious free time away from your family while you get licensed to try to sell the products and recruit new people before you see much money at all.  I mean, wouldn’t someone just be better off to go out and get a part-time job instead to help pay for the tests to get the licenses, then go independent so they could give their customers more options.
This is just my take on it. My friend is very knowledgable about finances so this is why I’m on the fence about this. Sorry for the length, just wanted to state how I felt.

Hello everyone!
I’m glad I finally found a blog about this that doesn’t have it’s last post in November 2006. lol
Some posters on here (and other bloggs) are making the whole situation a little more focused for me, in making a decision. Thank You!
I’m supposed to attend the first training meeting with Primerica this Friday. I have been to two meetings with my trainer though.
Quick info: I have NO financial experience. I’m not all about the money. I’m going to school for an Environmental Science (Extended) Degree in Denver CO.
I’m not all about the money, and I could never live with myself if I messed someone’s retirement fund by involving them with Primerica. Even though that person accepted the service themselves, I as part of it. Anyway…
I am a strong believer in “Do what you love, and the money will follow”; especially for my career. Maybe it’s a little bit too optimistic, but I choose to be that way.
So to answer some questions let me tell you what I’ve learned so far.
I asked my trainer some of the exact questions you guys are asking. REMEMBER, the answers are pretty much what the trainer has told me, and I did very little research on them. I hope they help, especially as an insider’s info.
1. How does Primerica actually make their money if they offer such good rates?
Well first if they beat your current set up (say the way you pay your debt, and through what bank etc) they can actually buy out that loan from whoever you’re with, and transfer it to CitiBank or w/e. Though Citi won’t make as much money as the people you were with before, THEY did just buy out that loan. So if they do this with many loans, then  the  money does come in. And if people are happy with what happened to them, they are bound to recommend these services to their friends.
2. The mutual funds are NOT owned by Citi or Primerica; they just use other companies that have good ratings. At least that’s what the trainer said. I have not done any research on this.
3. The guy told me, I have to work  for my money. But in terms of pay per hour, it can be a good earning. Recruiting people onto my team (3 people) will make me more money, but I SHOULD be able to be OK just by myself. Also, I can recruit just one person, and get a slight increase in my commission percentage.
4. It is like a pyramid scheme, except that it is different.
Everyone’s work benefits everyone. So you gotta treat employees well, because it all comes back to you.
You don’t sell products, but services, and as I said, some can really help people (like the debt deals).
You CAN move up to the top, and get this, WITHOUT becoming competition for the person that was your trainer. Because if my RVP make me an RVP, he gets rewarded for doing that. And not just once, but every year. The amounts depend from 50K-100K.
That’s it for now, I’ll try and post more later.
Also, remember that since people are ‘contracted’ by Primerica, every office will have different people running it. So experiences of people joining the company, or using their services or encountering representatives, will all depend on the people that they deal with.
I’m trying to do as much research as possible, as I am still on the fence with joining or not.
I work at a restaurant right now, and the money is good, while going to school. Once summer begins, I’ll need more than just the restaurant (and for a college student, it’s not easy top get a job job, as in not sales at the local clothing store or working for target etc.).
I am considering joining, but I will uphold myself to the standards I have now – my ethics, actually HELPING people and making sure I don’t screw anyone over so I can make a few more dollars.
My plan is to pay attention to what really works, and recommended it. For example, they seem to excel at helping families get rid of their debt faster and cheaper. I will recommend this to my friends.
But when it comes to investing in mutual funds and what not, so far I would NOT recommend it. Though history shows MFs are a good route, in today’s economy MFs aren’t going to be too stable. 
So that is my plan. I’m supposed to get my trainer guy in front of 6 families and let him do the talking blah blah. I will do that, but I will warn all 6 parties not to sign up for the mutual funds (at least for now) or do anything else besides the debt consolidation and etc, if the FNA shows that Primerica can indeed beat the current set up they have.
Any more advice will be great. Also, PLEASE post any questions you would like me to ask my trainer!
Thank You!

Hello again. I see no one responded…which is great actually.
I wanted to thank the people that posted on here again, for allowing me to make a more educated decision. I know this is just some blog on the internet, but on the other side there are people, honest and not so honest, that posted. So I did take it with a grain of salt.
After giving it some thought, and after trying to talk to people about what I was doing and if they could help me out, it became apparent this isn’t for me.
Though I was trying to ‘work the system’ as to avoid any bad stuff for my customers, as well as make me the most profits. Doing just debt consolidation and such wouldn’t make me a whole lot of money, unless I sold immense amounts.
Having to recruit customers felt weird and wrong really. Not for me.
Also having to recruit friends to be part of my team, so I could get a promo wold feel weird and a bit exploitative, even though they did make money, and could be in a position as I was eventually.
Even if I did have my license, I think I would still have very little expertise in advising people about investments and what not. I wouldn’t want to do that, as I explained in my previous post. 
The trainer guy was telling me that the most common professions people came from, were law enforcement, construction and teaching. So people with just a license and a computer program are out there messing with people’s money. Though there are successes, when you get into investments and mutual funds, the situation gets more serious.
I forgot to mention the guy also mentioned Primerica is into educating the public (lower class and middle class) about how finances work, and when giving them an FNA or whatever kind of report or contract, they would tell the customers about the small print and so on. Basically exposing everything about a contract of FNA report.
I did learn some good things from the short adventure.
Being ignorant of how finances work, or not having at least a basic understanding of what you’re doing with your money, is just asking for loss of money or even trouble in the future. So try and contact government non-profit agencies to educate you a little bit. Also, as others have said, you can educate yourself at a very low price or for free if you find the right sources.
Good Luck!

Yes you say find a entry level position in a reputable company but then I have to charge people $1500-$2500 and up in order for me to help them. And if they don’t have at least $25,000.00 to invest you will not help them.  How many (average) americans have $25k to invest or can afford to pay you/reputable companies 1500.00-2,500.00 or more for your services. I joined two months ago and yes we have to go through the training/licensing process but if I did it your way I (average) american would have to pay thousands for training/education. But the main reason I joined is because my husbands grandfather got robbed by two of the “whole life” insurance agency. We got nothing back to bury him. He had to pay an extra $700-900 to be cremated.  My mother is 81 yrs. old, too old to do something better. Thank God her plot is paid for at least. I say I’m getting a good deal for $99.00. I want to expose all those other criminals selling whole life and keeping peoples money instead of to them like it should be.

The second comment by me has a correction at the bottom. I was typing too fast because I’m on lunch from my full time jail “job”. I want to add that most average americans don’t understand life insurance policies. They don’t understand how the policy works (hidden clauses) in “whole life” etc. Primerica teaches the clients/recruits how both types of insurances work for or against them. My upline told one of my potential clients to keep his term life insurance that he currently had instead of getting Primerica’s offer because he had been rated with preexisting conditions. I would say that is pretty honest on our part. What do you think “whole life” agents would have told him. i have a mutual fund through my job and it gives me great returns. I believe in Mutual Funds.

If your licensed in the industry, you should know you dont talk bad about other companies. Tell me why we have a rating of a+www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_Nov_2/ai_n16854073. What is your full name and license number. I know if you are licensed you have been taught about badmouthing other companies. You can lose your license for misrepresenting companies you know nothing about.

can someone in the company tell me why is it okay for agents to flirt with people of the opposite sex as a recruiting technique, but try to say they are only using their people skills…when clearly commenting on someone’s apperance and asking them about being single or not is clearly unprofessional. is this a method often used and if not does anyone else in the compnay believe it is unprofessional…and could be a form sexual harrassment?

Since you are just SUCH an expert, maybe you should consider doing the research yourself???  Primericas Term life coverage is actually the lowest premium out!!  Not only that, but do you know how much your life insurance company paid out in death benefits last year??  I can tell you Primerica paid out over a billion in death benefit in 2007, as opposed to average joes company that maybe maxed out 400 million in ’07.  Its alright your company might pay out your death benefit, But I know I’m not gonna leave an investment of that magnitude to chance because they just wanna make a few excuses not to pay.  Oh, and Primerica isnt a spin of citi bank.  Its actually a sister company of Citi bank, in the much larger Citigroup.  I’de really like to take a look at the FNA you had done, maybe you’re confusing it with your boys over at edward jones.  You know that advertising buys you all the credibility that you could ever want lol

My $.02… sorry if it’s too long.
I’m an IT manager for an architecture and engineering firm. An acquaintance approached me about Primerica. I was intrigued by it since I’ve been through Dave Ramsey and am on a crusade to get totally debt free. 
I know very little about financial services and I’m not going to pretend like I do. Some of the ‘experts’ on these blogs make me smile since I’m not totally in the dark. I’m just not fooling myself or anyone else.
I actually signed up as a rep before I did the FNA or anything because I seen an opportunity to learn and do something in which i’m very interested. Helping people learn about managing their assets and having the opportunity to earn extra income. Basically for my time only I get to get licensed and trained in an area I like a lot seems like a good investment for that  benefit to me.
Being the IT guy i am, I google’d it and read all posts by the haters, ‘scam stories’ and the hyped up Primerica lovers (that’s how I found this one.) I went to a builders school or some such pep rally on a saturday during this time so I was on a roller coaster of; “did I do the right thing’, ‘I made a mistake’ to hyped up and ready to go 24/7 and reach RVP in 12-18 months. :0)
Here’s where I’m at after all that…
1. I think I made the right choice.
2. I think Primerica offers good products at a reasonable price.
3. I think this is one of the better MLM systems.
4. I think the rah-rah rally’s only hype people up and make them reckless, hence the haters from back experiences.
5. I’m not going to rush out and harass my friends and family and get a bunch of appointments even if that’s what I’m told I need to do 15-20 appts in the first 30 days. I am just telling them about Primerica when I get the chance and I have asked if they would let me train on them. Some of my friends have been interested from the start.
6. I am going to take my time in trying to sell until I have proper training and licensing.
7. I am going to approach it as an opportunity to educate people first and then as an opportunity to sell something that will meet their financial needs.
8. I think that if I provide a valuable service to clients, and I think primerica will allow me to do that, treat clients with respect, be totally honest with them and not pressure them to do what makes me the most money then I will be able to make money doing Primerica…
Every time i read the list of cons or why primerica is a ‘scam’ they are almost word-for-word which makes me wonder.
how I feel about a few of them:
1. primerica’s products are not the cheapest. So what!… My question is not the cheapest but who gives you the most value and obviously price does go into that. I purchased life insurance for myself and wife from Primerica. I checked the internet pricing searching multiple providers and the cheapest I could find was only $4 cheaper per month. We have a local farm and garden store here called Atwoods. i like to go there instead of wal-mart even though I know that I can get the same thing cheaper at wal-mart. Should Atwoods close down because they are unethical for charging 5.99 for something you can by for 4.87 at wal-mart? should the clerk tell you, “You can get that cheaper at Wal-Mart?” Having a person come to my house and take in consideration all financial factors in my purchase is better to me then buying the cheapest policy off the internet. that’s worth $48 per year to me….
I will try to update how things go… got an ‘appointment’ tonight…

Hi to everyone. I have joined primerica just last week and have completed 3 appointments with my RVP. I am also currently studying for my RN exam this june. I am stuck in the middle about whether or not to pursue a career with primerica. I plan to work as a nurse part time (have accepted an offer already) and plan to work with primerica part time as well. I just do not know if I would be able to do both as I am just starting as a nurse. Does anyone have any advice? If there is anyone in this forum doing a part time career with primerica, I would like you to share some of your experiences with primerica. I am very interested in the opportunities that primerica offers but I am very confused as to what to do right at this moment. Thanks.

macg have you ever heard of Senior Settlements? How about conversion features? Did you shop individually
for yourself and your wife? If i remember correctly PFS has unisex rates. You wife being female may get better ratings at another company. From what I understand pFS doesn’t require anyone to purchase their products, so wouldn’t it be in your best interest to find the best policy for your individual needs?
Ok I understand the how can you sell it if you don’t own it, but you are an independent contractor not a W-2 employee. Primerica has no loyalty towards you they will do what’s in the best interest of the company as you should do what’s in the best interest of you and yours.
Some of us have been where you are and know what it’s like inside and outside of PFS. Something to consider is if the goal is to be an RVP and above, why do some of them leave? Consider the business side…

natalie you can get licensed and be what’s called a referring agent. Just refer people to your RVP and do your nursing thing and since you will be licensed you can be compensated, but of course follow your individual states laws. Ask your RVP about it. I think at one time they called it being an inactive rep.

if you are whining because you’ve never built a business then you need a hug. go ask your bos why he “recruits” or “hires” massive employees? mayb because he wants to have all the labor done for him? have you ever noticed that you employees do all the work and dont get paid your worth while your BOSS calls theshots, determines your income and lives the dream life? gt your mind right and instead of judging you need to get with it before you get fired or downsized!

think you need to check your stats chum! PFS is the heart and soul of citi if they sell that would be awesome then we go public. which will probably make you more comfortable working with us seeing as that would make it more like a “job” for you employee mentality characters. when will you realize that men and women lie and numbers dont. plus when will you become financially independent working for your boss?

Primerica is what most would call a pyrimid, but someone tell me what company is not. Look, no one person can run a succesfull business by themselves. When someone response to your resume on careerbuilder  they are looking to add a piece to the puzzle to better the business, same here. The people below us in the workforce has a strong influence on how sucessfull we are. I recently met with a RVP about a job position and I more or less  interviewed him. One thing that really caught my attention is how spiritual the guy was, which is a big plus when I consider a job.He was laid back, maybe a little too much. The meeting lasted about an hour and a half and was by no means tense. He was very open and did not stray from the fact that part of your earnings would come from recruiting. For the most part you’ll be offering clients advice on how to take thier current income, cut every corner and plan for the future. In other words what can you live without to pay off your debt. For this you dont get paid, you get paid if the consumer takes out a loan or accepts any other services like an insurance policy. The RVP told me on average per person you’ll make $300-$500 which aint bad. The upfront fee is $99 and $25 a month online access fees. THE COMPANY CANT GET RICH ON THESE PENNY ANNY FEES. The profit comes from the services. If you are not a salesman dont join. If you are shy dont join. If you’ve never had a commission job, start part time as I am. I’ve successfully work sales and can care less if someone rejects my services. You need the same mind frame for this job.

                May 18, 2008                            



I’d like to throw in my thoughts as someone who has recently joined Primerica.  First of all here are the reasons I joined.
1.)  Hours are mine to make.
2.)  Yes, my upline gets paid via my sales, but to me that’s a way I can ensure I get the proper training and support(i.e. if I succeed, my coach/upline succeeds).
3.)  I really do want to help people get out of debt.
4.)  Primerica has been around a long time and is part of Citi – a reputable company.
5.)  Primerica is audited by the states to make sure its reps are licensed and are practicing good business.
6.)  On a personal note I don’t have any financial knowledge, but in the few weeks of attending training classes I’ve learned many things in a way I can understand them.  I’ve put into practice some of the things I’ve learned, so I can see for myself if they work before recommending them to others.
7.) My wife and I had an FNA done for us, and for the first time in our lives, we actually had a salesperson in our house who didn’t pressure us to buy.  We were not even asked to buy.  As someone who hates pressure sales, I liked knowing I didn’t have to do that as a rep.
Now for all of you naysayers:
1.)  Recruiting is encouraged, however, in the same way I wasn’t pressured to join Primerica I will NOT pressure others.  Even though I’m new, I’ve already invited some people I know, but I only make one invitation. Furthermore, as mentiones in other posts, ALL companies recruit to grow the business.
2.)  I can’t speak for other states, but in taking the Life Insurance class here for Illinois, licensed Life Insurance Producers, I learned recently, can only present facts about other agencies.  Bad-mouthing other agencies is ILLEGAL.  Please review what your state’s rules are, if you are licensed and are bad-mouthing Primerica.  SHAME ON YOU!!
3.)  Unfortunately there are going to be bad employees in all companies.  It’s too bad these bad apples ruin the rest of the company.  Name me any company, and I’m sure there are people out there with complaints about them.  I for one am determined to watch out for the interests of my clients – – Period – – even if it’s at the expense of a Primerica product.  Hey, I may work for Primerica, but they do NOT own me.
4.) As with ALL things, Primerica may not be for everyone whether it’s being a rep or a client of Primerica.  I would hope clients are investigating and crunching the numbers on their own to determine if a Primerica product will work for them instead of just taking my word.  In fact, I will encourage them to do so.
5.)  My wife and I did have Whole Life Insurance at one point, and we were paying over $300-$400 per month.  OUCH!  That wasn’t for us, so we canceled and purchased Term through my Mom, who works for another Insurance Company.  Yes, my Mom knows I’ve joined Primerica, and she’s okay with it.
6.)  It’s good to see the VP’s of the company excited about their job and company.  Although this may freak some people, I’ve seen the same things at Wal-mart and Target where they have done team cheers right there where the customers can see them.
Anyway that’s all I have to say for now.  Thanks for reading!

Well Mr. Thomas said it straight. Many of you look at becoming and RVP and above. Do you ever ask why people who attain those position leave PFS? Remember recruits=Sales. I don’t think Primerica allows advanement with personal production, unless things have changed.
Joe R. Citi is currently trying to sell Primerica. being new to the industry your going to learn a few things especially if you consistantly view message boards. You say “I for one am determined to watch out for the interests of my clients – – Period – – even if it’s at the expense of a Primerica product. Hey, I may work for Primerica, but they do NOT own me.”
The thing is you don’t work for Primerica. Your an independent contractor who markets Primerica products per agreement. You see there’s many people who get sold on the coming into the business to really help people by offering education and great products. 
The problem is when some people find out that their are more competitive products and better compensation that can be had with the same licenses that can be used with different companies.
Get your liceses, and yes Primerica does own you. Try to sell another companies products or ask what can you take with you if you leave PFS. These things arn’t bad mouthing Primerica they are things you can look up in your agent agreement. Been there, done that..

Ask your cousin or your RVP, if you built a team and you decided to leave Primerica for another opportunity, what can you take with you? Just remember who brought in the downline and who trained the downline.
As far as the license go people do own their license. Ask them who owns the downline and what does it take for an agent to have ownership? 
Your best appointments are from your warm market or from a referral. I would mention buying leads, but in those cases you may have to contend with an independent agent.

XL,
     Just wanted to clarify my thoughts as I also like to state facts.
 – Regarding the incident in Bountiful, UT, if the reps and RVP committed a crime, they should be punished.  Like I stated above, and you implied by stating we are responsible for our success, there are “bad apples” in all companies.  Fortunately, each State regulates insurance business, so each producer and company will be held accountable.  Furthermore, you refer to the incident in Utah as an alleged offense (meaning the verdict is still out), but are quick to stain the reputation of the company.  As I just stated, if they are guilty they should be punished.  What company do you work for?  I’m sure there is a less than 100% satisfaction; there can’t be perfect companies with imperfect people working there.
 – Regaring my comment about “bad mouthing”, I stated that licensed Insurance Producers here in Illinois cannot defame another agency or its products.  That’s what I learned in both Pre-licensing classes I took (one in ’94 and one this past weekend).  It’s not my opinion; it’s law.  It applies only to those who are licensed.  If you disagree with this law, try to get it changed.  If you don’t care about this law and are licensed in Illinois, send me your name and defame any other insurance company of your choosing in writing, and I will forward that on to the Director of Insurance.  This way we can see whose opinion counts in the end.
 – If you’re commenting on my thinking I know everything, I actually didn’t say that.  As a matter of fact I was clear to state I am new to Primerica.  This statement should imply I am still learning about the company and its products.  It shouldn’t lead one to believe I know or think I know everything.
 – If you’re commenting on my desire to see my clients do their own homework and crunch numbers on their own, you’ll see that the reason I said that is because I don’t want them to just take my word for it.  I never said I wouldn’t be willing to help them; that is an assumption.  I give people more credit than perhaps others.
 – Regarding other comments about getting paid higher elsewhere, I wouldn’t doubt that.  I know up front what percent I am to receive as a Rep, and I’m okay with it.  I know for a fact that the competitor of the company I work at on a full time basis pays its employees higher.  However I don’t have plans on leaving because I know where I stand with my present employer and because there are perks that my present company give me that the other wouldn’t.  Likewise I’m trying Primerica for my own reasons; it’s NOT just about money with me.
Thanks for reading!

I work for a MAJOR corpoation that has been around about 45 years. In the past couple of years all of us “little people” have been instructed to recruit new people. I also happen to be one of the people asked to train these folks. Both of these duties are outside of my job description. I was never hired to do either of these things. I don’t make a dime extra for all the people I have brought in and helped train. Lately, those same new recruits have been used to replace the folks with tenure….gee, I wonder why? That’s corporate America(by the way, this is a very well respected company). Now, THAT is a scam if I ever heard one. I have been working for Primerica part time for the past couple of months and I am very happy. I am still in the licensing phase of the employment process. I am curious to see if I can make it based on what I ALONE produce. I was skeptical at first, but I had to change my way of thinking. What is wrong with presenting someone with an opportunty to make more money? I don’t mind that the person who trained me gets a piece of my action, because I will get a piece of the action from those I sign on and they off of their folks….Where I am(my full time job), we have a few fat cats making the lions share of the money off of our backs. It is a pyramid with all the money going to the top. I have no problem with spending $99.00 to get some very expensive licensing. Also, the office I work out of have been nothing but first class to me. They are just regular people who seem to enjoy doing the right thing and they are making money doing it. What more can I ask for? I hope it works out. I hate the snobby view that regular folks can’t learn how money and insurance works. I get suspicious when I am lead to believe that I am too dumb to understand. I would rather talk to someone in my kitchen that go to a fancy office building that I know is being funded from money I am sure they are screwing me out of. Just my opinion….

I have a friend with them also and I totally agree with your comment about being brainwashed. He eats, sleeps, breathes, and dreams Primerica. We can’t even have normal conversations anymore without him trying to convinve me to join this company. I really think they are brainwashed into using the same statements and into behaving in this manner. They are like tics in one’s flesh.

just remembered that i would follow up and post after some appointments…
I am enjoying it so far, things have went well. I’ve made some money; far more than what i’ve put in… Haven’t quite covered the time i’ve put in but i’m going to do 3 life sales in a couple of days so in addition to a couple of other things in the works that will probable get me close to compensating my time.
I’m not sure where all this energy comes from to spend time writing blogs trying to discourage people from primerica. trolling around these blogs and parroting the same exact things over and over.
I’ve found it to be exactly what I thought it to be and much more. Of course our office is pretty incredible…
When you work with a family and they almost have tears in their eyes as they thank you for what you’ve done to educate them and help them. That’s worth more than the money that you make from it to me. Of course some people are beyond help or don’t need your help. 
to address some of the “negatives” that are repeated thousands of times on the net…
1. captive agent – yes I signed a contract with a no-compete clause. If you work for Primerica you will too. If you don’t like that then don’t do it… I decided if i’m going to do this kind of work it’ll be with primerica and nobody else anyway.
2. You can make more at other places besides primerica – Maybe that is true when you talk about starting out in one aspect of the business. True it’s possible to start your own independent office and make more money than starting with primerica and working your way up. Get you certifications, licenses pay a big licensing fee with whoever you join to use their name, etc… I have no interest to open an edward jones office or my own independent office. I don’t have the ability or the resources. With primerica, less risk/less reward at first, i get to “give it my best shot” part time, and If i am good at what i do, I have a chance to have my own office and have a 6 figure income. It takes hard work and dedication to getting in front of people.
3. “you can get it cheaper” – There’s always a cheaper price for anything. I’ve been to the term quote sites and checked pricing. You get a big difference in price from the top to bottom of the results list. So does that mean the bottom of the list is a “rip-off?” No, that’s just their price for your class and group that you fit in. 
that’s enough said.
I joined because I like the financial services industry, couldn’t make a transition to a full time to some other company so Primerica was perfect for me…
I pretty much dismiss all the critics online not because I don’t think they have valid arguments but because they obviously have deeper motivations to repeat over and over again the same things that they’ve said many other times and others have said.
I don’t really have time for that so this will probably be my last post… I used to wonder why some of the successful ones in Primerica didn’t respond to posts like this but now I can see why after i’ve been around some of them… 
If your considering Primerica, i’d say try it out and see what happens, you may like it and it may work out great for you. On the other hand it may not be for you or you may not be the right fit for Primerica… i’m not afraid to try…
I’m getting my Sr Rep promotion and well on my way to District promotion…  We’ll see what happens….

                June 2, 2008                            



Mr Thomas: please don’t inform the PFS people about the renewals they may be missing out on with a disability or Long Term Care Sale. As independent
contractors with PFS agents are not employees and
PFS or the agent has the right to terminate the contract at anytime.
With that being said. Knowing what you know now, is it
in the best interest of your family to have Primerica products or should you get the best available product that is suitable for your family situation? So you understand cost per 1000 and how it pertains to the amount of coverage you can purchase right?
It’s that old question again… Where is your loyalty? To your family, yourself, your friends, or to your upline and company? Take the Banner challenge and act like the client is your mother. That’s what I did and I just couldn’t drink the kool-aid anymore. See you at the top.

Respectfully, I really don’t care what you think. I just don’t like it when folks like yourself pee on my leg and tell me it’s raining and that the difference between you and I is that you “care” about the client. 
I just dumped the EXPENSIVE whole life policies that a family member, you know, a pro sold me(lol!). I feel I am much better off. I can’t wait to get my IRA moved from the “professional” that I have it placed with right now…By the way, I never hear from this guy. I guess he is too busy caring about me to bother to call.
The reason why I am responding to you is that I keep getting alerts when more posts are up and I can’t help but read. Can’t help but respond either! 
Don’t be so hostile, it’s all good….we will never agree and that’s okay.

As a Primerica agent if your client showed you this what would you say? Remember the rule of 72? Remember you do what’s right 100% of the time.
I used this one because I couldn’t get a PFS quote with other situations. This is to be used just as an example. PFS agents have just one company to compete against an independent. Yes we know. If not you, who?
If this were you and you had limited funds, whould you just get the PFS policy or shop? Remember before you answer your an independent contractor with PFS, not an employee. There’s no requirement to purchase Primerica products..Let the spin begin.
Oh wait go back and change the premium from annual to monthly..Maybe now you will get why some of us left. That’s just one example..

Well, nice to see the monkeys performing.  I’m going to clear up a few things here.  First, Primerica is commonly mistaken for a MLM.  According to FTC regulations a multi level marketing company is required to register as such.  Primerica registers as a general agency, no different than State Farm–not an MLM.  
Second, like it or not, the opportunity to make more money to bridge the income shortfall that many middle-class families have today is one of the best things that a Primerica agent can offer, products aside.  Think about it–you can re-arrange the deckchairs on the Titanic all you want…that ship’s still going down.  If after delivering and FNA with a proper budget worksheet analysis (which EVERY ONE of my fellow PFS agents SHOULD BE DOING EVERY TIME, and shame on you if you’re not), you find that the family is $500-$1000 a month short on income (and having to use Visa to bridge that gap right now), then think about it.  Do you not have an income-earning opportunity to offer?  
See, I said OFFER!  I’ve had many families tell me “no thanks” after “trying to recruit them” as many of you put it.  I feel bad for those who choose to just let the ship go down rather than explore the opportunity to make some extra part time money, but I certainly don’t feel bad for too long.  The truth is that anyone CAN do really well in Primerica–not everyone WILL.  It’s a choice.  And truth be told, if they don’t do it here, then they probably wont do it anywhere else either.  The numbers speak volumes in Primerica–too many people have become wildly successful in PFS to dismiss it’s validity.  I have yet to find another company on the planet that has more 6-figure earners.  Maybe someone can enlighten me. 
There’s a serious amount of people out there who would rather spend time in their comfort zone making excuses as to why they’re in the financial mess that they’re in.  You can ridicule Primerica all you want, but if what you’re currently doing isn’t getting you the results you want, then maybe it’s time to try something else.

I find it interesting that I used facts and you attacked me with heresay and oppinion.  “…and recruit them into a longshot opportunity that hasn’t worked for anyone but the old timers…”  Please tell me how you back up that statement with facts?
“…Isn’t it time you stop selling a “pipe dream” to your downlines. TRULY look at your downline team and ask them if PFS is really proving them with a sustainable business and income?”  You dont know me or my team, nor do you know how successful any of us are.  Sounds like heresay and oppinion to me.
Michael, I find it incredibly hard to believe that after 17 years in PFS you can say with a straight face that your highest income attained has anything to do with the company’s system or it’s products.  Primerica is (was) the same for you as it is for Doug Hartman.  And you’ve got 29 year-old Brandon Neil out in St George, Utah who is about to go over $900K in income and he’s only been in Primerica 8 years.  The SAME Primerica you were in.  Unless he has a third arm or something like that, it sounds to me like you have no one but yourself to thank for your income.  Seriously, grow up and take some responsibility.







 I got away from the cult

                June 7, 2008                            



Does any PFSer have a rebuttal for the following claim from another website that says the SMART loan is nothing but smoke & mirrors?:
The BIG Smoke & Mirrors loan—SMART Loan.
If you want to pay your mortgage off in 20 years, the mortgage industry (including Citimortgage) has something to accommodate that—it’s called a 20 year mortgage. I wish I had the time to go through the numbers right now, but you all can check it for yourself. Run any SMART loan scenario’s total annual payment (including the 26 payments) against a 20-year fixed loan with a “normal” interest rate and you’ll find that the regular old 20 year loan will have a lower:
payment monthly/annually
total payment to finish the loan
fees to get the loan
NO pre-payment penalty
Comparing to a 30 year loan, the SMART loan will accelerate the payment, no question about it. Do you HAVE to have a 30 year loan to begin with? NO!!
Also, the simple interest thing will DESTROY you if you’re ever late. The same power of simple interest saving you money when you pay bi-weekly, hurts you when you miss a payment. The interest compounds DAILY.
So, if anyone’s argument is that the client doesn’t want to be “committed” to a 20 year loan, here’s my rebuttal:
If they can’t afford my 20 year theory, they can’t afford your bi-weekly payment either. They can always get a HELOC in case times are tough and they can’t make the payment. It’ll be a lot cheaper than adding simple interest to their mortgage, NSF fees at the bank and being locked up by HUGE pre-payment penalties.
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX
As for the “opportunity”, anyone that is bright enough to beat the enormous attrition rate that Primerica has can easily get a job that pays a salary. The person won’t have to annoy their friends and family trying to recruit them and finally will be able to offer clients less expensive products, with better features.

Michael, “…Maybe you are making all the income you want, with the freedoms you deservce. Maybe all your downlines are supporting their familes with their PFS income. I wasn’t. And my downlines were’t. I could no long stand up on a Thursday night OPP meeting and sell the dream while I was living a nightmare. I was getting to the point that was almost envious of people that had a “good job” and were making consistent income. Bad times.”
Just because you didn’t achieve the success in Primerica that you were looking for doesn’t mean that someone else can’t either.  I’m living proof of that, and countless others as well (as you know PFS doesn’t hide income levels – it’s all right there on POL).  I’m very happy that you were able to find your niche.  I’m happy for you that you’re making good money as an independent agent, and that’s really all that counts, right?
If you re-read my posts, I never said that PFS was any better than another business, vehicle, or system.  I only said that it works.  For the right person, it works really well.  And anyone can BECOME the right person, if they choose to do so–you are not a victim.  If Primerica didn’t work for you, then go elsewhere, but don’t discourage someone else who is excited about getting involved from doing it–you may be talking the next PFS SNSD out of getting there.
How you feel about PFS is not really relevant when someone asks you if you think that they should or shouldn’t do the business.  You know, I had a Mercedes S500 for 9 months–that thing was in the shop all the time.  Now, I could tell people what a crappy car Mercedes is, or I could just tell the truth–I had a bad experience with mine, but based on MB’s track record of success and lengthy history, I think you stand a pretty good shot at owning a very fine automobile.  Doesn’t THAT sound like a better reaction than “Dont buy one of those pieces of crap!  I had one and they suck!”
Now, a mature adult would approach Primerica the same way, right?  How about saying: “You know, I had a bad experience with Primerica, but if you do your research you will find that there are many, many people who have achieved financial independence.  It’s not going to be easy, but nothing worthwhile ever is.  You should give it a look, and if you decide to do it, make sure that you put some REAL effort into learning the business and getting great at it.  You will find that there are many agents in Primerica who never make much money, but there are too many successful people in that company to lead me to believe that it doesn’t work.  Instead of asking the people who didn’t make it big why they didn’t, ask the people who ARE successful how they did it?  If you don’t like what you hear, then move on to something else–it’s your prerogative, right?  What you should do is find out for yourself if you have what it takes, or are willing to develop what it takes, to do really well there.  What have you really got to lose, anyway?  By the way, I hope that it works out for you–you deserve to win!”
Doesn’t that sound better?

Just make an appointment to get all the facts.







 Dave

                June 12, 2008                            



Michael,
You said: “Wonderful for you. You are a better man than me. It didn’t work for me, nor for anyone in my Base.”
I am not a better man than you.  You found something that was better for you, and capitalized on it (going independent).  For that I am happy.  I am only more dedicated to making PFS work for me than you were.  Second, it’s not that PFS didn’t work for you, or the people in your base–I think we both know that’s not it.  You just probably fell under bad leadership, and/or were probably taught the system incorrectly.  It’s not Primerica’s fault that you didn’t do the things necessary to become more successful.  Primerica paid you $86K in your best year because you put forth $86K worth of effort in the years preceding that.  People earn EXACTLY what they’re worth in Primerica, like it or not.
Then you said: “As for “others” in PFS…. There are 100,000 Reps or so, and 4,000 make $50k. $2,500 (part of the 4,000) make $100k. Point: There are 5,000 RVPs and only 4,000 make $50k.”
How is this any different from the W2 world?  According to the IRS website less than 2% of all individual tax returns filed in 2007 were over $100,000 gross income.  About the same % of licensed reps that make $100K here.  The biggest difference between making $100K in PFS vs. as an employee–you are your own boss here and you call the shots.  In my opinion, it’s pretty hard to put a price on that.  Oh, and the fact that I pay about 8% in taxes instead of the 28% I’d have to pay as an employee.
You said: “And at PFS they actually think $100k is a lot of money. It’s not.”
Your statement is based on your opinion–not on fact.  Actually, I hear all the time in this business how $100K is the starting point.  Almost everyone in PFS knows that if you make $100K no one knows who you are.  I tell my reps all the time that $100K is minimum wage in Primerica.
You said: “OF COURSE how I feel about PFS is relevant!!! They asked ME! If you had a bad experience with your S class, and someone asks you your opinion, or it comes up in conversation, you ARE SUPPOSED to give your experience and opinion! (By the way, I have a E350 2008 and love it). I refuse to be “politically correct”. If have an particular experience and opinion about PFS – I will share it. Period.”
I believe you would have better understood what I was getting at here had you read the entire post.  Your opinion of Primerica has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it works, or could work for the person who asks you about it.  Be a grown-up and share your experience with the disclaimer that “while I wasn’t able to achieve the amount of success that I wanted to, you are not me, and your experience may differ.  You should explore the facts and ask the people who ARE making big money how they did it.  You’ll get your answers that way, and then you can make your decision based on those facts, and not just on how I happen to view the company.”
And you said: “Again, bottom line: better products, cheaper products, more commission for the rep, more freedom and immediate ownership. And a lot of small things…. truly have your own company (as opposed to a ‘branch’ of PFS’), outside business interests, no annual auditing, no “conventions” that are useless and cost a ton of money, free reign to do advertising (billboards, Internet, newspapers etc), no requirement to maintain an office. It’s sooooooooooooooooooooooo good to be free. Really.”
And you missed it AGAIN.  Allow me to quote myself from my previous post: “I never said that PFS was any better than another business, vehicle, or system. I only said that it works. For the right person, it works really well.”
I’m happy that you found something that was a fit for you.  This isn’t a pissing contest to see whose business is better than whose.  I like Green, while you may like yellow.  does that make me right and you wrong?  No, it only means that we are different.  
For those of you who are considering joining Primerica, meet with an RVP, one on one, and ask them to give you all of the information that you want/need to make a decision.  Attend a business orientation to see if you like the environment.  And finally, remember that you have almost nothing to lose by trying.  If you don’t like it/aren’t good at it, well then you can always go back and get a job, and be just like everyone else.

How I Got Out Of The Rat Race
April 10, 2017  by Bob


A little over a year ago I ventured out into self-employment after spending much of the previous decade in the “Rat Race”. For most of that time I was a glorified pencil-pusher in the corporate abyss of a Fortune 500 company.
Now that I have spent over a year working for myself I can’t imagine doing anything else. For as trapped and held down as I felt before, I feel the opposite extreme of the joy of freedom. Just to be clear, self-employment has it’s own challenges and difficulties, but I honestly think they pale in comparison to what I went through while spinning my wheels in the Rat Race.

I am currently reading Your Money or Your Life – which is a great book by the way. And I won’t turn this article into a review of the book since I haven’t finished it yet, but one of the things that I found very valuable the other day was calculating your real hourly wage. It’s not as simple as saying, “I make $400 a week and work 40 hours, therefore I make $10/hr.” When you factor in all the additional expenses of having your job (which some may not be obvious) that you could avoid if you didn’t have that particular job, you begin to see the value in this calculation.

Business model
Primerica, Inc. is an insurance and financial services company that uses multi-level marketing[8] to sell financial products and services.
Headquartered in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia,[9][10] Primerica spun off from its former parent company Citi through an initial public offering on April 1, 2010. It is a financial services marketing organization in North America with approximately 116,827 independent representatives,[11][7] including 22,000 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Series 6 licensed[2] through Primerica's securities broker-dealer affiliate PFS Investments, Inc. in the United States, and through PFSL Investments Canada Ltd. in Canada. The company focuses on the sale of term life insurance,[2] as well as providing other financial products and services including mutual funds, annuities, segregated funds, managed accounts, long-term care insurance, pre-paid legal services, auto insurance, home insurance, credit monitoring and debt management plans. The company has more than 4.3 million life insurance clients and over 2 million client investment accounts.[11]
History
Founded in 1977 by Arthur L. Williams Jr. as A.L. Williams & Associates (A.L. Williams), the company established its base by mass-marketing the concept of "Buy Term and Invest the Difference."[5] With "BTID" the company illustrated how its mostly middle-income client base could purchase sufficient protection with term life insurance and systematically save and invest in separate investment vehicles, such as mutual fund Individual Retirement Accounts.[2] A.L. Williams was initially established as a privately held general agency, at first selling term life insurance policies underwritten by Financial Assurance, Inc. (FAI).
The company expanded, outgrowing the capacity of FAI to process its business. In 1980, A.L. Williams entered into a contract with Boston-based Massachusetts Indemnity and Life Insurance Company (MILICO), a larger underwriter of life insurance, whose parent was PennCorp Financial Services based in Santa Monica. To support A.L. Williams headquartered in Atlanta, MILICO established a regional office in that city. In 1981, the company established First American National Corporation (later renamed The A.L. Williams Corporation) as a holding company for First American Life Insurance (later renamed A.L. Williams Life Insurance Company) and First American National Securities (later renamed PFS Investments, Inc). In 1982, The A.L. Williams Corporation (ALWC) underwrote a public stock offering, listed in the Over the Counter (OTC) market under the symbol ALWC. In 1983, the company became listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the same symbol.
Origin of Primerica name
PennCorp's growth due to MILICO's underwriting caught the attention of Bill Woodside, Chairman & CEO of American Can Company, a former Dow Jones 30 blue chip can and container producing company based in Greenwich, Connecticut founded in 1901.[12] Due to the growing rise of plastic as a replacement for aluminum cans, the company looked to acquire financial services providers and move away from the dying manufacturing industry, having acquired life insurance holding company Associated Madison from Gerry Tsai Jr in 1982. With this acquisition Woodside created a new financial services division for American Can and hired Tsai, who succeeded him as Chairman & CEO, as the new head.
In September 1982, American Can and PennCorp signed a merger agreement.
In 1983, the merger was finalized, making American Can the parent company of PennCorp and MILICO, signing a new contract with ALWC through the year 2000. In 1986 Nelson Peltz's Triangle Industries bought American Can's packaging division, along with rights to the name of the company. Therefore, on March 6, 1987 American Can announced that it would change its 86-year-old name to Primerica Corporation,[13] hence giving birth to the new and currently recognized name "Primerica."
Acquisition by Commercial Credit
The newly named Primerica Corporation targeted Smith Barney as the first significant purchase that moved the company completely into financial services with the May 1987 announcement of its intent to buy the Wall Street brokerage for $750 million,[14] which would later end up as Primerica's sister company under Citigroup in 1998.[15]
In 1985, ALWC began the procedure to open business in Canada. After encountering legal and cultural roadblocks to expanding outside the United States, ALWC began selling insurance products of Pennsylvania Life Insurance Company, a Primerica subsidiary, in Canada in 1986.
On November 30, 1988, ALWC acquired MILICO from Primerica Corporation through a stock merger acquisition for 44.58 million shares of ALWC stock, making Primerica Corporation the majority shareholder of ALWC. In December 1988, Sanford Weill's Commercial Credit acquired Primerica Corporation for $1.54 billion, retaining the Primerica name. At this time, the major businesses under Primerica Corporation were A.L. Williams, Smith Barney and Commercial Credit. On February 6, 1989, Primerica Corporation began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Travelers and Citigroup era
In November 1989, Primerica purchased the remaining 30% of ALWC that it did not previously own and the privately held General Agent, A.L. Williams, Inc. In 1991, Primerica Corporation changed the name of A.L. Williams to Primerica Financial Services. The following year MILICO, Primerica's life insurance underwriter, changed its name to Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its broker-dealer FANS changed to PFS Investments, Inc.[15]
In December 1993, Primerica acquired the remaining 73% of Travelers Insurance Corporation and adopted the name Travelers Inc., which was changed to Travelers Group the following year.[15] Travelers Group included Primerica Financial Services, Smith Barney, Travelers Life and Annuity, Travelers Property/Casualty, Commercial Credit and other financial businesses.
Joe Plumeri was Chairman and CEO of Primerica Financial Services from 1995 to 1999.[16][17][18] In 1998, Primerica had net income of $398 million on net sales of $1.65 billion, compared to a 1994 $209 million net income on net sales of $1.28 billion.[19]
In December 1997, Primerica announced it was going to begin offering pre-paid legal through Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc., at the time both subsidiaries of Travelers Group, Inc.[20]
In 1998, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) censured and fined PFS Investments Inc., the securities arm for Primerica, for failure to properly supervise a group of registered representatives in Dearborn, Michigan. The SEC found that PFS Investments Inc. had failed to have in place effective policies and procedures to follow up adequately on three complaints received about the Dearborn registered representatives, "selling away" activities. Prior to the SEC's ruling, PFS Investments Inc. hired an independent consultant to review its supervisory and compliance policies and procedures to prevent and detect violations of the federal securities laws. By the date of the ruling, PFS Investments reported it had complied with the final recommendations made by the independent consultant.[21]
In 1998, Travelers Group and banking giant Citicorp merged creating Citigroup (NYSE: C). Primerica and its affiliates continued to operate as subsidiaries of Citigroup, although the Travelers insurance business was spun off in 2002. Along with Primerica, other major brand names under Citigroup included Citibank, CitiFinancial, Citicorp Trust Bank, Smith Barney, and Banamex.
Long-time veteran executives John Addison and Rick Williams, whom Art Williams quoted in his book Coach as "two true sons of A.L. Williams",[22] were hired as co-CEOs in 2000, with Glen Williams promoted to President in 2005.
Separation from Citi
Citigroup attempted to sell Primerica in 2008,[23] having received several bids from life insurance companies and private equity firms interested in buying.[24][25] At the time the market value of the company was estimated to be $7 billion, roughly 15 times its annual earnings[26] and Citi was trying to match various bidders in groups that could bid for the unit together. Initially, a sale to JC Flowers & Co. LLC and Protective Life Corp was underway until the deal was canceled last minute for publicly undisclosed reasons.[27]
In May 2009 the Primerica executive team led by co-CEOs John Addison and Rick Williams approached private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co. yet again, as well as Blackstone Group LP and TPG Inc [23] in a new attempt to have the company bought, a plan which Citigroup did not endorse.[28]
Initial public offering
On November 5, 2009 Citi announced that it intended to spin off Primerica through an initial public offering.[29] The Primerica executive and legal team filed an S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),[30] having officially publicly announced the intention of becoming a public company. Citi would claim all profit from the primary offering, as well as continue to receive income from a significant portion of existing Primerica business,[31] with Citi Holdings CEO Michael Corbit claiming the move to be "the best separation alternative for this franchise.[29]
Primerica filed[32] a final amended S-1 and preliminary prospectus with the SEC on March 17, 2010, indicating that it will offer 18 million shares[33] to the public through the IPO, with underwriters having the option to purchase an additional 2.7 million shares. The first trading occurred on April 1, 2010. Initially, the expected share price was in the $12 – $14 range, having ended up being priced $15 a share on March 31, 2010,[34] resulting in Citi raising 27 percent or $30 million more than $290 million projected through the IPO by selling 3.36 million more shares than the anticipated 18 million.[35] The first day of trading saw the stock surge 31 percent to end up closing at $19.65 a share.[36] In a separate offering, Private equity firm Warburg Pincus has bought 17.2 million shares, resulting in a 23 percent stake in Primerica, and up to 33 percent if Warburg decides to exercise warrants to purchase an additional 4.3 million shares from Citi. Following the IPO, Citi's stake was between 32 percent and 46 percent and expected to divest its interest in Primerica "as soon as possible"[37] to fulfill its original goal of raising cash by shedding assets to improve financial performance.
On December 19, 2011, Citigroup sold its remaining equity stake in Primerica (approximately 8 million shares of Primerica's common stock), completing the separation from Citi.[38]
Awards
Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its New York subsidiary, National Benefit Life, have received several awards from A. M. Best, Standard & Poor's and the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association (IMSA) for their financial strength, high standards and quality business.[39][40][41]
Primerica has also received awards for Customer Service.[42][43][44]

Business model
Primerica, Inc. is an insurance and financial services company that uses multi-level marketing[8] to sell financial products and services.
Headquartered in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia,[9][10] Primerica spun off from its former parent company Citi through an initial public offering on April 1, 2010. It is a financial services marketing organization in North America with approximately 116,827 independent representatives,[11][7] including 22,000 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Series 6 licensed[2] through Primerica's securities broker-dealer affiliate PFS Investments, Inc. in the United States, and through PFSL Investments Canada Ltd. in Canada. The company focuses on the sale of term life insurance,[2] as well as providing other financial products and services including mutual funds, annuities, segregated funds, managed accounts, long-term care insurance, pre-paid legal services, auto insurance, home insurance, credit monitoring and debt management plans. The company has more than 4.3 million life insurance clients and over 2 million client investment accounts.[11]
History
Founded in 1977 by Arthur L. Williams Jr. as A.L. Williams & Associates (A.L. Williams), the company established its base by mass-marketing the concept of "Buy Term and Invest the Difference."[5] With "BTID" the company illustrated how its mostly middle-income client base could purchase sufficient protection with term life insurance and systematically save and invest in separate investment vehicles, such as mutual fund Individual Retirement Accounts.[2] A.L. Williams was initially established as a privately held general agency, at first selling term life insurance policies underwritten by Financial Assurance, Inc. (FAI).
The company expanded, outgrowing the capacity of FAI to process its business. In 1980, A.L. Williams entered into a contract with Boston-based Massachusetts Indemnity and Life Insurance Company (MILICO), a larger underwriter of life insurance, whose parent was PennCorp Financial Services based in Santa Monica. To support A.L. Williams headquartered in Atlanta, MILICO established a regional office in that city. In 1981, the company established First American National Corporation (later renamed The A.L. Williams Corporation) as a holding company for First American Life Insurance (later renamed A.L. Williams Life Insurance Company) and First American National Securities (later renamed PFS Investments, Inc). In 1982, The A.L. Williams Corporation (ALWC) underwrote a public stock offering, listed in the Over the Counter (OTC) market under the symbol ALWC. In 1983, the company became listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the same symbol.
Origin of Primerica name
PennCorp's growth due to MILICO's underwriting caught the attention of Bill Woodside, Chairman & CEO of American Can Company, a former Dow Jones 30 blue chip can and container producing company based in Greenwich, Connecticut founded in 1901.[12] Due to the growing rise of plastic as a replacement for aluminum cans, the company looked to acquire financial services providers and move away from the dying manufacturing industry, having acquired life insurance holding company Associated Madison from Gerry Tsai Jr in 1982. With this acquisition Woodside created a new financial services division for American Can and hired Tsai, who succeeded him as Chairman & CEO, as the new head.
In September 1982, American Can and PennCorp signed a merger agreement.
In 1983, the merger was finalized, making American Can the parent company of PennCorp and MILICO, signing a new contract with ALWC through the year 2000. In 1986 Nelson Peltz's Triangle Industries bought American Can's packaging division, along with rights to the name of the company. Therefore, on March 6, 1987 American Can announced that it would change its 86-year-old name to Primerica Corporation,[13] hence giving birth to the new and currently recognized name "Primerica."
Acquisition by Commercial Credit
The newly named Primerica Corporation targeted Smith Barney as the first significant purchase that moved the company completely into financial services with the May 1987 announcement of its intent to buy the Wall Street brokerage for $750 million,[14] which would later end up as Primerica's sister company under Citigroup in 1998.[15]
In 1985, ALWC began the procedure to open business in Canada. After encountering legal and cultural roadblocks to expanding outside the United States, ALWC began selling insurance products of Pennsylvania Life Insurance Company, a Primerica subsidiary, in Canada in 1986.
On November 30, 1988, ALWC acquired MILICO from Primerica Corporation through a stock merger acquisition for 44.58 million shares of ALWC stock, making Primerica Corporation the majority shareholder of ALWC. In December 1988, Sanford Weill's Commercial Credit acquired Primerica Corporation for $1.54 billion, retaining the Primerica name. At this time, the major businesses under Primerica Corporation were A.L. Williams, Smith Barney and Commercial Credit. On February 6, 1989, Primerica Corporation began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Travelers and Citigroup era
In November 1989, Primerica purchased the remaining 30% of ALWC that it did not previously own and the privately held General Agent, A.L. Williams, Inc. In 1991, Primerica Corporation changed the name of A.L. Williams to Primerica Financial Services. The following year MILICO, Primerica's life insurance underwriter, changed its name to Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its broker-dealer FANS changed to PFS Investments, Inc.[15]
In December 1993, Primerica acquired the remaining 73% of Travelers Insurance Corporation and adopted the name Travelers Inc., which was changed to Travelers Group the following year.[15] Travelers Group included Primerica Financial Services, Smith Barney, Travelers Life and Annuity, Travelers Property/Casualty, Commercial Credit and other financial businesses.
Joe Plumeri was Chairman and CEO of Primerica Financial Services from 1995 to 1999.[16][17][18] In 1998, Primerica had net income of $398 million on net sales of $1.65 billion, compared to a 1994 $209 million net income on net sales of $1.28 billion.[19]
In December 1997, Primerica announced it was going to begin offering pre-paid legal through Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc., at the time both subsidiaries of Travelers Group, Inc.[20]
In 1998, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) censured and fined PFS Investments Inc., the securities arm for Primerica, for failure to properly supervise a group of registered representatives in Dearborn, Michigan. The SEC found that PFS Investments Inc. had failed to have in place effective policies and procedures to follow up adequately on three complaints received about the Dearborn registered representatives, "selling away" activities. Prior to the SEC's ruling, PFS Investments Inc. hired an independent consultant to review its supervisory and compliance policies and procedures to prevent and detect violations of the federal securities laws. By the date of the ruling, PFS Investments reported it had complied with the final recommendations made by the independent consultant.[21]
In 1998, Travelers Group and banking giant Citicorp merged creating Citigroup (NYSE: C). Primerica and its affiliates continued to operate as subsidiaries of Citigroup, although the Travelers insurance business was spun off in 2002. Along with Primerica, other major brand names under Citigroup included Citibank, CitiFinancial, Citicorp Trust Bank, Smith Barney, and Banamex.
Long-time veteran executives John Addison and Rick Williams, whom Art Williams quoted in his book Coach as "two true sons of A.L. Williams",[22] were hired as co-CEOs in 2000, with Glen Williams promoted to President in 2005.
Separation from Citi
Citigroup attempted to sell Primerica in 2008,[23] having received several bids from life insurance companies and private equity firms interested in buying.[24][25] At the time the market value of the company was estimated to be $7 billion, roughly 15 times its annual earnings[26] and Citi was trying to match various bidders in groups that could bid for the unit together. Initially, a sale to JC Flowers & Co. LLC and Protective Life Corp was underway until the deal was canceled last minute for publicly undisclosed reasons.[27]
In May 2009 the Primerica executive team led by co-CEOs John Addison and Rick Williams approached private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co. yet again, as well as Blackstone Group LP and TPG Inc [23] in a new attempt to have the company bought, a plan which Citigroup did not endorse.[28]
Initial public offering
On November 5, 2009 Citi announced that it intended to spin off Primerica through an initial public offering.[29] The Primerica executive and legal team filed an S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),[30] having officially publicly announced the intention of becoming a public company. Citi would claim all profit from the primary offering, as well as continue to receive income from a significant portion of existing Primerica business,[31] with Citi Holdings CEO Michael Corbit claiming the move to be "the best separation alternative for this franchise.[29]
Primerica filed[32] a final amended S-1 and preliminary prospectus with the SEC on March 17, 2010, indicating that it will offer 18 million shares[33] to the public through the IPO, with underwriters having the option to purchase an additional 2.7 million shares. The first trading occurred on April 1, 2010. Initially, the expected share price was in the $12 – $14 range, having ended up being priced $15 a share on March 31, 2010,[34] resulting in Citi raising 27 percent or $30 million more than $290 million projected through the IPO by selling 3.36 million more shares than the anticipated 18 million.[35] The first day of trading saw the stock surge 31 percent to end up closing at $19.65 a share.[36] In a separate offering, Private equity firm Warburg Pincus has bought 17.2 million shares, resulting in a 23 percent stake in Primerica, and up to 33 percent if Warburg decides to exercise warrants to purchase an additional 4.3 million shares from Citi. Following the IPO, Citi's stake was between 32 percent and 46 percent and expected to divest its interest in Primerica "as soon as possible"[37] to fulfill its original goal of raising cash by shedding assets to improve financial performance.
On December 19, 2011, Citigroup sold its remaining equity stake in Primerica (approximately 8 million shares of Primerica's common stock), completing the separation from Citi.[38]
Awards
Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its New York subsidiary, National Benefit Life, have received several awards from A. M. Best, Standard & Poor's and the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association (IMSA) for their financial strength, high standards and quality business.[39][40][41]
Primerica has also received awards for Customer Service.[42][43][44]

Business model
Primerica, Inc. is an insurance and financial services company that uses multi-level marketing[8] to sell financial products and services.
Headquartered in unincorporated Gwinnett County, Georgia,[9][10] Primerica spun off from its former parent company Citi through an initial public offering on April 1, 2010. It is a financial services marketing organization in North America with approximately 116,827 independent representatives,[11][7] including 22,000 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Series 6 licensed[2] through Primerica's securities broker-dealer affiliate PFS Investments, Inc. in the United States, and through PFSL Investments Canada Ltd. in Canada. The company focuses on the sale of term life insurance,[2] as well as providing other financial products and services including mutual funds, annuities, segregated funds, managed accounts, long-term care insurance, pre-paid legal services, auto insurance, home insurance, credit monitoring and debt management plans. The company has more than 4.3 million life insurance clients and over 2 million client investment accounts.[11]
History
Founded in 1977 by Arthur L. Williams Jr. as A.L. Williams & Associates (A.L. Williams), the company established its base by mass-marketing the concept of "Buy Term and Invest the Difference."[5] With "BTID" the company illustrated how its mostly middle-income client base could purchase sufficient protection with term life insurance and systematically save and invest in separate investment vehicles, such as mutual fund Individual Retirement Accounts.[2] A.L. Williams was initially established as a privately held general agency, at first selling term life insurance policies underwritten by Financial Assurance, Inc. (FAI).
The company expanded, outgrowing the capacity of FAI to process its business. In 1980, A.L. Williams entered into a contract with Boston-based Massachusetts Indemnity and Life Insurance Company (MILICO), a larger underwriter of life insurance, whose parent was PennCorp Financial Services based in Santa Monica. To support A.L. Williams headquartered in Atlanta, MILICO established a regional office in that city. In 1981, the company established First American National Corporation (later renamed The A.L. Williams Corporation) as a holding company for First American Life Insurance (later renamed A.L. Williams Life Insurance Company) and First American National Securities (later renamed PFS Investments, Inc). In 1982, The A.L. Williams Corporation (ALWC) underwrote a public stock offering, listed in the Over the Counter (OTC) market under the symbol ALWC. In 1983, the company became listed on the NASDAQ exchange under the same symbol.
Origin of Primerica name
PennCorp's growth due to MILICO's underwriting caught the attention of Bill Woodside, Chairman & CEO of American Can Company, a former Dow Jones 30 blue chip can and container producing company based in Greenwich, Connecticut founded in 1901.[12] Due to the growing rise of plastic as a replacement for aluminum cans, the company looked to acquire financial services providers and move away from the dying manufacturing industry, having acquired life insurance holding company Associated Madison from Gerry Tsai Jr in 1982. With this acquisition Woodside created a new financial services division for American Can and hired Tsai, who succeeded him as Chairman & CEO, as the new head.
In September 1982, American Can and PennCorp signed a merger agreement.
In 1983, the merger was finalized, making American Can the parent company of PennCorp and MILICO, signing a new contract with ALWC through the year 2000. In 1986 Nelson Peltz's Triangle Industries bought American Can's packaging division, along with rights to the name of the company. Therefore, on March 6, 1987 American Can announced that it would change its 86-year-old name to Primerica Corporation,[13] hence giving birth to the new and currently recognized name "Primerica."
Acquisition by Commercial Credit
The newly named Primerica Corporation targeted Smith Barney as the first significant purchase that moved the company completely into financial services with the May 1987 announcement of its intent to buy the Wall Street brokerage for $750 million,[14] which would later end up as Primerica's sister company under Citigroup in 1998.[15]
In 1985, ALWC began the procedure to open business in Canada. After encountering legal and cultural roadblocks to expanding outside the United States, ALWC began selling insurance products of Pennsylvania Life Insurance Company, a Primerica subsidiary, in Canada in 1986.
On November 30, 1988, ALWC acquired MILICO from Primerica Corporation through a stock merger acquisition for 44.58 million shares of ALWC stock, making Primerica Corporation the majority shareholder of ALWC. In December 1988, Sanford Weill's Commercial Credit acquired Primerica Corporation for $1.54 billion, retaining the Primerica name. At this time, the major businesses under Primerica Corporation were A.L. Williams, Smith Barney and Commercial Credit. On February 6, 1989, Primerica Corporation began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Travelers and Citigroup era
In November 1989, Primerica purchased the remaining 30% of ALWC that it did not previously own and the privately held General Agent, A.L. Williams, Inc. In 1991, Primerica Corporation changed the name of A.L. Williams to Primerica Financial Services. The following year MILICO, Primerica's life insurance underwriter, changed its name to Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its broker-dealer FANS changed to PFS Investments, Inc.[15]
In December 1993, Primerica acquired the remaining 73% of Travelers Insurance Corporation and adopted the name Travelers Inc., which was changed to Travelers Group the following year.[15] Travelers Group included Primerica Financial Services, Smith Barney, Travelers Life and Annuity, Travelers Property/Casualty, Commercial Credit and other financial businesses.
Joe Plumeri was Chairman and CEO of Primerica Financial Services from 1995 to 1999.[16][17][18] In 1998, Primerica had net income of $398 million on net sales of $1.65 billion, compared to a 1994 $209 million net income on net sales of $1.28 billion.[19]
In December 1997, Primerica announced it was going to begin offering pre-paid legal through Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc., at the time both subsidiaries of Travelers Group, Inc.[20]
In 1998, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) censured and fined PFS Investments Inc., the securities arm for Primerica, for failure to properly supervise a group of registered representatives in Dearborn, Michigan. The SEC found that PFS Investments Inc. had failed to have in place effective policies and procedures to follow up adequately on three complaints received about the Dearborn registered representatives, "selling away" activities. Prior to the SEC's ruling, PFS Investments Inc. hired an independent consultant to review its supervisory and compliance policies and procedures to prevent and detect violations of the federal securities laws. By the date of the ruling, PFS Investments reported it had complied with the final recommendations made by the independent consultant.[21]
In 1998, Travelers Group and banking giant Citicorp merged creating Citigroup (NYSE: C). Primerica and its affiliates continued to operate as subsidiaries of Citigroup, although the Travelers insurance business was spun off in 2002. Along with Primerica, other major brand names under Citigroup included Citibank, CitiFinancial, Citicorp Trust Bank, Smith Barney, and Banamex.
Long-time veteran executives John Addison and Rick Williams, whom Art Williams quoted in his book Coach as "two true sons of A.L. Williams",[22] were hired as co-CEOs in 2000, with Glen Williams promoted to President in 2005.
Separation from Citi
Citigroup attempted to sell Primerica in 2008,[23] having received several bids from life insurance companies and private equity firms interested in buying.[24][25] At the time the market value of the company was estimated to be $7 billion, roughly 15 times its annual earnings[26] and Citi was trying to match various bidders in groups that could bid for the unit together. Initially, a sale to JC Flowers & Co. LLC and Protective Life Corp was underway until the deal was canceled last minute for publicly undisclosed reasons.[27]
In May 2009 the Primerica executive team led by co-CEOs John Addison and Rick Williams approached private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co. yet again, as well as Blackstone Group LP and TPG Inc [23] in a new attempt to have the company bought, a plan which Citigroup did not endorse.[28]
Initial public offering
On November 5, 2009 Citi announced that it intended to spin off Primerica through an initial public offering.[29] The Primerica executive and legal team filed an S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),[30] having officially publicly announced the intention of becoming a public company. Citi would claim all profit from the primary offering, as well as continue to receive income from a significant portion of existing Primerica business,[31] with Citi Holdings CEO Michael Corbit claiming the move to be "the best separation alternative for this franchise.[29]
Primerica filed[32] a final amended S-1 and preliminary prospectus with the SEC on March 17, 2010, indicating that it will offer 18 million shares[33] to the public through the IPO, with underwriters having the option to purchase an additional 2.7 million shares. The first trading occurred on April 1, 2010. Initially, the expected share price was in the $12 – $14 range, having ended up being priced $15 a share on March 31, 2010,[34] resulting in Citi raising 27 percent or $30 million more than $290 million projected through the IPO by selling 3.36 million more shares than the anticipated 18 million.[35] The first day of trading saw the stock surge 31 percent to end up closing at $19.65 a share.[36] In a separate offering, Private equity firm Warburg Pincus has bought 17.2 million shares, resulting in a 23 percent stake in Primerica, and up to 33 percent if Warburg decides to exercise warrants to purchase an additional 4.3 million shares from Citi. Following the IPO, Citi's stake was between 32 percent and 46 percent and expected to divest its interest in Primerica "as soon as possible"[37] to fulfill its original goal of raising cash by shedding assets to improve financial performance.
On December 19, 2011, Citigroup sold its remaining equity stake in Primerica (approximately 8 million shares of Primerica's common stock), completing the separation from Citi.[38]
Awards
Primerica Life Insurance Company, and its New York subsidiary, National Benefit Life, have received several awards from A. M. Best, Standard & Poor's and the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association (IMSA) for their financial strength, high standards and quality business.[39][40][41]
Primerica has also received awards for Customer Service.[42][43][44]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
