Find a Nationwide Insurance Agent in Keller, Texas
Nationwide auto insurance Keller’s packed greater metropolitan area means that there are a lot of people on the roads during the workweek rush hour.

There are also plenty of RVs, motorcycles, and other specialty vehicles enjoyed by residents across the city. Talk to one of our Keller auto insurance agents about your coverage and discover the services and products that have earned us a 95% member satisfaction rating.  Nationwide homeowners insurance Whether you’re protecting a home that’s been in the family for generations, or you’ve just bought a house in one of the city’s fledgling newer communities, it’s impossible to foresee every possible hazard. A Keller home insurance policy can help get you and your family back on their feet when covered damages occur. Along with the usual options included in a homeowner’s policy, you should inquire about our Brand New Belongings®, Better Roof Replacement®, and other Nationwide homeowner’s programs that can strengthen your coverage and your peace of mind.  Nationwide life insurance You know how people think they know Keller just because they’ve heard enough of the city’s folklore? It’s not all that different with life insurance.

Fortunately, our Keller life insurance agents have plenty of experience understanding the individual concerns of local families and their life insurance decisions.  Nationwide business insurance If you’re like a lot of Keller business owners we know, you’re constantly evaluating and worrying about the vulnerabilities facing your company. What risks keep you up at night? Broken windows and late night burglary? An employee or contractor getting in an accident with a company vehicle? Fire and/or flooding? Like so many things, we can’t prevent every instance of commercial loss, no matter how hard we try. Fortunately, our Keller business insurance agents can serve as risk management experts for companies in a variety of sizes and industries.  Online Quotes and Local Insurance Coverage In just minutes, you can input your zip and local insurance information to view personalized quotes.

A Word From Our CEO
BUILDING A BRAND

Priceline.com's brand has been built over the past decade and a half by world-class creative talent fueled by analytics. We continue to dig deep to truly understand what drives our consumer and build our brand around those insights in a breakthrough, differentiated and consistent way. The power of our brand impacts all of our marketing channels and we have some of the best minds in the industry creating and optimizing data-driven campaigns in the offline and online worlds."
- Brett Keller
CEO



A Word From Our SVP
EMPOWERMENT

						Priceline is a well-known company with a strong brand, and yet we're small enough where every individual can make a material contribution to the business. Every day our employees leverage data, technology, and their own creativity to develop innovative travel products for people around the world. It's really stimulating to work in a place where you are not only empowered, but expected to make a difference."
- Bill Jose
SVP, Rental Cars



A Word From Our SVP
EMPLOYEES

						Building a successful customer service organization starts with your employees. You find the right people and create an environment where employees love coming to work by giving them the proper tools, empowerment and motivation. These engaged employees love doing their job and customers take notice. Your customers will enjoy their experience and keep coming back to your organization. Repeat customers - this is good for business. And it all starts with your employees."
- Todd Provino
SVP, Customer Care



A Word From Our SVP
WORKING WITH SUPPLIERS

						Priceline.com is a great place to work. We have a unique combination of having a global reach, and global product complexity, which leads to a positive, intellectually challenging work environment. We also work with small teams so every employee is on the frontline. This is easily seen on the Hotels team where the average Sales Mgr maintains hundreds of critical supplier relationships. These relationships generate thousands of daily hotel deals helping to drive customer conversion/company profitability for Priceline.com and critical revenue for our hotel partners."
- Mark Koehler
SVP, Hotels

WELCOME
 To Brett & Kassie Keller's
WEBSITE






Brett and I were introduced to AdvoCare in September of 2011, and what a difference it has made in our lives in 6 short months! Together we have lost over 90 lbs and are both in the best shape of our lives. We started our AdvoCare journey on the 24 Day Challenge program that is sweeping the nation. I lost 15 pounds and Brett lost 12. In addition to the awesome weight loss, the amount of energy we both had was incredible! 
After experiencing our own product success, we began sharing the products with our closest friends and family members. We then quickly saw the amazing business opportunity and within a few months worked our way to the Silver leadership level, earning an extra $1000 per month PART TIME! 
From weight loss, to overall wellness, to sports performance, to skin care, AdvoCare has world class nutritional products for everyone! The products are formulated by an elite Scientific and Medical Advisory Board with over 200 years combined experience in pharmacology, toxicology, nutrition, sports performance and pediatrics. We have a multitude of product endorsers that includes professional athletes, champion amateur athletes, and acclaimed entertainers.  
Brett and I certainly weren't looking for AdvoCare when it plopped in our laps in September of 2011, but we were leading an unhealthy and uncomfortable lifestyle trading hours for dollars. Where are you? Are you looking to make a HEALTHY LIFESTYLE change, or perhaps you find yourself needing more TIME, ENERGY, or MONEY? AdvoCare can be your answer, too! 
We'd love the opportunity to share AdvoCare with you, just like it was shared with us. We feel honored and blessed to be a part of such a phenomenal company. 

God bless! 
Brett and Kassie Keller
