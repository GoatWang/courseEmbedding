EMS Find Inc: Why This Promoted $56 Million Company Could Drop 70%+ - EMS Find, Inc. (OTCMKTS:INTV) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»EMS Find Inc: Why This Promoted $56 Million Company Could Drop 70%+Jun.16.15 | About: EMS Find, (INTV) Penny Stock Realist Short onlyPenny Stock RealistSummaryThere is a stock promotional landing page out there http://emsfreport.com/.18,500,000 Free Trading Shares that could be dumped into the Stock Promotion.Moskowitz mailer promotions typically perform terribly.EMS Find. (OTC:EMSF) is a name that I believe is currently the target of a penny stock promotion scheme. It is my view that the stock's intrinsic value is somewhere near $0, and it is with conviction that I recommend that any investors currently in the name sell the entirety of their stakes immediately. I also believe that EMS Find is a stock definitely worth shorting. My track record of identifying and publicly exposing such highly overvalued equities is excellent.
Little Revenue. Debts. No Business. Bright Future?
As is usually the case with these types of hyped-up scams, it takes only one quick glance at the balance sheet to realize that the $58M market capitalization that this equity commands is beyond ludicrous. With $0 in current assets and $90,724 in current liabilities. It's my suspicion that the purpose of this company is not to succeed, but to sell stock. The recent volume is due to overly bullish promotional mailers.
Picture of $EMSF Chart
You can see that trading in EMS Find started seeing really increased volume on June 8, 2015. You can see it was around the this time the landing page went up. Coincidence with the time of the landing page and increased volume in EMS Find? Absolutely not.

Online Landing Page


Disclaimer

Landing Page Details
Go here to see details about the landing page.
"TABIUS SWAY MEDIA INC. HAS PAID ONE MILLION AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE DISSEMINATION OF THIS INFORMATION TO ENHANCE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF EMSF"
You can see obviously someone is interested in increasing public awareness for EMS Find. Most likely the insiders, who own 18,500,000 free trading shares in EMS Find. Why else would someone spend $1,200,000 to increase public awareness? At these levels, those are worth about 36 million! It is worth it to them, because if they can bring in buyers and liquidate their shares around these prices, that can mean millions in profits! Running pump and dump schemes is a lucrative business, and that is why we see it way too often. My job is to wake you up.
Promoter History
The promoter behind EMS Find is the Moskowitz Report
How will the EMS Find story play out? It will act like the rest of their promotions. People who buy EMS Find will lose and the insiders will laugh all the way to the bank. Interested in some of their past promotions? Below are some of their promotions, You can tell when the promotion starts by seeing when the stocks start trading large volume.
Falconridge Oil Technologies



Virtus Oil and Gas Corp

My Recommendation
If you own shares of this company, get out now. Do not hope that you can hang on to sell them to a greater fool. These shares are worthless. I have showed you that the reason for the promotional email campaign indicates that the individuals behind this stock scam are trying desperately to unload their worthless shares onto the unsuspecting public and book a huge profit before the inevitable collapse. If you are a more sophisticated investor and can get a borrow on these shares, then I believe that shorting this name will be highly lucrative for you. This will end horribly just like all stock promotions of this kind. You have been warned.

		What Do You Know About EMS Find Inc(OTCMKTS:EMSF)

EMS Find Inc(OTCMKTS:EMSF) continues to move up steadily in recent days since taking off from its base over $1.
EMSF is the newest hard mailer promotion to hit the bb’s with a landing page established at emsfreport.com with a disclaimer that reads ”Chesh media ltd has been paid eighty thousand dollars for the dissemination of this information to enhance public awareness of EMSF.
EMS Find Inc(OTCMKTS:EMSF) develops and markets B2B & B2C on-demand mobile platform, designed to connect health care providers and consumers to a network of medical transport companies throughout the United States and Canada.  The development of Ems Find has been managed by a team that includes experienced mobile software developers, healthcare providers, medical transport operators and hospital executives.
The company’s solution facilitates, speeds up and connects health care providers and the public with ambulance providers for the benefit of the patients.  The platform enables users (hospitals, medical offices, dialysis centers, nursing homes, home care agencies and other medical providers) and the public to schedule medical transportation in a timely and efficient way based on the type of medical transportation which best fits each patient’s needs.
Ems Find App will work on any smart device including smart phones, tablets or laptops. Desktop, iOS and Android versions will allow users to connect in real time to local and nearby pre-screened medical transportation companies wherever the medical transports are needed and fit the medical, logistical and financial criteria.
The landing page at emsfreport.com claims ”First to Market Play From EMS Find Inc. (EMSF) Is Set To Shake Up $15-Billion Market With Next-Gen Breakthrough. EMS Find (EMSF) Has One Ground-Breaking Solution That Could Make YOU A Fortune…Even Save Your Life One Day!”
It goes on to say ”The Key With EMS Find (EMSF) IS TO GET IN EARLY, On The Ground-Floor! If you can still grab EMSF shares anywhere around $1, then I recommend you do so immediately! Or, you can wait and count your blessings if you can get in under $3! In the coming months I expect that EMSF could announce that its breakthrough medical transportation network app has gone countrywide… at that moment, EMS Find shares could be worth a fortune!”
Then emsfreport.com makes the preposterous and baseless price prediction of ”Conservative Profit Strategy: Sell half at $6.15 hold balance to $12.66. Aggressive Profit Strategy: Hold to $12.66 or higher.
To Find out the inside Scoop on EMSF Subscribe to Microcapdaily.com Right Now by entering your Email in the box below


On June 11 EMSF announced it has retained New York based law firm, Meister, Seelig & Fein, LLP to file a provisional patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office relating to its on-demand mobile medical transport platform designed to connect healthcare facilities, providers and consumers with medical transportation companies to schedule transports on an on-demand basis, in a more efficient, timely and cost effective manner than is currently being utilized.  EMS Find’s mobile application is currently being developed and will be available on iOS, Android and Desktop platforms.
Steve Rubakh, EMS Find CEO, remarked, “We are excited to be filing this patent covering our products. In the fast growing on-demand transportation category we plan to maintain the process of building our IP within the on-demand transportation category thus adding further value to our unique platform. We plan to be very proactive in managing our intellectual property strategy. Managing our intellectual property involves identifying and properly documenting the Company’s patentable innovations, filing patent applications and creating a flexible set of options for handling IP in order for IP filings to become a dynamic company asset and significantly boost the value of our company.”
A Provisional Patent application is a legal document that establishes an early priority date for the benefit of claiming “first to file” status against other companies or individuals that may want to file for a patent with similar claims after the filing date of our provisional application.

Currently trading at a $66 million market valuation EMSF has minimal assets, no revenues and rising debt. The stock is skyrocketing on a hard mailer promotion with an already established landing page at emsfreport.com with disclosed $80,000 budget. Short term EMSF could easily go way higher, long term it could collapse big once the promo dollars run dry. We will be updating on EMSF as more details emerge so make sure you are subscribed to Microcapdaily so you know what’s going on with EMSF.

The SEC should be ashamed of itself for letting such trash go public.
This company’s stock literally defines “Pump and Dump”

Isn’t their marketing material illegal? If not, shouldn’t it be? 
Run away from this stock disaster.

Welcome to America in the new century. A place where B.S. and worthless stock is sold for quick and massive profits. Heck, why create a legitimate business, when making big money by selling worthless shares to an ignorant public is so easy? Especially when the SEC condones it and makes it so easy. 
EMSF is a poster child for what’s wrong with this country. Stay away. Far, far away.

Shares in EMS Find Inc (OTCMKTS:EMSF) Soar after Launching New RideShare Program

By Michael Luke -  March 22, 2017 660 




Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter











EMS Find Inc (OTCMKTS:EMSF) shares were up over 100% recently, and this may have been due to the announcement of its beta launch of 888.RideShare. If you haven’t heard of EMS Find Inc yet, it’s a wholly owned subsidiary of the Paradigm Group Inc. EMS Find is an applications and software development company primarily engaged in the healthcare transportation industry.
 
EMS Find APP is an innovative product, and it’s the first of its kind in the industry. This app is an on-demand platform that connects consumers to healthcare providers with the closest medical transportation providers. COnsequently, this would benefit patients using this service, and it would enable the user base, which includes hospitals, nursing homes, medical offices,  home care agencies and other medical providers, and public to schedule transportation in an efficient matter, based on the type of medical transportation that best fits every patient’s needs.
 
Getting back to the news that may have been the catalyst that caused EMS Find Inc (OTCMKTS:EMSF) shares to double. EMS Find Inc announced the beta launch of 888.RideShare, which is a transportation portal powered by UBER Central. 888.RideShare is focused on providing a convenient and reliable transportation service to patients and seniors.
 
With the aging population, there are an increasing amount of seniors that would like to remain in their homes with their families, rather than moving to assisted living homes and facilities. However, transportation may be challenging, and many seniors have either delayed or even missed their medical appointments due to the poor supply of appropriate transportation services.

 

 
According to EMS Find Inc CEO Steve Rubakh, “Transportation is critical for all seniors, especially those who have mobility challenges, to stay in their homes as they age without being stuck at home because of a lack of transportation options…888.RideShare service, in collaboration with UBER Central, makes it easier for seniors and caregivers to set up transportation while providing elderly with help they need to remain independent and be able to afford to get where they need to go.”
 
Now, a free call to 888.RideShare allows seniors to set their rides in order to get to their doctor appointments, to go shopping, run errands, or visit friends and family. Moving on, the 888.RideShare portal allows users to track and schedule rides, anywhere in the U.S., where UBER operates.
 
In addition to this news, EMS Find Inc announced that it changed its business strategy in order to drive long-term shareholder value growth. That in mind, these moves could potentially further propel the stock higher.
 
EMS Find CEO stated, “We plan to focus on providing smaller, middle market private companies with a strategy that includes an equity capitalization, an equity exit and a liquidity. This change in business strategy is intended to provide our shareholders and investors with access to unique business opportunities with the potential for significant upside while reducing risk through diversification. Our short-term goal is to deliver our first M&A transaction to our shareholders, by the end of the month.”
 
That in mind, EMS Find Inc plans to follow a business structure similar to that of Berkshire Hathaway. The M&A structure would enable private businesses in order to take advantage of the power of a public company, without losing autonomous management control.
 
EMS Find Inc just spiked up recently, and it could be due to these two catalysts. Now, it’s hard to be around computers all day, but most have their phones on them so they could check emails. If you want to stay up to date on EMSF, without having to read up on its latest developments, you might want to sign up to our free newsletter. All you have to do is give us your email, and we’ll provide you any updates on EMSF as the story unfolds!
