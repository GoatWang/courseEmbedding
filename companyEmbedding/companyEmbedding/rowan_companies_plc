The company operates a fleet of 31 rigs including 27 offshore drilling jackup rigs and 4 ultra-deepwater drillships. The company operates worldwide in the Gulf of Mexico, Trinidad, North Sea, Southeast Asia, Mediterranean, Middle East and Southeast Asia.[1]
Its offshore jackup rigs include cantilever jackup rigs that are designated as Gorilla Class rigs, Super Gorilla Class rigs, Tarzan Class rigs, 240C Class Rigs, EXL class rigs and N-class rigs, as well as conventional jackup rigs.[1]
Its ultra-deepwater drillships are based on the Gusto MSC P10,000 class with capacity for 12,000’ of riser and a variable deck load capacity of 20,000 tons.[1]
The company provides quarterly updates on the status of each rig in its fleet on its website.[2]

History[edit]
Rowan Drilling Company, Inc. was founded in 1923 by brothers Charles and Arch Rowan as a contract drilling business.[3]
The company went public in 1967, issuing 323,000 shares.[3]
In 1971, the company changed its name to Rowan Companies, Inc.[3]
In 1994, Rowan acquired the assets of Marathon LeTourneau Company from General Cable for $52 million.[4]
In 2000, Rowan subsidiary LeTourneau, Inc. acquired The Ellis Williams Company, Inc., a manufacturer of mud pumps, for $9 million.[5]
In 2002, Rowan Electric, Inc. acquired Oilfield-Electric-Marine, Inc. for $8 million in stock. Oilfield-Electric-Marine, Inc. manufactured variable speed AC motors and variable frequency drive systems. Kevin R. Williams had been President of Oilfield-Electric-Marine, Inc., and he stayed on as President of Rowan Electric, Inc.[6]
In 2004, Rowan sold its aviation subsidiary business Era Aviation, Inc. for US$118.1 million in cash. The subsidiary chartered helicopter and fixed-wing services.[7]
In 2009, W. Matt Ralls became Rowan's President and Chief Executive Officer.[8]
In 2010, Rowan completed the acquisition of Skeie Drilling & Production ASA, including its three North Sea compliant (N-class) jack-up rigs under construction. Rowan adds three EXL class (enhanced LeTourneau Super 116E) rigs to its fleet and the first N-class rig comes into service.[9]
In 2013, Rowan completed the sales of its manufacturing subsidiary, LeTourneau Technologies, Inc., and its land drilling operations to Joy Global in a $1.1 billion transaction.[10] Joy Global subsequently sold LeTourneau's Drilling, Marine, and Power divisions to Cameron International for $375 million.[11]
In January 2014, Rowan took delivery its first ultra-deepwater drillship, the Rowan Renaissance.[12]
The company eventually took delivery of 4 ultra-deepwater drillships, at a cost of approximately $600 million each.[13]
In April 2014, Thomas P. Burke was named President and CEO. Matt Ralls became Executive Chairman.[14]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

What are analysts saying about Rowan Companies PLC stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Rowan Companies PLC stock: 
1. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "RDC solidified, if not modestly strengthened, our sense of the relatively healthy demand outlook for many of its jackups through the medium-term, and we continue to see healthy FCF generation through the long-term. However, we see ample downside risk to estimates through 2018E, as we believe the spottiness of work as the cycle turns, and the likelihood of depressed dayrates through 2018 suggest (much) weaker earnings than is appreciated. Maintain Hold." (2/25/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Rowan Companies offers investors stable earnings and cash flow visibility, given its technologically advanced and versatile offshore drilling fleet, strong backlog and considerable pricing power. The company's decision to eliminate its dividend might have disappointed income investors but it has provided the much-needed stability to its balance sheet. We also appreciate Rowan’s cost-control initiatives like its decision to significantly lower its 2016 operating expenses. Owing to these strong fundamentals, the company has been able to outperform the Zacks categorized Oil & Gas – U.S. Exploration & Production industry, over a period of three months. However, the company remains unsure of its near-term prospects. With most companies slowing down on activity to manage costs, the company’s utilization rate will be affected and rigs downtime will be increased." (1/3/2017)
3. FBR & Co analysts commented, "Production from EOG’s wells that started production in 3Q15 and 4Q15 and now have at least six months of production and revenue generation (i.e., the latest wells with such data available) spiked versus EOG’s own previous wells and versus peer wells. Lateral placement appears to be the key to the spike in production and revenue generation." (9/19/2016)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Rowan Companies PLC (NYSE:RDC) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?)

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings.

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 12 Hold Ratings, 7 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.18)Consensus Price Target: $16.93 (44.17% upside)
