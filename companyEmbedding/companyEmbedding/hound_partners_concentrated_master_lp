   Hedge Fund Analysis-Hedge Funds-News  Hound Partners & Marble Arch Investments Are Betting On Same Stocks    Published on March 5, 2014 at 11:55 am by  
                                Jason Seo, CFA
                                  in Hedge Fund Analysis,Hedge Funds,News                 Jonathan Auerbach co-founded long/short equity fund Hound Partners with Scott McLellan in 2004, seeded by Tiger Management. Jonathan Auerbach had been a senior analyst at Ziff Brothers Investments before joining Tiger Management in 2004, when he was put in charge of a new umbrella fund, which later became Hound Partners. Auerbach lured Scott McLellan to Tiger to help him run the fund. Prior to that, McLellan worked at Highbridge Capital. In 2007, Scott McLellan left to form Marble Arch Partners with Timothy Jenkins, who had spent three years working at Tiger Management. Jonathan Auerbach’s Hound Partners gained around 16 percent in 2013. Marble Arch Investments was founded in 2007 by Scott McLellan, who had previously worked at Hound Partners. Hound’s manager, Jonathan Auerbach, is a Tiger Cub and so McLellan can trace his investment lineage to Julian Robertson as well. McLellan himself worked at Highbridge Capital Management and has an MBA from Northwestern. Marble Arch is a long/short equity fund. In their most recent 13F filings reflecting activity during the fourth quarter of 2013, two hedge funds, Hound Partners and Marble Arch Investments, showed a remarkable amount of similarity in their holdings and investment activity, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (NYSE:VRX), Carters Inc. (NYSE:CRI), FleetCor Technologies Inc. (NYSE:FLT), and W R Grace & Co. (NYSE:GRA). Other equities owned by both funds include Charter Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) and American International Group Inc. (NYSE:AIG). Given the concentrated number of stocks in their portfolios (23 for Hound and 22 for Marble Arch), we thought it would be interesting in delve into their common investments a little deeper.  Given the backgrounds of the founders of the two firms, it is not surprising that their investments should overlap. Both Jonathan Auerbach and Scott McLellan, who founded Hound Partners, worked at Tiger Management previously. Three years later, McLellan left Hound to set-up another hedge fund, Marble Arch, along with Timothy Jenkins, another Tiger Management alumni. Both funds, based in New York, NY, employ a long/short equity strategy based on fundamental analysis. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (NYSE:VRX) was the top holding of both funds as of year-end 2013, accounting for 13.0% of Hound’s equity portfolio and 12.4% of Marble Arch’s. Neither fund changed its holdings of the multinational specialty pharmaceutical company during the fourth quarter. VRX has had a strong run over the past year, as its earnings have been boosted by its recent acquisition of eye care products maker Bausch & Lomb Holdings Inc. FleetCor Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:FLT) was another top holding of both funds, which was the third largest holding of Hound and second largest of Marble Arch. Both funds did reduce their positions by 14-21% in the payment processor of commercial fuel cards during the quarter, but their large remaining stakes still imply a bullish view on the stock. Chemical and materials manufacturer W R Grace & Co. (NYSE:GRA) occupied the fourth largest position in Hound’s portfolio and third largest in Marble Arch’s. Again, we see a similarity in investing behavior among the two funds, as both reduced their stakes in the company by 11-20% during the fourth quarter but still maintained relatively large stakes. This could reflect a directional bet on GRA exiting bankruptcy soon. Charter Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) was the fifth largest equity investment of Hound and eighth largest  of Marble Arch. Both funds increased their positions in the telecommunications company by 7-8% during the quarter. The stock could have been a bet that CHTR would outbid Comcast Corp. (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and successfully acquire Time Warner Cable (NYSE:TWC). Although CMCSA and TWC reached an agreement recently, CHTR’s largest shareholder, Liberty Media Corp. (NASDAQ:LMCA) seems to remain interested on the ultimate outcome of the deal.

                Hedge Funds, Manager Analysis            

                Manager Monday: Marble Arch Investments            






 Faryan Amir-Ghassemi
Director of Analytics




 
                        Every Monday, Novus digs into the public holdings of a prominent hedge fund manager. This week, we take a look at Marble Arch Investments.                    





Marble Arch is a prime example of the wildly successful lineage of Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management. Its founder, Scott McLellan, worked at Hound Partners, whose founder, Jonathan Auerbach, worked at Tiger. This “family tree” of hedge funds has produced prolific and successful long/short equity managers, and Marble Arch Investments is no exception. What is particularly interesting to study is the “family resemblance” in investment style and underlying holdings for these managers.
About our Data
Everything mentioned in this post is sourced exclusively from public data, including the manager’s profile, simulated performance and all other analysis and commentary. The data used here omits the short side, non-equity securities, many non-US securities and all non-public information such as actual fund performance.
Marble Arch Investments and Hound Partners
While we’ve talked extensively about the similarity in portfolio structure between Tiger lineage managers, many have noted the tremendous overlap between Hound and its sibling, Marble Arch. As of the most recent 13-F filings, 60% of Marble Arch’s portfolio is owned by Hound. While that sounds a lot, prior quarters have been nearly 70%!

Both managers take meaty positions in names such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Fleetcor Technologies, and Spirit Aerosystems. These are, of course, Tiger lineage favorites as most of these names hold in excess of 10 participants through our capture of all Tiger “family members.” Before you prematurely conclude that overlap is a bad thing, our data shows that Tiger Cub consensus names greatly outperform and the same can’t be said about all unique stocks. Most of these are world class managers and the securities they invest in have compounded at exceptional rates, so perhaps they are on to something.
Recent Marble Arch Outperformance
Marble Arch’s simulated long portfolio performance has been outpacing the S&P 500 by about 450bps per year, since our first public data capture in Jan 2008. A large amount of the portfolio’s outperformance began after the US debt ceiling crisis in the 3rd quarter of 2011:

Structural Changes
If we look at their portfolio since then, a few things become apparent in terms of structural changes:

The portfolio has reduced the number of long positions from a peak of 26 (07/31/13) to 15 as of the most recent filing
As a corollary, portfolio concentration has risen dramatically, constituting a 50% relative increase in terms of top 5 / top 10 position concentration


This has led to a greater allocation of larger positions in the portfolio, as positions greater than 10% of reported assets have gone from non-existent to nearly 50% of the book. In the last 30 months, that largest position size bucket has annualized at an astounding 40.5%, which shows why the move to a more concentrated portfolio explains the widening outperformance:


We can truly isolate position sizing value add by comparing an equal weighted portfolio to their actual return profile. This allows us to measure how additive the escalation in concentration has been for Marble Arch’s portfolio. We estimate, it has added nearly 3000 bps of outperformance since September 2011:

Finally, if we simply sort the names with the highest average weighting during this period, we can see a strong relationship between sizing and outsized return on invested capital. In fact, there has only been one notable miss (Applied Materials) amongst overweight positions.

This phenomenon is punctuated by the firm’s positioning in Valeant, which has been a huge driver of outperformance, delivering over 4000bps of simulated contribution:

With these trends, we can see the manager engaging in a higher octane investment style, with a clear escalation in the median P/E of the portfolio, as well as a widening negative beta to value:


Conclusion
Marble Arch’s reported long positions have had an extended period of outperformance, beginning in late 2011. This has coincided with a strong move towards increased concentration and is dominated by a growth-factor tilt. The manager continues to outperform the market, and has demonstrated adaptability in the past. The question is whether or not this trend of amplified concentration and growth bias will persist if the market begins to change in tenor.


Three Managers. Three Styles.
An analysis of three different hedge fund strategies and how they generate alpha.

What makes a successful hedge fund manager? We believe that studying performance alone does not adequately answer the question. By looking at thousands of active manager portfolios, we peek under the hood of managers’ investment process and recognize patterns that lead managers to consistent outperformance. These patterns can be viewed as investment skill, or managers’ ability to generate alpha through certain repeatable methods.
In this article we use public ownership data and the Novus Alpha platform to evaluate three very distinct money managers. The three case studies aim to identify the driver of these managers’ success: investment skill.

                Manager Monday: Corvex Management LP            






 Stephen Bennett
Senior Associate, Client Analytics




 
                        Corvex Management LP, a seed of Icahn Enterprises, is very much its own entity. Read our latest article to learn how they've outperformed.                    





Corvex Capital was founded in 2010 by Keith Meister, formerly of Icahn Enterprises. At Icahn he served as CEO and as vice chairman of the board. He took the skills he learned under the renowned Carl Icahn and founded his own activist hedge fund with the backing of another hedge fund giant, George Soros.
Like all Manager Mondays, everything mentioned in this post is sourced exclusively from public data, including the manager’s profile, simulated performance and all other analysis and commentary. The data used here omits the short side, non-equity securities, many non-US securities and all non-public information such as actual fund performance.
Corvex Management LP’s Performance
First, let’s examine performance of this fund. Since it has begun filing the fund has returned 94% cumulatively against the S&P500’s 69.6%. The fund had two solid years of outperformance compared to the market, and has had a decent 2015 through August.

The returns, using a rolling six month time window, offer insight into when the outperformance occurred. Recently, the fund has experienced outperformance during late 2013 and a large amount over the course of 2014, but this does not demonstrate skills of the manager or provide insight into the portfolios aggregate dynamics. So, let’s dig in.

Corvex Management LP’s Portfolio Attributes: Asset Growth, Position Changes, Concentration
Corvex began filing in December of 2011 and has seen almost a 20x increase in reported market value. Since December of 2012 the market value of filed positions has almost doubled from $4.8B to $9.4B. This rapid increase in asset growth must cause a change in the portfolio whether changes in market cap, number of positions, or concentration. This growth probably stems from a mix of large capital inflows captured in the filings spikes below and from the good performance of the fund.

While assets doubled to over $9B, the number of securities has decreased 30% from a peak of 62 positions to 41 currently. If assets are growing while securities count decreases then the concentration of the portfolio must increase.

Indeed the portfolio’s concentration has increased. Corvex has become heavily concentrated in their 5 securities while assets rose and this shifted from around 40%, the historical average, in December of 2013 to 60%, its peak, currently. This concentration has increased steadily in the top 5 securities.

The top 20 securities represent approximately 93% of the portfolio, a highly concentrated book, considering that the other 20 securities represent the remaining 7%. This has steadily increased from 70% in December of 2013. We are only examining the publicly filed long positions, but we gain insight into how these dynamics are changing as the assets grow. What does this increased concentration mean for the portfolio? Usually this will indicate that we should see higher win/loss ratios as the portfolio focuses on generating most of its returns from fewer positions.

Corvex Management LP’s Position Breakdown and Attribution
At an aggregate portfolio level, Corvex has put up some impressive numbers. It has owned 272 securities, 71% have been up with 73% of capital allocated to those winning names, which has led to approximately a 2x win/loss ratio. This means that each winning name has contributed twice as much to the portfolio as the average loser has detracted, which is good, but not fantastic for an activist. Let’s breakdown these aggregate stats into the underlying positions.

The top contributing position has been Williams (WMB), generating 1,393bps with an average position size of 14.87%, which is about the same contribution as the next three positions. In comparison, the top detractor, YUM detracted 300bps, and only 8 securities have detracted more than 100bps, demonstrating an ability to cut their losers.

Digging into the Williams position, Corvex built into the position over time and filed a 13D in December 2013. After reaching an agreement for a board seat with Williams in February 2014, they increased their shares in March 2014. Williams has stayed above a 20% position since then with most of the contribution occurring from June 2014 until presently. Williams’ contribution to the fund is driven by Security Selection, meaning that the individual security generated contribution and not from the relative factors of the market and sector. The effect of its activist investment seems to be taking hold and finally paying off.

Another security that drove performance in 2014 was Fidelity (FNF). It has generated approx. 500bps with an average position size of 8.5%. Corvex announced its investment through a 13D filing in October of 2013. Although the security initially detracted, it began to outperform half way through 2014 and is Corvex’s second highest contributor. There is a delay to the activist’s ability to generate value in these longer term investments and because Corvex is still invested in them. We will have to wait and see how it plays out.

Breaking down the top contributors on a relative basis, we see all but four of them have generated greater than 50% of their contribution from Security Selection. Corvex’s winners are winners because of Security Selection, but let’s compare this to the largest average positions.

Sorting on Avg. Pos. Size reveals that of the positions greater than 4% only 5 of them have detracted value, but Williams is the only major contributor. This provides context for the great batting averages, but that their other investments have not paid off or did not generate the excess returns that an activist needs from its concentrated positions.

Returning to the portfolio level metrics, Corvex has demonstrated an ability to pick and allocate to outperformers with a 54% batting average and 58% of capital deployed to those names. This has led to around 4300bps of Security Selection.


That is an impressive amount of Stock Selection. Corvex can picks names and allocate capital, but has only had one large winner so far. Let’s dive under the hood and examine Corvex’s investments across several additional dimensions to understand how this switch towards a more concentrated strategy has affected the book.
Corvex Management LP’s Sector Allocations
The sector allocations initially centered on Energy, Consumer Discretionary, and Tech, and became more balanced as it grew. But, in 2013 the fund began to concentrate again and now focuses on Consumer Discretionary, Energy, and Financials, which represent ~72% of the portfolio, while cutting Telecom and Utilities.

Regardless of sector, Corvex has an ability to pick winning names. Every sector has above 50% batting averages and those below 60%, industrials and materials, make up less than 6% of the current long book.

In terms of the Win/Loss ratios, 90% of the portfolio is allocated to sectors that have greater than 1x win/loss ratios. As an activist we expect high/win loss ratios, but Corvex has shifted away from sectors that do not contribute like Industrials, Technology, and Materials. Corvex has demonstrated an ability to identify the sectors they do not do well in and get out of them to focus on those that they perform well in. Telecomm has an incredible win/loss ratio of 21.87x, so let’s see what names are contributing to this outsized ratio.


LVLT, ABVT, TWTC are the largest contributions and positions, but only one of these securities had a position size greater than 5%. The win/loss ratio stems from these medium size positions offering healthy contribution and only a few tiny positions detracting. Although a successful sector, it has not been a heavy allocation for them, but the few names they have invested in did well.
Overall, Corvex has picked winning names across sectors, but has learned over its short time to focus on the sectors it knows best and drive the best batting averages and win/loss ratios. These metrics across their favorites sectors will be something to follow because it is still early to judge the results of this newer concentration strategy.
Corvex Management LP’s Market Cap
Market Cap has predominately been Large Cap and Mid Cap and has shifted upwards slightly towards more Large and even Mega cap names.

All batting averages are over 60% across the spectrum, indicating they can pick names well, but the win/loss ratio is what matters for an activist. Across the spectrum Corvex has above 1x win/loss ratios with Mega, Large, Mid, and Small cap having 1.75x, 1.55x, 1.91x, and 1.22x ratios respectively. Although these are good, they could be better. Again, it is still early to tell how these longer and larger investments will pay off.

On a ROIC basis the larger buckets have performed better with each above 15% and only micro-cap, a minor allocation in the past detracted.

Across the larger buckets they have also generated alpha through Stock Selection. Overall they understand their investments on a market cap basis and have shifted into their best market cap bucket.

Corvex Management LP’s Concentration
Returning to our question about concentration, we see that Corvex has shifted into larger position sizes since March of 2014. Specifically, since December of 2013 position sizes have more than doubled from ~30% to ~65%. We know that the fund has become concentrated in these positions and that some of those names like Williams and Fidelity have generated returns, but have done so slowly and steadily over 2014 and 2015. These names still need more time to play out in an activist play.

We can compare the portfolio’s returns against an equally weighted portfolio’s to understand if the fund has added value, and we see two periods in 2014 and 2015 with outperformance. We know that these are some early effects of their new concentration strategy like their positions in WMB and FLF. Ultimately, this concentration play has contributed to the portfolio, but it is a little early to conclusively know because it is still running its course. We know Corvex has had good batting averages and decent win/loss ratios, meaning Corvex picks winning names but needs time for them to generate those larger returns we expect from concentrated positions.

Conclusion
Corvex may only have been around since 2010, but this fund has demonstrated a skill for picking winning securities across sectors and market cap buckets. They understand what sectors and market caps they are good at and know to focus on them while getting out of those that do not perform well for them. Corvex has solid win/loss ratios in those areas, but it could be better, especially for an activist. This can get better as these new investments have more time for the activist influence to gain transaction at the targeted companies. Even as Corvex experienced extraordinary asset growth, it maintained its ability to pick names and continues to adapt to its concentrated strategy. Although an Icahn protégé started Corvex, it has found a style and skillset all its own as it continues to focus. Corvex is a manager that we will watch closely as it continues to grow and its investments have more time to play out.


Three Managers. Three Styles.
An analysis of three different hedge fund strategies and how they generate alpha.

What makes a successful hedge fund manager? We believe that studying performance alone does not adequately answer the question. By looking at thousands of active manager portfolios, we peek under the hood of managers’ investment process and recognize patterns that lead managers to consistent outperformance. These patterns can be viewed as investment skill, or managers’ ability to generate alpha through certain repeatable methods.
In this article we use public ownership data and the Novus Alpha platform to evaluate three very distinct money managers. The three case studies aim to identify the driver of these managers’ success: investment skill.
