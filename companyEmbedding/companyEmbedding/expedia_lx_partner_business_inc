TransFirst Media, Inc. Partners with Expedia Local Expert® Orlando


Press Release
-


									updated: Nov 15, 2016							

 





			Orlando, FL, 
			November 15, 2016			(Newswire.com) -
	​On Thursday, November 10th, TransFirst Media and Expedia Local Expert (LX) joined forces to bring a new digital media advertising opportunity to the local hospitality industry. With over 65+ million visitors a year coming to Orlando, travelers are savvy in how they purchase activities while in-market. AdOnTheBox (AOTB) is another touch point for the tourist to gather information about what activities they would like to experience during their stay.
TransFirst Media, Inc., dba AdOnTheBox, is a multimedia advertising and technology company that uses digital interactive signage and kiosks placed in lobbies and other key areas throughout hotels, resorts, and high traffic areas in Orlando, FL. They are innovating the tourism advertising market by providing the means for a local business to connect directly to their consumer through video and display content.
The AdOnTheBox is the course of the future for every vacationer’s needs; from theme park tickets to dining and other specialty services. AdOnTheBox will provide the consumer with all the necessary information to get the most out of their family vacations. LX will support AOTB in the complex ticket fulfillment processes to serve those hotels when the LX concierge desk is closed and for those locations who do not have a concierge on staff.

The relationship between Expedia Local Expert and AdOnTheBox is a great opportunity to showcase the interactivity of digital media and consumer advertising. Expedia has an incredible brand presence and over the past two years, AdOnTheBox has created a unique user interface that we look forward to introducing to the Orlando Market.


				Scott Matthews,
		President		
		
	


Jon Epstein, Director of Sales for Expedia Local Expert is excited about this new relationship, “We have always focused on providing the best guest experience and making a positive financial impact for our supply partners.  To accomplish these goals we are always looking for new ways to make our services more convenient and accessible for our guests.  It is exciting to begin this new relationship with those goals in mind.  We want the traveling public to feel that Expedia Local Expert travels with them. Today this is done mainly in the nearly 100 locations we staff in the Orlando market.  AdOnTheBox will increase that footprint even more, providing additional service and access to the vast array of world class products and services we offer.”  
Scott Matthews, President of AdOnTheBox is equally excited, “The relationship between Expedia Local Expert and AdOnTheBox is a great opportunity to showcase the interactivity of digital media and consumer advertising. Expedia has an incredible brand presence and over the past two years, AdOnTheBox has created a unique user interface that we look forward to introducing to the Orlando Market.”

API Verification Tool (AVT)
What is the AVT?
                    The AVT is an automated test suite that verifies proper operation of your API endpoints. It verifies each endpoint to ensure that proper responses are generated for requests that are expected to succeed, and it also verifies that the correct API errors are returned in scenarios where an error should be generated.
                    What is included in the AVT.zip file?
                    The download link for the AVT can be found on the API Portal. This link will download a ZIP file that contains the following items:
                    
ApiVerificationTool.jar
	                    This is a pre-compiled Java executable that runs all of the tests that will help ensure your API endpoints are performing according to the behaviors defined in the API spec.
	                    avt.log
	                    This is a sample output log file that gives an example of what the AVT output will look like after running against your endpoints. This file will contain a list of all of the tests that were run, and any errors that were encountered. It will also include information for troubleshooting what may be causing any of the tests to fail. Please attach this log with any emails that you may send about troubleshooting test failures.
	                    refApi.conf
	                    This is a sample config file that is used by the ApiVerificationTool.jar to run the tests. You will need to modify this configuration file to provide the correct values for connecting to your endpoint, as well as the partner IDs for things like Supplier Branch IDs, Activity IDs, Offer IDs, and Ticket Type IDs that will be used by the tests to generate the correct responses. Please attach this file when you have completed your testing and are ready for us to perform final verification.
	                    README.md
	                    This file contains information about how to configure and execute the AVT and should be able to answer the most common questions about what you need to know in order to get the AVT working.
                    
Running the AVT
                    There are 2 phases to running the AVT:
                    
Phase 1
	                    In the first phase, you can run the AVT locally on your own Dev machine, or from within your own test environment to ensure that things are being developed correctly. This will allow very rapid turnaround time from running the test and evaluating results to fixing bugs. During this time if you have any questions about how to interpret test failures or how to setup the AVT to run correctly, please email us the refApi.conf and avt.log files from your most recent test run and we can assist you.
	                    Phase 2
	                    Once the AVT is passing in your local environment, email us your refApi.conf file and we will run the AVT from our Production network. The primary purpose of this secondary test is to ensure that our network is able to connect to yours and that we are not encountering any errors in transit during communication with your API endpoints.
                    
What's required to run the AVT?
                    The AVT requires a Java Runtime Environment and access to the environment that is hosting your API. The AVT can be run from any computer that meets these requirements and does not need to be run locally from within the environment.
                    How do I run the AVT?
                    In order to run the AVT you will need to modify the config file that it came with. You will need to provide the proper values in this config file so that the AVT can connect to your API and different tests will need to have specific platform IDs entered. For example, in some cases you may need to specify a partnerOfferId that has been sold out, or a partnerSupplierBranchId that will not be recognized by your API. Once you have completed entering the correct values into the config file, you may run the tool from the terminal with the following command:
                    
Usage:

java -jar ApiVerificationTool.jar [configuration_file] [output_file] [test_suite] [test_case]

Options:

configuration_file
		                    The file that contain the configuration information you just entered. [default: avt.conf]
		                    output_file
		                    The AVT will write the test output to this file. [default: avt.log]
		                    test_suite
		                    Allows limiting the tests to only those within the specified suite. [default: all]
		                    test_case
		                    Allows limiting the tests to only those that match the specified name. [default: all]
	                    
Examples:

java -jar ApiVerificationTool.jar
java -jar ApiVerificationTool.jar avt.conf avt.log all all
java -jar ApiVerificationTool.jar test1.conf test1.log CheckOfferDateAvailability soldOut


Which test cases are optional in the AVT?
                    These AVT test cases can be ignored with sign off by your API Integration Contact:
                    
CheckOfferDateAvailability: notAvailable
	                    This test checks for a "Not Available" status, which provides an alternative to the "Sold Out" status and may not be necessary for platforms that don't require a distinction between an activity that was available on that date but is now sold out and one that was never available on that date.
	                    CheckOfferDateAvailability: acceptVersion1_0
	                    This test checks for backwards compatibility of the platform's API and may not be necessary for new platforms that never implemented an older version of the API.
	                    CreateSale: thisConfigurationNotAvailable
	                    This test checks for a response that indicates an error that doesn’t fall into other categories. A common example of this is when a booking doesn't meet the minimum ticket count requirements and it may not be necessary for platforms where all such error cases are covered by more descriptive error types.
	                    CommitSale: saleNotFound
	                    This test checks for a proper error response when the commit of a non-existent sale is requested. It may not be necessary if the platform is not implementing two-phase commit for sales. In that case, the sale should already have been committed on the Create Sale call.
	                    CommitSale: saleExpired
	                    This test checks for a response that indicates the hold time on a Create Sale request has expired and thus the sale cannot be committed without being recreated. It may not be necessary if the platform does not enforce the sale expiration window.
	                    CreateSaleCancellation: saleNotFound
	                    This test checks for a proper error response when the creation of a sale cancellation for a non-existent sale is requested. It may not be necessary if the platform is not implementing two-phase commit for cancellations. In that case, the cancellation will be created during the Commit Sale Cancellation request and the error will be thrown at that time.
	                    CreateSaleCancellation: saleNotCancellable
	                    This test checks for a proper error response when the creation of a sale cancellation is requested for an activity that is past the cancellation cutoff time. It may not be necessary if the platform is not implementing two-phase commit for cancellations. In that case, the cancellation will be created during the Commit Sale Cancellation request and the error thrown for this condition will be the generic UnableToProcessRequest error type with an error description explaining the reason.
	                    CreateSaleCancellation: saleNotCommitted
	                    This test checks for a proper error response when the creation of a sale cancellation is requested for a sale that was never committed. It may not be necessary if the platform is not implementing two-phase commit for sales. In that case, the sale will always be either committed or cancelled and an uncommitted sale will never exist. If, however, the platform is implementing 2-phase commit for sales but not for cancellations, then the cancellation will be created during the Commit Sale Cancellation request and the error thrown for this condition will be the generic UnableToProcessRequest error type with an error description explaining the reason.
	                    CommitSaleCancellation: cancellationNotCreated
	                    This test checks for a proper error response when the commit of a non-existent sale cancellation is requested. It may not be necessary if the platform is not implementing two-phase commit for cancellations. In that case, the cancellation is created during the Commit Sale Cancellation request.
	                    CommitSaleCancellation: saleAlreadyCancelled
	                    This test checks for a proper error response when the commit of a sale cancellation has already been committed. It may not be necessary if the platform is implementing idempotent cancellations. In that case, the commit sale cancellation request would simply return a successful response.
	                    ReleaseSaleCancellation: cancellationNotCreated
	                    This test checks for a proper error response when the release of a non-existent sale cancellation is requested. It may not be necessary if the platform is not implementing two-phase commit for cancellations. In that case, the cancellation is created during the Commit Sale Cancellation request and the release sale cancellation request should return the generic error UnableToProcessRequest with an error description explaining the reason.
                    
General API Integration FAQ
API Keys
Why is the API key in x-request-authentication different than the one generated in my API?
                    When validating the incoming API authentication header, you may receive an incorrect validation failure if the base 64 encoding is performed on the hex encoded has instead of the raw hash. For example, you may generate an internal authentication hash similar to this:
                    
OEZFMzk0MzZDMUI3N0M0NkYwRjgyNUIwMDFGNTE4NEJCOEI1NTg2MTdCRkUyQzBGRDdCNUM5MjRFNThBMEY0NA==

					While the incoming authentication hash looks similar to this:
					
j+OUNsG3fEbw+CWwAfUYS7i1WGF7/iwP17XJJOWKD0Q=

					If this is the case, check to make sure you are base 64 encoding the raw hash of the API key and Request Identifier, and that you are not base 64 encoding the hex encoded hash of the API key and Request Identifier. Please refer to the Additional API Documentation linked from the Swagger page here for more details.
					Mapping
As an Expedia Supplier, how do I map my activities?
					Expedia takes on all of the work required to map your activities correctly. Please direct Supplier inquiries to your API Integration Contact. The Timeline for onboarding suppliers and mapping them to be agreed between Expedia and the Platform.
					What happens if not all products are mapped before go live?
					You must map ALL of your Activities, Offers and Ticket IDs currently available and live on Expedia.
We CANNOT switch a supplier to connectivity unless ALL live Activities, Offers or Ticket types have been mapped beforehand. Doing so would:
					

Cause booking failures for unmapped products
Allow bookings to be made without going into your reservation system


General Availability Check (GAC)
					The GAC tool is used for the advanced availability check. This tool makes use of the same Availability Check endpoint that you have developed for the real-time availability check during the customer booking flow, however it provides a wider date range so that we can pre-cache the inventory counts available for your products for the next 30 days. The GAC will query the activities and offers that we are planning to launch with in order to get a baseline of the inventory counts available. Once your platform is live in Production, this tool will run each night in order to get an updated count of inventory for products so that dates that have been sold out or taken off sale can be updated correctly in our system.
					Booking API
How do I implement Booking APIs when my platform does not support 2-phase commit?
					If your platform does not support two-phase booking (e.g. booking hold) then you must commit the booking when the Create Sale API is called so that any errors during booking can be reported back in the response. There are 2 additional scenarios in which the sale must be cancelled so that the supplier's inventory is not tied up with an incomplete booking and so that suppliers maintain an accurate view of what they should be expecting in booking payments from Expedia:
					

If you don't receive a Commit Sale API call before the time specified by the utcHoldExpiration parameter has elapsed.
If you receive a Release Sale API call at any time.


Cancellation API
How do I implement Cancellation APIs when my platform does not support 2-phase commit?
					If your platform does not support two-phase cancellation (e.g. cancellation hold) then you must commit the cancellation when the Commit Sale Cancellation API is called. In this case, both the Create Sale Cancellation and Release Sale Cancellation APIs can be no-op calls from your end that return static API responses with the exception that if the Release Sale Cancellation API is called after the Commit Sale Cancellation API has been called, then the proper response is to generate an error indicating that the cancellation request has already been committed.
