Operations[edit]
GameStop is divided into two operating segments: Video Game Brands and Technology Brands.[1] The Technology Brands was created during the fourth quarter of 2013, and houses the companies Simply Mac, Spring Mobile, and Cricket Wireless business. As of April 2014, the Technology Brands segment included 218 retail outlets.[4] GameStop's Video Game Brands includes the company's other businesses such as video game and consumer electronics retail shops; Kongregate, a digital video game distribution site; and buymytronics.com, a consumer electronics marketplace. Pre-owned and value video games accounted for 47% of GameStop's gross revenue for the fiscal year ending February 2014.[1]
History[edit]

Babbage's (1984–1994)[edit]
GameStop traces its roots to Babbage's, a Dallas, Texas-based software retailer founded in 1984 by former Harvard Business School classmates James McCurry and Gary M. Kusin.[5] The company was named after Charles Babbage[6] and opened its first store in Dallas's North Park Center with the help of Ross Perot, an early investor in the company.[7] The company quickly began to focus on video game sales for the then-dominant Atari 2600.[5] Babbage's began selling Nintendo games in 1987.[8] The company went public in 1988.[6] By 1991, video games accounted for two-thirds of Babbage's sales.[8]
NeoStar Retail Group (1994–1996)[edit]
Babbage's merged with Software Etc., an Edina, Minnesota-based retailer that specialized in personal computing software, to create NeoStar Retail Group in 1994.[9] The merger was structured as a stock swap, where shareholders of Babbage's and Software Etc. received shares of NeoStar, a newly formed holding company. Babbage's and Software Etc. continued to operate as independent subsidiaries of NeoStar and retained their respective senior management teams.[9] Babbage's founder and chairman James McCurry became chairman of NeoStar, while Babbage's president Gary Kusin and Software Etc. president Daniel DeMatteo retained their respective titles. Software Etc. chairman Leonard Riggio became chairman of NeoStar's executive committee.[10]
Gary Kusin resigned as president of Babbage's in February 1995 to start a cosmetics company. Daniel DeMatto, formerly president of Software Etc., assumed Kusin's duties and was promoted to president and chief operating officer of NeoStar. NeoStar chairman James McCurry was also appointed to the newly created position of NeoStar CEO.[11] The company relocated from its headquarters in Dallas to Grapevine later that year.[12]
NeoStar merged its Babbage's and Software Etc. units into a single organization in May 1996 amid declining sales. Company president Daniel DeMatteo also resigned, and NeoStar chairman and CEO James McCurry assumed the title of president.[13] In September of that year, after NeoStar was unable to secure the credit necessary to purchase inventory necessary for the holiday season, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[14] With the filing, NeoStar board member Thomas G. Plaskett became chairman and James McCurry remained company chief executive and president.[15]
The leadership changes were not enough and in November 1996 the assets of NeoStar were purchased for $58.5 million by Leonard Riggio, a founder of Software Etc. and chairman and principal stockholder of Barnes & Noble. Electronics Boutique had also bid to purchase NeoStar, but the judge presiding over NeoStar's bankruptcy accepted Riggio's bid because it kept open 108 stores more than Electronics Boutique's bid would have. Approximately 200 retail stores were not included in the transaction and were subsequently closed.[15]
Babbage’s Etc. (1996–1999)[edit]
Following his purchase of NeoStar's assets, Leonard Riggio dissolved the holding company and created a new holding company named Babbage's Etc.[16] He appointed Richard "Dick" Fontaine, previously Software Etc.'s chief executive during its expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as Babbage Etc.'s chief executive. Daniel DeMatteo, previously the president of both Software Etc. and NeoStar, became company president and COO.[16] Three years later, in 1999, Babbage's Etc. launched its GameStop brand with 30 stores located in strip malls. The company also launched gamestop.com, a website that allowed consumers to purchase video games online. GameStop.com was promoted in Babbage's and Software Etc. stores.[17]
Barnes & Noble (1999–2004)[edit]




Gamestop shop front inside a mall


Barnes & Noble purchased Babbage's Etc. in October 1999 for $215 million.[18] Because Babbage's Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes & Noble's chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes & Noble evaluated and signed-off on the deal.[18] A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes & Noble acquired Funco, an Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based video game retailer, for $160 million.[19] Babbage's Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco.[20] With its acquisition of Funco, Barnes & Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991.[21] Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company.[20]
Barnes & Noble took GameStop public with a February 2002 initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[22] GameStop was listed under the ticker symbol GME.[22] Barnes & Noble retained control over the newly public company with 67% of outstanding shares and 95% of voting shares. Barnes & Noble retained control over GameStop until October 2004, when it distributed its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble, making it an independent company.[22][23]
GameStop (2004–present)[edit]




A store in Hillsboro, Oregon


GameStop acquired EB Games (formerly Electronics Boutique) in 2005 for $1.44 billion. The acquisition expanded GameStop's operations into Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[24] Two years later, in 2007, GameStop acquired Rhino Video Games from Blockbuster for an undisclosed amount. Rhino Video Games operated 70 video game stores throughout the Southeastern United States.[25]
GameStop purchased Free Record Shop's Norwegian stores in April 2008. The company acquired 49 stores and converted them into video game shops.[26] Daniel DeMatteo replaced Richard Fontaine as GameStop CEO in August 2008. DeMatteo had served as company COO since 1996. Fontaine, who had been GameStop chairman and CEO since 1996, remained the company's chairman.[27] J. Paul Raines, formerly executive vice president of Home Depot, became company COO in September.[27] GameStop acquired Micromania, a French video game retailer, in October 2008 for $700 million. GameStop, which had previously owned no stores in France, now had 332 French video game stores.[28] It also acquired a majority stake in Jolt Online Gaming, an Irish browser-based game studio, in November 2009. Jolt closed in 2012.[29]
J. Paul Raines became GameStop CEO in June 2010.[30] He replaced Daniel DeMatteo who was named executive chairman of the company.[30] GameStop acquired Kongregate, a San Francisco, California-based website for browser-based games; terms of the deal were not disclosed.[31]
GameStop acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse in separate transactions during 2011.[32] Spawn Labs was a developer of technology that allowed users to play video games that were run remotely on machines in data centers rather than their personal computer or console. Impulse was a digital distribution and multiplayer gaming platform.[32] GameStop closed Spawn Labs in 2014.[33]
GameStop purchased BuyMyTronics, a Denver, Colorado-based online market place for consumer electronics, in 2012.[34] Later that year, it acquired a minority interest in Simply Mac, a Utah-based authorized Apple reseller.[35] GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% interest in Simply Mac in November 2013.[1] GameStop also acquired Spring Mobile, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based retailer of AT&T-branded wireless services, in November 2013.[36] They obtained 163 RadioShack locations as of February 26, 2015, as well.[37] All GameStop stores have been closed down in Puerto Rico at the end of March 2016, citing increased rates of government taxes.[38] On August 3, 2016, it acquired 507 AT&T store chains in plans to diversify into new businesses and less dependant on the video game market.[39]
Decline (2016–present)[edit]
The market for physical game media had been in a state of decline since online services such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam had taken footholds,[40][41] and GameStop, whose business was long rooted in new and pre-owned software, began to feel the effects of the changing market. In 2017, GameStop reported a 16.4% drop in sales for the 2016 holiday season, but expressed optimism in its non-physical gaming businesses.[42] Reasons cited for the decline in sales included industry weakness, promotional pricing pressure, and lower in-store traffic.
Shares of GameStop stock fell 16% throughout 2016.[43] On February 28, 2017, shares dropped an additional 8% following Microsoft's announcement of its Xbox Game Pass service. [44] Following these reports, GameStop announced it would close over 150 stores in 2017 and expand its nongaming business.[45] On the same day, however, GameStop said it planned to open 65 new Technology Brand stores and 35 Collectibles stores due to a 44% and 28% increase in sales, respectively.[46] GameStop expects a continued drop in operating income between 3% and 10% in 2017.[47]
Owned brands and concepts[edit]
Game Informer[edit]
Game Informer is a magazine owned by GameStop, Inc. and primarily sold through subscriptions which can be purchased at GameStop locations.[48] Purchasing a subscription to the magazine also gets the subscriber the PowerUp Rewards Pro card, a pro version of GameStop's customer appreciation card. This increases all store-credit trade values by 10%, discounts all used accessories and games by 10%, gives new PowerUp members a coupon for "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" on pre-owned games and accessories, enters them twice for the Epic Rewards Giveaway for each purchase, gives the cardholder opportunities to gain points with their purchases, and redeem them for rewards and gains them access to special content on the Game Informer website.
GameStop PC Downloads[edit]
GameStop PC Downloads, formerly called Impulse, is a digital distribution service run and operated by GameStop. Originally known as Impulse when owned by Stardock, it was sold to GameStop in 2011 and rebranded as GameStop PC Downloads, with the Impulse client renamed as the GameStop App. Under the ownership of GameStop the service has had a redesign, and sells games that use other platforms such as Steam while also selling games that use its own proprietary DRM solution Impulse:Reactor.
Trade-ins[edit]
GameStop sells games that are traded in for store credit. This practice has come under fire from game publishers and developers as they make no money from the transaction.[49]
GameStop TV[edit]
GameStop TV is the in-store television network run internally GameStop, with non-endemic sales in partnership with Playwire Media, Inc.[50] GameStop TV features programming designed to speak to the consumers shopping in GameStop stores. Each month brings content segments about upcoming video game releases, exclusive developer interviews, product demonstrations and more.
Pre-order bonuses[edit]
Game publishers have begun to obtain more pre-orders by including exclusive in-game or physical bonuses, available only if the player pre-ordered the game. Bonuses typically include extras such as exclusive characters, weapons and maps. For example, GameStop included an additional avatar costume for Call of Duty: Black Ops when it was released in November 2010, and a pictorial Art-Folio for Metroid: Other M. Soundtracks, artbooks, plushies, figurines, posters, and T-shirts have also been special bonuses.
MovieStop[edit]
GameStop founded MovieStop in 2004 as a standalone store that focused on new and used movies.[51] More than 40 locations were opened, which typically adjoined or were adjacent to GameStop locations.[52] GameStop spun off MovieStop to private owners in 2012.[53] In November 2014, Draw Another Circle LLC, a company controlled by merchandising executive Joel Weinshanker that also owns Hastings Entertainment, purchased MovieStop.[54]
GameStop Kids[edit]
In October 2012 at Grapevine Mills in Dallas, GameStop introduced a new store concept known as GameStop Kids. The brand focus on children's products, and carried only games rated "Everyone" by the ESRB, along with merchandise of popular franchises aimed towards the demographic. The locations opened in 80 malls as pop-up stores for the holiday shopping season.[55][56]
GameTrust Games[edit]
In January 2016, GameStop announced a partnership it had made with Insomniac Games with their 2016 title Song of the Deep. GameStop executive Mark Stanley said the concept was to help the chain have more direct communication with players, and would expect to expand out to other similar distribution deals with other developers if this one succeeds.[57] Subsequently, in April 2016, GameStop announced that it was formally creating the GameTrust Games publishing division within the company to serve as a publisher for mid-sized developers. In addition to Insomniac Games, GameTrust Games is working with Ready At Dawn, Tequila Works, and Frozenbyte to prepare more titles to be published by the end of 2016.[58]
Simply Mac[edit]
In October 2012, GameStop acquired a 49.9% minority equity ownership interest in the Salt Lake City-based Apple authorized reseller and repairer Simply Mac. Simply Mac was founded in Salt Lake City in 2006. GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% that it did not own in November 2013. GameStop tried to target areas for potential new Simply Mac locations in slight smaller markets that did not have an existing Apple Store within a reasonable driving distance.[59][60][61]
In January 2017, GameStop closed a large number of Simply Mac locations. The chain had as many as 70 locations at the time of the announcement.[62][63] After the closings, a few recently vacated Simply Mac locations were replaced by sister company ThinkGeek.[64]
Criticism[edit]
Opened copies of game titles[edit]
The company has a policy where some copies of new games upon release are "gutted".[65] This means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter, one copy is opened so the case can be put on display, with the game disc filed separately behind the counter. Consumers may reach for the opened copy and purchase at the counter, whereupon the consumer will receive a factory-sealed copy from behind the counter. If the opened copy is the last copy of the new game, it is sold at regular price.
GameStop's check-out policy allows employees "to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days", with the intent being to allow the employee to evaluate the game and learn about its content. This check out policy does not apply to only used merchandise, which has been a hotly contested practice among the community.[66][67]
GameStop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of Deus Ex: Human Revolution.[68][69][70] GameStop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of Deus Ex: Human Revolution on OnLive, a cloud gaming service. GameStop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its subsidiaries, Spawn Labs and Impulse, which it had acquired in April 2011.[68] Later, GameStop entirely removed the PC version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution from its stores. Square Enix, the publisher of Deus Ex, said that it "respects the right of GameStop to have final say over the contents of products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies".[71]
Used games market[edit]
GameStop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles.[72] By reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game, it is argued that GameStop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue. In effect, this means that companies such as GameStop can resell used copies of a game within days of the title's release and keep all of the profit, thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers. It has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games.[73]
Fingerprint identification[edit]
It was revealed in early August 2014 that GameStop was required by the Pennsylvania State Police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at Philadelphia GameStop locations. The policy had been in place since early July of that year and did not apply to the suburban areas of Philadelphia.[74] This caused some heavy criticism from video gamers living in the affected area. Pennsylvania State Police in Philadelphia asserted that the fingerprint identification would help track thieves. By August 4, 2014, the policy had been reversed in all Philadelphia-area GameStop stores.[75]
Circle of Life policy[edit]
In February 2017, it was revealed that GameStop enforced, on all of its retail employees, a program known as Circle of Life. The policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allot a certain percentage of their sales to pre-orders, rewards cards, used games, or have a customer trade in a game.[76] Upon revelation of the policy, many GameStop employees including current and former, brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers. Many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress.[77] Later into the month, GameStop reformed the program to solely focus on the store as a whole instead of the previous individual employee basis.[78]

Operations[edit]
GameStop is divided into two operating segments: Video Game Brands and Technology Brands.[1] The Technology Brands was created during the fourth quarter of 2013, and houses the companies Simply Mac, Spring Mobile, and Cricket Wireless business. As of April 2014, the Technology Brands segment included 218 retail outlets.[4] GameStop's Video Game Brands includes the company's other businesses such as video game and consumer electronics retail shops; Kongregate, a digital video game distribution site; and buymytronics.com, a consumer electronics marketplace. Pre-owned and value video games accounted for 47% of GameStop's gross revenue for the fiscal year ending February 2014.[1]
History[edit]

Babbage's (1984–1994)[edit]
GameStop traces its roots to Babbage's, a Dallas, Texas-based software retailer founded in 1984 by former Harvard Business School classmates James McCurry and Gary M. Kusin.[5] The company was named after Charles Babbage[6] and opened its first store in Dallas's North Park Center with the help of Ross Perot, an early investor in the company.[7] The company quickly began to focus on video game sales for the then-dominant Atari 2600.[5] Babbage's began selling Nintendo games in 1987.[8] The company went public in 1988.[6] By 1991, video games accounted for two-thirds of Babbage's sales.[8]
NeoStar Retail Group (1994–1996)[edit]
Babbage's merged with Software Etc., an Edina, Minnesota-based retailer that specialized in personal computing software, to create NeoStar Retail Group in 1994.[9] The merger was structured as a stock swap, where shareholders of Babbage's and Software Etc. received shares of NeoStar, a newly formed holding company. Babbage's and Software Etc. continued to operate as independent subsidiaries of NeoStar and retained their respective senior management teams.[9] Babbage's founder and chairman James McCurry became chairman of NeoStar, while Babbage's president Gary Kusin and Software Etc. president Daniel DeMatteo retained their respective titles. Software Etc. chairman Leonard Riggio became chairman of NeoStar's executive committee.[10]
Gary Kusin resigned as president of Babbage's in February 1995 to start a cosmetics company. Daniel DeMatto, formerly president of Software Etc., assumed Kusin's duties and was promoted to president and chief operating officer of NeoStar. NeoStar chairman James McCurry was also appointed to the newly created position of NeoStar CEO.[11] The company relocated from its headquarters in Dallas to Grapevine later that year.[12]
NeoStar merged its Babbage's and Software Etc. units into a single organization in May 1996 amid declining sales. Company president Daniel DeMatteo also resigned, and NeoStar chairman and CEO James McCurry assumed the title of president.[13] In September of that year, after NeoStar was unable to secure the credit necessary to purchase inventory necessary for the holiday season, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[14] With the filing, NeoStar board member Thomas G. Plaskett became chairman and James McCurry remained company chief executive and president.[15]
The leadership changes were not enough and in November 1996 the assets of NeoStar were purchased for $58.5 million by Leonard Riggio, a founder of Software Etc. and chairman and principal stockholder of Barnes & Noble. Electronics Boutique had also bid to purchase NeoStar, but the judge presiding over NeoStar's bankruptcy accepted Riggio's bid because it kept open 108 stores more than Electronics Boutique's bid would have. Approximately 200 retail stores were not included in the transaction and were subsequently closed.[15]
Babbage’s Etc. (1996–1999)[edit]
Following his purchase of NeoStar's assets, Leonard Riggio dissolved the holding company and created a new holding company named Babbage's Etc.[16] He appointed Richard "Dick" Fontaine, previously Software Etc.'s chief executive during its expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as Babbage Etc.'s chief executive. Daniel DeMatteo, previously the president of both Software Etc. and NeoStar, became company president and COO.[16] Three years later, in 1999, Babbage's Etc. launched its GameStop brand with 30 stores located in strip malls. The company also launched gamestop.com, a website that allowed consumers to purchase video games online. GameStop.com was promoted in Babbage's and Software Etc. stores.[17]
Barnes & Noble (1999–2004)[edit]

Barnes & Noble purchased Babbage's Etc. in October 1999 for $215 million.[18] Because Babbage's Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes & Noble's chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes & Noble evaluated and signed-off on the deal.[18] A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes & Noble acquired Funco, an Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based video game retailer, for $160 million.[19] Babbage's Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco.[20] With its acquisition of Funco, Barnes & Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991.[21] Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company.[20]
Barnes & Noble took GameStop public with a February 2002 initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[22] GameStop was listed under the ticker symbol GME.[22] Barnes & Noble retained control over the newly public company with 67% of outstanding shares and 95% of voting shares. Barnes & Noble retained control over GameStop until October 2004, when it distributed its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble, making it an independent company.[22][23]
GameStop (2004–present)[edit]




A store in Hillsboro, Oregon


GameStop acquired EB Games (formerly Electronics Boutique) in 2005 for $1.44 billion. The acquisition expanded GameStop's operations into Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[24] Two years later, in 2007, GameStop acquired Rhino Video Games from Blockbuster for an undisclosed amount. Rhino Video Games operated 70 video game stores throughout the Southeastern United States.[25]
GameStop purchased Free Record Shop's Norwegian stores in April 2008. The company acquired 49 stores and converted them into video game shops.[26] Daniel DeMatteo replaced Richard Fontaine as GameStop CEO in August 2008. DeMatteo had served as company COO since 1996. Fontaine, who had been GameStop chairman and CEO since 1996, remained the company's chairman.[27] J. Paul Raines, formerly executive vice president of Home Depot, became company COO in September.[27] GameStop acquired Micromania, a French video game retailer, in October 2008 for $700 million. GameStop, which had previously owned no stores in France, now had 332 French video game stores.[28] It also acquired a majority stake in Jolt Online Gaming, an Irish browser-based game studio, in November 2009. Jolt closed in 2012.[29]
J. Paul Raines became GameStop CEO in June 2010.[30] He replaced Daniel DeMatteo who was named executive chairman of the company.[30] GameStop acquired Kongregate, a San Francisco, California-based website for browser-based games; terms of the deal were not disclosed.[31]
GameStop acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse in separate transactions during 2011.[32] Spawn Labs was a developer of technology that allowed users to play video games that were run remotely on machines in data centers rather than their personal computer or console. Impulse was a digital distribution and multiplayer gaming platform.[32] GameStop closed Spawn Labs in 2014.[33]
GameStop purchased BuyMyTronics, a Denver, Colorado-based online market place for consumer electronics, in 2012.[34] Later that year, it acquired a minority interest in Simply Mac, a Utah-based authorized Apple reseller.[35] GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% interest in Simply Mac in November 2013.[1] GameStop also acquired Spring Mobile, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based retailer of AT&T-branded wireless services, in November 2013.[36] They obtained 163 RadioShack locations as of February 26, 2015, as well.[37] All GameStop stores have been closed down in Puerto Rico at the end of March 2016, citing increased rates of government taxes.[38] On August 3, 2016, it acquired 507 AT&T store chains in plans to diversify into new businesses and less dependant on the video game market.[39]
Decline (2016–present)[edit]
The market for physical game media had been in a state of decline since online services such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam had taken footholds,[40][41] and GameStop, whose business was long rooted in new and pre-owned software, began to feel the effects of the changing market. In 2017, GameStop reported a 16.4% drop in sales for the 2016 holiday season, but expressed optimism in its non-physical gaming businesses.[42] Reasons cited for the decline in sales included industry weakness, promotional pricing pressure, and lower in-store traffic.
Shares of GameStop stock fell 16% throughout 2016.[43] On February 28, 2017, shares dropped an additional 8% following Microsoft's announcement of its Xbox Game Pass service. [44] Following these reports, GameStop announced it would close over 150 stores in 2017 and expand its nongaming business.[45] On the same day, however, GameStop said it planned to open 65 new Technology Brand stores and 35 Collectibles stores due to a 44% and 28% increase in sales, respectively.[46] GameStop expects a continued drop in operating income between 3% and 10% in 2017.[47]
Owned brands and concepts[edit]
Game Informer[edit]
Game Informer is a magazine owned by GameStop, Inc. and primarily sold through subscriptions which can be purchased at GameStop locations.[48] Purchasing a subscription to the magazine also gets the subscriber the PowerUp Rewards Pro card, a pro version of GameStop's customer appreciation card. This increases all store-credit trade values by 10%, discounts all used accessories and games by 10%, gives new PowerUp members a coupon for "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" on pre-owned games and accessories, enters them twice for the Epic Rewards Giveaway for each purchase, gives the cardholder opportunities to gain points with their purchases, and redeem them for rewards and gains them access to special content on the Game Informer website.
GameStop PC Downloads[edit]
GameStop PC Downloads, formerly called Impulse, is a digital distribution service run and operated by GameStop. Originally known as Impulse when owned by Stardock, it was sold to GameStop in 2011 and rebranded as GameStop PC Downloads, with the Impulse client renamed as the GameStop App. Under the ownership of GameStop the service has had a redesign, and sells games that use other platforms such as Steam while also selling games that use its own proprietary DRM solution Impulse:Reactor.
Trade-ins[edit]
GameStop sells games that are traded in for store credit. This practice has come under fire from game publishers and developers as they make no money from the transaction.[49]
GameStop TV[edit]
GameStop TV is the in-store television network run internally GameStop, with non-endemic sales in partnership with Playwire Media, Inc.[50] GameStop TV features programming designed to speak to the consumers shopping in GameStop stores. Each month brings content segments about upcoming video game releases, exclusive developer interviews, product demonstrations and more.
Pre-order bonuses[edit]
Game publishers have begun to obtain more pre-orders by including exclusive in-game or physical bonuses, available only if the player pre-ordered the game. Bonuses typically include extras such as exclusive characters, weapons and maps. For example, GameStop included an additional avatar costume for Call of Duty: Black Ops when it was released in November 2010, and a pictorial Art-Folio for Metroid: Other M. Soundtracks, artbooks, plushies, figurines, posters, and T-shirts have also been special bonuses.
MovieStop[edit]
GameStop founded MovieStop in 2004 as a standalone store that focused on new and used movies.[51] More than 40 locations were opened, which typically adjoined or were adjacent to GameStop locations.[52] GameStop spun off MovieStop to private owners in 2012.[53] In November 2014, Draw Another Circle LLC, a company controlled by merchandising executive Joel Weinshanker that also owns Hastings Entertainment, purchased MovieStop.[54]
GameStop Kids[edit]
In October 2012 at Grapevine Mills in Dallas, GameStop introduced a new store concept known as GameStop Kids. The brand focus on children's products, and carried only games rated "Everyone" by the ESRB, along with merchandise of popular franchises aimed towards the demographic. The locations opened in 80 malls as pop-up stores for the holiday shopping season.[55][56]
GameTrust Games[edit]
In January 2016, GameStop announced a partnership it had made with Insomniac Games with their 2016 title Song of the Deep. GameStop executive Mark Stanley said the concept was to help the chain have more direct communication with players, and would expect to expand out to other similar distribution deals with other developers if this one succeeds.[57] Subsequently, in April 2016, GameStop announced that it was formally creating the GameTrust Games publishing division within the company to serve as a publisher for mid-sized developers. In addition to Insomniac Games, GameTrust Games is working with Ready At Dawn, Tequila Works, and Frozenbyte to prepare more titles to be published by the end of 2016.[58]
Simply Mac[edit]
In October 2012, GameStop acquired a 49.9% minority equity ownership interest in the Salt Lake City-based Apple authorized reseller and repairer Simply Mac. Simply Mac was founded in Salt Lake City in 2006. GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% that it did not own in November 2013. GameStop tried to target areas for potential new Simply Mac locations in slight smaller markets that did not have an existing Apple Store within a reasonable driving distance.[59][60][61]
In January 2017, GameStop closed a large number of Simply Mac locations. The chain had as many as 70 locations at the time of the announcement.[62][63] After the closings, a few recently vacated Simply Mac locations were replaced by sister company ThinkGeek.[64]
Criticism[edit]
Opened copies of game titles[edit]
The company has a policy where some copies of new games upon release are "gutted".[65] This means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter, one copy is opened so the case can be put on display, with the game disc filed separately behind the counter. Consumers may reach for the opened copy and purchase at the counter, whereupon the consumer will receive a factory-sealed copy from behind the counter. If the opened copy is the last copy of the new game, it is sold at regular price.
GameStop's check-out policy allows employees "to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days", with the intent being to allow the employee to evaluate the game and learn about its content. This check out policy does not apply to only used merchandise, which has been a hotly contested practice among the community.[66][67]
GameStop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of Deus Ex: Human Revolution.[68][69][70] GameStop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of Deus Ex: Human Revolution on OnLive, a cloud gaming service. GameStop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its subsidiaries, Spawn Labs and Impulse, which it had acquired in April 2011.[68] Later, GameStop entirely removed the PC version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution from its stores. Square Enix, the publisher of Deus Ex, said that it "respects the right of GameStop to have final say over the contents of products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies".[71]
Used games market[edit]
GameStop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles.[72] By reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game, it is argued that GameStop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue. In effect, this means that companies such as GameStop can resell used copies of a game within days of the title's release and keep all of the profit, thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers. It has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games.[73]
Fingerprint identification[edit]
It was revealed in early August 2014 that GameStop was required by the Pennsylvania State Police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at Philadelphia GameStop locations. The policy had been in place since early July of that year and did not apply to the suburban areas of Philadelphia.[74] This caused some heavy criticism from video gamers living in the affected area. Pennsylvania State Police in Philadelphia asserted that the fingerprint identification would help track thieves. By August 4, 2014, the policy had been reversed in all Philadelphia-area GameStop stores.[75]
Circle of Life policy[edit]
In February 2017, it was revealed that GameStop enforced, on all of its retail employees, a program known as Circle of Life. The policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allot a certain percentage of their sales to pre-orders, rewards cards, used games, or have a customer trade in a game.[76] Upon revelation of the policy, many GameStop employees including current and former, brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers. Many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress.[77] Later into the month, GameStop reformed the program to solely focus on the store as a whole instead of the previous individual employee basis.[78]

Operations[edit]
GameStop is divided into two operating segments: Video Game Brands and Technology Brands.[1] The Technology Brands was created during the fourth quarter of 2013, and houses the companies Simply Mac, Spring Mobile, and Cricket Wireless business. As of April 2014, the Technology Brands segment included 218 retail outlets.[4] GameStop's Video Game Brands includes the company's other businesses such as video game and consumer electronics retail shops; Kongregate, a digital video game distribution site; and buymytronics.com, a consumer electronics marketplace. Pre-owned and value video games accounted for 47% of GameStop's gross revenue for the fiscal year ending February 2014.[1]
History[edit]

Babbage's (1984–1994)[edit]
GameStop traces its roots to Babbage's, a Dallas, Texas-based software retailer founded in 1984 by former Harvard Business School classmates James McCurry and Gary M. Kusin.[5] The company was named after Charles Babbage[6] and opened its first store in Dallas's North Park Center with the help of Ross Perot, an early investor in the company.[7] The company quickly began to focus on video game sales for the then-dominant Atari 2600.[5] Babbage's began selling Nintendo games in 1987.[8] The company went public in 1988.[6] By 1991, video games accounted for two-thirds of Babbage's sales.[8]
NeoStar Retail Group (1994–1996)[edit]
Babbage's merged with Software Etc., an Edina, Minnesota-based retailer that specialized in personal computing software, to create NeoStar Retail Group in 1994.[9] The merger was structured as a stock swap, where shareholders of Babbage's and Software Etc. received shares of NeoStar, a newly formed holding company. Babbage's and Software Etc. continued to operate as independent subsidiaries of NeoStar and retained their respective senior management teams.[9] Babbage's founder and chairman James McCurry became chairman of NeoStar, while Babbage's president Gary Kusin and Software Etc. president Daniel DeMatteo retained their respective titles. Software Etc. chairman Leonard Riggio became chairman of NeoStar's executive committee.[10]
Gary Kusin resigned as president of Babbage's in February 1995 to start a cosmetics company. Daniel DeMatto, formerly president of Software Etc., assumed Kusin's duties and was promoted to president and chief operating officer of NeoStar. NeoStar chairman James McCurry was also appointed to the newly created position of NeoStar CEO.[11] The company relocated from its headquarters in Dallas to Grapevine later that year.[12]
NeoStar merged its Babbage's and Software Etc. units into a single organization in May 1996 amid declining sales. Company president Daniel DeMatteo also resigned, and NeoStar chairman and CEO James McCurry assumed the title of president.[13] In September of that year, after NeoStar was unable to secure the credit necessary to purchase inventory necessary for the holiday season, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[14] With the filing, NeoStar board member Thomas G. Plaskett became chairman and James McCurry remained company chief executive and president.[15]
The leadership changes were not enough and in November 1996 the assets of NeoStar were purchased for $58.5 million by Leonard Riggio, a founder of Software Etc. and chairman and principal stockholder of Barnes & Noble. Electronics Boutique had also bid to purchase NeoStar, but the judge presiding over NeoStar's bankruptcy accepted Riggio's bid because it kept open 108 stores more than Electronics Boutique's bid would have. Approximately 200 retail stores were not included in the transaction and were subsequently closed.[15]
Babbage’s Etc. (1996–1999)[edit]
Following his purchase of NeoStar's assets, Leonard Riggio dissolved the holding company and created a new holding company named Babbage's Etc.[16] He appointed Richard "Dick" Fontaine, previously Software Etc.'s chief executive during its expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as Babbage Etc.'s chief executive. Daniel DeMatteo, previously the president of both Software Etc. and NeoStar, became company president and COO.[16] Three years later, in 1999, Babbage's Etc. launched its GameStop brand with 30 stores located in strip malls. The company also launched gamestop.com, a website that allowed consumers to purchase video games online. GameStop.com was promoted in Babbage's and Software Etc. stores.[17]
Barnes & Noble (1999–2004)[edit]

Barnes & Noble purchased Babbage's Etc. in October 1999 for $215 million.[18] Because Babbage's Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes & Noble's chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes & Noble evaluated and signed-off on the deal.[18] A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes & Noble acquired Funco, an Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based video game retailer, for $160 million.[19] Babbage's Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco.[20] With its acquisition of Funco, Barnes & Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991.[21] Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company.[20]
Barnes & Noble took GameStop public with a February 2002 initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[22] GameStop was listed under the ticker symbol GME.[22] Barnes & Noble retained control over the newly public company with 67% of outstanding shares and 95% of voting shares. Barnes & Noble retained control over GameStop until October 2004, when it distributed its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble, making it an independent company.[22][23]
GameStop (2004–present)[edit]




A store in Hillsboro, Oregon


GameStop acquired EB Games (formerly Electronics Boutique) in 2005 for $1.44 billion. The acquisition expanded GameStop's operations into Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[24] Two years later, in 2007, GameStop acquired Rhino Video Games from Blockbuster for an undisclosed amount. Rhino Video Games operated 70 video game stores throughout the Southeastern United States.[25]
GameStop purchased Free Record Shop's Norwegian stores in April 2008. The company acquired 49 stores and converted them into video game shops.[26] Daniel DeMatteo replaced Richard Fontaine as GameStop CEO in August 2008. DeMatteo had served as company COO since 1996. Fontaine, who had been GameStop chairman and CEO since 1996, remained the company's chairman.[27] J. Paul Raines, formerly executive vice president of Home Depot, became company COO in September.[27] GameStop acquired Micromania, a French video game retailer, in October 2008 for $700 million. GameStop, which had previously owned no stores in France, now had 332 French video game stores.[28] It also acquired a majority stake in Jolt Online Gaming, an Irish browser-based game studio, in November 2009. Jolt closed in 2012.[29]
J. Paul Raines became GameStop CEO in June 2010.[30] He replaced Daniel DeMatteo who was named executive chairman of the company.[30] GameStop acquired Kongregate, a San Francisco, California-based website for browser-based games; terms of the deal were not disclosed.[31]
GameStop acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse in separate transactions during 2011.[32] Spawn Labs was a developer of technology that allowed users to play video games that were run remotely on machines in data centers rather than their personal computer or console. Impulse was a digital distribution and multiplayer gaming platform.[32] GameStop closed Spawn Labs in 2014.[33]
GameStop purchased BuyMyTronics, a Denver, Colorado-based online market place for consumer electronics, in 2012.[34] Later that year, it acquired a minority interest in Simply Mac, a Utah-based authorized Apple reseller.[35] GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% interest in Simply Mac in November 2013.[1] GameStop also acquired Spring Mobile, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based retailer of AT&T-branded wireless services, in November 2013.[36] They obtained 163 RadioShack locations as of February 26, 2015, as well.[37] All GameStop stores have been closed down in Puerto Rico at the end of March 2016, citing increased rates of government taxes.[38] On August 3, 2016, it acquired 507 AT&T store chains in plans to diversify into new businesses and less dependant on the video game market.[39]
Decline (2016–present)[edit]
The market for physical game media had been in a state of decline since online services such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam had taken footholds,[40][41] and GameStop, whose business was long rooted in new and pre-owned software, began to feel the effects of the changing market. In 2017, GameStop reported a 16.4% drop in sales for the 2016 holiday season, but expressed optimism in its non-physical gaming businesses.[42] Reasons cited for the decline in sales included industry weakness, promotional pricing pressure, and lower in-store traffic.
Shares of GameStop stock fell 16% throughout 2016.[43] On February 28, 2017, shares dropped an additional 8% following Microsoft's announcement of its Xbox Game Pass service. [44] Following these reports, GameStop announced it would close over 150 stores in 2017 and expand its nongaming business.[45] On the same day, however, GameStop said it planned to open 65 new Technology Brand stores and 35 Collectibles stores due to a 44% and 28% increase in sales, respectively.[46] GameStop expects a continued drop in operating income between 3% and 10% in 2017.[47]
Owned brands and concepts[edit]
Game Informer[edit]
Game Informer is a magazine owned by GameStop, Inc. and primarily sold through subscriptions which can be purchased at GameStop locations.[48] Purchasing a subscription to the magazine also gets the subscriber the PowerUp Rewards Pro card, a pro version of GameStop's customer appreciation card. This increases all store-credit trade values by 10%, discounts all used accessories and games by 10%, gives new PowerUp members a coupon for "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" on pre-owned games and accessories, enters them twice for the Epic Rewards Giveaway for each purchase, gives the cardholder opportunities to gain points with their purchases, and redeem them for rewards and gains them access to special content on the Game Informer website.
GameStop PC Downloads[edit]
GameStop PC Downloads, formerly called Impulse, is a digital distribution service run and operated by GameStop. Originally known as Impulse when owned by Stardock, it was sold to GameStop in 2011 and rebranded as GameStop PC Downloads, with the Impulse client renamed as the GameStop App. Under the ownership of GameStop the service has had a redesign, and sells games that use other platforms such as Steam while also selling games that use its own proprietary DRM solution Impulse:Reactor.
Trade-ins[edit]
GameStop sells games that are traded in for store credit. This practice has come under fire from game publishers and developers as they make no money from the transaction.[49]
GameStop TV[edit]
GameStop TV is the in-store television network run internally GameStop, with non-endemic sales in partnership with Playwire Media, Inc.[50] GameStop TV features programming designed to speak to the consumers shopping in GameStop stores. Each month brings content segments about upcoming video game releases, exclusive developer interviews, product demonstrations and more.
Pre-order bonuses[edit]
Game publishers have begun to obtain more pre-orders by including exclusive in-game or physical bonuses, available only if the player pre-ordered the game. Bonuses typically include extras such as exclusive characters, weapons and maps. For example, GameStop included an additional avatar costume for Call of Duty: Black Ops when it was released in November 2010, and a pictorial Art-Folio for Metroid: Other M. Soundtracks, artbooks, plushies, figurines, posters, and T-shirts have also been special bonuses.
MovieStop[edit]
GameStop founded MovieStop in 2004 as a standalone store that focused on new and used movies.[51] More than 40 locations were opened, which typically adjoined or were adjacent to GameStop locations.[52] GameStop spun off MovieStop to private owners in 2012.[53] In November 2014, Draw Another Circle LLC, a company controlled by merchandising executive Joel Weinshanker that also owns Hastings Entertainment, purchased MovieStop.[54]
GameStop Kids[edit]
In October 2012 at Grapevine Mills in Dallas, GameStop introduced a new store concept known as GameStop Kids. The brand focus on children's products, and carried only games rated "Everyone" by the ESRB, along with merchandise of popular franchises aimed towards the demographic. The locations opened in 80 malls as pop-up stores for the holiday shopping season.[55][56]
GameTrust Games[edit]
In January 2016, GameStop announced a partnership it had made with Insomniac Games with their 2016 title Song of the Deep. GameStop executive Mark Stanley said the concept was to help the chain have more direct communication with players, and would expect to expand out to other similar distribution deals with other developers if this one succeeds.[57] Subsequently, in April 2016, GameStop announced that it was formally creating the GameTrust Games publishing division within the company to serve as a publisher for mid-sized developers. In addition to Insomniac Games, GameTrust Games is working with Ready At Dawn, Tequila Works, and Frozenbyte to prepare more titles to be published by the end of 2016.[58]
Simply Mac[edit]
In October 2012, GameStop acquired a 49.9% minority equity ownership interest in the Salt Lake City-based Apple authorized reseller and repairer Simply Mac. Simply Mac was founded in Salt Lake City in 2006. GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% that it did not own in November 2013. GameStop tried to target areas for potential new Simply Mac locations in slight smaller markets that did not have an existing Apple Store within a reasonable driving distance.[59][60][61]
In January 2017, GameStop closed a large number of Simply Mac locations. The chain had as many as 70 locations at the time of the announcement.[62][63] After the closings, a few recently vacated Simply Mac locations were replaced by sister company ThinkGeek.[64]
Criticism[edit]
Opened copies of game titles[edit]
The company has a policy where some copies of new games upon release are "gutted".[65] This means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter, one copy is opened so the case can be put on display, with the game disc filed separately behind the counter. Consumers may reach for the opened copy and purchase at the counter, whereupon the consumer will receive a factory-sealed copy from behind the counter. If the opened copy is the last copy of the new game, it is sold at regular price.
GameStop's check-out policy allows employees "to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days", with the intent being to allow the employee to evaluate the game and learn about its content. This check out policy does not apply to only used merchandise, which has been a hotly contested practice among the community.[66][67]
GameStop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of Deus Ex: Human Revolution.[68][69][70] GameStop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of Deus Ex: Human Revolution on OnLive, a cloud gaming service. GameStop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its subsidiaries, Spawn Labs and Impulse, which it had acquired in April 2011.[68] Later, GameStop entirely removed the PC version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution from its stores. Square Enix, the publisher of Deus Ex, said that it "respects the right of GameStop to have final say over the contents of products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies".[71]
Used games market[edit]
GameStop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles.[72] By reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game, it is argued that GameStop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue. In effect, this means that companies such as GameStop can resell used copies of a game within days of the title's release and keep all of the profit, thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers. It has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games.[73]
Fingerprint identification[edit]
It was revealed in early August 2014 that GameStop was required by the Pennsylvania State Police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at Philadelphia GameStop locations. The policy had been in place since early July of that year and did not apply to the suburban areas of Philadelphia.[74] This caused some heavy criticism from video gamers living in the affected area. Pennsylvania State Police in Philadelphia asserted that the fingerprint identification would help track thieves. By August 4, 2014, the policy had been reversed in all Philadelphia-area GameStop stores.[75]
Circle of Life policy[edit]
In February 2017, it was revealed that GameStop enforced, on all of its retail employees, a program known as Circle of Life. The policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allot a certain percentage of their sales to pre-orders, rewards cards, used games, or have a customer trade in a game.[76] Upon revelation of the policy, many GameStop employees including current and former, brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers. Many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress.[77] Later into the month, GameStop reformed the program to solely focus on the store as a whole instead of the previous individual employee basis.[78]

Operations[edit]
GameStop is divided into two operating segments: Video Game Brands and Technology Brands.[1] The Technology Brands was created during the fourth quarter of 2013, and houses the companies Simply Mac, Spring Mobile, and Cricket Wireless business. As of April 2014, the Technology Brands segment included 218 retail outlets.[4] GameStop's Video Game Brands includes the company's other businesses such as video game and consumer electronics retail shops; Kongregate, a digital video game distribution site; and buymytronics.com, a consumer electronics marketplace. Pre-owned and value video games accounted for 47% of GameStop's gross revenue for the fiscal year ending February 2014.[1]
History[edit]

Babbage's (1984–1994)[edit]
GameStop traces its roots to Babbage's, a Dallas, Texas-based software retailer founded in 1984 by former Harvard Business School classmates James McCurry and Gary M. Kusin.[5] The company was named after Charles Babbage[6] and opened its first store in Dallas's North Park Center with the help of Ross Perot, an early investor in the company.[7] The company quickly began to focus on video game sales for the then-dominant Atari 2600.[5] Babbage's began selling Nintendo games in 1987.[8] The company went public in 1988.[6] By 1991, video games accounted for two-thirds of Babbage's sales.[8]
NeoStar Retail Group (1994–1996)[edit]
Babbage's merged with Software Etc., an Edina, Minnesota-based retailer that specialized in personal computing software, to create NeoStar Retail Group in 1994.[9] The merger was structured as a stock swap, where shareholders of Babbage's and Software Etc. received shares of NeoStar, a newly formed holding company. Babbage's and Software Etc. continued to operate as independent subsidiaries of NeoStar and retained their respective senior management teams.[9] Babbage's founder and chairman James McCurry became chairman of NeoStar, while Babbage's president Gary Kusin and Software Etc. president Daniel DeMatteo retained their respective titles. Software Etc. chairman Leonard Riggio became chairman of NeoStar's executive committee.[10]
Gary Kusin resigned as president of Babbage's in February 1995 to start a cosmetics company. Daniel DeMatto, formerly president of Software Etc., assumed Kusin's duties and was promoted to president and chief operating officer of NeoStar. NeoStar chairman James McCurry was also appointed to the newly created position of NeoStar CEO.[11] The company relocated from its headquarters in Dallas to Grapevine later that year.[12]
NeoStar merged its Babbage's and Software Etc. units into a single organization in May 1996 amid declining sales. Company president Daniel DeMatteo also resigned, and NeoStar chairman and CEO James McCurry assumed the title of president.[13] In September of that year, after NeoStar was unable to secure the credit necessary to purchase inventory necessary for the holiday season, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[14] With the filing, NeoStar board member Thomas G. Plaskett became chairman and James McCurry remained company chief executive and president.[15]
The leadership changes were not enough and in November 1996 the assets of NeoStar were purchased for $58.5 million by Leonard Riggio, a founder of Software Etc. and chairman and principal stockholder of Barnes & Noble. Electronics Boutique had also bid to purchase NeoStar, but the judge presiding over NeoStar's bankruptcy accepted Riggio's bid because it kept open 108 stores more than Electronics Boutique's bid would have. Approximately 200 retail stores were not included in the transaction and were subsequently closed.[15]
Babbage’s Etc. (1996–1999)[edit]
Following his purchase of NeoStar's assets, Leonard Riggio dissolved the holding company and created a new holding company named Babbage's Etc.[16] He appointed Richard "Dick" Fontaine, previously Software Etc.'s chief executive during its expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as Babbage Etc.'s chief executive. Daniel DeMatteo, previously the president of both Software Etc. and NeoStar, became company president and COO.[16] Three years later, in 1999, Babbage's Etc. launched its GameStop brand with 30 stores located in strip malls. The company also launched gamestop.com, a website that allowed consumers to purchase video games online. GameStop.com was promoted in Babbage's and Software Etc. stores.[17]
Barnes & Noble (1999–2004)[edit]

Barnes & Noble purchased Babbage's Etc. in October 1999 for $215 million.[18] Because Babbage's Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes & Noble's chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes & Noble evaluated and signed-off on the deal.[18] A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes & Noble acquired Funco, an Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based video game retailer, for $160 million.[19] Babbage's Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco.[20] With its acquisition of Funco, Barnes & Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991.[21] Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company.[20]
Barnes & Noble took GameStop public with a February 2002 initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[22] GameStop was listed under the ticker symbol GME.[22] Barnes & Noble retained control over the newly public company with 67% of outstanding shares and 95% of voting shares. Barnes & Noble retained control over GameStop until October 2004, when it distributed its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble, making it an independent company.[22][23]
GameStop (2004–present)[edit]




A store in Hillsboro, Oregon


GameStop acquired EB Games (formerly Electronics Boutique) in 2005 for $1.44 billion. The acquisition expanded GameStop's operations into Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[24] Two years later, in 2007, GameStop acquired Rhino Video Games from Blockbuster for an undisclosed amount. Rhino Video Games operated 70 video game stores throughout the Southeastern United States.[25]
GameStop purchased Free Record Shop's Norwegian stores in April 2008. The company acquired 49 stores and converted them into video game shops.[26] Daniel DeMatteo replaced Richard Fontaine as GameStop CEO in August 2008. DeMatteo had served as company COO since 1996. Fontaine, who had been GameStop chairman and CEO since 1996, remained the company's chairman.[27] J. Paul Raines, formerly executive vice president of Home Depot, became company COO in September.[27] GameStop acquired Micromania, a French video game retailer, in October 2008 for $700 million. GameStop, which had previously owned no stores in France, now had 332 French video game stores.[28] It also acquired a majority stake in Jolt Online Gaming, an Irish browser-based game studio, in November 2009. Jolt closed in 2012.[29]
J. Paul Raines became GameStop CEO in June 2010.[30] He replaced Daniel DeMatteo who was named executive chairman of the company.[30] GameStop acquired Kongregate, a San Francisco, California-based website for browser-based games; terms of the deal were not disclosed.[31]
GameStop acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse in separate transactions during 2011.[32] Spawn Labs was a developer of technology that allowed users to play video games that were run remotely on machines in data centers rather than their personal computer or console. Impulse was a digital distribution and multiplayer gaming platform.[32] GameStop closed Spawn Labs in 2014.[33]
GameStop purchased BuyMyTronics, a Denver, Colorado-based online market place for consumer electronics, in 2012.[34] Later that year, it acquired a minority interest in Simply Mac, a Utah-based authorized Apple reseller.[35] GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% interest in Simply Mac in November 2013.[1] GameStop also acquired Spring Mobile, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based retailer of AT&T-branded wireless services, in November 2013.[36] They obtained 163 RadioShack locations as of February 26, 2015, as well.[37] All GameStop stores have been closed down in Puerto Rico at the end of March 2016, citing increased rates of government taxes.[38] On August 3, 2016, it acquired 507 AT&T store chains in plans to diversify into new businesses and less dependant on the video game market.[39]
Decline (2016–present)[edit]
The market for physical game media had been in a state of decline since online services such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam had taken footholds,[40][41] and GameStop, whose business was long rooted in new and pre-owned software, began to feel the effects of the changing market. In 2017, GameStop reported a 16.4% drop in sales for the 2016 holiday season, but expressed optimism in its non-physical gaming businesses.[42] Reasons cited for the decline in sales included industry weakness, promotional pricing pressure, and lower in-store traffic.
Shares of GameStop stock fell 16% throughout 2016.[43] On February 28, 2017, shares dropped an additional 8% following Microsoft's announcement of its Xbox Game Pass service. [44] Following these reports, GameStop announced it would close over 150 stores in 2017 and expand its nongaming business.[45] On the same day, however, GameStop said it planned to open 65 new Technology Brand stores and 35 Collectibles stores due to a 44% and 28% increase in sales, respectively.[46] GameStop expects a continued drop in operating income between 3% and 10% in 2017.[47]
Owned brands and concepts[edit]
Game Informer[edit]
Game Informer is a magazine owned by GameStop, Inc. and primarily sold through subscriptions which can be purchased at GameStop locations.[48] Purchasing a subscription to the magazine also gets the subscriber the PowerUp Rewards Pro card, a pro version of GameStop's customer appreciation card. This increases all store-credit trade values by 10%, discounts all used accessories and games by 10%, gives new PowerUp members a coupon for "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" on pre-owned games and accessories, enters them twice for the Epic Rewards Giveaway for each purchase, gives the cardholder opportunities to gain points with their purchases, and redeem them for rewards and gains them access to special content on the Game Informer website.
GameStop PC Downloads[edit]
GameStop PC Downloads, formerly called Impulse, is a digital distribution service run and operated by GameStop. Originally known as Impulse when owned by Stardock, it was sold to GameStop in 2011 and rebranded as GameStop PC Downloads, with the Impulse client renamed as the GameStop App. Under the ownership of GameStop the service has had a redesign, and sells games that use other platforms such as Steam while also selling games that use its own proprietary DRM solution Impulse:Reactor.
Trade-ins[edit]
GameStop sells games that are traded in for store credit. This practice has come under fire from game publishers and developers as they make no money from the transaction.[49]
GameStop TV[edit]
GameStop TV is the in-store television network run internally GameStop, with non-endemic sales in partnership with Playwire Media, Inc.[50] GameStop TV features programming designed to speak to the consumers shopping in GameStop stores. Each month brings content segments about upcoming video game releases, exclusive developer interviews, product demonstrations and more.
Pre-order bonuses[edit]
Game publishers have begun to obtain more pre-orders by including exclusive in-game or physical bonuses, available only if the player pre-ordered the game. Bonuses typically include extras such as exclusive characters, weapons and maps. For example, GameStop included an additional avatar costume for Call of Duty: Black Ops when it was released in November 2010, and a pictorial Art-Folio for Metroid: Other M. Soundtracks, artbooks, plushies, figurines, posters, and T-shirts have also been special bonuses.
MovieStop[edit]
GameStop founded MovieStop in 2004 as a standalone store that focused on new and used movies.[51] More than 40 locations were opened, which typically adjoined or were adjacent to GameStop locations.[52] GameStop spun off MovieStop to private owners in 2012.[53] In November 2014, Draw Another Circle LLC, a company controlled by merchandising executive Joel Weinshanker that also owns Hastings Entertainment, purchased MovieStop.[54]
GameStop Kids[edit]
In October 2012 at Grapevine Mills in Dallas, GameStop introduced a new store concept known as GameStop Kids. The brand focus on children's products, and carried only games rated "Everyone" by the ESRB, along with merchandise of popular franchises aimed towards the demographic. The locations opened in 80 malls as pop-up stores for the holiday shopping season.[55][56]
GameTrust Games[edit]
In January 2016, GameStop announced a partnership it had made with Insomniac Games with their 2016 title Song of the Deep. GameStop executive Mark Stanley said the concept was to help the chain have more direct communication with players, and would expect to expand out to other similar distribution deals with other developers if this one succeeds.[57] Subsequently, in April 2016, GameStop announced that it was formally creating the GameTrust Games publishing division within the company to serve as a publisher for mid-sized developers. In addition to Insomniac Games, GameTrust Games is working with Ready At Dawn, Tequila Works, and Frozenbyte to prepare more titles to be published by the end of 2016.[58]
Simply Mac[edit]
In October 2012, GameStop acquired a 49.9% minority equity ownership interest in the Salt Lake City-based Apple authorized reseller and repairer Simply Mac. Simply Mac was founded in Salt Lake City in 2006. GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% that it did not own in November 2013. GameStop tried to target areas for potential new Simply Mac locations in slight smaller markets that did not have an existing Apple Store within a reasonable driving distance.[59][60][61]
In January 2017, GameStop closed a large number of Simply Mac locations. The chain had as many as 70 locations at the time of the announcement.[62][63] After the closings, a few recently vacated Simply Mac locations were replaced by sister company ThinkGeek.[64]
Criticism[edit]
Opened copies of game titles[edit]
The company has a policy where some copies of new games upon release are "gutted".[65] This means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter, one copy is opened so the case can be put on display, with the game disc filed separately behind the counter. Consumers may reach for the opened copy and purchase at the counter, whereupon the consumer will receive a factory-sealed copy from behind the counter. If the opened copy is the last copy of the new game, it is sold at regular price.
GameStop's check-out policy allows employees "to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days", with the intent being to allow the employee to evaluate the game and learn about its content. This check out policy does not apply to only used merchandise, which has been a hotly contested practice among the community.[66][67]
GameStop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of Deus Ex: Human Revolution.[68][69][70] GameStop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of Deus Ex: Human Revolution on OnLive, a cloud gaming service. GameStop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its subsidiaries, Spawn Labs and Impulse, which it had acquired in April 2011.[68] Later, GameStop entirely removed the PC version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution from its stores. Square Enix, the publisher of Deus Ex, said that it "respects the right of GameStop to have final say over the contents of products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies".[71]
Used games market[edit]
GameStop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles.[72] By reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game, it is argued that GameStop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue. In effect, this means that companies such as GameStop can resell used copies of a game within days of the title's release and keep all of the profit, thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers. It has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games.[73]
Fingerprint identification[edit]
It was revealed in early August 2014 that GameStop was required by the Pennsylvania State Police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at Philadelphia GameStop locations. The policy had been in place since early July of that year and did not apply to the suburban areas of Philadelphia.[74] This caused some heavy criticism from video gamers living in the affected area. Pennsylvania State Police in Philadelphia asserted that the fingerprint identification would help track thieves. By August 4, 2014, the policy had been reversed in all Philadelphia-area GameStop stores.[75]
Circle of Life policy[edit]
In February 2017, it was revealed that GameStop enforced, on all of its retail employees, a program known as Circle of Life. The policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allot a certain percentage of their sales to pre-orders, rewards cards, used games, or have a customer trade in a game.[76] Upon revelation of the policy, many GameStop employees including current and former, brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers. Many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress.[77] Later into the month, GameStop reformed the program to solely focus on the store as a whole instead of the previous individual employee basis.[78]

Operations[edit]
GameStop is divided into two operating segments: Video Game Brands and Technology Brands.[1] The Technology Brands was created during the fourth quarter of 2013, and houses the companies Simply Mac, Spring Mobile, and Cricket Wireless business. As of April 2014, the Technology Brands segment included 218 retail outlets.[4] GameStop's Video Game Brands includes the company's other businesses such as video game and consumer electronics retail shops; Kongregate, a digital video game distribution site; and buymytronics.com, a consumer electronics marketplace. Pre-owned and value video games accounted for 47% of GameStop's gross revenue for the fiscal year ending February 2014.[1]
History[edit]

Babbage's (1984–1994)[edit]
GameStop traces its roots to Babbage's, a Dallas, Texas-based software retailer founded in 1984 by former Harvard Business School classmates James McCurry and Gary M. Kusin.[5] The company was named after Charles Babbage[6] and opened its first store in Dallas's North Park Center with the help of Ross Perot, an early investor in the company.[7] The company quickly began to focus on video game sales for the then-dominant Atari 2600.[5] Babbage's began selling Nintendo games in 1987.[8] The company went public in 1988.[6] By 1991, video games accounted for two-thirds of Babbage's sales.[8]
NeoStar Retail Group (1994–1996)[edit]
Babbage's merged with Software Etc., an Edina, Minnesota-based retailer that specialized in personal computing software, to create NeoStar Retail Group in 1994.[9] The merger was structured as a stock swap, where shareholders of Babbage's and Software Etc. received shares of NeoStar, a newly formed holding company. Babbage's and Software Etc. continued to operate as independent subsidiaries of NeoStar and retained their respective senior management teams.[9] Babbage's founder and chairman James McCurry became chairman of NeoStar, while Babbage's president Gary Kusin and Software Etc. president Daniel DeMatteo retained their respective titles. Software Etc. chairman Leonard Riggio became chairman of NeoStar's executive committee.[10]
Gary Kusin resigned as president of Babbage's in February 1995 to start a cosmetics company. Daniel DeMatto, formerly president of Software Etc., assumed Kusin's duties and was promoted to president and chief operating officer of NeoStar. NeoStar chairman James McCurry was also appointed to the newly created position of NeoStar CEO.[11] The company relocated from its headquarters in Dallas to Grapevine later that year.[12]
NeoStar merged its Babbage's and Software Etc. units into a single organization in May 1996 amid declining sales. Company president Daniel DeMatteo also resigned, and NeoStar chairman and CEO James McCurry assumed the title of president.[13] In September of that year, after NeoStar was unable to secure the credit necessary to purchase inventory necessary for the holiday season, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[14] With the filing, NeoStar board member Thomas G. Plaskett became chairman and James McCurry remained company chief executive and president.[15]
The leadership changes were not enough and in November 1996 the assets of NeoStar were purchased for $58.5 million by Leonard Riggio, a founder of Software Etc. and chairman and principal stockholder of Barnes & Noble. Electronics Boutique had also bid to purchase NeoStar, but the judge presiding over NeoStar's bankruptcy accepted Riggio's bid because it kept open 108 stores more than Electronics Boutique's bid would have. Approximately 200 retail stores were not included in the transaction and were subsequently closed.[15]
Babbage’s Etc. (1996–1999)[edit]
Following his purchase of NeoStar's assets, Leonard Riggio dissolved the holding company and created a new holding company named Babbage's Etc.[16] He appointed Richard "Dick" Fontaine, previously Software Etc.'s chief executive during its expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as Babbage Etc.'s chief executive. Daniel DeMatteo, previously the president of both Software Etc. and NeoStar, became company president and COO.[16] Three years later, in 1999, Babbage's Etc. launched its GameStop brand with 30 stores located in strip malls. The company also launched gamestop.com, a website that allowed consumers to purchase video games online. GameStop.com was promoted in Babbage's and Software Etc. stores.[17]
Barnes & Noble (1999–2004)[edit]

Barnes & Noble purchased Babbage's Etc. in October 1999 for $215 million.[18] Because Babbage's Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes & Noble's chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes & Noble evaluated and signed-off on the deal.[18] A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes & Noble acquired Funco, an Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based video game retailer, for $160 million.[19] Babbage's Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco.[20] With its acquisition of Funco, Barnes & Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991.[21] Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company.[20]
Barnes & Noble took GameStop public with a February 2002 initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[22] GameStop was listed under the ticker symbol GME.[22] Barnes & Noble retained control over the newly public company with 67% of outstanding shares and 95% of voting shares. Barnes & Noble retained control over GameStop until October 2004, when it distributed its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble, making it an independent company.[22][23]
GameStop (2004–present)[edit]




A store in Hillsboro, Oregon


GameStop acquired EB Games (formerly Electronics Boutique) in 2005 for $1.44 billion. The acquisition expanded GameStop's operations into Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[24] Two years later, in 2007, GameStop acquired Rhino Video Games from Blockbuster for an undisclosed amount. Rhino Video Games operated 70 video game stores throughout the Southeastern United States.[25]
GameStop purchased Free Record Shop's Norwegian stores in April 2008. The company acquired 49 stores and converted them into video game shops.[26] Daniel DeMatteo replaced Richard Fontaine as GameStop CEO in August 2008. DeMatteo had served as company COO since 1996. Fontaine, who had been GameStop chairman and CEO since 1996, remained the company's chairman.[27] J. Paul Raines, formerly executive vice president of Home Depot, became company COO in September.[27] GameStop acquired Micromania, a French video game retailer, in October 2008 for $700 million. GameStop, which had previously owned no stores in France, now had 332 French video game stores.[28] It also acquired a majority stake in Jolt Online Gaming, an Irish browser-based game studio, in November 2009. Jolt closed in 2012.[29]
J. Paul Raines became GameStop CEO in June 2010.[30] He replaced Daniel DeMatteo who was named executive chairman of the company.[30] GameStop acquired Kongregate, a San Francisco, California-based website for browser-based games; terms of the deal were not disclosed.[31]
GameStop acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse in separate transactions during 2011.[32] Spawn Labs was a developer of technology that allowed users to play video games that were run remotely on machines in data centers rather than their personal computer or console. Impulse was a digital distribution and multiplayer gaming platform.[32] GameStop closed Spawn Labs in 2014.[33]
GameStop purchased BuyMyTronics, a Denver, Colorado-based online market place for consumer electronics, in 2012.[34] Later that year, it acquired a minority interest in Simply Mac, a Utah-based authorized Apple reseller.[35] GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% interest in Simply Mac in November 2013.[1] GameStop also acquired Spring Mobile, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based retailer of AT&T-branded wireless services, in November 2013.[36] They obtained 163 RadioShack locations as of February 26, 2015, as well.[37] All GameStop stores have been closed down in Puerto Rico at the end of March 2016, citing increased rates of government taxes.[38] On August 3, 2016, it acquired 507 AT&T store chains in plans to diversify into new businesses and less dependant on the video game market.[39]
Decline (2016–present)[edit]
The market for physical game media had been in a state of decline since online services such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam had taken footholds,[40][41] and GameStop, whose business was long rooted in new and pre-owned software, began to feel the effects of the changing market. In 2017, GameStop reported a 16.4% drop in sales for the 2016 holiday season, but expressed optimism in its non-physical gaming businesses.[42] Reasons cited for the decline in sales included industry weakness, promotional pricing pressure, and lower in-store traffic.
Shares of GameStop stock fell 16% throughout 2016.[43] On February 28, 2017, shares dropped an additional 8% following Microsoft's announcement of its Xbox Game Pass service. [44] Following these reports, GameStop announced it would close over 150 stores in 2017 and expand its nongaming business.[45] On the same day, however, GameStop said it planned to open 65 new Technology Brand stores and 35 Collectibles stores due to a 44% and 28% increase in sales, respectively.[46] GameStop expects a continued drop in operating income between 3% and 10% in 2017.[47]
Owned brands and concepts[edit]
Game Informer[edit]
Game Informer is a magazine owned by GameStop, Inc. and primarily sold through subscriptions which can be purchased at GameStop locations.[48] Purchasing a subscription to the magazine also gets the subscriber the PowerUp Rewards Pro card, a pro version of GameStop's customer appreciation card. This increases all store-credit trade values by 10%, discounts all used accessories and games by 10%, gives new PowerUp members a coupon for "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" on pre-owned games and accessories, enters them twice for the Epic Rewards Giveaway for each purchase, gives the cardholder opportunities to gain points with their purchases, and redeem them for rewards and gains them access to special content on the Game Informer website.
GameStop PC Downloads[edit]
GameStop PC Downloads, formerly called Impulse, is a digital distribution service run and operated by GameStop. Originally known as Impulse when owned by Stardock, it was sold to GameStop in 2011 and rebranded as GameStop PC Downloads, with the Impulse client renamed as the GameStop App. Under the ownership of GameStop the service has had a redesign, and sells games that use other platforms such as Steam while also selling games that use its own proprietary DRM solution Impulse:Reactor.
Trade-ins[edit]
GameStop sells games that are traded in for store credit. This practice has come under fire from game publishers and developers as they make no money from the transaction.[49]
GameStop TV[edit]
GameStop TV is the in-store television network run internally GameStop, with non-endemic sales in partnership with Playwire Media, Inc.[50] GameStop TV features programming designed to speak to the consumers shopping in GameStop stores. Each month brings content segments about upcoming video game releases, exclusive developer interviews, product demonstrations and more.
Pre-order bonuses[edit]
Game publishers have begun to obtain more pre-orders by including exclusive in-game or physical bonuses, available only if the player pre-ordered the game. Bonuses typically include extras such as exclusive characters, weapons and maps. For example, GameStop included an additional avatar costume for Call of Duty: Black Ops when it was released in November 2010, and a pictorial Art-Folio for Metroid: Other M. Soundtracks, artbooks, plushies, figurines, posters, and T-shirts have also been special bonuses.
MovieStop[edit]
GameStop founded MovieStop in 2004 as a standalone store that focused on new and used movies.[51] More than 40 locations were opened, which typically adjoined or were adjacent to GameStop locations.[52] GameStop spun off MovieStop to private owners in 2012.[53] In November 2014, Draw Another Circle LLC, a company controlled by merchandising executive Joel Weinshanker that also owns Hastings Entertainment, purchased MovieStop.[54]
GameStop Kids[edit]
In October 2012 at Grapevine Mills in Dallas, GameStop introduced a new store concept known as GameStop Kids. The brand focus on children's products, and carried only games rated "Everyone" by the ESRB, along with merchandise of popular franchises aimed towards the demographic. The locations opened in 80 malls as pop-up stores for the holiday shopping season.[55][56]
GameTrust Games[edit]
In January 2016, GameStop announced a partnership it had made with Insomniac Games with their 2016 title Song of the Deep. GameStop executive Mark Stanley said the concept was to help the chain have more direct communication with players, and would expect to expand out to other similar distribution deals with other developers if this one succeeds.[57] Subsequently, in April 2016, GameStop announced that it was formally creating the GameTrust Games publishing division within the company to serve as a publisher for mid-sized developers. In addition to Insomniac Games, GameTrust Games is working with Ready At Dawn, Tequila Works, and Frozenbyte to prepare more titles to be published by the end of 2016.[58]
Simply Mac[edit]
In October 2012, GameStop acquired a 49.9% minority equity ownership interest in the Salt Lake City-based Apple authorized reseller and repairer Simply Mac. Simply Mac was founded in Salt Lake City in 2006. GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% that it did not own in November 2013. GameStop tried to target areas for potential new Simply Mac locations in slight smaller markets that did not have an existing Apple Store within a reasonable driving distance.[59][60][61]
In January 2017, GameStop closed a large number of Simply Mac locations. The chain had as many as 70 locations at the time of the announcement.[62][63] After the closings, a few recently vacated Simply Mac locations were replaced by sister company ThinkGeek.[64]
Criticism[edit]
Opened copies of game titles[edit]
The company has a policy where some copies of new games upon release are "gutted".[65] This means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter, one copy is opened so the case can be put on display, with the game disc filed separately behind the counter. Consumers may reach for the opened copy and purchase at the counter, whereupon the consumer will receive a factory-sealed copy from behind the counter. If the opened copy is the last copy of the new game, it is sold at regular price.
GameStop's check-out policy allows employees "to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days", with the intent being to allow the employee to evaluate the game and learn about its content. This check out policy does not apply to only used merchandise, which has been a hotly contested practice among the community.[66][67]
GameStop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of Deus Ex: Human Revolution.[68][69][70] GameStop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of Deus Ex: Human Revolution on OnLive, a cloud gaming service. GameStop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its subsidiaries, Spawn Labs and Impulse, which it had acquired in April 2011.[68] Later, GameStop entirely removed the PC version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution from its stores. Square Enix, the publisher of Deus Ex, said that it "respects the right of GameStop to have final say over the contents of products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies".[71]
Used games market[edit]
GameStop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles.[72] By reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game, it is argued that GameStop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue. In effect, this means that companies such as GameStop can resell used copies of a game within days of the title's release and keep all of the profit, thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers. It has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games.[73]
Fingerprint identification[edit]
It was revealed in early August 2014 that GameStop was required by the Pennsylvania State Police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at Philadelphia GameStop locations. The policy had been in place since early July of that year and did not apply to the suburban areas of Philadelphia.[74] This caused some heavy criticism from video gamers living in the affected area. Pennsylvania State Police in Philadelphia asserted that the fingerprint identification would help track thieves. By August 4, 2014, the policy had been reversed in all Philadelphia-area GameStop stores.[75]
Circle of Life policy[edit]
In February 2017, it was revealed that GameStop enforced, on all of its retail employees, a program known as Circle of Life. The policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allot a certain percentage of their sales to pre-orders, rewards cards, used games, or have a customer trade in a game.[76] Upon revelation of the policy, many GameStop employees including current and former, brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers. Many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress.[77] Later into the month, GameStop reformed the program to solely focus on the store as a whole instead of the previous individual employee basis.[78]

(GME) Jozef Bystricky Value, Deep Value, long only, long-term horizonSummaryInvestors fear that GameStop Corp. will become the next Blockbuster and eventually bankrupt.There are important distinctions between Blockbuster and GameStop that may result in the company’s survival.The technology is not there, yet that would allow such a swift transformation of the industry.In the meantime, the company is shifting away from being a physical product seller to being diversified gaming specialty omni-channel retailer.And so, the company may be a good value play at these levels.Investors fear that GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) will become the next Blockbuster and so the pessimism results in very depressed valuation. The company currently trades at multiples of 7 price to forward earnings and 6 price to free cash flow. That is very cheap and therefore grabbed my attention to research the company. Truthfully, the whole brick and mortar industry is undergoing structural change of digitization. In addition, investor fears are amplified by the technological advancement of the cloud business. And so, there are many similarities that resemble the Blockbuster story but there are also crucial distinctions. Before making an investment decision one needs to evaluate these similarities and differences hence I provide my analysis. Industry challenges GameStop Corp. is doing business in one of the most challenging industries these days. The industry is facing a disruption from change in consumer behavior towards digital purchases. In addition, the industry is challenged by technological advance where physical products are disappearing from the market in the favor of the cloud. These are the exact challenges that Blockbuster was facing a couple of years ago and so the investors' pain from that investment is still fresh. Similarly, GameStop Corp. is challenged by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) the same way as Blockbuster was challenged years ago. Amazon provided an alternative to selling physical DVDs already in 2004 and so Blockbuster renting business was challenged by DVDs being cheaper and comfortable to buy online compared to renting. However, this was hardly the reason why the company went out of business. Had that been the case, the companies such as Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS), specializing on selling books, would already have ceased to exist. And even nowadays, Barnes & Noble is cash-flow positive and owns more than 600 physical stores. The company was able to adapt to changing behavior and technological advancement and stayed profitable even in this environment.
 

 Source: Barnes & Noble Inc 10K 2016 Therefore, judging from the survival in the book retailers, the specialized retailer focused on gaming may be able to survive as well. In addition, I would tend to think the overall market for books is rather a declining business compared to the booming gaming industry. Hence, the probability of surviving the Amazon challenge could be quite high. The direct competitor However, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) became a more significant threat to Blockbuster than Amazon. First, the company started offering DVD rentals business with much higher customer satisfaction and home delivery. Also, the subscription services and no late delivery fees quickly stole customers from Blockbuster. And so Blockbuster started losing money from 2005 and was never able to recover. It is important to say that Netflix started offering a streaming service only in 2008. 

 Source: Business Insider Therefore, Blockbuster was not a victim of technological disruption but a victim of the inability to compete in a competitive environment. Yes, Netflix's success story can be replicated in the gaming market as well but at the moment there is not a company that would offer such services. It would need to be a company that has a platform with most of the games available and could be played on the cloud. The cost for storing and owning such games are much higher than in the DVD business. In addition, there are more platforms that compete with each other. And finally, the platform would need to be customized and allow each user to save data. I don't think the technology is there yet that would offer all of those options. And so this is not a direct threat yet.
 Cloud However, there is another threat that the industry is facing. Investors see the future in the cloud. Perhaps 10 years from now, there will be no need to have a physical copy and everything would be downloadable from cloud. The management made a counterargument that one DVD can have around 4GB whereas one game can be 40GB and more. Therefore, the obstacle to store is 10 times higher and the download time is 10 times longer. Which is a bit uncomfortable for the customers. 

 Source: GameStop Corp. Investor's Day Presentation Nevertheless, the technology is advancing and perhaps in a couple of years from now, the games will be either available on the platform or quickly downloadable from the cloud. In the meantime, because of technological progress, the company may diversify enough that it will not depend on physical sales. Diversification The management expects to have 50% of operating income from non-physical products by 2019. 

 Source: GameStop Corp. Investor's Day Presentation This translates to $300m to $350m of operating earnings which is just enough to cover capital expenditures in the amount of $110m to $120m, taxes in the amount of $100m and partial dividend payments in the amount of $100m. In addition to that, there is still an upside from selling the physical products such as new consoles and equipment. Outlook There is a high anticipation of new consoles and gadgets coming in the market that may provide a further boost to the earnings. Management and analysts' outlook for next year earnings translates to approximately $350m to $400m in free cash for the company. Using 102m shares outstanding this will result in free cash at 3.5 to 4 per share.
 

 Source: Finance.yahoo.com 

 Source: GameStop Corp. 4Q 2016 Earnings Release And so the company trades at 5.5 - 6 times future free cash. In my point of view, this is very depressed valuation and so I am willing to bet on a possible recovery stemming from higher diversification of revenue streams and new consoles coming in the market. Therefore, the expected performance does not resemble the Blockbuster story. In addition, GameStop Corp. is highly profitable. Historical performance I know the historical performance is not an indication of the future performance. But, it gives us an indication of how well the management was managing the company in the past. And, in my point of view the results were outstanding. The company was able to operate every year with operating margin between 6% and 7% and it is still projecting this profitability with flat revenues going forward. 

 Source: GameStop Corp. 10Ks The free cash flow is enough to cover capital expenditures, dividend payments and reinvestment into the business which is a sign of a healthy business. 


 Source: GameStop Corp. 2016 10K Also, the balance sheet is sound with very low debt compared to EBITDA. Therefore, GameStop Corp. may actually be a sound investment at these levels. Takeaway My conclusion is that the company operates in a very challenging industry. But, every company now faces a disruption from advancement in the technology across the whole brick-and-mortar retailers as well as car manufacturers. In my point of view, the company has plenty of time to diversify from the challenges and it is on the right track of doing that. Therefore, my conclusion is that it will not end up with the same destiny as Blockbuster.

GameStop Corp. Projects a Profit Decline in 2017
The retailer met management's lowered targets over the holiday season as the video game market contracted sharply.











                Demitrios Kalogeropoulos
            

                (TMFSigma)



            
            Mar 24, 2017 at 1:14PM
            
            





GameStop (NYSE:GME) this week announced quarterly results for the key holiday shopping period that, as expected, included sharp declines in its core video game business. The specialty retailer managed a few important wins, including improved profitability and spiking revenue from divisions that exist outside of the slumping video game segment. Yet management also issued a conservative profit outlook for the year ahead.
More on that forecast in a moment. First, here's how the headline fourth-quarter results stacked up against the prior-year period:

Data source: GameStop's financial filing.
What happened this quarter?
Overall sales dipped 14% as a big decline in comparable-store sales was partially offset by rising demand in the technology brands segment that houses GameStop's consumer electronics business.

Image source: Getty Images.

Other highlights of the quarter include:

Comparable-store sales fell 16%, which was near the lower end of management's January guidance that called for declines of between 16% and 18%. GameStop suffered from weak demand for major game releases as well as significant pricing pressure as rivals offered huge discounts on gaming consoles through the holiday season crush.
The profitable pre-owned software business fared relatively well, falling 7%.
The tech brands segment rose 44% to $256 million. Collectibles, GameStop's other promising new business line, jumped 28% to $212 million. Overall, sales from non-physical gaming segments increased to 37% of sales from 25% a year ago.
Gross profit margin jumped to 33% of sales from 30%, and that growth ensured that the company generated the same $1 billion of gross profit that it produced on a larger revenue base last year.
Asset impairment charges tied to the closing of a few underperforming tech brands stores, plus higher overall expenses, pushed net income lower as net margin ticked down to 6.9% of sales from 7%.

What management had to say
"GameStop's transformation continued to take hold in 2016," CEO Paul Raines said in a press release, "as our non-gaming businesses drove gross margin expansion and significantly contributed to our profits."
On the other hand, "the video game category was weak, particularly in the back half of 2016, as the console cycle ages," Rains explained. "Looking at 2017, Technology Brands and Collectibles are expected to generate another year of strong growth, and new hardware innovation in the video game category looks promising."





Looking forward
Rains and his executive team plan to keep emphasizing the retailer's healthy business lines this year while cutting costs and trimming down its portfolio of stores. To that end, they see the tech brands segment growing by 20% to at least $120 million in 2017.
Overall revenue is projected to be flat to mark a solid improvement over this past year's 8% drop. Net income will likely end between $320 million and $354 million, which would be a second straight year of declines following 2015's record $400 million haul. That result would leave the 6% dividend yield well covered at less than 50% of earnings.
But whether the company reaches that $400 million profit mark again will depend on the severity of the pullback in physical game retailing, and on GameStop's ability to take advantage of complementary selling opportunities like the consumer products and collectibles segments that have protected profitability as its core industry shrinks. Either way, it promises to be a bumpy ride for shareholders. In announcing its plan to discontinue offering quarterly forecasts on comparable-store sales, GameStop argued that these results are distracting to investors since they "can be volatile given the current business environment."

Operations[edit]
GameStop is divided into two operating segments: Video Game Brands and Technology Brands.[1] The Technology Brands was created during the fourth quarter of 2013, and houses the companies Simply Mac, Spring Mobile, and Cricket Wireless business. As of April 2014, the Technology Brands segment included 218 retail outlets.[4] GameStop's Video Game Brands includes the company's other businesses such as video game and consumer electronics retail shops; Kongregate, a digital video game distribution site; and buymytronics.com, a consumer electronics marketplace. Pre-owned and value video games accounted for 47% of GameStop's gross revenue for the fiscal year ending February 2014.[1]
History[edit]

Babbage's (1984–1994)[edit]
GameStop traces its roots to Babbage's, a Dallas, Texas-based software retailer founded in 1984 by former Harvard Business School classmates James McCurry and Gary M. Kusin.[5] The company was named after Charles Babbage[6] and opened its first store in Dallas's North Park Center with the help of Ross Perot, an early investor in the company.[7] The company quickly began to focus on video game sales for the then-dominant Atari 2600.[5] Babbage's began selling Nintendo games in 1987.[8] The company went public in 1988.[6] By 1991, video games accounted for two-thirds of Babbage's sales.[8]
NeoStar Retail Group (1994–1996)[edit]
Babbage's merged with Software Etc., an Edina, Minnesota-based retailer that specialized in personal computing software, to create NeoStar Retail Group in 1994.[9] The merger was structured as a stock swap, where shareholders of Babbage's and Software Etc. received shares of NeoStar, a newly formed holding company. Babbage's and Software Etc. continued to operate as independent subsidiaries of NeoStar and retained their respective senior management teams.[9] Babbage's founder and chairman James McCurry became chairman of NeoStar, while Babbage's president Gary Kusin and Software Etc. president Daniel DeMatteo retained their respective titles. Software Etc. chairman Leonard Riggio became chairman of NeoStar's executive committee.[10]
Gary Kusin resigned as president of Babbage's in February 1995 to start a cosmetics company. Daniel DeMatto, formerly president of Software Etc., assumed Kusin's duties and was promoted to president and chief operating officer of NeoStar. NeoStar chairman James McCurry was also appointed to the newly created position of NeoStar CEO.[11] The company relocated from its headquarters in Dallas to Grapevine later that year.[12]
NeoStar merged its Babbage's and Software Etc. units into a single organization in May 1996 amid declining sales. Company president Daniel DeMatteo also resigned, and NeoStar chairman and CEO James McCurry assumed the title of president.[13] In September of that year, after NeoStar was unable to secure the credit necessary to purchase inventory necessary for the holiday season, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[14] With the filing, NeoStar board member Thomas G. Plaskett became chairman and James McCurry remained company chief executive and president.[15]
The leadership changes were not enough and in November 1996 the assets of NeoStar were purchased for $58.5 million by Leonard Riggio, a founder of Software Etc. and chairman and principal stockholder of Barnes & Noble. Electronics Boutique had also bid to purchase NeoStar, but the judge presiding over NeoStar's bankruptcy accepted Riggio's bid because it kept open 108 stores more than Electronics Boutique's bid would have. Approximately 200 retail stores were not included in the transaction and were subsequently closed.[15]
Babbage’s Etc. (1996–1999)[edit]
Following his purchase of NeoStar's assets, Leonard Riggio dissolved the holding company and created a new holding company named Babbage's Etc.[16] He appointed Richard "Dick" Fontaine, previously Software Etc.'s chief executive during its expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as Babbage Etc.'s chief executive. Daniel DeMatteo, previously the president of both Software Etc. and NeoStar, became company president and COO.[16] Three years later, in 1999, Babbage's Etc. launched its GameStop brand with 30 stores located in strip malls. The company also launched gamestop.com, a website that allowed consumers to purchase video games online. GameStop.com was promoted in Babbage's and Software Etc. stores.[17]
Barnes & Noble (1999–2004)[edit]

Barnes & Noble purchased Babbage's Etc. in October 1999 for $215 million.[18] Because Babbage's Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes & Noble's chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes & Noble evaluated and signed-off on the deal.[18] A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes & Noble acquired Funco, an Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based video game retailer, for $160 million.[19] Babbage's Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco.[20] With its acquisition of Funco, Barnes & Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991.[21] Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company.[20]
Barnes & Noble took GameStop public with a February 2002 initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[22] GameStop was listed under the ticker symbol GME.[22] Barnes & Noble retained control over the newly public company with 67% of outstanding shares and 95% of voting shares. Barnes & Noble retained control over GameStop until October 2004, when it distributed its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble, making it an independent company.[22][23]
GameStop (2004–present)[edit]




A store in Hillsboro, Oregon


GameStop acquired EB Games (formerly Electronics Boutique) in 2005 for $1.44 billion. The acquisition expanded GameStop's operations into Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[24] Two years later, in 2007, GameStop acquired Rhino Video Games from Blockbuster for an undisclosed amount. Rhino Video Games operated 70 video game stores throughout the Southeastern United States.[25]
GameStop purchased Free Record Shop's Norwegian stores in April 2008. The company acquired 49 stores and converted them into video game shops.[26] Daniel DeMatteo replaced Richard Fontaine as GameStop CEO in August 2008. DeMatteo had served as company COO since 1996. Fontaine, who had been GameStop chairman and CEO since 1996, remained the company's chairman.[27] J. Paul Raines, formerly executive vice president of Home Depot, became company COO in September.[27] GameStop acquired Micromania, a French video game retailer, in October 2008 for $700 million. GameStop, which had previously owned no stores in France, now had 332 French video game stores.[28] It also acquired a majority stake in Jolt Online Gaming, an Irish browser-based game studio, in November 2009. Jolt closed in 2012.[29]
J. Paul Raines became GameStop CEO in June 2010.[30] He replaced Daniel DeMatteo who was named executive chairman of the company.[30] GameStop acquired Kongregate, a San Francisco, California-based website for browser-based games; terms of the deal were not disclosed.[31]
GameStop acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse in separate transactions during 2011.[32] Spawn Labs was a developer of technology that allowed users to play video games that were run remotely on machines in data centers rather than their personal computer or console. Impulse was a digital distribution and multiplayer gaming platform.[32] GameStop closed Spawn Labs in 2014.[33]
GameStop purchased BuyMyTronics, a Denver, Colorado-based online market place for consumer electronics, in 2012.[34] Later that year, it acquired a minority interest in Simply Mac, a Utah-based authorized Apple reseller.[35] GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% interest in Simply Mac in November 2013.[1] GameStop also acquired Spring Mobile, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based retailer of AT&T-branded wireless services, in November 2013.[36] They obtained 163 RadioShack locations as of February 26, 2015, as well.[37] All GameStop stores have been closed down in Puerto Rico at the end of March 2016, citing increased rates of government taxes.[38] On August 3, 2016, it acquired 507 AT&T store chains in plans to diversify into new businesses and less dependant on the video game market.[39]
Decline (2016–present)[edit]
The market for physical game media had been in a state of decline since online services such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam had taken footholds,[40][41] and GameStop, whose business was long rooted in new and pre-owned software, began to feel the effects of the changing market. In 2017, GameStop reported a 16.4% drop in sales for the 2016 holiday season, but expressed optimism in its non-physical gaming businesses.[42] Reasons cited for the decline in sales included industry weakness, promotional pricing pressure, and lower in-store traffic.
Shares of GameStop stock fell 16% throughout 2016.[43] On February 28, 2017, shares dropped an additional 8% following Microsoft's announcement of its Xbox Game Pass service. [44] Following these reports, GameStop announced it would close over 150 stores in 2017 and expand its nongaming business.[45] On the same day, however, GameStop said it planned to open 65 new Technology Brand stores and 35 Collectibles stores due to a 44% and 28% increase in sales, respectively.[46] GameStop expects a continued drop in operating income between 3% and 10% in 2017.[47]
Owned brands and concepts[edit]
Game Informer[edit]
Game Informer is a magazine owned by GameStop, Inc. and primarily sold through subscriptions which can be purchased at GameStop locations.[48] Purchasing a subscription to the magazine also gets the subscriber the PowerUp Rewards Pro card, a pro version of GameStop's customer appreciation card. This increases all store-credit trade values by 10%, discounts all used accessories and games by 10%, gives new PowerUp members a coupon for "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" on pre-owned games and accessories, enters them twice for the Epic Rewards Giveaway for each purchase, gives the cardholder opportunities to gain points with their purchases, and redeem them for rewards and gains them access to special content on the Game Informer website.
GameStop PC Downloads[edit]
GameStop PC Downloads, formerly called Impulse, is a digital distribution service run and operated by GameStop. Originally known as Impulse when owned by Stardock, it was sold to GameStop in 2011 and rebranded as GameStop PC Downloads, with the Impulse client renamed as the GameStop App. Under the ownership of GameStop the service has had a redesign, and sells games that use other platforms such as Steam while also selling games that use its own proprietary DRM solution Impulse:Reactor.
Trade-ins[edit]
GameStop sells games that are traded in for store credit. This practice has come under fire from game publishers and developers as they make no money from the transaction.[49]
GameStop TV[edit]
GameStop TV is the in-store television network run internally GameStop, with non-endemic sales in partnership with Playwire Media, Inc.[50] GameStop TV features programming designed to speak to the consumers shopping in GameStop stores. Each month brings content segments about upcoming video game releases, exclusive developer interviews, product demonstrations and more.
Pre-order bonuses[edit]
Game publishers have begun to obtain more pre-orders by including exclusive in-game or physical bonuses, available only if the player pre-ordered the game. Bonuses typically include extras such as exclusive characters, weapons and maps. For example, GameStop included an additional avatar costume for Call of Duty: Black Ops when it was released in November 2010, and a pictorial Art-Folio for Metroid: Other M.

MovieStop[edit]
GameStop founded MovieStop in 2004 as a standalone store that focused on new and used movies.[51] More than 40 locations were opened, which typically adjoined or were adjacent to GameStop locations.[52] GameStop spun off MovieStop to private owners in 2012.[53] In November 2014, Draw Another Circle LLC, a company controlled by merchandising executive Joel Weinshanker that also owns Hastings Entertainment, purchased MovieStop.[54]
GameStop Kids[edit]
In October 2012 at Grapevine Mills in Dallas, GameStop introduced a new store concept known as GameStop Kids. The brand focus on children's products, and carried only games rated "Everyone" by the ESRB, along with merchandise of popular franchises aimed towards the demographic. The locations opened in 80 malls as pop-up stores for the holiday shopping season.[55][56]
GameTrust Games[edit]
In January 2016, GameStop announced a partnership it had made with Insomniac Games with their 2016 title Song of the Deep. GameStop executive Mark Stanley said the concept was to help the chain have more direct communication with players, and would expect to expand out to other similar distribution deals with other developers if this one succeeds.[57] Subsequently, in April 2016, GameStop announced that it was formally creating the GameTrust Games publishing division within the company to serve as a publisher for mid-sized developers. In addition to Insomniac Games, GameTrust Games is working with Ready At Dawn, Tequila Works, and Frozenbyte to prepare more titles to be published by the end of 2016.[58]
Simply Mac[edit]
In October 2012, GameStop acquired a 49.9% minority equity ownership interest in the Salt Lake City-based Apple authorized reseller and repairer Simply Mac. Simply Mac was founded in Salt Lake City in 2006. GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% that it did not own in November 2013. GameStop tried to target areas for potential new Simply Mac locations in slight smaller markets that did not have an existing Apple Store within a reasonable driving distance.[59][60][61]
In January 2017, GameStop closed a large number of Simply Mac locations. The chain had as many as 70 locations at the time of the announcement.[62][63] After the closings, a few recently vacated Simply Mac locations were replaced by sister company ThinkGeek.[64]
Criticism[edit]
Opened copies of game titles[edit]
The company has a policy where some copies of new games upon release are "gutted".[65] This means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter, one copy is opened so the case can be put on display, with the game disc filed separately behind the counter. Consumers may reach for the opened copy and purchase at the counter, whereupon the consumer will receive a factory-sealed copy from behind the counter. If the opened copy is the last copy of the new game, it is sold at regular price.
GameStop's check-out policy allows employees "to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days", with the intent being to allow the employee to evaluate the game and learn about its content. This check out policy does not apply to only used merchandise, which has been a hotly contested practice among the community.[66][67]
GameStop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of Deus Ex: Human Revolution.[68][69][70] GameStop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of Deus Ex: Human Revolution on OnLive, a cloud gaming service. GameStop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its subsidiaries, Spawn Labs and Impulse, which it had acquired in April 2011.[68] Later, GameStop entirely removed the PC version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution from its stores. Square Enix, the publisher of Deus Ex, said that it "respects the right of GameStop to have final say over the contents of products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies".[71]
Used games market[edit]
GameStop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles.[72] By reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game, it is argued that GameStop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue. In effect, this means that companies such as GameStop can resell used copies of a game within days of the title's release and keep all of the profit, thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers. It has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games.[73]
Fingerprint identification[edit]
It was revealed in early August 2014 that GameStop was required by the Pennsylvania State Police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at Philadelphia GameStop locations. The policy had been in place since early July of that year and did not apply to the suburban areas of Philadelphia.[74] This caused some heavy criticism from video gamers living in the affected area. Pennsylvania State Police in Philadelphia asserted that the fingerprint identification would help track thieves. By August 4, 2014, the policy had been reversed in all Philadelphia-area GameStop stores.[75]
Circle of Life policy[edit]
In February 2017, it was revealed that GameStop enforced, on all of its retail employees, a program known as Circle of Life. The policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allot a certain percentage of their sales to pre-orders, rewards cards, used games, or have a customer trade in a game.[76] Upon revelation of the policy, many GameStop employees including current and former, brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers. Many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress.[77] Later into the month, GameStop reformed the program to solely focus on the store as a whole instead of the previous individual employee basis.[78]

Operations[edit]
GameStop is divided into two operating segments: Video Game Brands and Technology Brands.[1] The Technology Brands was created during the fourth quarter of 2013, and houses the companies Simply Mac, Spring Mobile, and Cricket Wireless business. As of April 2014, the Technology Brands segment included 218 retail outlets.[4] GameStop's Video Game Brands includes the company's other businesses such as video game and consumer electronics retail shops; Kongregate, a digital video game distribution site; and buymytronics.com, a consumer electronics marketplace. Pre-owned and value video games accounted for 47% of GameStop's gross revenue for the fiscal year ending February 2014.[1]
History[edit]

Babbage's (1984–1994)[edit]
GameStop traces its roots to Babbage's, a Dallas, Texas-based software retailer founded in 1984 by former Harvard Business School classmates James McCurry and Gary M. Kusin.[5] The company was named after Charles Babbage[6] and opened its first store in Dallas's North Park Center with the help of Ross Perot, an early investor in the company.[7] The company quickly began to focus on video game sales for the then-dominant Atari 2600.[5] Babbage's began selling Nintendo games in 1987.[8] The company went public in 1988.[6] By 1991, video games accounted for two-thirds of Babbage's sales.[8]
NeoStar Retail Group (1994–1996)[edit]
Babbage's merged with Software Etc., an Edina, Minnesota-based retailer that specialized in personal computing software, to create NeoStar Retail Group in 1994.[9] The merger was structured as a stock swap, where shareholders of Babbage's and Software Etc. received shares of NeoStar, a newly formed holding company. Babbage's and Software Etc. continued to operate as independent subsidiaries of NeoStar and retained their respective senior management teams.[9] Babbage's founder and chairman James McCurry became chairman of NeoStar, while Babbage's president Gary Kusin and Software Etc. president Daniel DeMatteo retained their respective titles. Software Etc. chairman Leonard Riggio became chairman of NeoStar's executive committee.[10]
Gary Kusin resigned as president of Babbage's in February 1995 to start a cosmetics company. Daniel DeMatto, formerly president of Software Etc., assumed Kusin's duties and was promoted to president and chief operating officer of NeoStar. NeoStar chairman James McCurry was also appointed to the newly created position of NeoStar CEO.[11] The company relocated from its headquarters in Dallas to Grapevine later that year.[12]
NeoStar merged its Babbage's and Software Etc. units into a single organization in May 1996 amid declining sales. Company president Daniel DeMatteo also resigned, and NeoStar chairman and CEO James McCurry assumed the title of president.[13] In September of that year, after NeoStar was unable to secure the credit necessary to purchase inventory necessary for the holiday season, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[14] With the filing, NeoStar board member Thomas G. Plaskett became chairman and James McCurry remained company chief executive and president.[15]
The leadership changes were not enough and in November 1996 the assets of NeoStar were purchased for $58.5 million by Leonard Riggio, a founder of Software Etc. and chairman and principal stockholder of Barnes & Noble. Electronics Boutique had also bid to purchase NeoStar, but the judge presiding over NeoStar's bankruptcy accepted Riggio's bid because it kept open 108 stores more than Electronics Boutique's bid would have. Approximately 200 retail stores were not included in the transaction and were subsequently closed.[15]
Babbage’s Etc. (1996–1999)[edit]
Following his purchase of NeoStar's assets, Leonard Riggio dissolved the holding company and created a new holding company named Babbage's Etc.[16] He appointed Richard "Dick" Fontaine, previously Software Etc.'s chief executive during its expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as Babbage Etc.'s chief executive. Daniel DeMatteo, previously the president of both Software Etc. and NeoStar, became company president and COO.[16] Three years later, in 1999, Babbage's Etc. launched its GameStop brand with 30 stores located in strip malls. The company also launched gamestop.com, a website that allowed consumers to purchase video games online. GameStop.com was promoted in Babbage's and Software Etc. stores.[17]
Barnes & Noble (1999–2004)[edit]

Barnes & Noble purchased Babbage's Etc. in October 1999 for $215 million.[18] Because Babbage's Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes & Noble's chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes & Noble evaluated and signed-off on the deal.[18] A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes & Noble acquired Funco, an Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based video game retailer, for $160 million.[19] Babbage's Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco.[20] With its acquisition of Funco, Barnes & Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991.[21] Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company.[20]
Barnes & Noble took GameStop public with a February 2002 initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[22] GameStop was listed under the ticker symbol GME.[22] Barnes & Noble retained control over the newly public company with 67% of outstanding shares and 95% of voting shares. Barnes & Noble retained control over GameStop until October 2004, when it distributed its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble, making it an independent company.[22][23]
GameStop (2004–present)[edit]




A store in Hillsboro, Oregon


GameStop acquired EB Games (formerly Electronics Boutique) in 2005 for $1.44 billion. The acquisition expanded GameStop's operations into Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[24] Two years later, in 2007, GameStop acquired Rhino Video Games from Blockbuster for an undisclosed amount. Rhino Video Games operated 70 video game stores throughout the Southeastern United States.[25]
GameStop purchased Free Record Shop's Norwegian stores in April 2008. The company acquired 49 stores and converted them into video game shops.[26] Daniel DeMatteo replaced Richard Fontaine as GameStop CEO in August 2008. DeMatteo had served as company COO since 1996. Fontaine, who had been GameStop chairman and CEO since 1996, remained the company's chairman.[27] J. Paul Raines, formerly executive vice president of Home Depot, became company COO in September.[27] GameStop acquired Micromania, a French video game retailer, in October 2008 for $700 million. GameStop, which had previously owned no stores in France, now had 332 French video game stores.[28] It also acquired a majority stake in Jolt Online Gaming, an Irish browser-based game studio, in November 2009. Jolt closed in 2012.[29]
J. Paul Raines became GameStop CEO in June 2010.[30] He replaced Daniel DeMatteo who was named executive chairman of the company.[30] GameStop acquired Kongregate, a San Francisco, California-based website for browser-based games; terms of the deal were not disclosed.[31]
GameStop acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse in separate transactions during 2011.[32] Spawn Labs was a developer of technology that allowed users to play video games that were run remotely on machines in data centers rather than their personal computer or console. Impulse was a digital distribution and multiplayer gaming platform.[32] GameStop closed Spawn Labs in 2014.[33]
GameStop purchased BuyMyTronics, a Denver, Colorado-based online market place for consumer electronics, in 2012.[34] Later that year, it acquired a minority interest in Simply Mac, a Utah-based authorized Apple reseller.[35] GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% interest in Simply Mac in November 2013.[1] GameStop also acquired Spring Mobile, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based retailer of AT&T-branded wireless services, in November 2013.[36] They obtained 163 RadioShack locations as of February 26, 2015, as well.[37] All GameStop stores have been closed down in Puerto Rico at the end of March 2016, citing increased rates of government taxes.[38] On August 3, 2016, it acquired 507 AT&T store chains in plans to diversify into new businesses and less dependant on the video game market.[39]
Decline (2016–present)[edit]
The market for physical game media had been in a state of decline since online services such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam had taken footholds,[40][41] and GameStop, whose business was long rooted in new and pre-owned software, began to feel the effects of the changing market. In 2017, GameStop reported a 16.4% drop in sales for the 2016 holiday season, but expressed optimism in its non-physical gaming businesses.[42] Reasons cited for the decline in sales included industry weakness, promotional pricing pressure, and lower in-store traffic.
Shares of GameStop stock fell 16% throughout 2016.[43] On February 28, 2017, shares dropped an additional 8% following Microsoft's announcement of its Xbox Game Pass service. [44] Following these reports, GameStop announced it would close over 150 stores in 2017 and expand its nongaming business.[45] On the same day, however, GameStop said it planned to open 65 new Technology Brand stores and 35 Collectibles stores due to a 44% and 28% increase in sales, respectively.[46] GameStop expects a continued drop in operating income between 3% and 10% in 2017.[47]
Owned brands and concepts[edit]
Game Informer[edit]
Game Informer is a magazine owned by GameStop, Inc. and primarily sold through subscriptions which can be purchased at GameStop locations.[48] Purchasing a subscription to the magazine also gets the subscriber the PowerUp Rewards Pro card, a pro version of GameStop's customer appreciation card. This increases all store-credit trade values by 10%, discounts all used accessories and games by 10%, gives new PowerUp members a coupon for "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" on pre-owned games and accessories, enters them twice for the Epic Rewards Giveaway for each purchase, gives the cardholder opportunities to gain points with their purchases, and redeem them for rewards and gains them access to special content on the Game Informer website.
GameStop PC Downloads[edit]
GameStop PC Downloads, formerly called Impulse, is a digital distribution service run and operated by GameStop. Originally known as Impulse when owned by Stardock, it was sold to GameStop in 2011 and rebranded as GameStop PC Downloads, with the Impulse client renamed as the GameStop App. Under the ownership of GameStop the service has had a redesign, and sells games that use other platforms such as Steam while also selling games that use its own proprietary DRM solution Impulse:Reactor.
Trade-ins[edit]
GameStop sells games that are traded in for store credit. This practice has come under fire from game publishers and developers as they make no money from the transaction.[49]
GameStop TV[edit]
GameStop TV is the in-store television network run internally GameStop, with non-endemic sales in partnership with Playwire Media, Inc.[50] GameStop TV features programming designed to speak to the consumers shopping in GameStop stores. Each month brings content segments about upcoming video game releases, exclusive developer interviews, product demonstrations and more.
Pre-order bonuses[edit]
Game publishers have begun to obtain more pre-orders by including exclusive in-game or physical bonuses, available only if the player pre-ordered the game. Bonuses typically include extras such as exclusive characters, weapons and maps. For example, GameStop included an additional avatar costume for Call of Duty: Black Ops when it was released in November 2010, and a pictorial Art-Folio for Metroid: Other M. Soundtracks, artbooks, plushies, figurines, posters, and T-shirts have also been special bonuses.
MovieStop[edit]
GameStop founded MovieStop in 2004 as a standalone store that focused on new and used movies.[51] More than 40 locations were opened, which typically adjoined or were adjacent to GameStop locations.[52] GameStop spun off MovieStop to private owners in 2012.[53] In November 2014, Draw Another Circle LLC, a company controlled by merchandising executive Joel Weinshanker that also owns Hastings Entertainment, purchased MovieStop.[54]
GameStop Kids[edit]
In October 2012 at Grapevine Mills in Dallas, GameStop introduced a new store concept known as GameStop Kids. The brand focus on children's products, and carried only games rated "Everyone" by the ESRB, along with merchandise of popular franchises aimed towards the demographic. The locations opened in 80 malls as pop-up stores for the holiday shopping season.[55][56]
GameTrust Games[edit]
In January 2016, GameStop announced a partnership it had made with Insomniac Games with their 2016 title Song of the Deep. GameStop executive Mark Stanley said the concept was to help the chain have more direct communication with players, and would expect to expand out to other similar distribution deals with other developers if this one succeeds.[57] Subsequently, in April 2016, GameStop announced that it was formally creating the GameTrust Games publishing division within the company to serve as a publisher for mid-sized developers. In addition to Insomniac Games, GameTrust Games is working with Ready At Dawn, Tequila Works, and Frozenbyte to prepare more titles to be published by the end of 2016.[58]
Simply Mac[edit]
In October 2012, GameStop acquired a 49.9% minority equity ownership interest in the Salt Lake City-based Apple authorized reseller and repairer Simply Mac. Simply Mac was founded in Salt Lake City in 2006. GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% that it did not own in November 2013. GameStop tried to target areas for potential new Simply Mac locations in slight smaller markets that did not have an existing Apple Store within a reasonable driving distance.[59][60][61]
In January 2017, GameStop closed a large number of Simply Mac locations. The chain had as many as 70 locations at the time of the announcement.[62][63] After the closings, a few recently vacated Simply Mac locations were replaced by sister company ThinkGeek.[64]
Criticism[edit]
Opened copies of game titles[edit]
The company has a policy where some copies of new games upon release are "gutted".[65] This means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter, one copy is opened so the case can be put on display, with the game disc filed separately behind the counter. Consumers may reach for the opened copy and purchase at the counter, whereupon the consumer will receive a factory-sealed copy from behind the counter. If the opened copy is the last copy of the new game, it is sold at regular price.
GameStop's check-out policy allows employees "to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days", with the intent being to allow the employee to evaluate the game and learn about its content. This check out policy does not apply to only used merchandise, which has been a hotly contested practice among the community.[66][67]
GameStop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of Deus Ex: Human Revolution.[68][69][70] GameStop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of Deus Ex: Human Revolution on OnLive, a cloud gaming service. GameStop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its subsidiaries, Spawn Labs and Impulse, which it had acquired in April 2011.[68] Later, GameStop entirely removed the PC version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution from its stores. Square Enix, the publisher of Deus Ex, said that it "respects the right of GameStop to have final say over the contents of products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies".[71]
Used games market[edit]
GameStop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles.[72] By reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game, it is argued that GameStop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue. In effect, this means that companies such as GameStop can resell used copies of a game within days of the title's release and keep all of the profit, thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers. It has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games.[73]
Fingerprint identification[edit]
It was revealed in early August 2014 that GameStop was required by the Pennsylvania State Police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at Philadelphia GameStop locations. The policy had been in place since early July of that year and did not apply to the suburban areas of Philadelphia.[74] This caused some heavy criticism from video gamers living in the affected area. Pennsylvania State Police in Philadelphia asserted that the fingerprint identification would help track thieves. By August 4, 2014, the policy had been reversed in all Philadelphia-area GameStop stores.[75]
Circle of Life policy[edit]
In February 2017, it was revealed that GameStop enforced, on all of its retail employees, a program known as Circle of Life. The policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allot a certain percentage of their sales to pre-orders, rewards cards, used games, or have a customer trade in a game.[76] Upon revelation of the policy, many GameStop employees including current and former, brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers. Many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress.[77] Later into the month, GameStop reformed the program to solely focus on the store as a whole instead of the previous individual employee basis.[78]

Operations[edit]
GameStop is divided into two operating segments: Video Game Brands and Technology Brands.[1] The Technology Brands was created during the fourth quarter of 2013, and houses the companies Simply Mac, Spring Mobile, and Cricket Wireless business. As of April 2014, the Technology Brands segment included 218 retail outlets.[4] GameStop's Video Game Brands includes the company's other businesses such as video game and consumer electronics retail shops; Kongregate, a digital video game distribution site; and buymytronics.com, a consumer electronics marketplace. Pre-owned and value video games accounted for 47% of GameStop's gross revenue for the fiscal year ending February 2014.[1]
History[edit]

Babbage's (1984–1994)[edit]
GameStop traces its roots to Babbage's, a Dallas, Texas-based software retailer founded in 1984 by former Harvard Business School classmates James McCurry and Gary M. Kusin.[5] The company was named after Charles Babbage[6] and opened its first store in Dallas's North Park Center with the help of Ross Perot, an early investor in the company.[7] The company quickly began to focus on video game sales for the then-dominant Atari 2600.[5] Babbage's began selling Nintendo games in 1987.[8] The company went public in 1988.[6] By 1991, video games accounted for two-thirds of Babbage's sales.[8]
NeoStar Retail Group (1994–1996)[edit]
Babbage's merged with Software Etc., an Edina, Minnesota-based retailer that specialized in personal computing software, to create NeoStar Retail Group in 1994.[9] The merger was structured as a stock swap, where shareholders of Babbage's and Software Etc. received shares of NeoStar, a newly formed holding company. Babbage's and Software Etc. continued to operate as independent subsidiaries of NeoStar and retained their respective senior management teams.[9] Babbage's founder and chairman James McCurry became chairman of NeoStar, while Babbage's president Gary Kusin and Software Etc. president Daniel DeMatteo retained their respective titles. Software Etc. chairman Leonard Riggio became chairman of NeoStar's executive committee.[10]
Gary Kusin resigned as president of Babbage's in February 1995 to start a cosmetics company. Daniel DeMatto, formerly president of Software Etc., assumed Kusin's duties and was promoted to president and chief operating officer of NeoStar. NeoStar chairman James McCurry was also appointed to the newly created position of NeoStar CEO.[11] The company relocated from its headquarters in Dallas to Grapevine later that year.[12]
NeoStar merged its Babbage's and Software Etc. units into a single organization in May 1996 amid declining sales. Company president Daniel DeMatteo also resigned, and NeoStar chairman and CEO James McCurry assumed the title of president.[13] In September of that year, after NeoStar was unable to secure the credit necessary to purchase inventory necessary for the holiday season, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[14] With the filing, NeoStar board member Thomas G. Plaskett became chairman and James McCurry remained company chief executive and president.[15]
The leadership changes were not enough and in November 1996 the assets of NeoStar were purchased for $58.5 million by Leonard Riggio, a founder of Software Etc. and chairman and principal stockholder of Barnes & Noble. Electronics Boutique had also bid to purchase NeoStar, but the judge presiding over NeoStar's bankruptcy accepted Riggio's bid because it kept open 108 stores more than Electronics Boutique's bid would have. Approximately 200 retail stores were not included in the transaction and were subsequently closed.[15]
Babbage’s Etc. (1996–1999)[edit]
Following his purchase of NeoStar's assets, Leonard Riggio dissolved the holding company and created a new holding company named Babbage's Etc.[16] He appointed Richard "Dick" Fontaine, previously Software Etc.'s chief executive during its expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as Babbage Etc.'s chief executive. Daniel DeMatteo, previously the president of both Software Etc. and NeoStar, became company president and COO.[16] Three years later, in 1999, Babbage's Etc. launched its GameStop brand with 30 stores located in strip malls. The company also launched gamestop.com, a website that allowed consumers to purchase video games online. GameStop.com was promoted in Babbage's and Software Etc. stores.[17]
Barnes & Noble (1999–2004)[edit]

Barnes & Noble purchased Babbage's Etc. in October 1999 for $215 million.[18] Because Babbage's Etc. was principally owned by Leonard Riggio, who was also Barnes & Noble's chairman and principal shareholder, a special committee of independent directors of Barnes & Noble evaluated and signed-off on the deal.[18] A few months later, in May 2000, Barnes & Noble acquired Funco, an Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based video game retailer, for $160 million.[19] Babbage's Etc., which had been previously operating as a direct subsidiary of Barnes & Noble, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Funco.[20] With its acquisition of Funco, Barnes & Noble also acquired Game Informer, a video game magazine that was first published in 1991.[21] Funco was renamed GameStop, Inc. in December 2000 in anticipation of holding an initial public offering for the company.[20]
Barnes & Noble took GameStop public with a February 2002 initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[22] GameStop was listed under the ticker symbol GME.[22] Barnes & Noble retained control over the newly public company with 67% of outstanding shares and 95% of voting shares. Barnes & Noble retained control over GameStop until October 2004, when it distributed its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble, making it an independent company.[22][23]
GameStop (2004–present)[edit]




A store in Hillsboro, Oregon


GameStop acquired EB Games (formerly Electronics Boutique) in 2005 for $1.44 billion. The acquisition expanded GameStop's operations into Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[24] Two years later, in 2007, GameStop acquired Rhino Video Games from Blockbuster for an undisclosed amount. Rhino Video Games operated 70 video game stores throughout the Southeastern United States.[25]
GameStop purchased Free Record Shop's Norwegian stores in April 2008. The company acquired 49 stores and converted them into video game shops.[26] Daniel DeMatteo replaced Richard Fontaine as GameStop CEO in August 2008. DeMatteo had served as company COO since 1996. Fontaine, who had been GameStop chairman and CEO since 1996, remained the company's chairman.[27] J. Paul Raines, formerly executive vice president of Home Depot, became company COO in September.[27] GameStop acquired Micromania, a French video game retailer, in October 2008 for $700 million. GameStop, which had previously owned no stores in France, now had 332 French video game stores.[28] It also acquired a majority stake in Jolt Online Gaming, an Irish browser-based game studio, in November 2009. Jolt closed in 2012.[29]
J. Paul Raines became GameStop CEO in June 2010.[30] He replaced Daniel DeMatteo who was named executive chairman of the company.[30] GameStop acquired Kongregate, a San Francisco, California-based website for browser-based games; terms of the deal were not disclosed.[31]
GameStop acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse in separate transactions during 2011.[32] Spawn Labs was a developer of technology that allowed users to play video games that were run remotely on machines in data centers rather than their personal computer or console. Impulse was a digital distribution and multiplayer gaming platform.[32] GameStop closed Spawn Labs in 2014.[33]
GameStop purchased BuyMyTronics, a Denver, Colorado-based online market place for consumer electronics, in 2012.[34] Later that year, it acquired a minority interest in Simply Mac, a Utah-based authorized Apple reseller.[35] GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% interest in Simply Mac in November 2013.[1] GameStop also acquired Spring Mobile, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based retailer of AT&T-branded wireless services, in November 2013.[36] They obtained 163 RadioShack locations as of February 26, 2015, as well.[37] All GameStop stores have been closed down in Puerto Rico at the end of March 2016, citing increased rates of government taxes.[38] On August 3, 2016, it acquired 507 AT&T store chains in plans to diversify into new businesses and less dependant on the video game market.[39]
Decline (2016–present)[edit]
The market for physical game media had been in a state of decline since online services such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam had taken footholds,[40][41] and GameStop, whose business was long rooted in new and pre-owned software, began to feel the effects of the changing market. In 2017, GameStop reported a 16.4% drop in sales for the 2016 holiday season, but expressed optimism in its non-physical gaming businesses.[42] Reasons cited for the decline in sales included industry weakness, promotional pricing pressure, and lower in-store traffic.
Shares of GameStop stock fell 16% throughout 2016.[43] On February 28, 2017, shares dropped an additional 8% following Microsoft's announcement of its Xbox Game Pass service. [44] Following these reports, GameStop announced it would close over 150 stores in 2017 and expand its nongaming business.[45] On the same day, however, GameStop said it planned to open 65 new Technology Brand stores and 35 Collectibles stores due to a 44% and 28% increase in sales, respectively.[46] GameStop expects a continued drop in operating income between 3% and 10% in 2017.[47]
Owned brands and concepts[edit]
Game Informer[edit]
Game Informer is a magazine owned by GameStop, Inc. and primarily sold through subscriptions which can be purchased at GameStop locations.[48] Purchasing a subscription to the magazine also gets the subscriber the PowerUp Rewards Pro card, a pro version of GameStop's customer appreciation card. This increases all store-credit trade values by 10%, discounts all used accessories and games by 10%, gives new PowerUp members a coupon for "Buy 2 Get 1 Free" on pre-owned games and accessories, enters them twice for the Epic Rewards Giveaway for each purchase, gives the cardholder opportunities to gain points with their purchases, and redeem them for rewards and gains them access to special content on the Game Informer website.
GameStop PC Downloads[edit]
GameStop PC Downloads, formerly called Impulse, is a digital distribution service run and operated by GameStop. Originally known as Impulse when owned by Stardock, it was sold to GameStop in 2011 and rebranded as GameStop PC Downloads, with the Impulse client renamed as the GameStop App. Under the ownership of GameStop the service has had a redesign, and sells games that use other platforms such as Steam while also selling games that use its own proprietary DRM solution Impulse:Reactor.
Trade-ins[edit]
GameStop sells games that are traded in for store credit. This practice has come under fire from game publishers and developers as they make no money from the transaction.[49]
GameStop TV[edit]
GameStop TV is the in-store television network run internally GameStop, with non-endemic sales in partnership with Playwire Media, Inc.[50] GameStop TV features programming designed to speak to the consumers shopping in GameStop stores. Each month brings content segments about upcoming video game releases, exclusive developer interviews, product demonstrations and more.
Pre-order bonuses[edit]
Game publishers have begun to obtain more pre-orders by including exclusive in-game or physical bonuses, available only if the player pre-ordered the game. Bonuses typically include extras such as exclusive characters, weapons and maps. For example, GameStop included an additional avatar costume for Call of Duty: Black Ops when it was released in November 2010, and a pictorial Art-Folio for Metroid: Other M. Soundtracks, artbooks, plushies, figurines, posters, and T-shirts have also been special bonuses.
MovieStop[edit]
GameStop founded MovieStop in 2004 as a standalone store that focused on new and used movies.[51] More than 40 locations were opened, which typically adjoined or were adjacent to GameStop locations.[52] GameStop spun off MovieStop to private owners in 2012.[53] In November 2014, Draw Another Circle LLC, a company controlled by merchandising executive Joel Weinshanker that also owns Hastings Entertainment, purchased MovieStop.[54]
GameStop Kids[edit]
In October 2012 at Grapevine Mills in Dallas, GameStop introduced a new store concept known as GameStop Kids. The brand focus on children's products, and carried only games rated "Everyone" by the ESRB, along with merchandise of popular franchises aimed towards the demographic. The locations opened in 80 malls as pop-up stores for the holiday shopping season.[55][56]
GameTrust Games[edit]
In January 2016, GameStop announced a partnership it had made with Insomniac Games with their 2016 title Song of the Deep. GameStop executive Mark Stanley said the concept was to help the chain have more direct communication with players, and would expect to expand out to other similar distribution deals with other developers if this one succeeds.[57] Subsequently, in April 2016, GameStop announced that it was formally creating the GameTrust Games publishing division within the company to serve as a publisher for mid-sized developers. In addition to Insomniac Games, GameTrust Games is working with Ready At Dawn, Tequila Works, and Frozenbyte to prepare more titles to be published by the end of 2016.[58]
Simply Mac[edit]
In October 2012, GameStop acquired a 49.9% minority equity ownership interest in the Salt Lake City-based Apple authorized reseller and repairer Simply Mac. Simply Mac was founded in Salt Lake City in 2006. GameStop acquired the remaining 50.1% that it did not own in November 2013. GameStop tried to target areas for potential new Simply Mac locations in slight smaller markets that did not have an existing Apple Store within a reasonable driving distance.[59][60][61]
In January 2017, GameStop closed a large number of Simply Mac locations. The chain had as many as 70 locations at the time of the announcement.[62][63] After the closings, a few recently vacated Simply Mac locations were replaced by sister company ThinkGeek.[64]
Criticism[edit]
Opened copies of game titles[edit]
The company has a policy where some copies of new games upon release are "gutted".[65] This means that while sealed copies of the new release are kept behind the counter, one copy is opened so the case can be put on display, with the game disc filed separately behind the counter. Consumers may reach for the opened copy and purchase at the counter, whereupon the consumer will receive a factory-sealed copy from behind the counter. If the opened copy is the last copy of the new game, it is sold at regular price.
GameStop's check-out policy allows employees "to check out one item of store merchandise for personal use for up to four days", with the intent being to allow the employee to evaluate the game and learn about its content. This check out policy does not apply to only used merchandise, which has been a hotly contested practice among the community.[66][67]
GameStop came under fire from critics when customers discovered that content had been removed from the original packaging of Deus Ex: Human Revolution.[68][69][70] GameStop had instructed employees to remove coupons for a free copy of Deus Ex: Human Revolution on OnLive, a cloud gaming service. GameStop stated that the coupon promoted a competitor of its subsidiaries, Spawn Labs and Impulse, which it had acquired in April 2011.[68] Later, GameStop entirely removed the PC version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution from its stores. Square Enix, the publisher of Deus Ex, said that it "respects the right of GameStop to have final say over the contents of products it sells and to adjust them where they see fit in accordance with their policies".[71]
Used games market[edit]
GameStop has frequently been criticized by game developers and publishers for the retailing of used game titles.[72] By reselling used copies at a small discount on the same shelf space as new copies of the game, it is argued that GameStop is taking profits directly from organizations such as developers and publishers which are solely dependent on their intellectual property for revenue. In effect, this means that companies such as GameStop can resell used copies of a game within days of the title's release and keep all of the profit, thereby cutting directly into the critical initial sales which would otherwise go to publishers and developers. It has been suggested by industry insiders that this directly results in increases to the retail cost of new games.[73]
Fingerprint identification[edit]
It was revealed in early August 2014 that GameStop was required by the Pennsylvania State Police to provide fingerprint identifications when customers traded in games at Philadelphia GameStop locations. The policy had been in place since early July of that year and did not apply to the suburban areas of Philadelphia.[74] This caused some heavy criticism from video gamers living in the affected area. Pennsylvania State Police in Philadelphia asserted that the fingerprint identification would help track thieves. By August 4, 2014, the policy had been reversed in all Philadelphia-area GameStop stores.[75]
Circle of Life policy[edit]
In February 2017, it was revealed that GameStop enforced, on all of its retail employees, a program known as Circle of Life. The policy itself was made to ensure that each employee would allot a certain percentage of their sales to pre-orders, rewards cards, used games, or have a customer trade in a game.[76] Upon revelation of the policy, many GameStop employees including current and former, brought up their stories of how the policy has led to them lying to customers. Many more claim that the policy had led to poor working conditions and emotional distress.[77] Later into the month, GameStop reformed the program to solely focus on the store as a whole instead of the previous individual employee basis.[78]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
