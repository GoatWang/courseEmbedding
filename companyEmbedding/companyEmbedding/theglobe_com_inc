theGlobe.com was an internet startup founded in 1994[1] by Cornell students Stephan Paternot and Todd Krizelman. A social networking service, theGlobe.com made headlines by going public on November 13, 1998 and posting the largest first day gain of any IPO in history up to that date.[2] Part of the dot-com bubble, the company's stock price collapsed the next year, and the company retrenched for several years before ceasing operations in 2008.

History[edit]
Early success[edit]




theglobe.com screenshot (12-15-2000)


While undergraduates at Cornell, Paternot and Krizelman encountered a primitive chatroom on the university's computer network and quickly became engrossed.[3] Realizing the business potential, the two raised $15,000 over the 1994 Christmas break and purchased an Apple Internet Server. They founded a programming company, WebGenesis, and spent the next few months programming what would become their primary website. theGlobe.com went live April 1, 1995, and attracted over 44,000 visits within the first month.[4] They readily recruited talent from the Cornell computer science department and had 17 employees by the site's first anniversary.[4]
The pair used the popularity of the site and the increasing interest in the internet in 1997 to secure $20 million in financing through Dancing Bear Investments. As a result, Paternot and Krizelman received salaries in excess of $100,000 and revenues from preferred shares sales of $500,000 each. Both were 23 years old at the time.[3]
In 1998, plans were made to take the company public. On Friday, November 13, 1998, theGlobe.com issued its IPO. The stock's target share price was initially set at $9, yet the first trade was at $87 and the price climbed as high as $97 before closing at $63.50. At the end of the trading day, the company had set a record for IPOs with a 606% increase over the initial share price.[2] The company floated 3.1 million shares, raising $27.9 million and bringing its market capitalization to over $840 million.[2] Based on their holdings, the young founders were worth close to $100 million each.[5]
During the late 1990s, theGlobe.com expanded into gaming, purchasing Computer Games magazine, happypuppy.com (a computer gaming site), and Chips and Bits, an online store for computer and console gaming.
Decline and downfall[edit]
As the fortunes of a number of very young people grew almost overnight, the public and the media began to scrutinize these new economy wunderkinds. In 1999, CNN filmed Paternot during a night on the town. He was shown in shiny leather pants, dancing on a table at a trendy Manhattan night club with his girlfriend, model Jennifer Medley. During the piece, he made the statement, "Got the girl. Got the money. Now I'm ready to live a disgusting, frivolous life."[6][7] He was derisively dubbed "the CEO in the plastic pants" and became a visible symbol of the excesses of dot-com millionaires.
That year also marked the change in the momentum of the dot com boom and theGlobe.com's stock price was hit heavily. As investors grew increasingly skeptical of the "new economy", share prices began to decline rapidly. theGlobe.com saw its share price drop from a high of $97 to less than 10 cents[5] and its market capitalization shrink by more than 95% to around $4 million[1] in 2001.
In 2000, Paternot and Krizelman were forced out of the company and it was taken over by a former VP of the AICPA,[3] but the company, which had never turned a profit, was forced to cut back severely. theGlobe.com closed its flagship site and laid off 50% of its employees in August 2001.[1] The company continued hosting some of its partner sites and publishing Computer Games, but the domain of www.theglobe.com displayed nothing more than an informational message about the site's termination until 2003.
That year, theGlobe.com launched GloPhone, a VoIP phone service similar to Skype, and used its eponymous domain as the product's website. Although teamed with networking site Friendster, reviews were bad[8] and sales were poor. A lawsuit was filed by Sprint Nextel for patent infringement.[9] theGlobe.com had continued publishing Computer Games and it was considered one of the top 3 PC gaming magazines in the US (along with Ziff Davis' Games for Windows and Future Publishing's PC Gamer).[10] The company expanded its print enterprises to include Now Playing magazine (2005) and MMO Games magazine (2006), publications focusing on popular entertainment and massively multiplayer gaming, respectively. theGlobe.com made a decision to send unsolicited messages to MySpace.com users and was subsequently sued under the CAN-SPAM act and a similar anti-spam law in California.[10] A California court ruled against theGlobe.com. Subsequently, the magazines stopped publication, Chips & Bits' home page announced the site's closing, and GloPhone ceased operations on March 13, 2007.[11] The anticipation of a large federal judgement (estimated as high as $120 million) effectively spelled the end of theGlobe.com.[10]
Lawsuits[edit]
The company was subject to six putative shareholder class action lawsuits.[12] It was sued by vendors to the discontinued VoIP business.[12] And in October 2011, it was sued in connection with the 2005 sale of a subsidiary called SendTec to RelationServ Media, which company subsequently failed.[12]
Tralliance[edit]
On May 9, 2005, the company acquired Tralliance Corporation, a company which maintains the .travel top-level domain. By mid-2007, the domain theglobe.com redirected to the home page of Tralliance.[13] The company then sold Tralliance on September 29, 2008.[14] theglobe received earn-out rights from Tralliance Registry Management, which will constitute the only source of future revenue for theglobe.[15]
With the sale of Tralliance, theglobe.com became a shell company with no operations or assets other than its rights in the Tralliance earn-out. The company operates out of borrowed offices, and as of March 1, 2012, it reported having no employees other than its executive officers, each of whom devoted "very limited time" to TheGlobe's business, and received no compensation for doing so.[12]
As a shell[edit]
The company continues to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol TGLO. Net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $0 compared to $544,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2008.
As of the company's 2011 annual report, it reported $6426 in assets versus $3.2 million in liabilities.[citation needed] Management has stated that the Tralliance earn-out must perform very well, or they will need to raise additional capital, or the company will file for bankruptcy.[16]

theglobe.com, incorporated in 1995, began as one of the first social media sites.  Created as an online community of registered members worldwide, the network gave users the freedom to personalize their online experiences by publishing their own content and interacting with others with similar interests.  Shortly thereafter and coinciding with the Internet boom, theglobe.com decided to go public and made headlines on November 13, 1998.  theglobe.com posted the largest first day gain of any IPO in history up to that date, a 606% increase over the initial share price.
The social media continued through the Internet craze of the late 90s, but with hopes of capturing advertising dollars it, like many Internet based companies, suffered with the deterioration of the online advertising market.  Faced with restructuring the operations of theglobe.com's online community, Chairman and CEO, Michael S. Egan, and President, Edward A. Cespedes, opted to use theglobe.com as a vehicle to make investments and acquire a portfolio of other Internet media and advertising companies.
From the late 1990s until 2007, theglobe.com's executive team expanded into four primary lines of business.  The first line was Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) telephony services. The VoIP-based phone services, called voiceglo, enabled people to use the Internet to make phone calls from anywhere in the world and cost effectively.  Secondly, theglobe.com purchased a network of three businesses, specializing in the computer gaming.  The network comprised of Computer Games magazine, happypuppy.com, and Chips & Bits.  Sentec, Inc. was the third line of business, which brought theglobe.com into the marketing services arena.   As a successful response marketing services and technology company, Sentec, Inc., quickly sold at a substantial profit in 2005.  The fourth line of business was the acquisition of Tralliance Corporation (“Tralliance”), the registry for the .travel top-level Internet domain.  
In March of 2007, management made the decision to shutdown the operations of both its computer games and VoIP telephony businesses.  On September 29, 2008, theglobe.com sold the business and substantially all of the assets of its Tralliance Corporation subsidiary to Tralliance Registry Management Company LLC, a private entity controlled by Michael S. Egan, theglobe.com's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  As part of the sales transaction, theglobe.com will receive an earn-out equal to 10% of Tralliance Registry Management's “net revenue” (as defined) derived from “.travel” names registered by Tralliance Registry Management through May 5, 2015.  In connection with the sales transaction, theglobe.com also entered into a Master Services Agreement with Dancing Bear Investments, Inc., a private entity controlled by Mr. Egan, whereby Dancing Bear Investments, Inc. will provide personnel and services to theglobe.com so as to enable it to continue as a public company without the necessity of full-time employees of its own.  Services under the Master Services Agreement include, without limitation, accounting, financial reporting, accounts payable, treasury/financial planning, tax, record retention and secretarial and investor relation functions.  For more complete information regarding the aforementioned transactions and other information regarding theglobe.com, please refer to theglobe.com's public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Immediately following the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets of its Tralliance Corporation subsidiary, theglobe.com became a shell company with no significant assets or operations, and has no source of revenue other than revenue related to the “net revenue” earn-out arrangement with Tralliance Registry Management.  theglobe.com presently intends to continue as a public company and make all the requisite filings under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to remain a public company.
               For more detailed information, please visit the SEC filings under theglobe.com's ticker symbol (tglo).

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

theglobe.com, incorporated in 1995, began as one of the first social media sites.  Created as an online community of registered members worldwide, the network gave users the freedom to personalize their online experiences by publishing their own content and interacting with others with similar interests.  Shortly thereafter and coinciding with the Internet boom, theglobe.com decided to go public and made headlines on November 13, 1998.  theglobe.com posted the largest first day gain of any IPO in history up to that date, a 606% increase over the initial share price.
The social media continued through the Internet craze of the late 90s, but with hopes of capturing advertising dollars it, like many Internet based companies, suffered with the deterioration of the online advertising market.  Faced with restructuring the operations of theglobe.com's online community, Chairman and CEO, Michael S. Egan, and President, Edward A. Cespedes, opted to use theglobe.com as a vehicle to make investments and acquire a portfolio of other Internet media and advertising companies.
From the late 1990s until 2007, theglobe.com's executive team expanded into four primary lines of business.  The first line was Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) telephony services. The VoIP-based phone services, called voiceglo, enabled people to use the Internet to make phone calls from anywhere in the world and cost effectively.  Secondly, theglobe.com purchased a network of three businesses, specializing in the computer gaming.  The network comprised of Computer Games magazine, happypuppy.com, and Chips & Bits.  Sentec, Inc. was the third line of business, which brought theglobe.com into the marketing services arena.   As a successful response marketing services and technology company, Sentec, Inc., quickly sold at a substantial profit in 2005.  The fourth line of business was the acquisition of Tralliance Corporation (“Tralliance”), the registry for the .travel top-level Internet domain.  
In March of 2007, management made the decision to shutdown the operations of both its computer games and VoIP telephony businesses.  On September 29, 2008, theglobe.com sold the business and substantially all of the assets of its Tralliance Corporation subsidiary to Tralliance Registry Management Company LLC, a private entity controlled by Michael S. Egan, theglobe.com's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  As part of the sales transaction, theglobe.com will receive an earn-out equal to 10% of Tralliance Registry Management's “net revenue” (as defined) derived from “.travel” names registered by Tralliance Registry Management through May 5, 2015.  In connection with the sales transaction, theglobe.com also entered into a Master Services Agreement with Dancing Bear Investments, Inc., a private entity controlled by Mr. Egan, whereby Dancing Bear Investments, Inc. will provide personnel and services to theglobe.com so as to enable it to continue as a public company without the necessity of full-time employees of its own.  Services under the Master Services Agreement include, without limitation, accounting, financial reporting, accounts payable, treasury/financial planning, tax, record retention and secretarial and investor relation functions.  For more complete information regarding the aforementioned transactions and other information regarding theglobe.com, please refer to theglobe.com's public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Immediately following the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets of its Tralliance Corporation subsidiary, theglobe.com became a shell company with no significant assets or operations, and has no source of revenue other than revenue related to the “net revenue” earn-out arrangement with Tralliance Registry Management.  theglobe.com presently intends to continue as a public company and make all the requisite filings under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to remain a public company.
               For more detailed information, please visit the SEC filings under theglobe.com's ticker symbol (tglo).

History[edit]
Early success[edit]




theglobe.com screenshot (12-15-2000)


While undergraduates at Cornell, Paternot and Krizelman encountered a primitive chatroom on the university's computer network and quickly became engrossed.[3] Realizing the business potential, the two raised $15,000 over the 1994 Christmas break and purchased an Apple Internet Server. They founded a programming company, WebGenesis, and spent the next few months programming what would become their primary website. theGlobe.com went live April 1, 1995, and attracted over 44,000 visits within the first month.[4] They readily recruited talent from the Cornell computer science department and had 17 employees by the site's first anniversary.[4]
The pair used the popularity of the site and the increasing interest in the internet in 1997 to secure $20 million in financing through Dancing Bear Investments. As a result, Paternot and Krizelman received salaries in excess of $100,000 and revenues from preferred shares sales of $500,000 each. Both were 23 years old at the time.[3]
In 1998, plans were made to take the company public. On Friday, November 13, 1998, theGlobe.com issued its IPO. The stock's target share price was initially set at $9, yet the first trade was at $87 and the price climbed as high as $97 before closing at $63.50. At the end of the trading day, the company had set a record for IPOs with a 606% increase over the initial share price.[2] The company floated 3.1 million shares, raising $27.9 million and bringing its market capitalization to over $840 million.[2] Based on their holdings, the young founders were worth close to $100 million each.[5]
During the late 1990s, theGlobe.com expanded into gaming, purchasing Computer Games magazine, happypuppy.com (a computer gaming site), and Chips and Bits, an online store for computer and console gaming.
Decline and downfall[edit]
As the fortunes of a number of very young people grew almost overnight, the public and the media began to scrutinize these new economy wunderkinds. In 1999, CNN filmed Paternot during a night on the town. He was shown in shiny leather pants, dancing on a table at a trendy Manhattan night club with his girlfriend, model Jennifer Medley. During the piece, he made the statement, "Got the girl. Got the money. Now I'm ready to live a disgusting, frivolous life."[6][7] He was derisively dubbed "the CEO in the plastic pants" and became a visible symbol of the excesses of dot-com millionaires.
That year also marked the change in the momentum of the dot com boom and theGlobe.com's stock price was hit heavily. As investors grew increasingly skeptical of the "new economy", share prices began to decline rapidly. theGlobe.com saw its share price drop from a high of $97 to less than 10 cents[5] and its market capitalization shrink by more than 95% to around $4 million[1] in 2001.
In 2000, Paternot and Krizelman were forced out of the company and it was taken over by a former VP of the AICPA,[3] but the company, which had never turned a profit, was forced to cut back severely. theGlobe.com closed its flagship site and laid off 50% of its employees in August 2001.[1] The company continued hosting some of its partner sites and publishing Computer Games, but the domain of www.theglobe.com displayed nothing more than an informational message about the site's termination until 2003.
That year, theGlobe.com launched GloPhone, a VoIP phone service similar to Skype, and used its eponymous domain as the product's website. Although teamed with networking site Friendster, reviews were bad[8] and sales were poor. A lawsuit was filed by Sprint Nextel for patent infringement.[9] theGlobe.com had continued publishing Computer Games and it was considered one of the top 3 PC gaming magazines in the US (along with Ziff Davis' Games for Windows and Future Publishing's PC Gamer).[10] The company expanded its print enterprises to include Now Playing magazine (2005) and MMO Games magazine (2006), publications focusing on popular entertainment and massively multiplayer gaming, respectively. theGlobe.com made a decision to send unsolicited messages to MySpace.com users and was subsequently sued under the CAN-SPAM act and a similar anti-spam law in California.[10] A California court ruled against theGlobe.com. Subsequently, the magazines stopped publication, Chips & Bits' home page announced the site's closing, and GloPhone ceased operations on March 13, 2007.[11] The anticipation of a large federal judgement (estimated as high as $120 million) effectively spelled the end of theGlobe.com.[10]
Lawsuits[edit]
The company was subject to six putative shareholder class action lawsuits.[12] It was sued by vendors to the discontinued VoIP business.[12] And in October 2011, it was sued in connection with the 2005 sale of a subsidiary called SendTec to RelationServ Media, which company subsequently failed.[12]
Tralliance[edit]
On May 9, 2005, the company acquired Tralliance Corporation, a company which maintains the .travel top-level domain. By mid-2007, the domain theglobe.com redirected to the home page of Tralliance.[13] The company then sold Tralliance on September 29, 2008.[14] theglobe received earn-out rights from Tralliance Registry Management, which will constitute the only source of future revenue for theglobe.[15]
With the sale of Tralliance, theglobe.com became a shell company with no operations or assets other than its rights in the Tralliance earn-out. The company operates out of borrowed offices, and as of March 1, 2012, it reported having no employees other than its executive officers, each of whom devoted "very limited time" to TheGlobe's business, and received no compensation for doing so.[12]
As a shell[edit]
The company continues to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol TGLO. Net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $0 compared to $544,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2008.
As of the company's 2011 annual report, it reported $6426 in assets versus $3.2 million in liabilities.[citation needed] Management has stated that the Tralliance earn-out must perform very well, or they will need to raise additional capital, or the company will file for bankruptcy.[16]

theGlobe.com was an internet startup founded in 1994[1] by Cornell students Stephan Paternot and Todd Krizelman. A social networking service, theGlobe.com made headlines by going public on November 13, 1998 and posting the largest first day gain of any IPO in history up to that date.[2] Part of the dot-com bubble, the company's stock price collapsed the next year, and the company retrenched for several years before ceasing operations in 2008.

History[edit]
Early success[edit]




theglobe.com screenshot (12-15-2000)


While undergraduates at Cornell, Paternot and Krizelman encountered a primitive chatroom on the university's computer network and quickly became engrossed.[3] Realizing the business potential, the two raised $15,000 over the 1994 Christmas break and purchased an Apple Internet Server. They founded a programming company, WebGenesis, and spent the next few months programming what would become their primary website. theGlobe.com went live April 1, 1995, and attracted over 44,000 visits within the first month.[4] They readily recruited talent from the Cornell computer science department and had 17 employees by the site's first anniversary.[4]
The pair used the popularity of the site and the increasing interest in the internet in 1997 to secure $20 million in financing through Dancing Bear Investments. As a result, Paternot and Krizelman received salaries in excess of $100,000 and revenues from preferred shares sales of $500,000 each. Both were 23 years old at the time.[3]
In 1998, plans were made to take the company public. On Friday, November 13, 1998, theGlobe.com issued its IPO. The stock's target share price was initially set at $9, yet the first trade was at $87 and the price climbed as high as $97 before closing at $63.50. At the end of the trading day, the company had set a record for IPOs with a 606% increase over the initial share price.[2] The company floated 3.1 million shares, raising $27.9 million and bringing its market capitalization to over $840 million.[2] Based on their holdings, the young founders were worth close to $100 million each.[5]
During the late 1990s, theGlobe.com expanded into gaming, purchasing Computer Games magazine, happypuppy.com (a computer gaming site), and Chips and Bits, an online store for computer and console gaming.
Decline and downfall[edit]
As the fortunes of a number of very young people grew almost overnight, the public and the media began to scrutinize these new economy wunderkinds. In 1999, CNN filmed Paternot during a night on the town. He was shown in shiny leather pants, dancing on a table at a trendy Manhattan night club with his girlfriend, model Jennifer Medley. During the piece, he made the statement, "Got the girl. Got the money. Now I'm ready to live a disgusting, frivolous life."[6][7] He was derisively dubbed "the CEO in the plastic pants" and became a visible symbol of the excesses of dot-com millionaires.
That year also marked the change in the momentum of the dot com boom and theGlobe.com's stock price was hit heavily. As investors grew increasingly skeptical of the "new economy", share prices began to decline rapidly. theGlobe.com saw its share price drop from a high of $97 to less than 10 cents[5] and its market capitalization shrink by more than 95% to around $4 million[1] in 2001.
In 2000, Paternot and Krizelman were forced out of the company and it was taken over by a former VP of the AICPA,[3] but the company, which had never turned a profit, was forced to cut back severely. theGlobe.com closed its flagship site and laid off 50% of its employees in August 2001.[1] The company continued hosting some of its partner sites and publishing Computer Games, but the domain of www.theglobe.com displayed nothing more than an informational message about the site's termination until 2003.
That year, theGlobe.com launched GloPhone, a VoIP phone service similar to Skype, and used its eponymous domain as the product's website. Although teamed with networking site Friendster, reviews were bad[8] and sales were poor. A lawsuit was filed by Sprint Nextel for patent infringement.[9] theGlobe.com had continued publishing Computer Games and it was considered one of the top 3 PC gaming magazines in the US (along with Ziff Davis' Games for Windows and Future Publishing's PC Gamer).[10] The company expanded its print enterprises to include Now Playing magazine (2005) and MMO Games magazine (2006), publications focusing on popular entertainment and massively multiplayer gaming, respectively. theGlobe.com made a decision to send unsolicited messages to MySpace.com users and was subsequently sued under the CAN-SPAM act and a similar anti-spam law in California.[10] A California court ruled against theGlobe.com. Subsequently, the magazines stopped publication, Chips & Bits' home page announced the site's closing, and GloPhone ceased operations on March 13, 2007.[11] The anticipation of a large federal judgement (estimated as high as $120 million) effectively spelled the end of theGlobe.com.[10]
Lawsuits[edit]
The company was subject to six putative shareholder class action lawsuits.[12] It was sued by vendors to the discontinued VoIP business.[12] And in October 2011, it was sued in connection with the 2005 sale of a subsidiary called SendTec to RelationServ Media, which company subsequently failed.[12]
Tralliance[edit]
On May 9, 2005, the company acquired Tralliance Corporation, a company which maintains the .travel top-level domain. By mid-2007, the domain theglobe.com redirected to the home page of Tralliance.[13] The company then sold Tralliance on September 29, 2008.[14] theglobe received earn-out rights from Tralliance Registry Management, which will constitute the only source of future revenue for theglobe.[15]
With the sale of Tralliance, theglobe.com became a shell company with no operations or assets other than its rights in the Tralliance earn-out. The company operates out of borrowed offices, and as of March 1, 2012, it reported having no employees other than its executive officers, each of whom devoted "very limited time" to TheGlobe's business, and received no compensation for doing so.[12]
As a shell[edit]
The company continues to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol TGLO. Net revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $0 compared to $544,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2008.
As of the company's 2011 annual report, it reported $6426 in assets versus $3.2 million in liabilities.[citation needed] Management has stated that the Tralliance earn-out must perform very well, or they will need to raise additional capital, or the company will file for bankruptcy.[16]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
