      A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this ratings action 
      commentary.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      November 03, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $33,849,000 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 39 loans secured by 69 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $820.6 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and Cantor Commercial Real Estate 
      Lending, L.P.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 75.9% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 87.6%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage Below Recent Transactions: The Fitch DSCR and LTV are 
      1.24x and 102.2%, respectively. The leverage metrics for this 
      transaction are better than for other recent Fitch-rated fixed-rate 
      multiborrower transactions. The 2015 YTD average DSCR and LTV are 1.19x 
      and 109.6% and the 2014 average DSCR and LTV were 1.19x and 106.2%, 
      respectively.
    

      High Pool Concentration: The top 10 loans comprise 65.5% of the pool, 
      which is much higher than recent averages of 48.5% and 50.5% for YTD 
      2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, the LCI is 564 and the SCI is 
      589, both of which are higher than recent respective averages of 349 and 
      384 for YTD 2015.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: The largest loan in the pool, 590 
      Madison (12.2% of the pool), was assigned a 'AAA' credit opinion within 
      the context of this pool.
    

      High Quality Collateral: Two properties, 590 Madison Avenue and Element 
      LA, were assigned Fitch's highest property quality grade of 'A' and 
      Deerfield Crossing was assigned a grade of 'A-'. These three properties 
      total 32.8% of the pool in which site inspections were performed. The 
      majority of the inspected pool (57.9%) was assigned a property quality 
      grade of 'B+' or 'B'. Only 9.3% of the inspected pool was assigned a 
      property quality grade of 'B-', indicating below average property 
      quality.}
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's NCF was 4.9% below the most recent year's 
      NOI (for properties for which a full year NOI was provided, excluding 
      properties that were stabilizing during this period). The following 
      rating sensitivities describe how the ratings would react to further NCF 
      declines below Fitch's NCF. The implied rating sensitivities are only 
      indicative of some of the potential outcomes and do not consider other 
      risk factors to which the transaction is exposed. Stressing additional 
      risk factors may result in different outcomes. Furthermore, the implied 
      ratings, after the further NCF stresses are applied, are more akin to 
      what the ratings would be at deal issuance had those further stressed 
      NCFs been in place at that time.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to GSMS 2015-GS1 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 10 - 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 39 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moodyâs publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

(a)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Each Note
Holder acknowledges and agrees that, subject in each case to this Agreement, the Mortgage Loan shall be serviced from and after
the Securitization Date pursuant to the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement; provided that the Master Servicer shall

Note if such principal or interest is not paid by the Mortgage Loan Borrower but shall be obligated to advance delinquent real

of the lien of the Mortgage thereon, subject to the terms of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement including any provisions

discretion, to include its Note in a Securitization and agrees that it will, subject to Section 26, reasonably cooperate with such
other Note Holder, at such other Note Holderâs expense, to effect such Securitization. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each Note Holder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the appointment of the Master Servicer,
Operating Advisor, Certificate Administrator and the Trustee under the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement by the Depositor

the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement and agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer
with respect to the servicing of the Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement. Each Note Holder

attorney-in-fact to sign any documents reasonably required with respect to the administration and servicing of the Mortgage Loan
on its behalf under the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement (subject at all times to the rights of the Note Holder set forth

of one Note Holder against any other Note Holder; however, this statement shall not be construed to otherwise limit the rights
of one Note Holder with respect to the other Note Holder. Each Servicer shall be required pursuant to the Lead Securitization Servicing
Agreement to service the Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the terms of the Mortgage Loan Documents, the
Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement and applicable law, and shall not take any action or refrain from taking any action or
follow any direction inconsistent with the foregoing.
Â 
At any time that the
Mortgage Loan is no longer subject to the provisions of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, the Note Holders agree to

to a servicing agreement that has servicing terms substantially similar to the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement and all
references herein to the âLead Securitization Servicing Agreementâ shall mean such subsequent servicing agreement;
provided, however, that if any Non-Lead Securitization Note is in a Securitization, then a written confirmation shall

in and of itself, cause a downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of the then-current ratings assigned to the securities issued
in connection with such
Â 

17
Â 
Â 
Securitization; provided, further, however, that until a replacement servicing agreement
has been entered into, the Lead Securitization Note Holder shall cause the Mortgage Loan to be serviced pursuant to the provisions
of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement as if such agreement was still in full force and effect with respect to the Mortgage
Loan, by the Servicer in the Lead Securitization or by any Person appointed by the Lead Securitization Note Holder that is a qualified
servicer meeting the requirements of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement.
(b)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Master
Servicer shall be the master servicer on the Mortgage Loan, and from time to time it (or the Trustee, to the extent provided in
the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement) (i) shall be required to make Property Advances with respect to the Mortgage Loan,
subject to the terms of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement and this Agreement, and (ii) may be required to make P&I
Advances on the Lead Securitization Note, if and to the extent provided in the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement and this
Agreement. The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee, as applicable, will be entitled to reimbursement for a Property
Advance, first from funds on deposit in the Whole Loan Custodial Account for the Mortgage Loan that (in any case) represent
amounts received on or in respect of the Mortgage Loan, and then, in the case of Nonrecoverable Property Advances, if such
funds on deposit in the Whole Loan Custodial Account are insufficient, from general collections of the Lead Securitization as provided
in the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement and from general collections of any Non-Lead Securitization as provided below. The
Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee, as applicable, will be entitled to reimbursement for Advance Interest Amounts
on a Property Advance or a Nonrecoverable Property Advance, in the manner and from the sources provided in the Lead Securitization
Servicing Agreement, including from general collections of the Lead Securitization and, in the case of Property Advances, from
general collections of any Non-Lead Securitization as provided below. To the extent the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or
the Trustee, as applicable, obtains funds from general collections of the Lead Securitization as a reimbursement for a Nonrecoverable
Property Advance or any Advance Interest Amounts on a Property Advance or a Nonrecoverable Property Advance, any Non-Lead Securitization
Note Holder (including from general collections or any other amounts from any Non-Lead Securitization Trust) shall be required
to, promptly following notice from the Master Servicer, reimburse the Lead Securitization for its pro rata share of such
Nonrecoverable Property Advance or Advance Interest Amounts.
Â 
In addition, any Non-Lead
Securitization Note Holder (including, but not limited to, any Non-Lead Securitization Trust) shall be required to, promptly following
notice from the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, pay or reimburse the Lead Securitization for such Non-Lead Securitization
Note Holderâs pro rata share of any Additional Trust Fund Expenses with respect to the Mortgage Loan and the Mortgaged
Property, any other fees, costs or expenses incurred in connection with the servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loan as
to which the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Operating Advisor or the Depositor,
as applicable, is entitled to be reimbursed pursuant to the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement and any costs, fees and expenses
related to obtaining any Rating Agency Confirmation, to the extent amounts on deposit in the Whole Loan Custodial Account that
are allocated to such Non-Lead Securitization Note are insufficient for reimbursement of such amounts. Each Non-Lead Securitization
Holder agrees to indemnify (i) (as and to the same extent the Lead Securitization Trust is required to indemnify each of the
Â 

18
Â 
Â 
following
parties in respect of other mortgage loans in the Lead Securitization Trust pursuant to the terms of Lead Securitization Servicing
Agreement) each of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Operating Advisor
and the Depositor (and any director, officer, employee or agent of any of the foregoing, to the extent such parties are identified
as indemnified parties in the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement in respect of other mortgage loans) and (ii) the Lead Securitization
Trust (such parties in clause (i) and the Lead Securitization Trust, collectively, the âIndemnified Partiesâ)
against any claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments and any other costs, liabilities,
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loan and the Mortgaged Property
(or, with respect to the Operating Advisor, incurred in connection with the provision of services for the Mortgage Loan) under
the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement (collectively, the âIndemnified Itemsâ) to the extent of its pro
rata share of such Indemnified Items, and to the extent amounts on deposit in the Whole Loan Custodial Account that are allocated
to the related Non-Lead Securitization Note are insufficient for reimbursement of such amounts, such Non-Lead Securitization Note
Holder shall be required to, promptly following notice from the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, reimburse
each of the applicable Indemnified Parties for its pro rata share of the insufficiency, (including, if such Non-Lead Securitization
Note has been included in a Non-Lead Securitization, from general collections or any other amounts from the related Non-Lead Securitization
Trust).
Â 
Each Non-Lead Master
Servicer may be required to make P&I Advances on the related Non-Lead Securitization Note, from time to time, subject to the
terms of the respective Non-Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement and this Agreement.
The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee, as applicable, shall be entitled to make their own recoverability determination
with respect to a P&I Advance to be made on the Lead Securitization Note based on the information that they have on hand and
in accordance with the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement. Each Non-Lead Master Servicer, each Non-Lead Special Servicer and
each Non-Lead Trustee, as applicable, shall be entitled to make their own recoverability determination with respect to a P&I
Advance to be made on the related Non-Lead Securitization Note based on the information that they have on hand and in accordance
with the related Non-Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement. The Master Servicer and the Trustee, as applicable, and each Non-Lead
Master Servicer or each Non-Lead Trustee shall be required to notify the other of the amount of its P&I Advance within two
business days of making such advance. If the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable (with respect
to the Lead Securitization Note) or a Non-Lead Master Servicer, a Non-Lead Special Servicer or a Non-Lead Trustee, as applicable
(with respect to a Non-Lead Securitization Note), determines that a proposed P&I Advance, if made, would be non-recoverable
or an outstanding P&I Advance is or would be non-recoverable, or if the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee,
as applicable, subsequently determines that a proposed Property Advance would be non-recoverable or an outstanding Property Advance
is or would be non-recoverable, then the Master Servicer or the Trustee (as provided in the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement,
in the case of a determination of non-recoverability by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee) or a Non-Lead
Master Servicer or a Non-Lead Trustee (as provided in the related Non-Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, in the case of the
a determination of non-recoverability by a Non-Lead Master Servicer, a Non-Lead Special Servicer or a Non-Lead Trustee) shall notify
the Master Servicer and the Trustee, or the
Â 

19
Â 
Â 
related Non-Lead Master Servicer and the related Non-Lead Trustee, as the case may
be, of the other Securitization within two business days of making such determination. Each of the Master Servicer, the Trustee,
each Non-Lead Master Servicer and each Non-Lead Trustee, as applicable, will only be entitled to reimbursement for a P&I Advance
and advance interest thereon that becomes non-recoverable first from the Whole Loan Custodial Account from amounts allocable
to the Note for which such P&I Advance was made, and then, if funds are insufficient, (i) in the case of the Lead Securitization

and (ii) in the case of a Non-Lead Securitization Note, from general collections of the related Securitization Trust, as and to
the extent provided in the related Non-Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement.
Â 
(c)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Each Non-Lead
Securitization Note Holder agrees that, if the related Non-Lead Securitization Note is included in a Securitization, it shall cause
the applicable Non-Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement to contain provisions to the effect that:
Â 
(i)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â the
related Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder shall be responsible for its pro rata share of any Property Advances (and advance
interest thereon) and any Additional Trust Fund Expenses, but only to the extent that they relate to servicing and administration
of the Notes and the Mortgaged Property, including without limitation, any unpaid Special Servicing Fees, Liquidation Fees and
Workout Fees relating to the Notes, and that in the event that the funds received with respect to each respective Note are insufficient

Servicer, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee, as applicable, may do so, and the related Non-Lead Master Servicer will
be required to, promptly following notice from the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, reimburse the Lead Securitization

Securitization Servicing Agreement and, in the case of the Lead Securitization Trust, to the extent of any Additional Trust Fund
Expenses with respect to the Mortgage Loan) by the related Non-Lead Securitization Trust, against any of the Indemnified Items
to the extent of its pro rata share of such Indemnified Items, and to the extent amounts on deposit in the Whole Loan Custodial

Special Servicer and the party designated to exercise the rights of the related âNon-Controlling Note Holderâ under
this Agreement), accompanied by a certified copy of such executed Non-Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement and (ii) notice

related Non-Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement; and
Â 
(v)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	the
Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee and the Lead Securitization Trust shall be third party beneficiaries of the
foregoing provisions.
Â 
Section 3.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Priority
of Payments.Â Â Each Note shall be of equal priority, and no portion of either Note shall have priority or preference over any
portion of the other Note or security therefor. All amounts tendered by the Mortgage Loan Borrower or otherwise available for
payment on or with respect to or in connection with the Mortgage Loan or the Mortgaged Property or amounts realized as proceeds
thereof, whether received in the form of Monthly Payments, the Balloon Payment, Liquidation Proceeds, proceeds under any guaranty,

(or the Trustee as successor to the Servicer), with respect to the Mortgage Loan pursuant to the Lead Securitization Servicing
Agreement (including without limitation, any Additional Trust Fund Expenses relating to the Mortgage Loan (but subject to second

and any other additional compensation payable pursuant to the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement), shall be applied by the
Lead Securitization Note Holder (or its designee) to the Notes on a Pro Rata and Pari Passu Basis.
Â 
For clarification
purposes, Penalty Charges (as defined in the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement) paid on each Note shall first, be
used to reduce, on a pro rata basis, the amounts payable on each Note by the amount necessary to pay the Master Servicer,
the Trustee or the Special Servicer for any interest accrued on any Property Advances and reimbursement of any Property Advances
in accordance with the terms of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, second, be used to reduce the respective

Section 4.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Workout.Â Â Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, but subject to the terms and conditions of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement,
and the obligation to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard, if the Lead Securitization Note Holder, or any Servicer,
in connection with a workout or proposed workout of the Mortgage Loan, modifies the terms thereof such that (i) the principal
balance of the Mortgage Loan is decreased, (ii) the Interest Rate is reduced, (iii) payments of interest or principal on any Note
are waived, reduced or deferred or (iv) any other adjustment is made to any of the payment terms of the Mortgage Loan, such modification

Â 
Section 5.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Administration
of the Mortgage Loan.
(a)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Subject
to this Agreement (including but not limited to Section 5(c)) and the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement and subject to the
rights and consents, where required, of the Controlling Note Holder Representative, the Lead Securitization Note Holder (or the
Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee acting on behalf of the Lead Securitization Note Holder) shall have the sole
and exclusive authority with respect to the administration of, and exercise of rights and remedies with respect to, the Mortgage
Loan, including, without limitation, the sole authority to modify or waive any of the terms of the Mortgage Loan Documents or consent
to any action or failure to act by the Mortgage Loan Borrower or any other party to the Mortgage Loan Documents, call or waive
any Event of Default, accelerate the Mortgage Loan or institute any foreclosure action or other remedy, and no Non-Lead Securitization
Note Holder shall have any voting, consent or other rights whatsoever except as explicitly set forth herein with respect to the
Lead Securitization Note Holderâs administration of, or exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to, the Mortgage
Loan. Subject to this Agreement and the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder agrees
that it shall have no right to, and hereby presently and irrevocably assigns and conveys to the Lead Securitization Note Holder
(or the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee acting on behalf of the Lead Securitization Note Holder) the rights,
if any, that such Note Holder has to, (i) call or cause the Lead Securitization Note Holder to call an Event of Default under the
Mortgage Loan, or (ii) exercise any remedies with respect to the Mortgage Loan or the Mortgage Loan Borrower, including, without
limitation, filing or causing the Lead Securitization Note Holder to file any bankruptcy petition against the Mortgage Loan Borrower.
The Lead Securitization Note Holder (or the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee acting on behalf of the Lead Securitization
Note Holder) shall not have any fiduciary duty to any Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder in connection with the administration
of the Mortgage Loan (but the foregoing shall not relieve the Lead Securitization Note Holder from the obligation to make any disbursement
of funds as set forth herein or its obligation to follow the Servicing Standard (in the case of the Master Servicer or the Special
Servicer) or any liability for failure to do so).
Â 
Upon the Mortgage
Loan becoming a Defaulted Mortgage Loan, each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder hereby acknowledges the right and obligation
of the Lead Securitization Note Holder (or the Special Servicer acting on behalf of the Lead Securitization Note Holder) to sell
each Non-Lead Securitization Note together with the Lead Securitization Note as notes evidencing one whole loan in accordance with
the terms of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement. In connection with any such sale, the Special Servicer shall be required
to sell each Non-Lead Securitization Note together with the Lead Securitization Note in the manner set forth in the Lead Securitization
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lead Securitization Note Holder (or the Special Servicer acting on behalf of the
Lead Securitization Note Holder) shall not be permitted to sell the Mortgage Loan if it becomes a Defaulted Mortgage Loan without
the written consent of each Non-Controlling Note Holder ( provided that such consent is not required if such Non-Controlling Note
Holder is the Mortgage Loan Borrower or an affiliate of the Mortgage Loan Borrower) unless the Special Servicer has delivered to
the Non-Controlling Note Holder: (a) at least 15 Business Daysâ prior written notice of any decision to attempt to sell the
Mortgage Loan; (b) at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale date, a copy of each bid package (together with any material amendments
to such bid
Â 

23
Â 
Â 
packages) received by the Special Servicer in connection with any such proposed sale, (c) at least 10 days prior to
the proposed sale date, a copy of the most recent Appraisal for the Mortgage Loan, and any documents in the Servicing File reasonably
requested by such Non-Controlling Note Holder that are material to the price of the Mortgage Loan and (d) until the sale is completed,
and a reasonable period of time (but no less time than is afforded to the other offerors and the Lead Securitization Subordinate
Class Representative) prior to the proposed sale date, all information and other documents being provided to other offerors and
all leases or other documents that are approved by and Servicer in connection with the proposed sale; provided, that each Non-Controlling
Note Holder may waive any of the delivery or timing requirements set forth in this sentence. Subject to the terms of the Lead Securitization
Servicing Agreement, each of the Controlling Note Holder, the Controlling Note Holder Representative, each Non-Controlling Note
Holder and each Non-Controlling Note Holder Representative shall be permitted to bid at any sale of the Mortgage Loan unless such
Person is the Mortgage Loan Borrower or an agent or Affiliate of the Mortgage Loan Borrower.
Â 
Each Non-Lead Securitization
Note Holder hereby appoints the Lead Securitization Note Holder as its agent, and grants to the Lead Securitization Note Holder
an irrevocable power of attorney coupled with an interest, and its proxy, for the purpose of soliciting and accepting offers for
and consummating the sale of the related Non-Lead Securitization Note. Each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder further agrees
that, upon the request of the Lead Securitization Note Holder, such Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder shall execute and deliver
to or at the direction of Lead Securitization Note Holder such powers of attorney or other instruments as the Lead Securitization
Note Holder may reasonably request to better assure and evidence the foregoing appointment and grant, in each case promptly following
request, and shall deliver the original related Non-Lead Securitization Note, endorsed in blank, to or at the direction of the
Lead Securitization Note Holder in connection with the consummation of any such sale.
Â 
The authority of the
Lead Securitization Note Holder to sell a Non-Lead Securitization Note, and the obligations of the related Non-Lead Securitization
Note Holder to execute and deliver instruments or deliver the related Non-Lead Securitization Note upon request of the Lead Securitization
Note Holder, shall terminate and cease to be of any further force or effect upon the date, if any, upon which Lead Securitization
Note is repurchased by the Initial Note A-1 Holder from the trust fund established under the Lead Securitization Agreement in connection
with a material breach of representation or warranty made by Initial Note A-1 Holder with respect to Lead Securitization Note or
material document defect with respect to the documents delivered by Initial Note A-1 Holder with respect to Lead Securitization
Note upon the consummation of the Lead Securitization. The preceding sentence shall not be construed to grant to any Non-Lead Securitization
Note Holder the benefit of any representation or warranty made by Initial Note A-1 Holder or any document delivery obligation imposed
on Initial Note A-1 Holder under any mortgage loan purchase and sale agreement, instrument of transfer or other document or instrument
that may be executed or delivered by Initial Note A-1 Holder in connection with the Lead Securitization.
(b)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	The administration
of the Mortgage Loan shall be governed by this Agreement and the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement. The servicing of the
Mortgage Loan shall be carried out by the Master Servicer and, if the Mortgage Loan is a Specially
Â 
24
Â 
Â 
Serviced Mortgage Loan (or to
the extent otherwise provided in the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement), by the Special Servicer, in each case pursuant to
the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in accordance with the
Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, the Lead Securitization Note Holder shall cause the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer
to service and administer the Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Servicing Standard, taking into account the interests of both
Note Holders as a collective whole. The Note Holders agree to be bound by the terms of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement.
All rights and obligations of the Lead Securitization Note Holder described hereunder may be exercised by the Master Servicer,
the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator and/or the Trustee on behalf of the Lead Securitization Note Holder. The Lead
Securitization Servicing Agreement shall not be amended in any manner that may adversely affect any Non-Lead Securitization Note
Holder in its capacity as Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder. Each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder (unless it is the same
Person as or an Affiliate of the Mortgage Loan Borrower) shall be a third-party beneficiary to the Lead Securitization Servicing
Agreement with respect to their rights as specifically provided for therein.
(c)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Controlling
Note Holder (or its Controlling Note Holder Representative) shall have, with respect to the Mortgage Loan, all of the same rights
and powers of the Lead Securitization Subordinate Class Representative under the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement with respect
to the other mortgage loans included in the Lead Securitization, without limitation, the right to consent and/or consult regarding
Major Decisions and other servicing matters, the right to advise (1) the Special Servicer with respect to all Specially Serviced
Loans and (2) the Special Servicer with respect to non-Specially Serviced Loans as to all matters for which the Master Servicer
must obtain the consent or deemed consent of the Special Servicer, and the right to direct the Special Servicer to take, or to
refrain from taking, such other actions with respect to the Mortgage Loan as the Lead Securitization Subordinate Class Representative
may deem advisable or as to which provision is otherwise made therein, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the
Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement (including the Servicing Standard).
(d)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Lead Securitization Note Holder (or the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer acting on its behalf)
shall be required (i) to provide copies of any notice, information and report that it is required to provide to the Lead
Securitization Subordinate Class Representative pursuant to the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement with respect to any
Major Decisions or the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an Asset Status Report relating to the Mortgage
Loan, to each Non-Controlling Note Holder (or its Non-Controlling Note Holder Representative), within the same time frame it
is required to provide to the Lead Securitization Subordinate Class Representative (for this purpose, without regard to
whether such items are actually required to be provided to the Lead Securitization Subordinate Class Representative under the
Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement due to the occurrence of a Control Termination Event or a Consultation Termination
Event) and (ii) to consult with each Non-Controlling Note Holder (or its Non-Controlling Note Holder Representative) on a
strictly non-binding basis, to the extent having received such notices, information and reports, such Non-Controlling Note
Holder (or its Non-Controlling Note Holder Representative) requests consultation with respect to any such Major Decisions or
the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an Asset Status

Â 
25
Â 
Â 
Report relating to the Mortgage Loan, and consider alternative actions recommended by each Non-Controlling Note Holder (or its
Non-Controlling Note Holder Representative); provided that after the expiration of a period of ten (10) Business Days from
the delivery to each Non-Controlling Note Holder (or its Non-Controlling Note Holder Representative) by the Lead Securitization
Note Holder of written notice of a proposed action, together with copies of the notice, information and report required to be provided
to the Lead Securitization Subordinate Class Representative, the Lead Securitization Note Holder (or the Master Servicer or the
Special Servicer acting on its behalf) shall no longer be obligated to consult with such Non-Controlling Note Holder (or its Non-Controlling
Note Holder Representative), whether or not such Non-Controlling Note Holder (or its Non-Controlling Note Holder Representative)
has responded within such ten (10) Business Day period (unless, the Lead Securitization Note Holder (or the Master Servicer or
the Special Servicer acting on its behalf) proposes a new course of action that is materially different from the action previously
proposed, in which case such ten (10) Business Day period shall be deemed to begin anew from the date of such proposal and delivery
of all information relating thereto). Notwithstanding the consultation rights of each Non-Controlling Note Holder (or its Non-Controlling
Note Holder Representative) set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the Lead Securitization Note Holder (or Servicer or
Special Servicer, acting on its behalf) may make any Major Decision or take any action set forth in the Asset Status Report before
the expiration of the aforementioned ten (10) Business Day period if the Lead Securitization Note Holder (or Master Servicer or
Special Servicer, as applicable) determines that immediate action with respect thereto is necessary to protect the interests of
the Note Holders. In no event shall the Lead Securitization Note Holder (or Servicer or Special Servicer, acting on its behalf)
be obligated at any time to follow or take any alternative actions recommended by each Non-Controlling Note Holder (or its Non-Controlling
Note Holder Representative).
Â 
In addition to the
consultation rights of each Non-Controlling Note Holder (or its Non-Controlling Note Holder Representative) provided in the immediately
preceding paragraph, each Non-Controlling Note Holder shall have the right to attend annual meetings (either telephonically or
in person, in the discretion of the Servicer) with the Lead Securitization Note Holder (or the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer
acting on its behalf) at the offices of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, upon reasonable notice and
at times reasonably acceptable to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, in which servicing issues related
to the Mortgage Loan are discussed.
(e)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â If any
Note is included as an asset of a real estate mortgage investment conduit (a âREMICâ), within the meaning of
Section 860D(a) of the Code, then, any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding: (i) the Mortgage Loan shall
be administered such that the Notes shall qualify at all times as (or as interests in) a âqualified mortgageâ within
the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, (ii) any real property (and related personal property) acquired by or on behalf
of the Note Holders pursuant to a foreclosure, exercise of a power of sale or delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure of the
Mortgage or lien on such property following a default on the Mortgage Loan shall be administered so that the interest of the pro
rata share of each Note Holder therein shall at all times qualify as âforeclosure propertyâ within the meaning
of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code and (iii) no Servicer may modify, waive or amend any provision of the Mortgage Loan, consent
to or withhold consent from any action of the Mortgage Loan Borrower, or exercise or refrain from exercising any
Â 
26
Â 
Â 
powers or rights
which the Note Holders may have under the Mortgage Loan Documents, if any such action would constitute a âsignificant modificationâ
of the Mortgage Loan, within the meaning of Section 1.860G-2(b) of the regulations of the United States Department of the Treasury,
more than three (3) months after the startup day of the REMIC which includes the Notes (or any portion thereof). Each Note Holder
agrees that the provisions of this paragraph shall be effected by compliance with any REMIC provisions in the Lead Securitization
Servicing Agreement relating to the administration of the Mortgage Loan.
Â 
Anything herein or
in the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that one of the Notes is included
in a REMIC and the other is not, such other Note Holder shall not be required to reimburse such Note Holder or any other Person
for payment of (i) any taxes imposed on such REMIC, (ii) any costs or expenses relating to the administration of such REMIC or
to any determination respecting the amount, payment or avoidance of any tax under such REMIC or (iii) any advances for any of the
foregoing or any interest thereon or for deficits in other items of disbursement or income resulting from the use of funds for
payment of any such taxes, costs or expenses or advances, nor shall any disbursement or payment otherwise distributable to the
other Note Holder be reduced to offset or make-up any such payment or deficit.
Â 
Section 6.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Appointment
of Controlling Note Holder Representative and Non-Controlling Note Holder Representative.
(a)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	The Controlling
Note Holder shall have the right at any time to appoint a representative in connection with the exercise of its rights and obligations
with respect to the Mortgage Loan (the âControlling Note Holder Representativeâ). The Controlling Note Holder
shall have the right in its sole discretion at any time and from time to time to remove and replace the Controlling Note Holder
Representative. When exercising its various rights under Section 5 and elsewhere in this Agreement, the Controlling Note Holder
may, at its option, in each case, act through the Controlling Note Holder Representative. The Controlling Note Holder Representative
may be any Person (other than the Mortgage Loan Borrower, its principal or any Affiliate of the Mortgage Loan Borrower), including,
without limitation, the Controlling Note Holder, any officer or employee of the Controlling Note Holder, any affiliate of the Controlling
Note Holder or any other unrelated third party. No such Controlling Note Holder Representative shall owe any fiduciary duty or
other duty to any other Person (other than the Controlling Note Holder). All actions that are permitted to be taken by the Controlling
Note Holder under this Agreement may be taken by the Controlling Note Holder Representative acting on behalf of the Controlling
Note Holder. No Servicer, Operating Advisor, Trustee or Certificate Administrator acting on behalf of the Lead Securitization Note
Holder shall be required to recognize any Person as a Controlling Note Holder Representative until the Controlling Note Holder
has notified each Servicer, Operating Advisor, Trustee and Certificate Administrator of such appointment and, if the Controlling
Note Holder Representative is not the same Person as the Controlling Note Holder, the Controlling Note Holder Representative provides
each Servicer, Operating Advisor, Trustee and Certificate Administrator with written confirmation of its acceptance of such appointment,
an address and facsimile number for the delivery of notices and other correspondence and a list of officers or employees of such
person with whom the parties to this Agreement may deal (including their names, titles, work addresses and facsimile numbers).
The Controlling Note Holder shall promptly deliver such
Â 
27
Â 
Â 
information to each Servicer, Operating Advisor, Trustee and Certificate
Administrator. So long as no Consultation Termination Event (including any such deemed event) is in effect pursuant to the terms
of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, the Controlling Note Holder Representative shall be the Lead Securitization Subordinate
Class Representative.
(b)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Neither
the Controlling Note Holder Representative nor the Controlling Note Holder will have any liability to the other Note Holders or
any other Person for any action taken, or for refraining from the taking of any action or the giving of any consent or the failure
to give any consent pursuant to this Agreement or the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, or errors in judgment, absent any
loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence. The Note Holders agree
that the Controlling Note Holder Representative and the Controlling Note Holder (whether acting in place of the Controlling Note
Holder Representative when no Controlling Note Holder Representative shall have been appointed hereunder or otherwise exercising
any right, power or privilege granted to the Controlling Note Holder hereunder) may take or refrain from taking actions, or give
or refrain from giving consents, that favor the interests of one Note Holder over the other Note Holder, and that the Controlling
Note Holder Representative may have special relationships and interests that conflict with the interests of a Note Holder and,
absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the Controlling Note Holder Representative or the Controlling
Note Holder, as the case may be, agree to take no action against the Controlling Note Holder Representative, the Controlling Note
Holder or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, principals or agents as a result of such special relationships
or interests, and that neither the Controlling Note Holder Representative nor the Controlling Note Holder will be deemed to have
been grossly negligent or reckless, or to have acted in bad faith or engaged in willful misfeasance or to have recklessly disregarded
any exercise of its rights by reason of its having acted or refrained from acting, or having given any consent or having failed
to give any consent, solely in the interests of any Note Holder.
(c)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Each Non-Controlling
Note Holder shall have the right at any time to appoint a representative in connection with the exercise of its rights and obligations
with respect to the Mortgage Loan (each, a âNon-Controlling Note Holder Representativeâ). All of the provisions
relating to Controlling Note Holder and the Controlling Note Holder Representative set forth in Section 6(a) (except those contained
in the last sentence thereof) and Section 6(b) shall apply to each Non-Controlling Note Holder and its Non-Controlling Note Holder
Representative mutatis mutandis. The Non-Controlling Note Holder Representative, with respect to Note A-2 and Note A-3,
as of the date of this Agreement and until the Lead Securitization Note Holder (and the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer)
is notified otherwise, shall be the Initial Note A-2 Holder and the Initial Note A-3 Holder, respectively.
Â 
Section 7.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Appointment
of Special Servicer.Â Â The Controlling Note Holder (or its Controlling Note Holder Representative) shall have the right at any
time and from time to time, with or without cause, to replace the Special Servicer then acting with respect to the Mortgage Loan
and appoint a replacement Special Servicer in lieu thereof. Any designation by Controlling Note Holder (or its Controlling Note
Holder Representative) of a Person to serve as Special Servicer shall be made by delivering to the other Note Holder, the Master
Servicer, the then existing Special Servicer and other parties to the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement a written notice
stating such designation and satisfying the other conditions to such replacement as
Â 

28
Â 
Â 
set forth in the Lead Securitization Servicing
Agreement (including, without limitation, a Rating Agency Confirmation, if required by the terms of the Lead Securitization Servicing
Agreement), if any. The Controlling Note Holder shall be solely responsible for any expenses incurred in connection with any such
replacement without cause. The Controlling Note Holder shall notify the other parties hereto of its termination of the then currently
serving Special Servicer and its appointment of a replacement Special Servicer in accordance with this Section 7. If the Controlling
Note Holder has not appointed a Special Servicer with respect to the Mortgage Loan as of the consummation of the securitization
under the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, then the initial Special Servicer designated in the Lead Securitization Servicing
Agreement shall serve as the initial Special Servicer but this shall not limit the right of the Controlling Note Holder (or its
Controlling Note Holder Representative) to designate a replacement Special Servicer for the Mortgage Loan as aforesaid. If a Servicer
Termination Event on the part of the Special Servicer has occurred that affects any Non-Controlling Note Holder, such Non-Controlling
Note Holder shall have the right to direct the Trustee (or at any time that the Mortgage Loan is no longer included in a Securitization
Trust, the Controlling Note Holder) to terminate the Special Servicer under the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement (or at
any time that the Mortgage Loan is no longer subject to the provisions of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, the successor
servicing agreement pursuant to which the Mortgage Loan is being serviced) solely with respect to the Mortgage Loan pursuant to
and in accordance with the terms of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement (or at any time that the Mortgage Loan is no longer
subject to the provisions of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, the successor servicing agreement pursuant to which
the Mortgage Loan is being serviced). The Controlling Note Holder and each Non-Controlling Note Holder acknowledge and agree that
any successor special servicer appointed to replace the Special Servicer with respect to the Mortgage Loan that was terminated
for cause at the Non-Controlling Note Holderâs direction cannot at any time be the person (or an Affiliate thereof) that
was so terminated without the prior written consent of such Non-Controlling Note Holder. In connection with such termination and
appointment, the related Non-Controlling Note Holder shall be solely responsible for reimbursing the Trusteeâs or the Controlling
Note Holderâs, as applicable, costs and expenses, if not paid within a reasonable time by the terminated special servicer
and, in the case of the Trustee, that would otherwise be reimbursed to the Trustee from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account.

Section 8.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Payment
Procedure.
(a)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Lead
Securitization Note Holder, in accordance with the priorities set forth in Section 3 and subject to the terms of the Lead Securitization
Servicing Agreement, will deposit or cause to be deposited all payments allocable to the Notes to the Whole Loan Custodial Account
pursuant to and in accordance with the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement. The Lead Securitization Note Holder (or the Master
Servicer acting on its behalf) shall deposit such amounts to the applicable account within two Business Days after receipt of properly
identified funds by the Lead Securitization Note Holder (or the Master Servicer acting on its behalf) from or on behalf of the
Mortgage Loan Borrower.
(b)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â If the
Lead Securitization Note Holder determines, or a court of competent jurisdiction orders, at any time that any amount received or
collected in respect of any Note must, pursuant to any insolvency, bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance, preference or similar law,
be returned to the Mortgage Loan Borrower or paid to the Lead Securitization Note
Â 
29
Â 
Â 
Holder, any Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder
or any Servicer or paid to any other Person, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Lead Securitization
Note Holder shall not be required to distribute any portion thereof to the Non-Lead Securitization Note Holders and the Non-Lead
Securitization Note Holders will promptly on demand by the Lead Securitization Note Holder repay to the Lead Securitization Note
Holder any portion thereof that the Lead Securitization Note Holder shall have theretofore distributed to the Non-Lead Securitization
Note Holders, together with interest thereon at such rate, if any, as the Lead Securitization Note Holder shall have been required
to pay to any Mortgage Loan Borrower, Master Servicer, Special Servicer or such other Person with respect thereto.
(c)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â If, for
any reason, the Lead Securitization Note Holder makes any payment to a Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder before the Lead Securitization
Note Holder has received the corresponding payment (it being understood that the Lead Securitization Note Holder is under no obligation
to do so), and the Lead Securitization Note Holder does not receive the corresponding payment within five (5) Business Days of
its payment to such Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder, such Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder shall, at the Lead Securitization
Note Holderâs request, promptly return that payment to the Lead Securitization Note Holder.
(d)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Each Note
Holder agrees that if at any time it shall receive from any sources whatsoever any payment on account of the Mortgage Loan in excess
of its distributable share thereof, it shall promptly remit such excess to the applicable Note Holder, subject to this Agreement
and the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement. The Lead Securitization Note Holder shall have the right to offset any amounts
due hereunder from a Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder with respect to the Mortgage Loan against any future payments due to such
Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder under the Mortgage Loan. Such Non-Lead Securitization Note Holderâs obligations under
this Section 8 constitute absolute, unconditional and continuing obligations.
Â 
Section 9.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Limitation
on Liability of the Note Holders.Â Â Each Note Holder shall have no liability to the other Note Holder with respect to its Note
except with respect to losses actually suffered due to the gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement on
the part of such Note Holder.
Â 
The Note Holders acknowledge
that, subject to the obligation of the Lead Securitization Note Holder (including any Servicer and the Trustee) to comply with,
and except as otherwise required by, the Servicing Standard, the Lead Securitization Note Holder (including any Servicer and the
Trustee) may exercise, or omit to exercise, any rights that the Lead Securitization Note Holder may have under the Lead Securitization
Servicing Agreement in a manner that may be adverse to the interests of a Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder and that the Lead
Securitization Note Holder (including any Servicer and the Trustee) shall have no liability whatsoever to any Non-Lead Securitization
Note Holder in connection with the Lead Securitization Note Holderâs exercise of rights or any omission by the Lead Securitization
Note Holder to exercise such rights other than as described above; provided, however, that the Servicer must act
in accordance with the Servicing Standard.
Â

Â 
Â 
Section 10.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Bankruptcy.Â Â Subject
to Section 5(c), each Note Holder hereby covenants and agrees that only the Lead Securitization Note Holder has the right to institute,
file, commence, acquiesce, petition under Bankruptcy Code Section 303 or otherwise or join any Person in any such petition or
otherwise invoke or cause any other Person to invoke an Insolvency Proceeding with respect to or against the Mortgage Loan Borrower
or seek to appoint a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian, sequestrator or other similar official with respect to
the Mortgage Loan Borrower or all or any part of its property or assets or ordering the winding-up or liquidation of the affairs
of the Mortgage Loan Borrower. Each Note Holder further agrees that only the Lead Securitization Note Holder, and not the Non-Lead
Securitization Note Holders, can make any election, give any consent, commence any action or file any motion, claim, obligation,
notice or application or take any other action in any case by or against the Mortgage Loan Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code
or in any other Insolvency Proceeding. The Note Holders hereby appoint the Lead Securitization Note Holder as their agent, and
grant to the Lead Securitization Note Holder an irrevocable power of attorney coupled with an interest, and their proxy, for the
purpose of exercising any and all rights and taking any and all actions available to any Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder in
connection with any case by or against the Mortgage Loan Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code or in any other Insolvency Proceeding,
including, without limitation, the right to file and/or prosecute any claim, vote to accept or reject a plan, to make any election
under Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Mortgage Loan, and to file a motion to modify, lift or terminate
the automatic stay with respect to the Mortgage Loan. The Note Holders hereby agree that, upon the request of the Lead Securitization
Note Holder, each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Lead Securitization Note Holder
all and every such further deeds, conveyances and instruments as the Lead Securitization Note Holder may reasonably request for
the better assuring and evidencing of the foregoing appointment and grant. All actions taken by the Servicer in connection with
any Insolvency Proceeding are subject to and must be in accordance with the Servicing Standard.
Â 
Section 11.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Representations
of the Note Holders.Â Â Each Note Holder represents and warrants that the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
is within its corporate powers, has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and does not contravene such Note
Holderâs charter or any law or contractual restriction binding upon such Note Holder, and that this Agreement is the legal,
valid and binding obligation of such Note Holder enforceable against such Note Holder in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement
of creditorsâ rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law), and except that the enforcement of rights with respect to indemnification and contribution
obligations may be limited by applicable law. Each Note Holder represents and warrants that it is duly organized, validly existing,
in good standing and in possession of all licenses and authorizations necessary to carry on its business. Each Note Holder represents
and warrants that (a) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Note Holder, (b) to such Note Holderâs
actual knowledge, all consents, approvals, authorizations, orders or filings of or with any court or governmental agency or body,
if any, required for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such Note Holder have been obtained or made
and (c) to such Note Holderâs actual knowledge, there is no pending action, suit or proceeding, arbitration or
Â 

31
Â 
Â 
governmental
investigation against such Note Holder, an adverse outcome of which would materially and adversely affect its performance under
this Agreement.
Â 
Section 12.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	No
Creation of a Partnership or Exclusive Purchase Right.Â Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant hereto
shall be deemed to constitute the relationship created hereby between the Note Holders as a partnership, association, joint venture
or other entity. Neither Note Holder shall have any obligation whatsoever to offer to the other Note Holder the opportunity to
purchase a participation interest in any future loans originated by such Note Holder or its Affiliates and if either Note Holder
chooses to offer to the other Note Holder the opportunity to purchase a participation interest in any future mortgage loans originated
by such Note Holder or its Affiliates, such offer shall be at such purchase price and interest rate as such Note Holder chooses,
in its sole and absolute discretion. Neither Note Holder shall have any obligation whatsoever to purchase from the other Note
Holder a participation interest in any future loans originated by such Note Holder or its Affiliates.
Â 
Section 13.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Other
Business Activities of the Note Holders.Â Each Note Holder acknowledges that the other Note Holder or its Affiliates may make
loans or otherwise extend credit to, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Mortgage Loan Borrower or any Affiliate
thereof, any entity that is a holder of debt secured by direct or indirect ownership interests in the Mortgage Loan Borrower or
any entity that is a holder of a preferred equity interest in the Mortgage Loan Borrower (each, a âMortgage Loan Borrower
Related Partyâ), and receive payments on such other loans or extensions of credit to Mortgage Loan Borrower Related
Parties and otherwise act with respect thereto freely and without accountability in the same manner as if this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby were not in effect.
Â 
Section 14.	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Sale
of the Notes.
(a)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Each Note
Holder agrees that it will not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, syndicate, hypothecate, contribute, encumber or otherwise dispose
of all or any portion of its respective Note (a âTransferâ) except to a Qualified Institutional Lender. Promptly
after the Transfer, the non-transferring Note Holder shall be provided with (x) a representation from a transferee or the applicable
Note Holder certifying that such transferee is a Qualified Institutional Lender (except in the case of a Transfer to a Securitization
(and the related pooling and servicing or similar agreement requires the parties thereto to comply with this Agreement) or in accordance
with the immediately following sentence) and (y) a copy of the assignment and assumption agreement referred to in Section 15. If
a Note Holder intends to Transfer its respective Note, or any portion thereof, to an entity that is not a Qualified Institutional
Lender, it must first obtain consent of the non-transferring Note Holder and, if such non-transferring Note Holderâs Note
is held in a Securitization Trust, a confirmation in writing from each Rating Agency that such Transfer will not result in a qualification,
downgrade or withdrawal of its then current rating of the securities issued pursuant to the related Securitization. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, without the non-transferring Note Holderâs prior consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld), and, if
such non-transferring Note Holderâs Note is held in a Securitization Trust, without a confirmation in writing from each Rating
Agency that such Transfer will not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of its then current rating of the securities
issued pursuant to the related Securitization, no Note Holder shall Transfer all or any portion of its Note (or a participation
interest in such Note) to the Mortgage Loan Borrower
Â 
32
Â 
Â 
or a Mortgage Loan Borrower Related Party and any such Transfer shall be absolutely
null and void and shall vest no rights in the purported transferee. The transferring Note Holder agrees that it will pay the expenses
of the non-transferring Note Holder (including all expenses of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee) and all
expenses relating to the confirmation from the Rating Agencies in connection with any such Transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each Note Holder shall have the right, without the need to obtain the consent of the other Note Holder, the Rating Agencies or
any other Person, to Transfer 49% or less (in the aggregate) of its Note or any beneficial interest in its Note. None of the provisions
of this Section 14(a) shall apply in the case of (1) a sale of Note A-1 together with Note A-2 and Note A-3 in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement or (2) a transfer by the Special Servicer, in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, of the Mortgage Loan or the Mortgaged Property, upon
the Mortgage Loan becoming a Defaulted Loan, to a single member limited liability or limited partnership, 100% of the equity interest
in which is owned directly or indirectly, through one or more single member limited liability companies or limited partnerships,
by the Lead Securitization Trust.
Â 
For the purposes of
this Agreement, if any Rating Agency shall, in writing, waive, decline or refuse to review or otherwise engage any request for
a confirmation hereunder from such Rating Agency that a proposed action will not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal
of its then current rating of the securities issued pursuant to the related Securitization, such waiver, declination, or refusal
shall be deemed to eliminate, for such request only, the condition that such confirmation by such Rating Agency (only) be obtained
for purposes of this Agreement. For purposes of clarity, any such waiver, declination or refusal to review or otherwise engage
in any request for such confirmation hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver, declination or refusal to review or otherwise engage
in any subsequent request for such Rating Agency confirmation hereunder and the condition for such Rating Agency confirmation pursuant
to this Agreement for any subsequent request shall apply regardless of any previous waiver, declination or refusal to review or
otherwise engage in such prior request.
(b)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	In the
case of any Transfer of a participation interest in any of the Notes, (i) the respective Note Holdersâ obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Note Holders shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations,
and (iii) the Lead Securitization Note Holder and any Persons acting on its behalf shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Note Holder in connection with such Note Holderâs rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Lead Securitization
Servicing Agreement, and all amounts payable hereunder shall be determined as if such Note Holder had not sold such participation
interest.
(c)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Notwithstanding
any other provision hereof, any Note Holder may pledge (a âPledgeâ) its Note to any entity (other than the Mortgage
Loan Borrower or any Affiliate thereof) which has extended a credit facility to such Note Holder and that is either a Qualified
Institutional Lender or a financial institution whose long-term unsecured debt is rated at least âAâ (or the equivalent)
or better by each Rating Agency (a âNote Pledgeeâ), on terms and conditions set forth in this Section 14(c),
it being further agreed that a financing provided by a Note Pledgee to a Note Holder or any person which Controls such Note that
is secured by its Note and is structured as a repurchase arrangement, shall qualify as a âPledgeâ hereunder,
Â 
33
Â 
Â 
provided
that a Note Pledgee which is not a Qualified Institutional Lender may not take title to the pledged Note without a Rating Agency
Confirmation. Upon written notice by the applicable Note Holder to each other Note Holder and any Servicer that a Pledge has been
effected (including the name and address of the applicable Note Pledgee), such other Note Holder agrees to acknowledge receipt
of such notice and thereafter agrees: (i) to give Note Pledgee written notice of any default by the pledging Note Holder in respect
of its obligations under this Agreement of which default such Note Holder has actual knowledge; (ii) to allow such Note Pledgee
a period of ten (10) days to cure a default by the pledging Note Holder in respect of its obligations to such other Note Holder
hereunder, but such Note Pledgee shall not be obligated to cure any such default; (iii) that no amendment, modification, waiver
or termination of this Agreement shall be effective against such Note Pledgee without the written consent of such Note Pledgee,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; (iv) that such other Note Holder shall give to such Note
Pledgee copies of any notice of default under this Agreement simultaneously with the giving of same to the pledging Note Holder;
(v) that such other Note Holder shall deliver to Note Pledgee such estoppel certificate(s) as Note Pledgee shall reasonably request,
provided that any such certificate(s) shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to such other Note Holder; and (vi) that,
upon written notice (a âRedirection Noticeâ) to such other Note Holder and any Servicer by such Note Pledgee
that the pledging Note Holder is in default, beyond any applicable cure periods, under the pledging Note Holderâs obligations
to such Note Pledgee pursuant to the applicable credit agreement between the pledging Note Holder and such Note Pledgee (which
notice need not be joined in or confirmed by the pledging Note Holder), and until such Redirection Notice is withdrawn or rescinded
by such Note Pledgee, Note Pledgee shall be entitled to receive any payments that any Note Holder or Servicer would otherwise be
obligated to pay to the pledging Note Holder from time to time pursuant to this Agreement or the Lead Securitization Servicing
Agreement. Any pledging Note Holder hereby unconditionally and absolutely releases the other Note Holder and any Servicer from
any liability to the pledging Note Holder on account of such other Note Holderâs or Servicerâs compliance with any
Redirection Notice believed by any Servicer or such other Note Holder to have been delivered by a Note Pledgee. Note Pledgee shall
be permitted to exercise fully its rights and remedies against the pledging Note Holder to such Note Pledgee (and accept an assignment
in lieu of foreclosure as to such collateral), in accordance with applicable law and this Agreement. In such event, the Note Holders
and any Servicer shall recognize such Note Pledgee (and any transferee other than the Mortgage Loan Borrower or any Affiliate thereof
which is also a Qualified Institutional Lender at any foreclosure or similar sale held by such Note Pledgee or any transfer in
lieu of foreclosure), and its successor and assigns, as the successor to the pledging Note Holderâs rights, remedies and
obligations under this Agreement, and any such Note Pledgee or Qualified Institutional Lender shall assume in writing the obligations
of the pledging Note Holder hereunder accruing from and after such Transfer (i.e., realization upon the collateral by such
Note Pledgee) and agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The rights of a Note Pledgee under this Section
14(c) shall remain effective as to any Note Holder (and any Servicer) unless and until such Note Pledgee shall have notified any
such Note Holder (and any Servicer, as applicable) in writing that its interest in the pledged Note has terminated.
(d)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Notwithstanding
any provisions herein to the contrary, if a conduit (âConduitâ) which is not a Qualified Institutional Lender
provides financing to a Note Holder then such Note Holder shall have the right to grant a security interest in its Note to such
Â 
34
Â 
Â 
Conduit notwithstanding that such Conduit is not a Qualified Institutional Lender, if the following conditions are satisfied:
(i)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The
loan (the âConduit Inventory Loanâ) made by the Conduit to such Note Holder to finance the acquisition and holding
of its Note requires a third party (the âConduit Credit Enhancerâ) to provide credit enhancement;
(ii)Â Â Â Â Â 	The
Conduit Credit Enhancer is a Qualified Institutional Lender;
(iii)Â Â Â 
	Such Note Holder pledges its interest in its Note to the Conduit as collateral for the Conduit Inventory Loan;
(iv)Â Â Â Â 	The
Conduit Credit Enhancer and the Conduit agree that, if such Note Holder defaults under the Conduit Inventory Loan, or if the Conduit
is unable to refinance its outstanding commercial paper even if there is no default by such Note Holder, the Conduit Credit Enhancer
will purchase the Conduit Inventory Loan from the Conduit, and the Conduit will assign the pledge of such Note Holderâs Note
to the Conduit Credit Enhancer; and
(v)	Â Â Â Â Unless
the Conduit is in fact then a Qualified Institutional Lender, the Conduit will not without obtaining a Rating Agency Confirmation
from each Rating Agency have any greater right to acquire the interests in the Note pledged by such Note Holder, by foreclosure
or otherwise, than would any other purchaser that is not a Qualified Institutional Lender at a foreclosure sale conducted by a
Note Pledgee.
Â 
Section 15.	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Registration
of the Notes and Each Note Holder.Â The Agent shall keep or cause to be kept at the Agent Office books (the âNote Registerâ)
for the registration and transfer of the Notes. The Agent shall serve as the initial note registrar and the Agent hereby accepts
such appointment. The names and addresses of the holders of the Notes and the names and addresses of any transferee of any Note
of which the Agent has received notice, in the form of a copy of the assignment and assumption agreement referred to in this Section
15, shall be registered in the Note Register. The Person in whose name a Note Holder is so registered shall be deemed and treated
as the sole owner and holder thereof for all purposes of this Agreement. Upon request of a Note Holder, the Agent shall provide
such party with the names and addresses of the other Note Holder. To the extent the Trustee or another party is appointed as Agent
hereunder, each Note Holder hereby designates such person as its agent under this Section 15 solely for purposes of maintaining
the Note Register.
Â 
In connection with
any Transfer of a Note (but excluding any Pledgee unless and until it realizes on its Pledge), a transferee shall execute an assignment
and assumption agreement (unless the transferee is a Securitization Trust and the related pooling and servicing agreement
requires the parties thereto to comply with this Agreement), whereby such transferee assumes all of the obligations of the applicable
Note Holder hereunder with respect to such Note thereafter accruing and agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, including
the applicable restriction on Transfers set forth in Section 14, from and after the date of such assignment. No transfer of a Note
may be made unless it is registered on the Note Register, and the Agent shall not recognize any attempted or purported transfer
of any Note in violation of the
Â 

35
Â 
Â 
provisions of Section 14 and this Section 15. Any such purported transfer shall be absolutely null
and void and shall vest no rights in the purported transferee. Each Note Holder desiring to effect such transfer shall, and does
hereby agree to, indemnify the Agent and the other Note Holder against any liability that may result if the transfer is not made
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
Â 
Section 16.	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Governing

(b)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â CONSENTS
THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE BROUGHT IN SUCH COURTS AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WAIVES ANY OBJECTION THAT
IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING
WAS BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT COURT AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM THE SAME;
(c)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	AGREES
THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE EFFECTED BY MAILING A COPY THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL

THAT NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT TO EFFECT SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR SHALL LIMIT THE
RIGHT TO SUE IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

Agreement shall not be modified, cancelled or terminated except by an instrument in writing signed by the Note A-1 Holder, the
Note A-2 Holder and the Note A-3 Holder. Additionally, for as long as any Note is contained in a Securitization Trust, the Note
Holders shall not amend or modify this Agreement without first receiving a written confirmation from each Rating Agency that such
amendment or modification will not result in a qualification, withdrawal or downgrade of its then current ratings of the securities
issued in connection with a Securitization; provided that no such confirmation from the Rating Agencies shall be required
in connection with a modification or amendment (i) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provisions herein that
may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions herein or with the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, (ii) entered
into pursuant to Section 32 of this Agreement or (iii) to correct or supplement any provision herein that may be defective or

Upon any such assignment, the assignee shall be entitled to all rights and benefits of the applicable Note Holder hereunder.

possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable laws, such provision shall be ineffective

Â 
Section 24.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Withholding
Taxes.Â Â (a) If the Lead Securitization Note Holder or the Mortgage Loan Borrower shall be required by law to deduct and withhold
Taxes from interest, fees or other amounts payable to any Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder with respect to the Mortgage Loan
as a result of such Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder constituting a Non-Exempt Person, the Lead Securitization Note Holder,
in its capacity as servicer, shall be entitled to do so with respect to such Non-Lead Securitization Note Holderâs interest
in such payment (all withheld amounts being deemed paid to such Note Holder), provided that the Lead Securitization Note
Holder shall furnish such Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder with a statement setting forth the amount of Taxes withheld, the
applicable rate and other information which may reasonably be requested for purposes of assisting such Note Holder to seek any
allowable credits or deductions for the Taxes so withheld in each jurisdiction in which such Note Holder is subject to tax.
(b)	Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Each Non-Lead
Securitization Note Holder shall and hereby agrees to indemnify the Lead Securitization Note Holder against and hold the Lead Securitization
Note Holder harmless from and against any Taxes, interest, penalties and attorneysâ fees and disbursements arising or resulting
from any failure of the Lead Securitization Note Holder to withhold Taxes from payment made to such Non-Lead Securitization Note
Holder in reliance upon any representation, certificate, statement, document or instrument made or provided by such Non-Lead Securitization
Note Holder to the Lead Securitization Note Holder in connection with the obligation of the Lead Securitization Note Holder to
withhold Taxes from payments made to such Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder, it being expressly understood and agreed that (i)
the Lead Securitization Note Holder shall be absolutely and unconditionally entitled to accept any such representation, certificate,
statement, document or instrument as being true and correct in all respects and to fully rely thereon without any obligation or
responsibility to investigate or to make any inquiries with respect to the accuracy, veracity, correctness or validity of the same
and (ii) each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder, upon request of the Lead Securitization Note Holder and at its sole cost and
expense, shall defend any claim or action relating to the foregoing indemnification using counsel selected by the Lead Securitization
Note Holder.
(c)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Each
Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder represents to the Lead Securitization Note Holder (for the benefit of the Mortgage Loan
Borrower) that it is not a Non-Exempt Person and that neither the Lead Securitization Note Holder nor the Mortgage Loan
Borrower is obligated under applicable law to withhold Taxes on sums paid to it with respect to the Mortgage Loan or
otherwise pursuant to this Agreement. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement and from time to time as
necessary during the term of this Agreement, each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder shall deliver to the Lead
Securitization Note Holder or Servicer, as applicable, evidence satisfactory to the Lead Securitization Note Holder
substantiating that such Note Holder is not a Non-Exempt Person and that the Lead Securitization Note Holder is not obligated
under applicable law to withhold Taxes on sums paid to it with respect to the Mortgage Loan or otherwise under this
Agreement. Without limiting the effect of the foregoing, (i) if a Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder is created or organized
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, it shall satisfy the requirements of the
preceding sentence by furnishing to the Lead Securitization Note Holder an Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 and (ii) if a
Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder is not created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or
the

Â 
38
Â 
Â 
District of Columbia, and if the payment of interest or other amounts by the Mortgage Loan Borrower is treated for United States
income tax purposes as derived in whole or part from sources within the United States, such Note Holder shall satisfy the requirements
of the preceding sentence by furnishing to the Lead Securitization Note Holder Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Form W-8IMY
(with appropriate attachments) or Form W-8BEN, or successor forms, as may be required from time to time, duly executed by such
Note Holder, as evidence of such Note Holderâs exemption from the withholding of United States tax with respect thereto.
The Lead Securitization Note Holder shall not be obligated to make any payment hereunder with respect to any Non-Lead Securitization
Note or otherwise until the related Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder shall have furnished to the Lead Securitization Note Holder
requested forms, certificates, statements or documents.
Â 
Section 25.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Custody
of Mortgage Loan Documents.Â Â The originals of all of the Mortgage Loan Documents (other than the Non-Lead Securitization Notes)
(a) prior to the Lead Securitization will be held by the Initial Agent and (b) after the Lead Securitization, will be held by
the Lead Securitization Note Holder (in the name of the Trustee and held by a duly appointed custodian therefor in accordance
with the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement), in each case, on behalf of the registered holders of the Notes.
Â 
Section 26.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Cooperation
in Securitization.
(a)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Each Note
Holder acknowledges that any Note Holder may elect, in its sole discretion, to include its Note in a Securitization. In connection
with a Securitization and subject to the terms of the preceding sentence, at the request of the Lead Securitization Note Holder,
each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder shall use reasonable efforts, at Lead Securitization Note Holderâs expense, to satisfy,
and to cooperate with the Lead Securitization Note Holder in attempting to cause the Mortgage Loan Borrower to satisfy, the market
standards to which the Lead Securitization Note Holder customarily adheres or which may be reasonably required in the marketplace
or by the Rating Agencies in connection with the Securitization, including, entering into (or consenting to, as applicable) any
modifications to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loan Documents and to cooperate with the Lead Securitization Note Holder in attempting
to cause the Mortgage Loan Borrower to execute such modifications to the Mortgage Loan Documents, in any such case, as may be reasonably
requested by the Rating Agencies to effect the Securitization; provided, however, that either in connection with
the Lead Securitization or otherwise at any time prior to the Lead Securitization, the Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder shall
be required to modify or amend this Agreement or any Mortgage Loan Documents (or consent to such modification, as applicable) in
connection therewith, if such modification or amendment would (i) change the interest allocable to, or the amount of any payments
due to or priority of such payments to, such Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder or (ii) materially increase such Non-Lead Securitization
Note Holdersâ obligations or materially decrease such Non-Lead Securitization Note Holdersâ rights, remedies or protections.
In connection with the Lead Securitization, each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder agrees to provide for inclusion in any disclosure
document relating to the Lead Securitization such information concerning the related Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder and the
related Non-Lead Securitization Note as the Lead Securitization Note Holder reasonably determines to be necessary or appropriate,
and each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder covenants and agrees that it shall, at the Lead Securitization Note Holderâs
expense,
Â 
39
Â 
Â 
cooperate with the reasonable requests of each Rating Agency and Lead Securitization Note Holder in connection with the
Lead Securitization (including, without limitation, reasonably cooperating with the Lead Securitization Noteholder (without any
obligation to make additional representations and warranties) to enable the Lead Securitization Noteholder to make all necessary
certifications and deliver all necessary opinions (including customary securities law opinions) in connection with the Mortgage
Loan and the Lead Securitization), as well as in connection with all other matters and the preparation of any offering documents
thereof and to review and respond reasonably promptly with respect to any information relating to the related Non-Lead Securitization
Note Holder and the related Non-Lead Securitization Note in any Securitization document. Each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder
acknowledges that the information provided by it to the Lead Securitization Note Holder may be incorporated into the offering documents
for the Lead Securitization. The Lead Securitization Note Holder and each Rating Agency shall be entitled to rely on the information
supplied by, or on behalf of, each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder. The Lead Securitization Note Holder will reasonably cooperate
with each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder by providing all information reasonably requested that is in the Lead Securitization
Note Holderâs possession in connection with each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holdersâ preparation of disclosure materials
in connection with a Securitization.
Â 
Upon request, the
Lead Securitization Note Holder shall deliver to each Non-Lead Securitization Note Holder drafts of the preliminary and final Lead
Securitization offering memoranda, prospectus supplement, free writing prospectus and any other disclosure documents and the Lead
Securitization Servicing Agreement and provide reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such documents.
Â 
Section 27.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	
Notices.Â Â All notices required hereunder shall be given by (i) facsimile transmission (during business hours) if the sender
on the same day sends a confirming copy of such notice by reputable overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), (ii) reputable
overnight delivery service (charges prepaid), (iii) with respect to any addressee of any party to which an electronic email address

Â 
Section 28.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Broker.Â Â Each
Note Holder represents to each other that no broker was responsible for bringing about this transaction.
Â 
Section 29.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Certain
Matters Affecting the Agent.
(a)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	The Agent
may request and/or rely upon and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any officerâs certificate or
assignment and assumption agreement delivered to the Agent pursuant to Section 14 and Section 15;
Â 
40
Â 
Â 
(b)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	The Agent
may consult with counsel and any opinion of counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action
taken or suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such opinion of counsel;
(c)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	The Agent
shall be under no obligation to institute, conduct or defend any litigation hereunder or in relation hereto at the request, order
or direction of any Note Holder pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, unless it has received indemnity reasonably satisfactory
to it;
(d)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	The Agent
or any of its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents or âcontrolâ persons within the meaning of the Act,
shall not be personally liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and reasonably believed by the Agent
to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Agreement;
(e)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	The Agent
shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any officerâs certificate or assignment
and assumption agreement delivered to the Agent pursuant to Section 15;
(f)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	The Agent
may execute any of the powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys but
shall not be relieved of its obligations hereunder; and
(g)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	The Agent
represents and warrants that it is a Qualified Institutional Lender.
Â 
Section 30.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Reserved.
Â 
Section 31.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Resignation
of Agent.Â Â The Agent may resign at any time on ten (10) daysâ prior notice, so long as a successor Agent, reasonably satisfactory
to the Note Holders (it being agreed that a Servicer, the Trustee or a Certificate Administrator in a Securitization is satisfactory
to the Note Holders), has agreed to be bound by this Agreement and perform the duties of the Agent hereunder. GSMC, as Initial
Agent, may transfer its rights and obligations to a Servicer, the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator, as successor Agent,
at any time without the consent of any Note Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Note Holders hereby agree that, simultaneously
with the closing of the Lead Securitization, the Master Servicer shall be deemed to have been automatically appointed as the successor
Agent under this Agreement in place of GSMC without any further notice or other action. The termination or resignation of such
Master Servicer, as Master Servicer under the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement, shall be deemed a termination or resignation
of such Master Servicer as Agent under this Agreement.
Â 
Section 32.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 	Resizing.Â Â Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, for so long as GSMC or an affiliate thereof (a âGSMC Entityâ) is the
owner of a Non-Lead Securitization Note (the âOwned Noteâ), such GSMC Entity shall have the right, subject
to the terms of the Mortgage Loan Documents, to cause the Mortgage Loan Borrower to execute amended and restated notes or additional
notes (in either case, âNew Notesâ) reallocating the principal of such Owned Note to such New Notes; or severing
such Owned Note into one or more further âcomponentâ notes in the aggregate principal amount equal to the then outstanding
principal balance of such Owned Note provided that (i) the aggregate principal balance of all
Â 

41
Â 
Â 
outstanding New Notes following
such amendments is no greater than the aggregate principal of such Owned Note prior to such amendments, (ii) all Notes continue
to have the same weighted average interest rate as the Notes prior to such amendments, (iii) all Notes pay pro rata
and on a pari passu basis and such reallocated or component notes shall be automatically subject to the terms of this
Agreement, (iv) the GSMC Entity holding the New Notes shall notify the Lead Securitization Note Holder, the Master Servicer, the
Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee in writing of such modified allocations and principal amounts,
and (v) the execution of such amendments and New Notes does not violate the Servicing Standard. If the Lead Securitization Note
Holder so requests, the GSMC Entity holding the New Notes (and any subsequent holder of such Notes) shall execute a confirmation
of the continuing applicability of this Agreement to the New Notes, as so modified. Except for the foregoing reallocation and
for modifications pursuant to the Lead Securitization Servicing Agreement (as discussed in Section 5), no Note may be modified
or amended without the consent of its holder and the consent of the holder of the other Note. In connection with the foregoing
(provided the conditions set forth in (i) through (v) above are satisfied, with respect to (i) through (iv), as certified by the
GSMC Entity, on which certification the Master Servicer can rely), the Master Servicer is hereby authorized and directed to execute
amendments to the Mortgage Loan Documents and this Agreement on behalf of any or all of the Note Holders, as applicable, solely
for the purpose of reflecting such reallocation of principal. If more than one New Note is created hereunder, for purposes of
exercising the rights of the Non-Controlling Note Holder hereunder, the âNon-Controlling Note Holderâ of such New
Notes shall be as provided in the definition of such term in this Agreement.

CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
    
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 14 classes of GS Mortgage Securities Trust 
      (GSMS) 2015-GS1 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on the stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral and no material changes to the pools metrics since issuance. 
      As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 0.4% to $817.3 million from $820.6 million 
      at issuance. Currently, there is one specially serviced loan (5.5%). No 
      loans are defeased and all loans are current. There is currently a 
      $25,292 interest shortfall affecting class G related to special 
      servicing fees and a small reimbursement for advance interest. The Fitch 
      debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) at issuance 
      were 1.24x and 102.2%, respectively.
    

      Stable Performance With No Material Changes: All loans in the pool are 
      current as of the September 2016 remittance with property level 
      performance generally in line with issuance expectations with no 
      material changes to pool metrics.
    

      Specially Serviced Loan: The sixth largest loan in the pool, Hammons 
      Hotel Portfolio (5.5% of the pool), transferred to special servicing in 
      August 2016 due to the borrower and parent company filing for Chapter 11 
      bankruptcy. The filing was made in connection with litigation, which was 
      ongoing at issuance, related to a complex deal made in 2005 to 
      reprivatize Hammons Hotels. The hotels and loan are performing better 
      than expected with year-end 2015 NOI across the collateral properties 
      10.6% above bank underwriting. The weighted average RevPAR Penetration 
      for the collateral properties was 138.3% as of the June, 2016 trailing 
      twelve month period. This loan is a non-controlling pari passu loan with 
      the remaining notes securitized in CGCMT 2015-GC33, GSMS 2015-GC34, and 
      CGCMT 2015-GC35.
    

      High Pool Concentration: The top 10 loans comprise 65.6% of the pool, 
      which is much higher than the 2015 and 2014 vintage averages of 49.3% 
      and 50.5%, respectively. It was also noted at issuance that the sponsor 
      and loan concentrations were higher than average for this transaction.
    

      High Quality Collateral: Two properties, 590 Madison and Element LA, 
      were assigned Fitch's highest property quality grade of 'A' (20.8% of 
      the pool) and Deerfield Crossing (3.9% of the pool) was assigned a grade 
      of 'A-'. At issuance the majority of the properties inspected (57.9%) 
      was assigned a property quality grade of 'B+' or 'B'. Only 9.3% of the 
      inspected pool was assigned a property quality of 'B-', indicated below 
      average property quality.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: The largest loan in the pool, 590 
      Madison Avenue (12.2% of the pool), was assigned an investment grade 
      credit opinion at issuance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following classes:
    

      --$25,811,294 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$20,515,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$8,207,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (c) Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ

      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of

      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001

Challenging Retail Environment Weights on REITsMixed economic news is weighing on retail markets, pushing REIT performance down in 2015. This week, the National Retail Federation announced that back-to-school spending is expected to be down 9.3% in 2015. This news came on the heels of a report from the Commerce Department stating that retail sales declined 0.3%...Â 
US REITs Feeling Effects from Turmoil in Greece and ChinaInternational economic forces have taken center stage this week, affecting both US stock markets and REITs. The crash in the Chinese stock market and ongoing concerns about the future of Greece in the eurozone drove markets down during the first half of the week. REITs fared better than the overall market...
What Does Increased Construction Mean for Apartment REITs?REITs so far this year have raised $17.1 billion of capital through the sale of unsecured notes, bringing the total raised over the past two and a half years to just more than $75 billion.
