Joe D Cecil's Experience
Title: Comptroller, International Operations
               Company: Unocal Corp.
Job Details
               Unocal is one of the world's leading independent natural gas and crude oil exploration and production companies. The company's principal operations are located in North America (Gulf of Mexico region, Alaska and Canada) and in Asia (Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar and Bangladesh). The company is also pursuing exploration programs in West Africa and Brazil.
Title: Board Member
               Company: Niocorp Developments Ltd
Job Details
               NioCorp is developing North America's only niobium / scandium / titanium project. Located near Elk Creek, Nebraska, the Elk Creek Project is the highest grade niobium project in North America, as well as the largest prospective producer of scandium in the world. NioCorp is positioned to emerge as the United States' only producer of niobium and scandium. These elements are unique and valuable superalloy materials that are strategic and critical to many industries and national defense technologies. 2015 was a year of extraordinary progress for NioCorp. In the midst of a challenging investment climate for metals projects, NioCorp set itself apart by successfully attracting investment from both retail and institutional investors. As the independent investment analysts at Rodman & Renshaw recently noted:"While commodity markets have been floundering, NioCorp has continued to progress its wholly-owned Elk Creek Project located in Nebraska while keeping a strong treasury… Elk Creek as a rare, strategic asset in a mining friendly jurisdiction." The Company plans to continue its positive momentum into 2016, with the expected issuance of its Elk Creek Feasibility Study, the launch a global effort to secure project capital, and the beginning of construction activities at Elk Creek.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS - Operation Masher (January 24 – March 6, 1966) was the largest search and destroy mission up to that point in the war. Project Delta was selected to reconnoiter the Northern end of the An Lao valley. The operation required insertion of recon teams into the valley but problems plagued the mission.The mission quickly disintegrated. Team one had to abort with one wounded. A woodcutter in the hills spotted Team Two and they were ambushed losing four men and the other two were wounded. According to Homecoming II records, Gray, Hodgson, and Terry successfully evaded the rest of that day and then settled into a hiding place for the night. At first light on 29 January, the three men began moving again. At approximately 1600 hours, they were lying in elephant grass when they saw seven VC soldiers standing four feet to the right and rear of them. The Americans opened fire on the enemy killing three of them immediately.MSgt. Gray looked around for SFC Hodgson, but did not see him. Once the three survivors returned to base, each man was debriefed by military intelligence and a search and rescue/recovery (SAR) operation was immediately initiated for SFC Hodgson, SSgt. Terry and SSgt. Badolati. During the next four days the area in and around the An Lao Valley was searched by air, but found no trace of the missing soldiers. No ground search was possible due the continuing heavy enemy presence throughout the sector. At the time the formal search effort was terminated, Ronald Terry and Frank Badolati were reported as Killed in Action/Body Not Recovered while Ronald Hodgson was reported as Missing in Action.
