Simon Pearce Bristol Caviar Chiller

$100





The hand-blown glassware of the Bristol Collection is inspired by Bristol, New England and represents the intersection of water and sky. Angular and sophisticated, the collections divine proportions call to mind the Golden Ratio, a mysterious relationship between geometry and beauty, found in the conch shells off the shores of Bristol.

Product Overview
Since beginning his apprenticeship at his father’s pottery studio at age 16, Simon Pearce has focused work on creating functional and sophisticated designs. Throughout the years, he has mastered the art of glassmaking using the finest natural materials. All Simon Pearce glassware is lead-free and safe to place in the dishwasher. Extreme changes in temperature may cause the glass to crack. Glass pieces with handles are particularly vulnerable. We suggest you not use glass in the microwave or place in the refrigerator or freezer to chill. Boiling hot liquids should never be poured into any handled glass. When pouring hot liquids into any other glass, place a metal spoon in the container before pouring.
