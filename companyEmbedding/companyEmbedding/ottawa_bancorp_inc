The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.

Ottawa Bancorp, Inc. Announces Completion Of Second-Step Conversion And Offering






Business Wire




Oct 11, 2016 4:30 PM EDT













 




























































  Ottawa Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company") (NasdaqCM: OTTW), announced today that it has completed the conversion and reorganization pursuant to which Ottawa Savings Bancorp MHC has converted to the stock holding company form of organization. The Company, the new stock holding company for Ottawa Savings Bank, FSB, sold 2,383,950 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share, for gross offering proceeds of $23.8 million in its stock offering.  Concurrent with the completion of the conversion and reorganization, shares of common stock of Ottawa Savings Bancorp, Inc. owned by public stockholders have been exchanged for shares of the Company's common stock so that the former public stockholders of Ottawa Savings Bancorp now own approximately the same percentage of the Company's outstanding common stock as they owned of Ottawa Savings Bancorp's outstanding common stock immediately prior to the conversion, subject to adjustment as disclosed in the prospectus. Stockholders of Ottawa Savings Bancorp will receive 1.1921 shares of the Company's common stock for each share of Ottawa Savings Bancorp's common stock they owned immediately prior to completion of the transaction. Cash in lieu of fractional shares will be paid based on the offering price of $10.00 per share. As a result of the offering and the exchange of shares, the Company has 3,450,000 shares of common stock outstanding, subject to adjustment for fractional shares.  The shares of the Company's common stock are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on October 12, 2016 under the trading symbol "OTTW."  Direct Registration Statements reflecting the shares purchased in the offering are expected to be mailed to purchasers on or about October 12, 2016. Stockholders of Ottawa Savings Bancorp holding shares in street name will receive shares of the Company's common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares within their accounts. Stockholders of Ottawa Savings Bancorp holding shares in certificated form will be mailed a letter of transmittal promptly following the closing. After submitting their stock certificates and a properly completed letter of transmittal to the Company's transfer agent, stockholders will receive Direct Registration Statements reflecting their shares of Company common stock and checks for cash in lieu of fractional shares.
