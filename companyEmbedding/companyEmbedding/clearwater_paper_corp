Clearwater Paper Corporation is a pulp and paper product manufacturer that was created on December 9, 2008, via a spin-off from the real estate investment trust (REIT) company Potlatch Corporation. With its headquarters in Spokane, Washington, the new company started with four locations for the manufacture of bleached paperboard, consumer tissue, and wood products.[1]
In late 2010, the company acquired Cellu Tissue Holdings, Inc., headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, which increased its tissue manufacturing presence in the eastern United States and Canada. The total number of manufacturing sites rose to fourteen, with another in construction.[2]
In November 2011, the company completed the sale of its Lewiston, Idaho, sawmill to Idaho Forest Group of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Today, the company has two divisions: consumer products, and pulp and paperboard.
The company's newest facility at Shelby, North Carolina, officially started-up in December 2012, producing its first private label through-air-dried (TAD) finished roll and converted tissue paper product to compete with national TAD tissue brands. Clearwater Paper also completed upgrades to its North Las Vegas facility, allowing the facility to produce TAD ultra-bathroom tissue and household towels.
Clearwater Paper is the premier supplier of private label tissue products to the major retail grocery chains.[3] It supplies more than half of the store brand bathroom tissue, paper towels, facial tissue and napkins to grocery stores in the United States.[1]

Spin-off from Potlatch[edit]
The spin-off from Potlatch Corporation was announced by its board of directors July 17, 2008,[4] with the official date for the creation of Clearwater Paper being December 9, 2008.
According to the IRS, the spin-off was ruled to be a tax-free distribution of stocks as Potlatch issued 1 share of Clearwater Paper stock for every 3.5 shares of Potlatch stock, with any fractional shares being paid in cash.[5] The Clearwater Paper stock began trading on December 17.
Gordon L. Jones, who had been a vice president of Potlatch since July 2008, was chosen as the president and chief executive officer of Clearwater Paper.
At the end of the spin off, two stand-alone entities remained, both publicly traded. These were Potlatch Corporation (NYSE:PCH) and Clearwater Paper Corporation (NYSE:CLW).
Environmental Policies[edit]
Clearwater Paper also markets a number of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) products,[5] including the brand Ancora, a high-end, coated, double-side bleached white paperboard. Of the three similar products manufactured in a full variety of sizes in the United States, it is the only one that has on-label FSC certification. Another of Clearwater Paper's brands is Candesce, which is sold for use in premium lines of C1S folding carton as well as paperboard for commercial printing, carded packaging and liquid packaging board. Candesce is the only brand of SBS (solid bleached sulfate) with FSC certification across its full range of calipers.[5]
Clearwater Paper's two paperboard mill in Cypress Bend, Arkansas, and Lewiston, Idaho,[6][7][8] are also FSC and Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) Chain of Custody certified.[citation needed]
Manufacturing Divisions[edit]
Clearwater Paper's facilities in the United States serve two separate divisions—consumer products and pulp and paperboard—within the company.
Consumer Products[edit]
The consumer products segment manufactures and sells household tissues, including paper towels, napkins, bathroom tissue and facial tissue. It produces over half of the store-brand, household tissues sold in grocery stores in the United States.[5]
The consumer products division produces through-air-dried (TAD) paper towels, as well as premium and value brand towels. It makes napkins in ultra, two-ply and three-ply dinner napkins, plus value one-ply luncheon napkins. The bathroom tissue produced is mostly two-ply ultra, though other types are manufactured and sold. The facial tissues produced by the division include ultra lotion facial tissues. Clearwater Paper primarily produces ultra and premium qualities of the tissue it produces, though it does manufacture lower grades as well.
Pulp and paperboard[edit]
The company's pulp and paperboard segment manufactures bleached paperboard, primarily for the packaging industry. Solid bleached sulfate board is a type of paperboard that is used in the production of folding cartons, liquid packaging, plates, cups and some commercial printing applications.
The pulp and paperboard segment also produces softwood market pulp, which is used as the primary raw material in the production of a wide variety of paper products, and slush pulp (excess or waste pulp), which it sends to the consumer products segment.
The pulp and paperboard division operates one facility in Idaho and one in Arkansas.[9]
Facilities[edit]
Prior to the acquisition of Cellu Tissue in 2010, Clearwater Paper operated four facilities in the United States, which were previously owned by Potlatch until the spin-off. Those facilities included Cypress Bend, Arkansas; Elwood, Illinois; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Lewiston, Idaho.
With the acquisition of Cellu Tissue Holdings, Inc., the company purchased 10 additional consumer products facilities at: East Hartford, Connecticut; Ladysmith, Wisconsin; Long Island, New York; Menominee, Michigan; Natural Dam, New York; Neenah, Wisconsin; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada; Thomaston, Georgia; and Wiggins, Mississippi.
The company's fifteenth facility is located at Shelby, North Carolina.
Clearwater Paper shutdown its Thomaston, Georgia facility in December 2013 and its Long Island, New York facility in February 2014, reducing the total number of facility locations to 13.
Washington[edit]
Clearwater Paper's headquarter office is located at 601 West Riverside Avenue, Spokane, Washington, 99201.

Spin-off from Potlatch[edit]
The spin-off from Potlatch Corporation was announced by its board of directors July 17, 2008,[4] with the official date for the creation of Clearwater Paper being December 9, 2008.
According to the IRS, the spin-off was ruled to be a tax-free distribution of stocks as Potlatch issued 1 share of Clearwater Paper stock for every 3.5 shares of Potlatch stock, with any fractional shares being paid in cash.[5] The Clearwater Paper stock began trading on December 17.
Gordon L. Jones, who had been a vice president of Potlatch since July 2008, was chosen as the president and chief executive officer of Clearwater Paper.
At the end of the spin off, two stand-alone entities remained, both publicly traded. These were Potlatch Corporation (NYSE:PCH) and Clearwater Paper Corporation (NYSE:CLW).
Environmental Policies[edit]
Clearwater Paper also markets a number of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) products,[5] including the brand Ancora, a high-end, coated, double-side bleached white paperboard. Of the three similar products manufactured in a full variety of sizes in the United States, it is the only one that has on-label FSC certification. Another of Clearwater Paper's brands is Candesce, which is sold for use in premium lines of C1S folding carton as well as paperboard for commercial printing, carded packaging and liquid packaging board. Candesce is the only brand of SBS (solid bleached sulfate) with FSC certification across its full range of calipers.[5]
Clearwater Paper's two paperboard mill in Cypress Bend, Arkansas, and Lewiston, Idaho,[6][7][8] are also FSC and Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) Chain of Custody certified.[citation needed]
Manufacturing Divisions[edit]
Clearwater Paper's facilities in the United States serve two separate divisions—consumer products and pulp and paperboard—within the company.
Consumer Products[edit]
The consumer products segment manufactures and sells household tissues, including paper towels, napkins, bathroom tissue and facial tissue. It produces over half of the store-brand, household tissues sold in grocery stores in the United States.[5]
The consumer products division produces through-air-dried (TAD) paper towels, as well as premium and value brand towels. It makes napkins in ultra, two-ply and three-ply dinner napkins, plus value one-ply luncheon napkins. The bathroom tissue produced is mostly two-ply ultra, though other types are manufactured and sold. The facial tissues produced by the division include ultra lotion facial tissues. Clearwater Paper primarily produces ultra and premium qualities of the tissue it produces, though it does manufacture lower grades as well.
Pulp and paperboard[edit]
The company's pulp and paperboard segment manufactures bleached paperboard, primarily for the packaging industry. Solid bleached sulfate board is a type of paperboard that is used in the production of folding cartons, liquid packaging, plates, cups and some commercial printing applications.
The pulp and paperboard segment also produces softwood market pulp, which is used as the primary raw material in the production of a wide variety of paper products, and slush pulp (excess or waste pulp), which it sends to the consumer products segment.
The pulp and paperboard division operates one facility in Idaho and one in Arkansas.[9]
Facilities[edit]
Prior to the acquisition of Cellu Tissue in 2010, Clearwater Paper operated four facilities in the United States, which were previously owned by Potlatch until the spin-off. Those facilities included Cypress Bend, Arkansas; Elwood, Illinois; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Lewiston, Idaho.
With the acquisition of Cellu Tissue Holdings, Inc., the company purchased 10 additional consumer products facilities at: East Hartford, Connecticut; Ladysmith, Wisconsin; Long Island, New York; Menominee, Michigan; Natural Dam, New York; Neenah, Wisconsin; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada; Thomaston, Georgia; and Wiggins, Mississippi.
The company's fifteenth facility is located at Shelby, North Carolina.
Clearwater Paper shutdown its Thomaston, Georgia facility in December 2013 and its Long Island, New York facility in February 2014, reducing the total number of facility locations to 13.
Washington[edit]
Clearwater Paper's headquarter office is located at 601 West Riverside Avenue, Spokane, Washington, 99201.

Clearwater Paper Corporation is a pulp and paper product manufacturer that was created on December 9, 2008, via a spin-off from the real estate investment trust (REIT) company Potlatch Corporation. With its headquarters in Spokane, Washington, the new company started with four locations for the manufacture of bleached paperboard, consumer tissue, and wood products.[1]
In late 2010, the company acquired Cellu Tissue Holdings, Inc., headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, which increased its tissue manufacturing presence in the eastern United States and Canada. The total number of manufacturing sites rose to fourteen, with another in construction.[2]
In November 2011, the company completed the sale of its Lewiston, Idaho, sawmill to Idaho Forest Group of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Today, the company has two divisions: consumer products, and pulp and paperboard.
The company's newest facility at Shelby, North Carolina, officially started-up in December 2012, producing its first private label through-air-dried (TAD) finished roll and converted tissue paper product to compete with national TAD tissue brands. Clearwater Paper also completed upgrades to its North Las Vegas facility, allowing the facility to produce TAD ultra-bathroom tissue and household towels.
Clearwater Paper is the premier supplier of private label tissue products to the major retail grocery chains.[3] It supplies more than half of the store brand bathroom tissue, paper towels, facial tissue and napkins to grocery stores in the United States.[1]

Spin-off from Potlatch[edit]
The spin-off from Potlatch Corporation was announced by its board of directors July 17, 2008,[4] with the official date for the creation of Clearwater Paper being December 9, 2008.
According to the IRS, the spin-off was ruled to be a tax-free distribution of stocks as Potlatch issued 1 share of Clearwater Paper stock for every 3.5 shares of Potlatch stock, with any fractional shares being paid in cash.[5] The Clearwater Paper stock began trading on December 17.
Gordon L. Jones, who had been a vice president of Potlatch since July 2008, was chosen as the president and chief executive officer of Clearwater Paper.
At the end of the spin off, two stand-alone entities remained, both publicly traded. These were Potlatch Corporation (NYSE:PCH) and Clearwater Paper Corporation (NYSE:CLW).
Environmental Policies[edit]
Clearwater Paper also markets a number of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) products,[5] including the brand Ancora, a high-end, coated, double-side bleached white paperboard. Of the three similar products manufactured in a full variety of sizes in the United States, it is the only one that has on-label FSC certification. Another of Clearwater Paper's brands is Candesce, which is sold for use in premium lines of C1S folding carton as well as paperboard for commercial printing, carded packaging and liquid packaging board. Candesce is the only brand of SBS (solid bleached sulfate) with FSC certification across its full range of calipers.[5]
Clearwater Paper's two paperboard mill in Cypress Bend, Arkansas, and Lewiston, Idaho,[6][7][8] are also FSC and Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) Chain of Custody certified.[citation needed]
Manufacturing Divisions[edit]
Clearwater Paper's facilities in the United States serve two separate divisions—consumer products and pulp and paperboard—within the company.
Consumer Products[edit]
The consumer products segment manufactures and sells household tissues, including paper towels, napkins, bathroom tissue and facial tissue. It produces over half of the store-brand, household tissues sold in grocery stores in the United States.[5]
The consumer products division produces through-air-dried (TAD) paper towels, as well as premium and value brand towels. It makes napkins in ultra, two-ply and three-ply dinner napkins, plus value one-ply luncheon napkins. The bathroom tissue produced is mostly two-ply ultra, though other types are manufactured and sold. The facial tissues produced by the division include ultra lotion facial tissues. Clearwater Paper primarily produces ultra and premium qualities of the tissue it produces, though it does manufacture lower grades as well.
Pulp and paperboard[edit]
The company's pulp and paperboard segment manufactures bleached paperboard, primarily for the packaging industry. Solid bleached sulfate board is a type of paperboard that is used in the production of folding cartons, liquid packaging, plates, cups and some commercial printing applications.
The pulp and paperboard segment also produces softwood market pulp, which is used as the primary raw material in the production of a wide variety of paper products, and slush pulp (excess or waste pulp), which it sends to the consumer products segment.
The pulp and paperboard division operates one facility in Idaho and one in Arkansas.[9]
Facilities[edit]
Prior to the acquisition of Cellu Tissue in 2010, Clearwater Paper operated four facilities in the United States, which were previously owned by Potlatch until the spin-off. Those facilities included Cypress Bend, Arkansas; Elwood, Illinois; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Lewiston, Idaho.
With the acquisition of Cellu Tissue Holdings, Inc., the company purchased 10 additional consumer products facilities at: East Hartford, Connecticut; Ladysmith, Wisconsin; Long Island, New York; Menominee, Michigan; Natural Dam, New York; Neenah, Wisconsin; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada; Thomaston, Georgia; and Wiggins, Mississippi.
The company's fifteenth facility is located at Shelby, North Carolina.
Clearwater Paper shutdown its Thomaston, Georgia facility in December 2013 and its Long Island, New York facility in February 2014, reducing the total number of facility locations to 13.
Washington[edit]
Clearwater Paper's headquarter office is located at 601 West Riverside Avenue, Spokane, Washington, 99201.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Clearwater Paper Corporation is a pulp and paper product manufacturer that was created on December 9, 2008, via a spin-off from the real estate investment trust (REIT) company Potlatch Corporation. With its headquarters in Spokane, Washington, the new company started with four locations for the manufacture of bleached paperboard, consumer tissue, and wood products.[1]
In late 2010, the company acquired Cellu Tissue Holdings, Inc., headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, which increased its tissue manufacturing presence in the eastern United States and Canada. The total number of manufacturing sites rose to fourteen, with another in construction.[2]
In November 2011, the company completed the sale of its Lewiston, Idaho, sawmill to Idaho Forest Group of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Today, the company has two divisions: consumer products, and pulp and paperboard.
The company's newest facility at Shelby, North Carolina, officially started-up in December 2012, producing its first private label through-air-dried (TAD) finished roll and converted tissue paper product to compete with national TAD tissue brands. Clearwater Paper also completed upgrades to its North Las Vegas facility, allowing the facility to produce TAD ultra-bathroom tissue and household towels.

Spin-off from Potlatch[edit]
The spin-off from Potlatch Corporation was announced by its board of directors July 17, 2008,[4] with the official date for the creation of Clearwater Paper being December 9, 2008.
According to the IRS, the spin-off was ruled to be a tax-free distribution of stocks as Potlatch issued 1 share of Clearwater Paper stock for every 3.5 shares of Potlatch stock, with any fractional shares being paid in cash.[5] The Clearwater Paper stock began trading on December 17.
Gordon L. Jones, who had been a vice president of Potlatch since July 2008, was chosen as the president and chief executive officer of Clearwater Paper.
At the end of the spin off, two stand-alone entities remained, both publicly traded. These were Potlatch Corporation (NYSE:PCH) and Clearwater Paper Corporation (NYSE:CLW).
Environmental Policies[edit]
Clearwater Paper also markets a number of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) products,[5] including the brand Ancora, a high-end, coated, double-side bleached white paperboard. Of the three similar products manufactured in a full variety of sizes in the United States, it is the only one that has on-label FSC certification. Another of Clearwater Paper's brands is Candesce, which is sold for use in premium lines of C1S folding carton as well as paperboard for commercial printing, carded packaging and liquid packaging board. Candesce is the only brand of SBS (solid bleached sulfate) with FSC certification across its full range of calipers.[5]
Clearwater Paper's two paperboard mill in Cypress Bend, Arkansas, and Lewiston, Idaho,[6][7][8] are also FSC and Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) Chain of Custody certified.[citation needed]
Manufacturing Divisions[edit]
Clearwater Paper's facilities in the United States serve two separate divisions—consumer products and pulp and paperboard—within the company.
Consumer Products[edit]
The consumer products segment manufactures and sells household tissues, including paper towels, napkins, bathroom tissue and facial tissue. It produces over half of the store-brand, household tissues sold in grocery stores in the United States.[5]
The consumer products division produces through-air-dried (TAD) paper towels, as well as premium and value brand towels. It makes napkins in ultra, two-ply and three-ply dinner napkins, plus value one-ply luncheon napkins. The bathroom tissue produced is mostly two-ply ultra, though other types are manufactured and sold. The facial tissues produced by the division include ultra lotion facial tissues. Clearwater Paper primarily produces ultra and premium qualities of the tissue it produces, though it does manufacture lower grades as well.
Pulp and paperboard[edit]
The company's pulp and paperboard segment manufactures bleached paperboard, primarily for the packaging industry. Solid bleached sulfate board is a type of paperboard that is used in the production of folding cartons, liquid packaging, plates, cups and some commercial printing applications.
The pulp and paperboard segment also produces softwood market pulp, which is used as the primary raw material in the production of a wide variety of paper products, and slush pulp (excess or waste pulp), which it sends to the consumer products segment.
The pulp and paperboard division operates one facility in Idaho and one in Arkansas.[9]
Facilities[edit]
Prior to the acquisition of Cellu Tissue in 2010, Clearwater Paper operated four facilities in the United States, which were previously owned by Potlatch until the spin-off. Those facilities included Cypress Bend, Arkansas; Elwood, Illinois; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Lewiston, Idaho.
With the acquisition of Cellu Tissue Holdings, Inc., the company purchased 10 additional consumer products facilities at: East Hartford, Connecticut; Ladysmith, Wisconsin; Long Island, New York; Menominee, Michigan; Natural Dam, New York; Neenah, Wisconsin; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada; Thomaston, Georgia; and Wiggins, Mississippi.
The company's fifteenth facility is located at Shelby, North Carolina.
Clearwater Paper shutdown its Thomaston, Georgia facility in December 2013 and its Long Island, New York facility in February 2014, reducing the total number of facility locations to 13.
Washington[edit]
Clearwater Paper's headquarter office is located at 601 West Riverside Avenue, Spokane, Washington, 99201.

Clearwater Paper Corporation is a pulp and paper product manufacturer that was created on December 9, 2008, via a spin-off from the real estate investment trust (REIT) company Potlatch Corporation. With its headquarters in Spokane, Washington, the new company started with four locations for the manufacture of bleached paperboard, consumer tissue, and wood products.[1]
In late 2010, the company acquired Cellu Tissue Holdings, Inc., headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, which increased its tissue manufacturing presence in the eastern United States and Canada. The total number of manufacturing sites rose to fourteen, with another in construction.[2]
In November 2011, the company completed the sale of its Lewiston, Idaho, sawmill to Idaho Forest Group of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Today, the company has two divisions: consumer products, and pulp and paperboard.
The company's newest facility at Shelby, North Carolina, officially started-up in December 2012, producing its first private label through-air-dried (TAD) finished roll and converted tissue paper product to compete with national TAD tissue brands.

Clearwater Paper Announces Sale of Specialty Mills to Dunn Paper, Inc

 SPOKANE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Clearwater Paper Corporation (NYSE:CLW)(the "Company") today

      announced the Company has sold its specialty products business and mills

      to Dunn Paper, Inc. The Company intends to reinvest the net proceeds of

      the sale into capital projects within its Consumer Products Division.

    


      The transaction, which closed today, includes the sale of five

      Clearwater Paper subsidiaries with facilities located at East Hartford,

      Conn., Menominee, Mich., Gouverneur (Natural Dam), N.Y., St. Catharines,

      Ontario, and Wiggins, Miss.



      "The sale of the specialty products business sharpens our Consumer

      Products Division's focus on the core retail business," said Linda

      Massman, president and CEO. "It's about improving our approach and

      efficiencies in all parts of our business while meeting or surpassing

      our customers' expectations, and our Company financial goals. We believe

      that the capital projects in which we will invest the proceeds of this

      sale can yield a 300 to 400 basis point improvement in the Consumer

      Product Division's EBITDA margins over the next three years."

    


      "On behalf of Clearwater Paper, we sincerely thank the specialty

      products team for their hard work and commitment to providing our

      customers with high-quality products and services," said Massman.

    


      Effective today, 470 specialty products employees are now employees of

      Dunn Paper.

    


      "We are very pleased to welcome the exceptional people who lead and work

      at these specialty mills to the Dunn Paper team," said Brent Earnshaw,

      CEO of Dunn Paper. "Combining the unique assets, capabilities and

      products of these mills with Dunn Paper's Port Huron mill will lead to a

      specialty paper company with unmatched product offerings for our diverse

      customer base."

    


      FBR Capital Markets & Co., led by Matthew Spain, advised Clearwater

      Paper on the sale of the specialty products business. Pillsbury Winthrop

      Shaw Pittman LLP acted as legal advisor to Clearwater Paper.
