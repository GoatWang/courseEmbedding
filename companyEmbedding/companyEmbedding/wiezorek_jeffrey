SANTA MONICA, Calif., May 12, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Kite Pharma, Inc. (Kite), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing engineered autologous T cell therapy (eACT™) products for the treatment of cancer, today announced the appointment of Jeffrey S. Wiezorek, M.D., M.S., to the newly created position of Vice President, Clinical Development.  Dr. Wiezorek will assume responsibilities for leading Kite Pharma's clinical programs upon the retirement of Chief Medical Officer Dr. Keith Nolop, who is continuing as an advisor to Kite Pharma for a transitional period.  Dr. Wiezorek most recently served as Executive Medical Director, Global Product Area Lead at Amgen.  His appointment at Kite Pharma is effective immediately.
Dr. Arie Belldegrun, M.D., Kite's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Jeff Wiezorek brings valuable expertise in all stages of clinical development, and this will be critical as Kite advances its breakthrough programs in cancer immunotherapy.  We are excited to welcome Jeff to our leadership team."  Dr. Belldegrun continued, "We also are grateful to Keith Nolop for the accomplishments he has achieved during his tenure.  Keith has been an integral part of our success, and we wish him well."
Dr. Wiezorek stated, "Kite has made great progress leading the development of new approaches to the treatment of intractable cancers.  I am excited to join a team that I believe is uniquely positioned to deliver on the potential and promise of cancer immunotherapy for patients."
Prior to joining Kite Pharma, Dr. Wiezorek held roles of increasing responsibility over 9 years at Amgen.  In his most recent position as Executive Medical Director, Global Development, he had global oversight of the clinical strategy for the immunotherapy (including blinatumomab and talimogene laherparepvec), angiogenesis, and denosumab oncology product areas.  Previously, he served as Global Development Leader for multiple programs encompassing phase 1 through phase 4 trials.   In these roles, Dr. Wiezorek worked closely with global regulatory agencies, and he was the development lead for the approval of Vectibix in combination with chemotherapy in Europe.  Dr. Wiezorek is author or co-author on more than 30 peer-reviewed articles and presentation abstracts.  He received his B.A. degree in biophysics from the University of Pennsylvania and his M.D. degree from Columbia University.  Dr. Wiezorek trained in internal medicine at Stanford University and also completed a fellowship in oncology at UCLA.  Prior to joining Amgen, he investigated the role of nuclear factor-kappaB in cellular proliferation and cancer pathogenesis in the laboratory of Dr. David Baltimore at the California Institute of Technology.
About Kite PharmaKite Pharma, Inc., is a privately held clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel cancer immunotherapy products, with a primary focus on eACT™ designed to restore the immune system's ability to recognize and eradicate tumors.  In partnership with the NCI Surgery Branch through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), Kite is advancing a pipeline of proprietary eACT™ product candidates, both CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) and TCR (T cell receptor) products, directed to a wide range of cancer indications.  Kite's management team has a proven track record of building successful biotechnology companies and successfully developing novel immunotherapies and other oncology treatments.  Kite is based in Santa Monica, CA.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.
