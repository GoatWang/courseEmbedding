                                                                            Approximate

To date, we are not aware of any direct competition from companies offering the
same products and services as Flagship. There are five categories that include
companies offering some variation of the products and services offered by
Flagship.

  · Institution-Based Primary and Specialty Healthcare service suppliers comprised
    of either single hospital or clinics or a network of medical centers aiming to
    provide personalized access to emergency, episodic or chronic care. These
    competitors provide guidance services that primarily include access to their
    institutions resources. The institutions most often determine which physician
    will see the patient. Examples include the executive registry of most leading
    hospitals and clinics and Pinnacle Healthcare.

  · Concierge Medicine generally refers to a model whereby patients essentially
    pay an annual fee for "special service" rendered primarily by a primary care
    physician. Individual physicians charge an annual fee to an exclusive set of
    patients in their region. The program allows primary care doctors to reduce
    their practice size and increase the time spent with participants in the
    program. This service is designed for patients who are seeking personalized
    healthcare alternatives and from physicians who are tired of dealing with
    health care insurance providers and HMO's. Examples include MDVIP and MD2.

  · "Best Physician" Identifiers are third parties utilizing a combination of
    physician rankings by the media and cross references among physicians to
    identify "best physicians." Typically, there is a membership fee charged to
    both the patient (for access) and the physicians (for listing) in these
    arrangements. Physicians are typically chosen based on the list published by
    medical institutions with which the physicians are affiliated. Examples
    include Best Doctors and MediGuide.

  · Web Search Services compile and offer lists of physicians with basic
    information about each physician. This may includes services that compile
    lists of physicians and basic information about each physician. An example is
    WebMD.

  · Billing and Insurance Facilitators services include review of benefits,
    negotiation of procedures and claim disputes on behalf of the member/patient.
    An example is Health Advocate.


Company Description
Flagship Global Health, Inc. ("Flagship" or the "Company") (formerly known as
Patients & Physicians, Inc.) was organized on February 5, 1993, and is an
international membership-based health assurance company providing physician
referrals on a priority basis, emergent care needs, a personal


 electronic
internet-based medical record repository and air evacuation to its members, all
linked by a sophisticated IT management system for its members, whether they are
at home or traveling. Acting as a member's healthcare advocate, we are focused
on providing priority access to renowned and clinically acclaimed physicians,
which are typically difficult to access. Rather than simply providing names, we
offer referrals, priority appointments, personalized advocacy services, on-line
repository for health records and air evacuation services to our members, all
linked by a sophisticated and proprietary information management system. For the
Company, healthcare advocacy means bringing about the delivery of exceptional
"medicine at the speed of need" to each of our members. The Company derives
revenue from the sale of annual memberships to a combination of various service
offerings. Flagship was incorporated in the State of Delaware on February 5,
2004, as a new corporation. Flagship was founded by a group of physicians and
entrepreneurs.

On June 27, 2006, Flagship closed an Exchange Agreement (the "Share Exchange")
with all of the stockholders of Flagship Patient Advocates, Inc. ("Advocates")
whereby Flagship acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
Advocates. Upon completion of the Share Exchange, Advocates stockholders
controlled approximately 99% of the then issued and outstanding Common Stock.
Prior to the Share Exchange, Flagship was a shell company. Post the Share
Exchange, Advocates business activities were the activities of Flagship. As a
result of these factors, this transaction has been treated as a reverse merger
and a capital transaction, equivalent to the issuance of stock by Advocates for
Flagship's net assets and, accordingly, the historical financial statements
prior to June 27, 2006 are those of Advocates. All shares and per share data
prior to the Share Exchange have been restated to reflect the stock issuances
and the effect of the closing of the Share Exchange.

On January 12, 2007, a Certificate of Ownership and Merger was filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, pursuant to which Flagship merged
with its wholly owned subsidiary, Advocates. As a result of the merger, Flagship
assumed all the obligations of Advocates and the operations of Advocates were
dissolved. As the surviving entity, Patients & Physicians, Inc. changed its name
to Flagship Global Health, Inc. on January 12, 2007.

On July 16, 2007 (the "Closing Date"), the Company entered into a Securities
Purchase Agreement (the "Securities Purchase Agreement") with FrontPoint
Healthcare Fund, L.P., FrontPoint Healthcare Fund 2X, L.P., FrontPoint
Healthcare Horizons Fund, L.P. and FrontPoint Healthcare Long Horizons Fund,
L.P. (collectively, "FrontPoint"). Under the Securities Purchase Agreement,
FrontPoint purchased from the Company an aggregate of 6,809,258 shares of the
Common Stock and warrants (the "Warrants") representing the right to acquire
2,042,777 shares of Common Stock for $2.20 per unit. The Company realized net
proceeds of $14,231,349. The Warrants have an exercise price of $3.00 per share.
When issued, the Warrants were immediately exercisable and had a term of three
years. On September 6, 2007, the Company and FrontPoint amended the Warrants
(the "Warrant Amendment"), to provide that the Warrants are not exercisable
until one year from the Closing Date. Pursuant to the Warrant Amendment, the
Company and FrontPoint also extended the term of the Warrants to four years.

In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Securities Purchase
Agreement, the Company and FrontPoint entered into a Registration Rights
Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). Pursuant to the Registration
Rights Agreement, the Company agreed to register the shares of Common Stock
issued to FrontPoint under the Securities Purchase Agreement and the Common
Stock underlying the warrants.
