 Career History



Investment Team

                                    Current                


Summit Rock Advisors LP


                  Summit Rock Advisors develops an asset allocation plan for each client after acquiring an understanding of the client's financial situation and investment goals. The asset allocation plan is customized to reflect the client's time horizon, liquidity requirements, tax position, and any other specific situations or circumstances that warrant consideration. It seeks to strike a balance between preserving wealth and seeking attractive returns. Summit Rock also strives to mitigate unnecessary risk, by achieving adequate diversification by investment strategy, manager, geography, sector and vintage year.Summit Rock's approach to asset allocation emphasizes diversification across five key dimensions: (1) geography (2) asset category (3) investment strategy (4) return driver and (5) liquidity. In implementing a client's asset allocation, Summit Rock seeks to achieve the optimal balance among these five dimensions based on each client's circumstances. Following the implementation of the asset allocation plan, Summit Rock monitors clients assets on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain appropriately positioned.Summit Rock's analytical work with respect to asset allocation is based on (1) academic financial theory (2) proprietary quantitative analysis (3) the professional experience of Summit Rocks principals and employees and (4) the Summit Rock team's active engagement with thought leaders within the investment management industry.In addition to asset allocation, Summit Rock considers manager selection an important source of investment returns and a key tool for risk management. Each Summit Rock portfolio has a specific investment focus. Summit Rock portfolios generally seek to achieve their respective investment objectives through investments in unaffiliated private funds and the retention of unaffiliated sub-advisers. Private funds and managers are chosen carefully by Summit Rocks Investment Committee following extensive investment and operational due diligence.Summit Rock's investment process includes quantitative and qualitative manager research, portfolio construction considerations and a variety of Operational Risk Management (ORM) processes. In selecting a manager, Summit Rock considers the merits of the investment program alongside the integrity of the business and operational infrastructure. In order to balance return and risk potential, Summit Rock integrates their investment decision-making process with their operational risk management process to form a holistic view of the managers return potential, considered in the context of a wide array of risks including market risk, liquidity risk and key man risk. The firm generally seeks to place the Summit Rock portfolios capital with well-established investment managers that have a history of strong performance, careful risk management, strict operational controls and institutional third party service providers.
