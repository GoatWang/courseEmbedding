Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

ROVERPASS Terms of Service
Last modified: August 5, 2016

THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, A CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF DISPUTES, AND OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
IN PARTICULAR, RV PARKS SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW THE LAWS WORK IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CITIES. SOME CITIES HAVE LAWS THAT RESTRICT THEIR ABILITY TO RV PARK PAYING GUESTS FOR SHORT PERIODS. THESE LAWS ARE OFTEN PART OF A CITY'S ZONING OR ADMINISTRATIVE CODES. IN MANY CITIES, RV PARKS MUST REGISTER, GET A PERMIT, OR OBTAIN A LICENSE BEFORE LISTING A PROPERTY OR ACCEPTING GUESTS. CERTAIN TYPES OF SHORT-TERM BOOKINGS MAY BE PROHIBITED ALTOGETHER. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS VARY GREATLY IN HOW THEY ENFORCE THESE LAWS. PENALTIES MAY INCLUDE FINES OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT. RV PARKS SHOULD REVIEW LOCAL LAWS BEFORE LISTING A SPACE ON ROVERPASS.

In addition, certain areas of the Site and Application (and your access to or use of certain aspects of the Services or Collective Content) may have different terms and conditions, standards, guidelines, or policies posted or may require you to agree with and accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Site, Application, Services, or Collective Content, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Site, Application, Services, or Collective Content.

If you accept or agree to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms and, in such event, "you" and "your" will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.

3. Modification
Roverpass reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify the Site, Application or Services or to modify these Terms, including the Service Fees, at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will either post the modification on the Site or via the Application or otherwise provide you with notice of the modification. We will also update the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Site, Application or Services after we have posted a modification on the Site or via the Application or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site, Application and Services.
4. Eligibility

5. How the Site, Application and Services Work
The Site, Application and Services can be used to facilitate the listing and booking of Accommodations. Such Accommodations are included in Listings on the Site, Application and Services by RV Parks. You may view Listings as an unregistered visitor to the Site, Application and Services; however, if you wish to book an Accommodation or create a Listing, you must first register to create an Roverpass Account (defined below).
As stated above, Roverpass makes available an online platform or marketplace with related technology for Guests and RV Parks to meet online and arrange for bookings of Accommodations directly with each other. Roverpass is not an owner or operator of properties, including, but not limited to, hotel rooms, motel rooms, other lodgings or Accommodations, nor is it a provider of properties, including, but not limited to, hotel rooms, motel rooms, other lodgings or Accommodations and Roverpass does not own, sell, resell, furnish, provide, rent, re-rent, manage and/or control properties, including, but not limited to, hotel rooms, motel rooms, other lodgings or Accommodations or transportation or travel services.

PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE RV PARKS AND GUESTS CONNECTING AND BOOKING ACCOMMODATIONS DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. ROVERPASS CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS AND THE CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY ACCOMMODATIONS.

6. Account Registration

You may register to join the Services directly via the Site or Application or as described in this section.

You can also register to join by logging into your account with certain third-party social networking sites ("SNS") (including, but not limited to, Facebook; each such account, a "Third-Party Account"), via our Site or Application, as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site, Application and Services, you may link your Roverpass Account with Third-Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third-Party Account login information to Roverpass through the Site, Services or Application; or (ii) allowing Roverpass to access your Third-Party Account, as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to Roverpass and/or grant Roverpass access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Roverpass to pay any fees or making Roverpass subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting Roverpass access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Roverpass will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account ("SNS Content") so that it is available on and through the Site, Services and Application via your Roverpass Account and Roverpass Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts will be available on and through your Roverpass Account on the Site, Services and Application. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Roverpass’s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Site, Services and Application. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Roverpass Account and your Third-Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the "Settings" section of the Site and Application.
PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.
Roverpass makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and Roverpass is not responsible for any SNS Content.

Your Roverpass Account and your Roverpass Account profile page will be created for your use of the Site and Application based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active Roverpass Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Roverpass reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Roverpass Account and your access to the Site, Application and Services if you create more than one (1) Roverpass Account, or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, fraudulent, not current, incomplete, or otherwise in violation of these Terms of Service.
You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Roverpass Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Roverpass of any unauthorized use of your Roverpass Account.
7. Accommodation Listings
As a Member, you may create Listings. To create a Listing, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Accommodation to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, size, features, and availability of the Accommodation and pricing and related rules and financial terms. In order to be featured in Listings via the Site, Application and Services, all Accommodations must have valid physical addresses. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and Services. You understand and agree that the placement or ranking of Listings in search results may depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, Guest and RV Park preferences, ratings and/or ease of booking.
Other Members will be able to book your Accommodation via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing, your Guest requirements, and Guests’ search parameters and preferences. You understand and agree that once a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation, you may not request the Guest to pay a higher price than in the booking request.
You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for any and all Listings and Member Content you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or a Guest's stay at, an Accommodation in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners association, condominium, lease or rental agreements, and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws (such as zoning laws and laws governing rentals of residential and other properties), Tax requirements, Intellectual Property laws, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Accommodation included in a Listing you post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that Roverpass assumes no responsibility for a RV Park's compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. Roverpass reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Roverpass, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or Roverpass's then-current Policies and Community Guidelines or Standards, Trademark & Branding Guidelines, or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.
If you are a RV Park, you understand and agree that Roverpass does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation and stays at your Accommodation, any agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the Guest and Roverpass is not a party to it.
When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Accommodation, such as requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to book your Accommodation. Any Member wishing to book Accommodations included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the "RV Parking" section of the Site, Application and Services.
If you are a RV Park, Roverpass makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm or preapprove for booking for your Accommodation. You acknowledge and agree that, as a RV Park, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable.)
Roverpass recommends that RV Parks obtain appropriate insurance for their Accommodations. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Accommodation carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable) while at your Accommodation.
Roverpass may offer RV Parks the option of having photographers take photographs of their Accommodations. If you as a RV Park choose to have photographer do this, Roverpass shall own all copyrights in photographs taken but these photographs will be made available to you to include in your Listing with a watermark or tag bearing the words "Roverpass.com Verified Photo" or similar wording ("Verified Images"). You agree that you alone are responsible for ensuring that your Listing is accurately represented in the Verified Images. You alone are responsible for using the Verified Images for your Listing and you warrant that you will cease to use the Verified Images or any other images if such images cease to accurately represent your Listing or if you cease to be a RV Park for the Listing featured. All images, materials and content created by these photographers, including Verified Images, constitute Roverpass Content, regardless of whether you include them in your Listingand you agree not to use them except in your Listing without prior authorization from Roverpass. If your Roverpass Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, you shall not use Verified Images in any way. You agree that Roverpass retains its right to and mayuse the Verified Images for advertising, marketing, commercial and other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation.
8. No Endorsement
Roverpass does not endorse any Member, Listing or Accommodation. You understand that Verified Images are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of the Accommodation at the time the photograph was taken. Verified Images are therefore not an endorsement by Roverpass of any Member, Listing or Accommodation.
Members are required by these Terms to provide accurate information. Although Roverpass may, for transparency or fraud prevention or detection purposes, directly or through third parties, ask you to provide a form of government identification, your date of birth, and other information, or undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of Members and/or screen Member information against third party databases or other sources, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Member or the Member’s purported identity or background.
By registering for an Roverpass Account, you agree that Roverpass may - but is not obligated to - request a consumer report on you from a Consumer Reporting Agency. If we do request a consumer report, we'll request and use it in compliance with applicable law, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Any references in the Site, Application or Services to a Member being "verified" or "connected" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process, and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Roverpass about any Member, including of the Member's identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site, Application and Services. We therefore recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay with a RV Park or to accept or preapprove a booking request from a Guest, or to have any other interaction with any other Member. Except as provided in the Roverpass RV Park Guarantee Terms and Conditions ("Roverpass RV Park Guarantee"), which is an agreement between Roverpass and RV Parks, we are not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members.
By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Roverpass with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a RV Park against Roverpass regarding the remittance of payments received from a Guest by Roverpass on behalf of a RV Park, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled "Limitation of Liability".
9. Bookings and Financial Terms
A. Key definitions
"Accommodation Fees" means the amounts that are due and payable by a Guest in exchange for that Guest’s stay in an Accommodation. The RV Park alone, and not Roverpass, is responsible for the Accommodation Fees for his or her Listing. The RV Park may in his or her sole discretion decide to include in these amounts (i) a cleaning fee or any other fee permitted on the Roverpass platform, or (ii) Taxes that the RV Park determines that he or she has to collect.
"Guest Fees" means the fee that Roverpass charges a Guest for the use of the Services, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees. The Guest Fees will be displayed to the Guest when the Guest is asked whether to send a booking request to a RV Park.
"RV Park Fees" means the fee that Roverpass charges a RV Park for the use of the Services, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Accommodation Fees. The RV Park Fees will be displayed to the RV Park when the RV Park is asked whether to confirm or reject a booking request from a prospective Guest.
"Payment Method" means a payment method that you have added to your Roverpass Account, such as a credit card, debit card or PayPal.
"Service Fees" means collectively the Guest Fees and the RV Park Fees.
"Total Fees" means collectively the Accommodation Fees and the Guest Fees plus any Taxes.
B. Bookings and Financial Terms for RV Parks
If you are a RV Park and a booking is requested for your Accommodation via the Site, Application or Services, you will be required to either preapprove, confirm or reject the booking request within the Booking Request Period, otherwise the booking request will automatically expire. When a booking is requested via the Site, Application or Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Guest who has requested the booking, (ii) a link to the Guest's Roverpass Account profile page, (iii) if the Guest and RV Park have both connected their Roverpass accounts to SNS and have not turned off sharing of social connections, the names of any shared connections on such SNS, and (iv) an indication of whether or not the Guest has provided other information to Roverpass, such as a verified email address, connection to SNSs, or a government ID. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking request within the Booking Request Period, any amounts collected by Roverpass (via Roverpass Payments) for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Guest. When you confirm a booking requested by a Guest, Roverpass will send you an email, text message or message via the Application confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.
Roverpass Payments will collect the Total Fees from Guests at the time of the booking request or upon the RV Park's confirmation and will initiate payment of the Accommodation Fees (less applicable fees and taxes) to the RV Park in most cases within 24 hours of the scheduled check-in time of the Guest at the applicable Accommodation (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Guest) and as further described in the Payments Terms.
Each RV Park agrees that Roverpass may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the RV Park and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Guest to cancel the booking and (ii) refund (via Roverpass Payments) to the Guest that portion of the Accommodation Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy.
C. Bookings and Financial Terms for Guests
The RV Parks, not Roverpass, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Accommodations reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a RV Park for the booking of an Accommodation, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the RV Park and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Accommodation imposed by the RV Park. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Roverpass, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Roverpass is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of Roverpass Payments' obligations pursuant to the Payments Terms, Roverpass (inclusive of all subsidiaries) disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. The Total Fees payable will be displayed to a Guest before the Guest sends a booking request to a RV Park. As noted above, the RV Park is required to either preapprove, confirm or reject the booking request within the Booking Request Period; otherwise, the requested booking will be automatically cancelled. Upon receipt of your booking request, Roverpass Payments may initiate a pre-authorization and/or charge a nominal amount to your Payment Method pursuant to the Payments Terms. If a requested booking is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable RV Park), any amounts collected by Roverpass Payments will be refunded to such Guest, depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Guest's Payment Method will be released, if applicable.
You as a Guest agree to pay the Total Fees for any booking requested, and in most cases confirmed, in connection with your Roverpass Account. Roverpass Payments will collect the Total Fees pursuant to thePayments Terms.
Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.
D. Service Fees and Other Fees
In consideration for the use of Roverpass's online marketplace and platform, Roverpass charges Service Fees. Roverpass Payments collects these Service Fees pursuant to the Payments Terms, and, where applicable, may also collect Taxes (such as VAT in Europe) in respect of the RV Park Fees and Guest Fees. Roverpass Payments deducts the RV Park Fees from the Accommodation Fees before remitting the balance to the RV Park as described in the Payments Terms. Guest Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees.
More information on any such costs or deductions will be available via the Site and Application. More information on Services Fees can be found at www.Roverpass.com/help. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.
E. General Booking and Financial Terms
Cancellations and Refunds
If, as a Guest, you wish to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services, either prior to or after arriving at the Accommodation, the cancellation policy of the RV Park contained in the applicable Listing will apply to such cancellation. Our ability to refund the Accommodation Fees and other amounts charged to you will depend upon the terms of the applicable cancellation policy. Details regarding refunds and cancellation policies are available via the Site and Application. The Guest Fee is non-refundable regardless of the cancellation policy selected by the RV Park. Roverpass Payments will initiate any refunds due pursuant to the Payments Terms.
If a RV Park cancels a confirmed booking made via the Site, Services, and Application, (i) Roverpass Payments will refund the Total Fees for such booking to the applicable Guest pursuant to the Payments Terms and (ii) the Guest will receive an email or other communication from Roverpass containing alternative Listings and other related information. If the Guest requests a booking from one of the alternative Listings and the RV Park associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Guest's requested booking, then the Guest agrees to pay Roverpass the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the Accommodation in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms. If a RV Park cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Guest, have not received an email or other communication from Roverpass, please contact Roverpass.
If, as a RV Park, you cancel a confirmed booking, you agree that Roverpass may apply penalties or consequences to you or your Listing, including (i) publishing an automated review on your Listing indicating that a booking was cancelled, (ii) keeping the calendar for your Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled booking, or (iii) imposing a cancellation fee. You will be notified of the situations in which a cancellation fee applies before you decide to cancel.
In certain circumstances, Roverpass may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed booking made via the Site, Application and Services. This may be for reasons set forth in Roverpass's Extenuating Circumstances policy or for any other reason. Roverpass may also determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to the Guest part or all of the amounts charged to the Guest in accordance with the Guest Refund Policy. You agree that Roverpass and the relevant Guest or RV Park will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.
Rounding Off
overpass may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Guests or RV Parks to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, Roverpass will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and $101.49 to $101.00.
Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, Roverpass may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for Roverpass to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.
Donations
Some RV Parks may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed bookings made via the Site, Application and Services to a particular cause or charity. We do not take any responsibility or liability for whether the RV Park does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make. In such cases, the RV Park in question is responsible for his or her own compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to such pledges and/or fund-raising.
Booking Modifications
You as a Guest or RV Park are responsible for any modifications to a booking that you direct Roverpass Customer Service to make ("Booking Modifications"), and you agree to pay any Accommodation Fees, Guest Fees, RV Parks Fees, Services Fees, and/or Taxes associated with such Booking Modifications.
10. Taxes
Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information from our RV Parks, or to withhold taxes from payouts to RV Parks, or both. For instance, IRS regulations stipulate that we must collect an IRS Form W--9 from certain US RV Parks, and an appropriate IRS Form W--8 (e.g. Form W--8BEN) from non-US RV Parks with at least one Listing in the US. You as a RV Park are solely responsible for keeping the information in your tax forms current, complete and accurate. If you as a RV Park fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold taxes from payments to you (e.g. where you are a US RV Park and you fail to provide us with a completed IRS Form W--9), we reserve the right in our sole discretion to freeze all payouts to you until resolution, to withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both.
You as a RV Park understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i) your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes included or received by you. Roverpass cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members.
Where applicable, or based upon request from a RV Park, Roverpass may issue a valid VAT invoice to such RV Park.
You understand and acknowledge that appropriate governmental agencies, departments or authorities (the "Tax Authority") where your Accommodation is located may require Taxes to be collected from Guests or RV Parks on the amount paid for the right to use and/or occupancy of accommodations, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these taxes may be required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the rent or Accommodation Fees set by RV Parks, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes called "occupancy taxes," "hotel taxes," "lodging taxes," "transient taxes," "sales and use taxes," "value added taxes," "room taxes" or "tourist taxes" (hereafter, "Occupancy Taxes").
A. Occupancy Tax Collection and Remittance
In certain jurisdictions, Roverpass may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes from or on behalf of Guests or RV Parks, in accordance with your directions in these Terms ("Collection and Remittance") if such tax jurisdiction asserts Roverpass or RV Parks have a tax collection and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, whether you are a Guest or RV Park, in lieu of the RV Park collecting Occupancy taxes from Guests and remitting to the Tax Authority, you hereby instruct and authorize Roverpass (via Roverpass Payments) to collect Occupancy Taxes from Guests on the RV Park's behalf at the time Accommodation Fees are collected, and to remit such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority. When Roverpass facilitates Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes in a jurisdiction for the first time, Roverpass will provide notice to existing RV Parks with Listings for Accommodations in such jurisdictions. When a new Listing is created in a jurisdiction where Roverpass facilitates Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, the RV Park will be notified in the Listing creation flow.
The amount of Occupancy Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by Roverpass will be visible to and separately stated to both Guests and RV Parks on their respective transaction documents. Where Roverpass is directly facilitating Collection and Remittance, Guests and RV Parks agree that RV Parks are not permitted to attempt collection, or collect any Occupancy Taxes relating to their Accommodations on Roverpass in that such jurisdiction. You expressly agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Roverpass and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, debts, obligations, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and/or accounting fees, arising out of or in any way related to Occupancy Taxes, including, without limitation, the applicability of, calculation, collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes in any amount or at all as to your transactions or Accommodations. For any jurisdiction in which we facilitate Collection and Remittance, RV Parks and Guests expressly grant us permission, without further notice, to store, transfer and disclose data and other information relating to them or to their transactions, bookings, Accommodations and Occupancy Taxes, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information such as RV Park or Guest's name, Listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes collected from Guests or allegedly due, contact information and similar information, to the relevant Tax Authority.
B. Opt-in to RV Park Remittance of Taxes
In other jurisdictions, Roverpass may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate Occupancy Tax collection on behalf of RV Parks and Guests in accordance with a RV Park's direction to opt in to a specific Occupancy Tax line item in the booking process, in which the RV Park directs that Occupancy Taxes from Guests be sent directly to the RV Park so that the RV Park will remit such taxes directly to Tax Authority ("Opt-in for RV Park Remittance"). In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate Collection by Opt-in for RV Park Remittance, whether you are a Guest or RV Park, you hereby instruct and authorize Roverpass (via Roverpass Payments) to send Occupancy Taxes received from Guests at the time Accommodation Fees are collected to the RV Park who is obligated to send such taxes to the Tax Authority directly. If Roverpass offers and a RV Park selects Opt-in for RV Park Remittance in any jurisdiction, RV Parks and Guests remain solely responsible and liable for the payment and remittance of any and all taxes that may apply to Accommodations; you agree and understand that Roverpass is not responsible for, and will not send any such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority under Opt-in to RV Park Remittance of Taxes. You hereby agree that through third party payment processors, Roverpass is merely processing Your election and direction to have Occupancy Taxes from Guests sent directly to the RV Park for remittance by the RV Park to the Tax Authority, and that You will remit all amounts collected from Guests as Occupancy Taxes to such Tax Authority. You expressly agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Roverpass and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, debts, obligations, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and/or accounting fees, arising out of or in any way related to Occupancy Taxes, including, without limitation, the applicability of, calculation of, collection of Occupancy Taxes in any amount or at all as to your transactions or Accommodations. For any jurisdiction in which we facilitate Opt-in for RV Park Remittance, RV Parks and Guests expressly grant us permission, without further notice, to store, transfer and disclose data and other information relating to them or to their transactions, bookings, Accommodations and Occupancy Taxes, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information such as RV Park or Guest’s name, Listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes received by RV Parks from Guests, or allegedly due, contact information and similar information, to the relevant Tax Authority.
C. Miscellaneous Occupancy Tax Provisions
Whether you are a Guest or RV Park, you agree that any claim or cause of action relating to Roverpass's facilitation of Opt-in for RV Park Remittance or Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that may be used by Roverpass in connection with facilitation of Opt-in Remittance or Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, if any. Guests and RV Parks agree that we may seek additional amounts from You in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected by Roverpass from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.
In any jurisdiction in which we have not provided notice of, or are not facilitating (or are no longer facilitating) the collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes by Collection and Remittance, Opt-in for RV Park Remittance or any other means or method, in your jurisdiction, RV Parks and Guests remain solely responsible and liable for the collection and/or remittance of any and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations.
RV Parks and Guests acknowledge and agree that in some jurisdictions, Roverpass may decide not to facilitate collection or remittance of Occupancy Taxes or may not be able to facilitate the collection and/or remittance of Occupancy Taxes, and nothing contained in these Terms of Service is a representation or guarantee that Roverpass will facilitate collection and/or remittance of Occupancy Tax anywhere at all, including in any specific jurisdiction, or that Roverpass will continue to facilitate any collection or remittance of Occupancy Tax in any specific jurisdiction in which it may have been offered. Roverpass reserves the right, in its sole determination, to cease any facilitation of any collection and remittance of Occupancy Tax (regardless of method used or to be used in the future) for any reason or no reason at all, provided that it will give RV Parks reasonable notice in any jurisdiction in which Roverpass determines to cease any such facilitation.
11. Foreign Currency
Roverpass's online platform facilitates bookings between Guests and RV Parks who may prefer to pay in a currency different from their destination currency, which may require foreign currency conversions to accommodate these differing currency preferences. Although the Roverpass platform allows users to view the price of Listings in a number of currencies, the currencies available for users to make and receive payments may be limited, and may not include the default currency in any given geographic location.
Details regarding currency conversion, including any associated fees, are detailed in the Payments Terms.
12. Damage to Accommodations and Security Deposits
As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation in the condition it was in when you arrived. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Guest, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation. In the event that a RV Park claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage ("Damage Claim"), including but not limited to photographs, you agree to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items.
RV Parks may choose to include security deposits in their Listings ("Security Deposits"). Each Listing will describe whether a Security Deposit is required for the applicable Accommodation. Roverpass will use commercially reasonable efforts to address RV Parks' requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but Roverpass is not responsible for administering or accepting any Damage Claims by RV Parks related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.
If a RV Park makes a Damage Claim for a confirmed booking of an Accommodation, you as a Guest will be notified of any Damage Claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond. Thereafter, Roverpass (via Roverpass Payments) will collect any such costs from you and/or against the Security Deposit in accordance with thePayments Terms. Roverpass also reserves the right to otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to Roverpass in this regard in situations in which you have been determined, in Roverpass's sole discretion, to have damaged any Accommodation, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by RV Parks under the Roverpass RV Park Guarantee, and in relation to any payments made by Roverpass (or Roverpass Payments) to RV Parks.
Both Guests and RV Parks agree to cooperate with and assist Roverpass in good faith, and to provide Roverpass with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Roverpass, in connection with any Damage Claims or other complaints or claims made by Members relating to Accommodations or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the Roverpass RV Park Guarantee) or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Roverpass or a representative of Roverpass regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services. If you are a Guest, upon Roverpass's reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a RV Park, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by Roverpass or a third party selected by Roverpass or its insurer, with respect to losses for which the RV Park is requesting payment from Roverpass under the Roverpass RV Park Guarantee.
If you are a Guest, you understand and agree that Roverpass may make a claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for or to an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including without limitation amounts paid by Roverpass under the Roverpass RV Park Guarantee). You agree to cooperate with and assist Roverpass in good faith, and to provide Roverpass with such information as may be reasonably requested by Roverpass, in order to make a claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Roverpass may reasonably request to assist Roverpass in accomplishing the foregoing Security Deposits, if required by a RV Park, may be applied to any fees due from a Guest overstaying at a Listing without the RV Park's consent.
13. Overstaying without the RV Park's Consent
Guests agree that a confirmed booking is merely a license granted by the RV Park to the Guest to enter and use the Listing for the limited duration of the confirmed booking and in accordance with the Guest's agreement with the RV Park. Guests further agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the checkout time that the RV Park specifies in the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between the RV Park and Guest. If a Guest stays past the agreed upon checkout time without the RV Park's consent, they no longer have a license to stay in the Listing and the RV Park is entitled to make the Guest leave. In addition, Guests agree that the RV Park can charge the Guest, for each 24 hour period that the Guest stays over the agreed period without the RV Park's consent, an additional nightly fee of two times the average nightly Accommodation Fee originally paid by the Guest to cover the inconvenience suffered by the RV Park, plus all applicable Service Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the RV Park to make the Guest leave (collectively, "Additional Sums"). Roverpass Payments will collect Additional Sums from Guests pursuant to the Payments Terms.

You acknowledge and agree that (i) these Terms are concluded between you and Roverpass only, and not Apple, and (ii) Roverpass, not Apple, is solely responsible for the App Store Sourced Application and content thereof. Your use of the App Store Sourced Application must comply with the App Store Terms of Services.
You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App Store Sourced Application.
In the event of any failure of the App Store Sourced Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App Store Sourced Application to you and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App Store Sourced Application. As between Roverpass and Apple, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of Roverpass.
You and Roverpass acknowledge that, as between Roverpass and Apple, Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of the App Store Sourced Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App Store Sourced Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.
You and Roverpass acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced Application infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, as between Roverpass and Apple, Roverpass, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms.
You and Roverpass acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.
Without limiting any other terms of these Terms, you must comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the App Store Sourced Application.

30. Entire Agreement
Except as they may be supplemented by additional Roverpass policies, guidelines, standards, or terms for a specific product, feature, service or offering, these Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Roverpass and you regarding the Site, Application, Services, Collective Content (excluding Payment Services), and any bookings or Listings of Accommodations made via the Site, Application and Services (excluding Payment Services), and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Roverpass and you regarding bookings or listings of Accommodations, the Site, Application, Services, and Collective Content (excluding Payment Services).
31. Assignment
You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Roverpass's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Roverpass may assign or transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
32. Notices
Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by Roverpass (i) via email (in each case to the address that you provide) or (ii) by posting to the Site or via the Application. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
33. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms and your use of the Services will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, San Francisco, California or a United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.
34. Dispute Resolution
If you reside in the United States, you and Roverpass agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site, Application or Collective Content (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding mediation, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Roverpass are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Roverpass otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.
Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Modification" section above, if Roverpass changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated" date above or in the date of Roverpass's email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Roverpass in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
35. General
The failure of Roverpass to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Roverpass. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
36. Third party beneficiary
These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
