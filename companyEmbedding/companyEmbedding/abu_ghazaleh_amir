However, since our launch AGIP has consistently been at the forefront of efforts to improve the infrastructure of IP in the Arab world. To this end, AGIP has worked in close coordination with Arab governments and multilateral organizations on introducing an efficient IP system that has brought up significant changes to the region. With the new system, major multinational corporations have been given the confidence to expand to the region and plan major investments, as they are now assured that their investments are appropriately protected. In addition, the creative Arab individuals, such as architects, artists, designers, scientists, musicians and writers, are encouraged to render more creations, as their hard work is properly rewarded and their creations are effectively protected.AGIP also assisted and supported governmental committees and officials charged in revising and drafting new laws and regulations for the enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) in several Arab countries, such as Bahrain, Lebanon, Yemen, Oman, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. This commitment to IP protection has been reinforced through AGIP’s continued involvement with international organizations, including the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO); with NGOs such as the International Trademark Association (INTA), International Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property (AIPPI), International Federation of Intellectual Property Attorneys (FICPI), and through our funding support of Arab NGOs, such as the Arab Society for Intellectual Property (ASIP) and the Licensing Executives Society-Arab Countries (LES-AC). AGIP has organized and sponsored, in coordination with WIPO, ASIP and WTO relevant training for members of the judiciary and district attorneys in various Arab countries. AGIP is also proud to have published numerous ground-breaking reference works on IP in the Arab world, including the compilation of an English translation of all the Arab Intellectual Property laws, and publishing of a major Intellectual Property Dictionary.
