National Oilwell Varco IncNOV Expands Completion Tool Technology Product OfferingTwitterFacebookLinkedInGooglePlusRedditPinterestUrlJun 01 2017 22:15 BSTSource: Business Wire

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 1, 2017--
      National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NYSE: NOV) announced today the
      introduction of several new proprietary technologies to its completion
      tools portfolio:
    


        Bulldog Frac™ - a sliding-sleeve annular fracturing system that
        provides pinpoint accuracy, zonal isolation, and improved reliability;
      

        Bullmastiff™ - a ball-drop openhole sliding-sleeve sand control
        fracturing system;
      

        Rottweiler™ - a product family of compact, high-performance frac plugs
        for the plug-and-perf market;
      

        ReAct™ - an intelligent completion tool technology that offers remote
        signaling capabilities for valves and sleeves for a variety of
        applications and completion designs; and
      

        German Oil Tools – a line of advanced liner hanger systems and other
        completion tool technologies, products, and accessories.
      


      “We are proud to unveil this meaningful expansion to our portfolio of
      leading-edge completion tool technologies,” commented Clay Williams, NOV
      Chairman, President, and CEO. “NOV now offers a comprehensive set of
      differentiated completion tool products and solutions that we believe
      address the most pressing needs within the global marketplace.”
    

      “We acquired a small completion tool company in mid-2016 that had
      limited scale and geographical reach but offered a high-quality sliding
      sleeve product line, strong portfolio of intellectual property, and
      solid team. Over the past year, this team organically developed several
      complementary products and supplemented that development with
      acquisitions of what we believe are best-in-class liner hanger and
      intelligent completion tool technologies. Today our completion tool
      business operates in 10 countries, has approximately 100 patents issued
      or pending, and we continue to expand our operations.”
    

Bulldog Frac Pinpoint Annular Fracturing System


      The Bulldog Frac annular fracturing system enables operators to
      precisely control the placement of proppant in each stage by pumping
      down the coiled tubing annulus through Multiple Open/Close (MOC) sliding
      sleeves, providing for an unlimited number of stages and leaving no
      restrictions in the wellbore. The Bulldog Frac system addresses the
      operational challenges of most MOC systems with a “shift up to open”
      design, performed with NOV’s proprietary hydraulic shifting tool, which
      ensures no sleeves are accidentally closed on the trip out. Unlike
      competitors’ products, Bulldog frac sleeves are compact, lightweight,
      and do not require handling pup joints, allowing for safer and more
      efficient installation. Additionally, the Bulldog incorporates NOV’s
      patented and field-proven sealing system, which offers full pressure
      testing of previously manipulated sleeves even after several years in
      service.
    

Bullmastiff Openhole Sand Control Ball-Drop Fracturing System


      The Bullmastiff fracturing system is a proprietary openhole
      sliding-sleeve system that incorporates sand screens to eliminate costly
      sand-production issues while maximizing hydrocarbon production. The
      ball-drop frac sleeve component is the first to allow for proppant
      stimulation with integral sand control, segregating the stimulation port
      from the production port. The Bullmastiff incorporates NOV’s patented
      flex sleeve and sealing technology to allow for maximum stage-count
      flexibility.
    

Rottweiler Frac Plugs


      Compact, large-bore Rottweiler frac plugs are the shortest on the market
      but still offer optimum performance during fracturing operations.
      Rottweiler frac plugs can be pumped in at high displacement rates, hold
      high differential pressure, and are easily milled. Additionally,
      Rottweiler frac plugs are the only products to offer a built-in chemical
      tracer that provides real-time data on reservoir characteristics during
      frac jobs to enhance production. Rottweiler frac plugs are currently
      available in cast-iron, with a composite version expected to be released
      in the near future.
    

ReAct Remote Activation Technology


      The ReAct product family, which was acquired from Omega Completion
      Technology, offers remote signaling capabilities to downhole valves and
      sleeves. The technology can be utilized for a number of applications
      including programmable sleeves, which respond to a particular pressure
      or flow signal and require no hydraulic or umbilical lines to surface.
      The ReAct technology currently has applications for inflow control (for
      water shutoff or zonal isolation), liner hanger deployment, production
      packer setting, and wellbore cleanup in preparation for flow-through
      sand screen completions. These interventionless solutions provide the
      lowest-cost intelligent completion technologies on the market.
    

German Oil Tools Liner Hanger Technologies


      German Oil Tools offers a proven portfolio of well-construction and
      completion products that are highly regarded for quality and reliability
      and are currently sold in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The
      operation, which includes GPS Oil Tools, will continue to develop and
      manufacture products in Germany to retain high standards of quality,
      craftsmanship, and innovation, but will benefit from NOV’s global sales
      organization and supply chain to accelerate its ability to meet
      customers’ growing demand for reliable, cost-efficient completions
      solutions around the world.
