Southampton Caught In Ethics Turmoil

CELEBRATING the return of a Republican majority to the Southampton Town Board during its yearly organizational meeting on Monday, Councilwoman Linda Kabot described it as ''a new day'' for town government while Councilman Dennis Suskind, a Democrat, grumbled that ''there are those on Long Island who believe Southampton is run by cronyism, deceit and unethical practices.''Politics as usual, to be sure; but the ''new day'' dawned under a cloud that has hung over Town Hall for a month, since a majority of the town ethics board resigned to protest what it described as the town supervisor's obstruction of a board investigation.Last spring, Mr. Suskind filed a complaint with the ethics board alleging that the town supervisor, Patrick Heaney, strong-armed a candidate for town attorney by threatening to expose the lawyer's arrest record if he did not withdraw from consideration. Mr. Heaney, in an interview on Tuesday, denied making any threats, saying he only offered advice that the record could become known if the lawyer, John Shields, continued to pursue the job.Town Justice Court records show Mr. Shields was charged on Jan. 9, 2003, with driving while intoxicated and refusing to take a sobriety test, both misdemeanors, and at the same time received a traffic ticket for driving outside his lane. The records also show that on Feb. 25, 2003, Justice Thomas DeMayo approved a settlement in which Mr. Shields's D.W.I. was reduced to a speeding ticket, for which he was fined $135, and the other two charges were dismissed.

In a March 27 letter, Mr. Shields, an assistant state attorney general, notified the board that he was withdrawing from consideration for the appointed town post. A copy of an aborted Town Board resolution approving Mr. Shields's appointment was co-sponsored by all the Town Board members except Mr. Heaney. In May, Stephen Brown was appointed to the post on a part-time basis at a $73,200 annual salary, and was reappointed on Monday with a full-time salary of $94,700.

On Dec. 8, five of the ethics board's six members resigned. Christine Merser, the board's former chairwoman, said members tried for several months to interview Mr. Heaney but were rebuffed.''We really did have no choice but to resign,'' she said. ''It became about why the town should have an ethics board at all if it is going to be rendered completely useless.''The board is empowered to advise town employees on ethical questions and to report to the Town Board on whether an allegation of impropriety has merit, deserves a full investigation, or should be referred to law enforcement.Mr. Heaney called the resignations an empty gesture. ''One might speculate,'' he said, ''that a majority of the ethics board, at the time their departure occurred, knew they were not likely to be appointed.'' The terms of all six members were to have expired on Dec. 31. A new board was appointed last week.The supervisor also contended that Mr. Suskind was trying to position himself for a run for town supervisor in two years. ''This was all about 'How can I embarrass my potential opponent?''' Mr. Heaney said. Mr. Suskind acknowledged that one of the resigned ethics board members, Ms. Merser, worked as a strategist on his campaign two years ago, and that another, Gail Davenport, is married to a town Democratic committeeman. But all three rebutted Mr. Heaney's charge of a partisan setup.''We were so careful to not be political,'' Ms. Davenport said. ''We waited until after the election to resign, and we really tried to uphold the integrity of anyone who came before us.'' Citing confidentiality rules, none of the former members would comment publicly on the specifics of their inquiry.

Before the resignations, the board suggested that Mr. Suskind seek a criminal investigation by the district attorney's office. Last week, he said he was still considering it. He had filed a complaint with the D.A. months ago, but prosecutors said the matter could not be pursued because Mr. Shields declined to help. So Mr. Suskind went to the ethics board.In his memo to the board, he alleged that because Mr. Heaney could not dissuade the four council members from appointing Mr. Shields, ''he threatened to ruin Mr. Shields's reputation, embarrass his family, and, if appointed, to not let him into the supervisor's office.''

The memo goes on to say that, when confronted in a closed-door meeting, Mr. Heaney admitted saying those things.In asking for a determination on whether the supervisor violated either the town or state ethics codes, Mr. Suskind wrote, ''The issue is, I believe, whether his behavior was in excess of his authority, perhaps illegal, but clearly unacceptable behavior by an elected official.''Mr. Heaney vehemently denied making any threats. He claimed Mr. Shields ''failed to disclose pertinent information.''''My crime is that I stood my ground and could not possibly support this individual,'' he said of Mr. Shields. ''I only told him he was taking an extreme risk. I told him, 'I know more about you than you could ever want me to know, and you're a damned fool if you go forward with this.'''The town attorney, Mr. Brown, wrote on Dec. 16 that he did not think Mr. Heaney had violated any law. Even if Mr. Suskind's allegations are true, he wrote, ''A 'threat' to disclose factual matters breaches neither ethical nor legal proscriptions.''Mr. Shields, who was a deputy town attorney before joining the state attorney general's office, said he had become a political football.''This is a dispute between two people,'' he said, referring to Mr. Heaney and Mr. Suskind, ''but I'm the one who's going to suffer from this. The ramifications for me are so far-reaching you can't even imagine.'' He declined further comment. Continue reading the main story

Suskind selling Methodist Church in Harbor

May 23, 2008 3:45 PM
By Oliver Peterson Despite his earlier assertions that he would renovate the historic United Methodist Church in Sag Harbor and make it his home, former Southampton Town Board member Dennis Suskind has now listed the building for sale.“It’s really been a personal business decision for Dennis and [his wife,] Cynthia,” the Suskinds’ real estate agent, former Southampton Town Trustee Scott Strough of Strough Associates, said Tuesday. Mr. Strough listed the 170-year-old church for his clients last week but said that despite a rumored $4.8 million price tag, he and the Suskinds have yet to determine an asking price.Mr. Suskind bought the church from the Methodist congregation for $2.9 million when it could no longer maintain the 9,000-square-foot building on Madison Street, but the sale will not officially close until next week.“We’re going to come out with a price soon,” Mr. Strough said.“I’m just exploring selling it, that’s all,” Mr. Suskind said on Tuesday, explaining that his decision is a product of “life and time and age.” Mr. Suskind, a retired Goldman Sachs executive, has listed Morgan Hill Farm, his 12,000-square-foot home on 11.5 acres on Kellis Pond in Bridgehampton, for sale as well, for just under $20 million, and said he’s waiting to see if it or the church sells first.Mr. Suskind came under fire from certain community members when his plans to buy the church and convert it into his home were made public last summer. Activists, including Goat on a Boat Puppet Theater owner Liz Joyce, hoped the church might become a community center for Sag Harbor Village. The Town of Southampton responded by ordering appraisals for a potential Community Preservation Fund purchase in July.“I’m not too hopeful of that happening,” Mr. Strough said of a CPF purchase, but he noted that the Suskinds would allow the town and village every opportunity to purchase the property. Although the appraisals are not public, it’s clear that if the town had offered more for the church than Mr. Suskind, the congregation and Pastor Tom MacLeod likely would have accepted the town’s offer.“They would not share the appraisals,” Mr. Suskind said, adding that he doesn’t expect the town to make a bid now. “They don’t have a need for it,” he said, noting that he’s continuing to do architectural work on the church, designing it to be a home, and the work has been well received by the Sag Harbor Village Architectural Review Board. “I’m doing all of this at the same time,” he said.Cee Scott Brown, chairman of the Sag Harbor ARB, said Tuesday that the church had come before the board as a discussion item several months ago, and members had discussed the placement of a pool, as well as parking issues, on the property, which covers less than a half acre.“It was very cursory,” Mr. Brown said, noting that the board had suggested that Mr. Suskind push the pool as far back from Madison Street as possible, screen it from the road and reduce the amount of parking.Any proposal to buy the church will require “a significant amount of hard money,” Mr. Strough said, explaining that acquisition is only the first expense for a purchase. Additional money would be needed for maintenance, repairs and any redesign to accommodate a new use, be it a home or community center.Despite the hurdles, Ms. Joyce is still optimistic about the recent turn of events.“I think it’s really nice that there’s another opportunity” for the town to buy the church, she said, adding, “The good part is, there’s not a church in there anymore.”The congregation is no longer actively worshipping in the building, which removes constitutional issues inherent in transforming the church into a community center, something Ms. Joyce had to contend with last year.Ms. Joyce suggested the church would also be a perfect building for expanding the John Jermain Memorial Library, which has been seeking an additional building for years. A library, she said, is by its nature a community center anyway, and the church comes already equipped with a playground and parking.The congregation is currently attending the St. David’s African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church on Eastville Avenue in Sag Harbor while its members await construction of their new church on Carroll Street, off the Bridgehampton-Sag Harbor Turnpike. The congregation has maintained ownership of the large stained glass windows at their original church and they will be installed at the new building on Carroll Street.“Part of my contract with them is they own the windows,” Mr. Suskind said.Because the windows are not part of the original and protected historic structure and were added later, they are not legally bound to remain in the church, but the building exterior cannot be changed. Mr. Strough said that standard clear windows are part of the structure and the stained glass were simply placed on top.

Background
Dennis Suskind joined J. Aron & Company in 1961 where he served as executive vice president with responsibility for the worldwide precious metal trading operations. In 1980, he became a general partner of Goldman Sachs upon its acquisition of J. Aron & Company where he led the metals operations for the next 10 years until his retirement in 1990.
Under his leadership, J. Aron worked closely with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on developing hedge exemptions and went on to build the largest precious metals arbitrage business in the world. He sent his team literally around the world to educate producers and consumers on the reasons for using futures as their pricing medium in order to help grow open interest and bring credibility to these markets.[4]
Suskind served on the Futures Industry Association's (FIA) board of directors from 1988 to 1991, and in 1991 he received a distinguished achievement award from the International Precious Metals Institute.[5]
During his tenure in trading metals, Suskind served as vice chairman of NYMEX, vice chairman of COMEX, a member of the board of directors of Futures Industry Association, a member of the board of directors of International Precious Metals Institute, chairperson of the Financial Times International Gold Conferences and a member of the boards of the Gold and Silver Institutes in Washington. In 2006, he was inducted into the FIA's Futures Hall of Fame.  
Suskind served as an elected official of the town of Southampton. He has also served as a member of the President's Council of the Peconic Land Trust, president of Brown University's Parent's Council, a founding member of Mt. Sinai's Hospital Associates, a board member of the Nature Conservancy, and a board member of the Collegiate School and Marymount Schools in New York, among others.
