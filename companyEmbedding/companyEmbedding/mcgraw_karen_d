Key Features

LearnSmart
LearnSmart is an adaptive study tool proven to strengthen memory recall, increase class retention, and boost grades. Students are able to study more efficiently because they are made aware of what they know and don’t know. Real-time reports quickly identify the concepts that require more attention from individual students—or the entire class.


Integrated eBook
When learning tools are interactive, content is more approachable and engagement is deeper. Connect includes an Integrated eBook that builds student comprehension through animation, audio and video. As part of its rich media format, students can insert and review notes, highlight text, conduct searches for specific content and interact with high-impact images.

Body Animat3D
These animated questions enables students to learn and visualize difficult concepts and features pre, during and post questions with every animation. 
More FeaturesCase StudiesEach chapter contains case scenarios placing the student in the role of a health professional faced with a situation where medical lanuage and communication is necessary. 
Consolidated Instructor ResourcesKeeps you organized and productive
So long to piles of paper and stacks of folders. With Connect’s safe storage system, all of your favorite teaching materials—PowerPoint files, manuals, assessments and more—are in one virtual location.
