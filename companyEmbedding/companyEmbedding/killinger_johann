    Buy PDF History »The surname Killinger was first found in  Durham where they held a  family seat as Lords of the Manor. The Saxon influence of English history diminished after the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The language of the courts was French for the next three centuries and the Norman ambience prevailed. But Saxon surnames survived and the family name was first referenced in the 13th century when they held estates and held a family seat at Middleton George.Killinger Spelling VariationsKillinger Spelling VariationsThe first dictionaries that appeared in the last few  hundred years did much to standardize the English language. Before that time,  spelling variations in names were a common occurrence. The language was changing, incorporating pieces of other languages, and the spelling of names changed with it. Killinger has been spelled many different ways, including Killinghall, Kilinghall, Killingall, Kilingal, Kilingall, Kyllinghall and many more.Killinger Early HistoryKillinger Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Killinger research.
