The pool is also more than 12 months seasoned, and the concentration of new vehicles has increased.Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE): 2013-A incorporates a sequential-pay structure. Total initial hard CE in 2013-A for the class A notes is 2.75% (overcollateralization of 2.50% plus a 0.25% [of the initial adjusted receivables balance] initial reserve). Yield supplement OC will be used to boost the transaction's APR, providing expected excess spread of 2.51% per annum. CE is sufficient to cover Fitch's 'AAAsf' stressed loss expectation.Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: In recent years BMWFS' securitizations and serviced portfolio have experienced improved loss performance.Unstable Economic Outlook: A slower recovery and potential for volatility could affect delinquencies and losses. Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including poorer performing vintages from the recent recession in the base case loss expectation.Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes BMWFS to be a capable originator, underwriter, and servicer for prime auto loan collateral, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of its securitizations and managed portfolio.Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of BMW FS would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.Rating SensitivitiesUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of 2013-A to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing limited impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience a downgrade of up to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the accompanying presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the below link.Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: BMW Vehicle Owner Trust 2013-A (US ABS)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextA Senate vote to repeal Obamacare could rattle marketsYahoo FinanceEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredPhil Mickelson trash-talked Jordan Spieth at the Open Championship — and Phil is going to have to eat his wordsBusiness InsiderWhy everybody should be happy that Flash is finally dyingYahoo FinanceAdvanced Micro Devices Could Gain Another 17% Within Hours: ChartThe StreetDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredPrescription for drama as Republicans try to agree on health planYahoo Finance VideoIt's Fed decision day — here's what to watchYahoo FinanceFord falls despite beat, AMD eyes fresh high, Scripps takeover talk ramps upYahoo FinanceTrunk Club.

Fitch Affirms BMW Vehicle Owner Trust 2013-A; Outlook Stable | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms BMW Vehicle Owner Trust 2013-A; Outlook Stable
    





August 26, 2015 05:21 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings affirms the outstanding classes of the BMW Vehicle Owner 
      Trust 2013-A as detailed below:
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating upgrades and affirmations are based on available credit 
      enhancement (CE) and loss performance. The collateral pool continues to 
      perform within Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and 
      CE, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent 
      with the assigned ratings and make full payments to investors in 
      accordance with the terms of the documents.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of BMW Financial Services, LLC's retail 
      auto loan originations, the strength of its servicing capabilities, and 
      the sound financial and legal structure of the transactions.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy, and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. Therefore, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'BMW Vehicle Owner Trust 2013-A - Appendix'. 
      These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as 
      detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global Structured Finance Transactions' 
      dated April 17, 2015.

Fixed! Watch Jeep owner abandon self-control, fix problem when a BMW is taking up 2 spaces

April 2, 2017 | Tom Tillison |  Print Article

When you pit a BMW up against a Jeep… fuhgettaboutit.
A Jeep driver came across a BMW taking up two parking spots, the likely product of a proud owner hoping to avoid potential dings on his precious ride — at the expense of all others.






With self-control failing to get the better of the Jeep driver, he commenced to exact a little vigilante justice on behalf of any motorist who has ever had to walk an eternity thanks to a thoughtless car owner taking up two spaces.
It’s not clear where the incident took place, but it was captured on video.
Once completed, the BMW was nicely parked in a single space… albeit a little worse for the wear!

Watch the entire incident unfold below:

ABOUT US - BMW OF DARIEN









Felix Callari had a passion for cars, beautiful, powerful automobiles. Â He opened his BMW dealership in 1967 with the dream to blend that love of cars with the solid relationships he developed with fellow car enthusiasts in the hopes of creating a car business based on trust and knowledge. He did just that when he opened his first dealership with Saab, Triumph and Sunbeam in 1966, later adding BMW and Datsun in 1967.Felix passed away in 2008, but his legacy lives on through his two daughters, Paula Callari (President) and Flavia Callari (Vice President). Â Currently, Callari Auto Group is comprised of BMW of Darien, MINI of Fairfield County and Volvo Cars Westport. Â Each dealership maintains the standards that Mr. Callari instilled in his employees through the many decades prior. Â Customer satisfaction, product knowledge, honesty and transparency. Â Mr. Callari was a true pioneer in the automobile industry, making the customer the number one priority. Â Because of his efforts, the three dealerships that make up Callari Cars are now poised to celebrate a combined 100 years of excellence in the automotive industry.Â In 2017 BMW of Darien will celebrate its 50th year in the car business and while it continues to grow and evolve, its roots are still the constant mantra of 1967, honesty, integrity, product knowledge and service are the cornerstone of success. The relationships that are formed from our commitment are the foundation of our continued success. Â And we are very proud of the work that we do every day to serve our wonderful community.

The BMW i is a sub-brand of BMW founded in 2011 to design and manufacture plug-in electric vehicles.[1][2][3] The company's initial plans call for the release of two vehicles; the i3 all-electric car and the i8 plug-in hybrid. Concept versions of both these vehicles were shown at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.[4]
Series production of the BMW i3 destined for retail customers began in September 2013,[5] and the European market launch took place in November 2013 with the first retail deliveries in Germany.[6] The BMW i8 was launched in Germany in June 2014.[7] The United States, Norway, Germany, and the UK are the main markets for both models.
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which is being given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8] As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released using BMW i technology, the BMW X5 xDrive40e, released in 2015, and the BMW 225xe Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and BMW 740e iPerformance, released in 2016.[9][10]
BMW i sales reached the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[11] Global i3 sales achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[12] Combined global sales of BMW i and iPerformance plug-in hybrid models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, three years after the inception of the i3. BMW's leading electrified model is the i3 with more than 60,000 units sold globally.[13] Two years after its introduction, the BMW i3 became the world's all-time third best selling all-electric car, and remained as such as of December 2016[update].[14][15]

History[edit]
Project i[edit]
BMW's "Project i" is a program created to develop lightweight eco-friendly urban electric car concepts designed to address the mobility and sustainability needs for people who live in megacities.[1][2] According to BMW, "Project i" has three phases. The Mini E demonstration was the first phase of this project, and it was followed by a similar field testing that began in January 2012 with the BMW ActiveE all-electric vehicle. The ActiveE was based on the BMW 1 Series Coupe and built considering the lessons learned from the Mini E trial. The last phase of "Project i" was the development of the i3 and i8 electric cars.[1][16][17]
The automaker expected that its first series production all-electric drive vehicle would help it achieve an overall fleet fuel economy average of 6.63 L/100 km (35.5 mpg) by 2016, as mandated by U.S. federal regulations. BMW expected high volume sales of the i3 to allow the company to continue selling several of its high-performance cars with low fuel economy in the U.S.[16]

In February 2011, BMW announced a new sub-brand, BMW i, to market the vehicles produced under Project i. BMW i vehicles are to be sold separately from BMW or Mini. The first two production models are the BEV (battery electric) Mega City Vehicle, now called BMW i3, and a plug-in hybrid called BMW i8, which is the production version of the Vision Efficient Dynamics concept unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and has an all-electric range of 50 kilometres (31 mi). Production of both plug-in electric cars was scheduled to start in Leipzig in 2013.[3][18]
Global i3 sales passed the 25,000 unit milestone in May 2015.[19] Combined global sales of the BMW i brand models passed the 30,000 mark in June 2015,[20] and the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[11] Global sales of the BMW i3 achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[12]
As of December 2016[update], BMW expects a stable development in the plug-in electric market with low profits the next 5-7 years, until batteries have doubled their capacity,[21] with the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025.[22][23] BMW's next electric development is expected to be the self-driving iNext in 2021.[24]
Stores[edit]
The first BMW i store opened in June 2012 at BMW’s London Park Lane showroom. The carmaker premiered an updated version of the BMW i3 concept electric car and unveiled its i Pedelec electric bicycle concept.[25] On November 15, 2013, retail deliveries for the i3 began with a special ceremony in Munich.[6]
Using eDrive in core-brand BMW models[edit]
On 1 December 2014, BMW announced the group is planning to offer plug-in hybrid versions of all its core-brand models using eDrive technology developed for its BMW i brand plug-in vehicles. The goal of the company is to use plug-in technology to continue offering high performance vehicles while reducing CO2 emissions below 100g/km.[26] In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which will be given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8]
Sales of BMW i and iPerformance designated plug-in hybrid drive models have grown strongly in Europe, accounting for 4% of all BMW vehicles sold in Western Europe in June 2016. The percentage is significantly higher in markets with strong incentives and infrastructural measures, such as Netherlands, with 14.9% of all BMW vehicles sold in June were BMW i or BMW iPerformance models, and Scandinavia with 13.2%. Combined global sales of BMW i or BMW iPerformance models totaled 23,675 units during the first half of 2016. This is the result of the expanded range of electrified models, which includes seven electrified models including plug-in hybrids. Sales of this type of vehicle during the first half of 2016 were just under 87% higher than the same period in 2015.[27] Combined global sales of BMW i and iPerformance plug-in hybrid models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, three years after the inception of the BMW i3.[13]

Products[edit]
As of February 2017[update], only two BMW i models are offered, the BMW i3 all-electric car with optional range-extender (REx), and the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid. BMW intends a family car above the i3 to have an optional range extender.[28] As of May 2016[update], BMW i was present in 50 countries, with both the i3 and i8 plug-in vehicles.[29] In November 2016, BMW announced the company expected to deliver 60,000 of its electrified i and iPerformance models in 2016, and a sales target of 100,000 units for 2017. BMW set the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025.[30] As of December 2016[update], the i3 ranked as the world's third best selling all-electric car in history, including REx variant sales.[15]

As of August 2016[update], a total of 65,638 units of both i brand vehicles had been sold worldwide since 2013, of which, 17,793 units were sold in 2014, 29,513 in 2015, and 16,855 during the first eight months of 2016.[31][32][33][34][35] The United States is the top selling market for both plug-ins, with 23,321 BMW i3s and 4,108 BMW i8s sold through October 2016.[29][36]
The demand for BMW i and iPerformance vehicles increased significantly during the first half of 2016. In June 2016, 4% of all BMW sales in Western Europe were electrified cars,[37] and again in July 2016, the electrified models captured 4% of all BMW sales in the region.[38] In the Netherlands, 43% of BMW 3 Series registrations in July 2016 corresponded to the plug-in hybrid BMW 330e iPerformance model, and 26% of BMW 2 Series Active Tourer registrations were for the BMW 225xe. Those figures were higher in Scandinavia, with the plug-in hybrid versions accounting for 45% of all BMW 3 Series sales, and 55% of all BMW 2 Series Active Tourer sales.[38] Sales of BMW iPerformance vehicles totaled 17,809 units during the first eight months of 2016.[35] Combined global sales of BMW i and BMW iPerformance vehicles totaled 34,664 units from January to August 2016, already exceeding 2015 total net sales of BMW electrified vehicles, and representing 2.3% of total BMW global sales during the first eight months of 2016.[35][39] In November 2016, more than one third of total BMWs sales in the Dutch market were electrified models.[40]
Sales of BMW plug-in hybrid and i3 electric cars in China totaled 1,796 units during the first nine months of 2016.[41] In the United States, sales of plug-in electric models represented 3.5% of BMW total sales in the country between January and June 2016, the highest share of plug-in vehicles sold for any carmaker in the American market except for Tesla Motors.[42] In July 2016, the i3 achieved a 7.5% share of all BMW passenger car sales in the American market. Accounting for all BMW plug-ins (i3, i8, X5 xDrive40e and 330e) sold in July 2016 (2,375 units), BMW also achieved a 9.2% share of the brand's total passenger and light trucks sales.[43]
Global sales of all plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 i3s, over 10,000 i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.[13] Combined global sales of BMW’s electrified models totaled more than 62,000 units in 2016.[44] More than 10,000 BMW i and iPerformance models were delivered worldwide during the first two months of 2017, up 110.1% on the same period the previous year.[45]
BMW i3[edit]
Main article: BMW i3
Design and technology[edit]
The BMW i3 is an electric car, BMW's first zero emissions mass-produced vehicle. The i3 is the first volume production vehicle on the market featuring carbon-fiber reinforced plastic.[46] This vehicle gets its power from an electric motor powered by lithium-ion batteries. The i3 is built for everyday use, with an all-electric range of 130 to 160 km (81 to 99 mi). BMW is offering a range extender (“REx”) option powered by a 647 cc two-cylinder gasoline engine with a 9 L (2.0 imp gal; 2.4 US gal) fuel tank that engages when the battery level drops to a pre-specified point, acting purely as a generator to produce electricity to extend the range to about 240 to 300 km (150 to 190 mi).[47]




BMW i3 charging


According to BMW, at the beginning of the i3 release, the use of range-extender was much more than the carmaker expected, more than 60%. Over time it has decreased significantly, with some people almost never using it, and by early 2016 it is being regularly used in fewer than 5% of i3s.[28]
In May 2016, BMW announced that the 2017 model year (MY) BMW i3 will come with an improved battery pack with 50% more capacity (33 kWh) than the previous model with a corresponding range increase expected to achieve 114 mi (183 km) under the EPA cycle, and 195 mi (314 km) under the New European Driving Cycle.[29][48] The Range Extender (REx) variant features the same higher capacity battery as the all-electric model, with a corresponding all-electric range increase.[29] Deliveries of the 2017 MY i3 in the U.S. market began in the third quarter of 2016.[49] Both variants with the improved battery are available in the UK starting in July 2016.[48]
Production[edit]
BMW invested US$100 million to build a plant in Moses Lake, Washington to manufacture the carbon-fiber reinforced plastic used on the vehicles' body panels.[16] The plant is located in an area that has large access to hydroelectric power.[16] The carbon fiber is then shipped to Germany, where it first gets fabricated and is then shipped to the automotive production plant in Leipzig.[16]
Markets and sales[edit]

In 2016 the i3 also ranked as the fifth top selling plug-in electric car.[15] All sales figures include the REx variant.




Norway has the largest BMW i3 market penetration per capita in the world.[55]


Since its introduction, global cumulative sales totaled about 65,500 units through December 2016, making the i3 the world's all-time third best-selling all-electric car after the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S. These figure includes REx sales.[15] As of November 2016[update], three years after its market launch, the i3 is the top selling BMW electrified model, and accounts for 60% of combined BMW i and BMW iPerformance models.[13]
As of December 2016[update], the United States is the i3 top selling market with 24,741 units sold since its inception,[29][56][57] with the REx variant outselling the pure electric version at a 3:1 ratio.[58] The other top markets are Norway with 8,034 new units registered through November 2016,[59][60][61][62] Germany with 7,493 units registered through November 2016,[63][64][65][66] and the UK with almost 6,000 i3s sold through October 2016.[67]
Two years after it market launch, the BMW i3 became the top selling electric vehicle in Germany. In Norway the BMW i3 was the best-selling model across the entire BMW range during 2015.[14] Norway has the world's largest i3 market penetration per capita due to its population size,[55] As of November 2016[update], Norway is also the world's second largest market for the BMW i3, accounting for more than 13% of total i3 production since inception.[68] In another achievement, the BMW i3 ranked as the top selling new passenger car model in Norway in November 2016, capturing a market share of 7.7% of total new car sales.[62][69]

BMW i8[edit]
Main article: BMW i8
The BMW i8 plug-in hybrid is the production version of the BMW Vision Efficient Dynamics concept unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and has an all-electric range of 35 kilometres (22 mi). Production of both plug-in electric cars is scheduled to start in Leipzig in 2013.[3] Powering the front wheels will be an electric motor (131 hp), while the rear wheels will make use of a 1.5-litre 3-cylinder gasoline engine (231 hp).[70] Zero to 60 mph sprint timings are estimated to be less than 4.5 seconds using both power sources.[4] The positioning of the motor and engine over the axles also makes it benefit from a 50/50 weight distribution.[70]

^ The i8 does not run on 100% electricity as it consumes 0.1 gallons per 100 mi in EV mode.






BMW iPerformance[edit]




The BMW X5 xDrive40e is a plug-in hybrid with an all-electric range of 23 km (14 mi) that uses BMW i cars technology.


Launched in Europe and the U.S. in 2015, the BMW X5 xDrive40e is the first plug-in hybrid released under the core BMW brand. The use of BMW's eDrive technology on the established X5 platform is a direct technology transfer from the BMW i cars, in particular, from the BMW i8 technology.[9]
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which was given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8] The first BMW car launched to the market with the "iPerformance" model designation was the BMW 330e iPerformance, initially named the 330e. Deliveries in the American market began in the second quarter of 2016.[90] The new designation was also used on the plug-in hybrid variants of the new BMW 7 Series, the BMW 740e iPerformance.[8]
The iPerformance models take advantage of technical expertise regarding electric motors, battery cells and electronic control systems. Visible indicators for the vehicles with this designation are a BMW i logo on the front side panel, BMW i-style blue elements in the kidney grille and wheel hubs, and an eDrive logo on the C-pillar. Customers can also make use of the BMW i 360° ELECTRIC range of products and services, including the BMW i Wallbox.[8]
As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released, the BMW X5 xDrive40e, BMW 225xe Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and the BMW 740e iPerformance.[10] The BMW 530e iPerformance is scheduled to be released in Europe March 2017 as part of the upcoming seventh generation BMW 5 Series lineup.[91] The Mini Cooper S E Countryman ALL4 plug-in hybrid release is slated for June 2017.[92]

The BMW i is a sub-brand of BMW founded in 2011 to design and manufacture plug-in electric vehicles.[1][2][3] The company's initial plans call for the release of two vehicles; the i3 all-electric car and the i8 plug-in hybrid. Concept versions of both these vehicles were shown at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.[4]
Series production of the BMW i3 destined for retail customers began in September 2013,[5] and the European market launch took place in November 2013 with the first retail deliveries in Germany.[6] The BMW i8 was launched in Germany in June 2014.[7] The United States, Norway, Germany, and the UK are the main markets for both models.
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which is being given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8] As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released using BMW i technology, the BMW X5 xDrive40e, released in 2015, and the BMW 225xe Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and BMW 740e iPerformance, released in 2016.[9][10]
BMW i sales reached the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[11] Global i3 sales achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[12] Combined global sales of BMW i and iPerformance plug-in hybrid models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, three years after the inception of the i3. BMW's leading electrified model is the i3 with more than 60,000 units sold globally.[13] Two years after its introduction, the BMW i3 became the world's all-time third best selling all-electric car, and remained as such as of December 2016[update].[14][15]

History[edit]
Project i[edit]
BMW's "Project i" is a program created to develop lightweight eco-friendly urban electric car concepts designed to address the mobility and sustainability needs for people who live in megacities.[1][2] According to BMW, "Project i" has three phases. The Mini E demonstration was the first phase of this project, and it was followed by a similar field testing that began in January 2012 with the BMW ActiveE all-electric vehicle. The ActiveE was based on the BMW 1 Series Coupe and built considering the lessons learned from the Mini E trial. The last phase of "Project i" was the development of the i3 and i8 electric cars.[1][16][17]
The automaker expected that its first series production all-electric drive vehicle would help it achieve an overall fleet fuel economy average of 6.63 L/100 km (35.5 mpg) by 2016, as mandated by U.S. federal regulations. BMW expected high volume sales of the i3 to allow the company to continue selling several of its high-performance cars with low fuel economy in the U.S.[16]

In February 2011, BMW announced a new sub-brand, BMW i, to market the vehicles produced under Project i. BMW i vehicles are to be sold separately from BMW or Mini. The first two production models are the BEV (battery electric) Mega City Vehicle, now called BMW i3, and a plug-in hybrid called BMW i8, which is the production version of the Vision Efficient Dynamics concept unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and has an all-electric range of 50 kilometres (31 mi). Production of both plug-in electric cars was scheduled to start in Leipzig in 2013.[3][18]
Global i3 sales passed the 25,000 unit milestone in May 2015.[19] Combined global sales of the BMW i brand models passed the 30,000 mark in June 2015,[20] and the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[11] Global sales of the BMW i3 achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[12]
As of December 2016[update], BMW expects a stable development in the plug-in electric market with low profits the next 5-7 years, until batteries have doubled their capacity,[21] with the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025.[22][23] BMW's next electric development is expected to be the self-driving iNext in 2021.[24]
Stores[edit]
The first BMW i store opened in June 2012 at BMW’s London Park Lane showroom. The carmaker premiered an updated version of the BMW i3 concept electric car and unveiled its i Pedelec electric bicycle concept.[25] On November 15, 2013, retail deliveries for the i3 began with a special ceremony in Munich.[6]
Using eDrive in core-brand BMW models[edit]
On 1 December 2014, BMW announced the group is planning to offer plug-in hybrid versions of all its core-brand models using eDrive technology developed for its BMW i brand plug-in vehicles. The goal of the company is to use plug-in technology to continue offering high performance vehicles while reducing CO2 emissions below 100g/km.[26] In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which will be given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8]
Sales of BMW i and iPerformance designated plug-in hybrid drive models have grown strongly in Europe, accounting for 4% of all BMW vehicles sold in Western Europe in June 2016. The percentage is significantly higher in markets with strong incentives and infrastructural measures, such as Netherlands, with 14.9% of all BMW vehicles sold in June were BMW i or BMW iPerformance models, and Scandinavia with 13.2%. Combined global sales of BMW i or BMW iPerformance models totaled 23,675 units during the first half of 2016. This is the result of the expanded range of electrified models, which includes seven electrified models including plug-in hybrids. Sales of this type of vehicle during the first half of 2016 were just under 87% higher than the same period in 2015.[27] Combined global sales of BMW i and iPerformance plug-in hybrid models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, three years after the inception of the BMW i3.[13]

Products[edit]
As of February 2017[update], only two BMW i models are offered, the BMW i3 all-electric car with optional range-extender (REx), and the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid. BMW intends a family car above the i3 to have an optional range extender.[28] As of May 2016[update], BMW i was present in 50 countries, with both the i3 and i8 plug-in vehicles.[29] In November 2016, BMW announced the company expected to deliver 60,000 of its electrified i and iPerformance models in 2016, and a sales target of 100,000 units for 2017. BMW set the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025.[30] As of December 2016[update], the i3 ranked as the world's third best selling all-electric car in history, including REx variant sales.[15]

As of August 2016[update], a total of 65,638 units of both i brand vehicles had been sold worldwide since 2013, of which, 17,793 units were sold in 2014, 29,513 in 2015, and 16,855 during the first eight months of 2016.[31][32][33][34][35] The United States is the top selling market for both plug-ins, with 23,321 BMW i3s and 4,108 BMW i8s sold through October 2016.[29][36]
The demand for BMW i and iPerformance vehicles increased significantly during the first half of 2016. In June 2016, 4% of all BMW sales in Western Europe were electrified cars,[37] and again in July 2016, the electrified models captured 4% of all BMW sales in the region.[38] In the Netherlands, 43% of BMW 3 Series registrations in July 2016 corresponded to the plug-in hybrid BMW 330e iPerformance model, and 26% of BMW 2 Series Active Tourer registrations were for the BMW 225xe. Those figures were higher in Scandinavia, with the plug-in hybrid versions accounting for 45% of all BMW 3 Series sales, and 55% of all BMW 2 Series Active Tourer sales.[38] Sales of BMW iPerformance vehicles totaled 17,809 units during the first eight months of 2016.[35] Combined global sales of BMW i and BMW iPerformance vehicles totaled 34,664 units from January to August 2016, already exceeding 2015 total net sales of BMW electrified vehicles, and representing 2.3% of total BMW global sales during the first eight months of 2016.[35][39] In November 2016, more than one third of total BMWs sales in the Dutch market were electrified models.[40]
Sales of BMW plug-in hybrid and i3 electric cars in China totaled 1,796 units during the first nine months of 2016.[41] In the United States, sales of plug-in electric models represented 3.5% of BMW total sales in the country between January and June 2016, the highest share of plug-in vehicles sold for any carmaker in the American market except for Tesla Motors.[42] In July 2016, the i3 achieved a 7.5% share of all BMW passenger car sales in the American market. Accounting for all BMW plug-ins (i3, i8, X5 xDrive40e and 330e) sold in July 2016 (2,375 units), BMW also achieved a 9.2% share of the brand's total passenger and light trucks sales.[43]
Global sales of all plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 i3s, over 10,000 i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.[13] Combined global sales of BMW’s electrified models totaled more than 62,000 units in 2016.[44] More than 10,000 BMW i and iPerformance models were delivered worldwide during the first two months of 2017, up 110.1% on the same period the previous year.[45]
BMW i3[edit]
Main article: BMW i3
Design and technology[edit]
The BMW i3 is an electric car, BMW's first zero emissions mass-produced vehicle. The i3 is the first volume production vehicle on the market featuring carbon-fiber reinforced plastic.[46] This vehicle gets its power from an electric motor powered by lithium-ion batteries. The i3 is built for everyday use, with an all-electric range of 130 to 160 km (81 to 99 mi). BMW is offering a range extender (“REx”) option powered by a 647 cc two-cylinder gasoline engine with a 9 L (2.0 imp gal; 2.4 US gal) fuel tank that engages when the battery level drops to a pre-specified point, acting purely as a generator to produce electricity to extend the range to about 240 to 300 km (150 to 190 mi).[47]




BMW i3 charging


According to BMW, at the beginning of the i3 release, the use of range-extender was much more than the carmaker expected, more than 60%. Over time it has decreased significantly, with some people almost never using it, and by early 2016 it is being regularly used in fewer than 5% of i3s.[28]
In May 2016, BMW announced that the 2017 model year (MY) BMW i3 will come with an improved battery pack with 50% more capacity (33 kWh) than the previous model with a corresponding range increase expected to achieve 114 mi (183 km) under the EPA cycle, and 195 mi (314 km) under the New European Driving Cycle.[29][48] The Range Extender (REx) variant features the same higher capacity battery as the all-electric model, with a corresponding all-electric range increase.[29] Deliveries of the 2017 MY i3 in the U.S. market began in the third quarter of 2016.[49] Both variants with the improved battery are available in the UK starting in July 2016.[48]
Production[edit]
BMW invested US$100 million to build a plant in Moses Lake, Washington to manufacture the carbon-fiber reinforced plastic used on the vehicles' body panels.[16] The plant is located in an area that has large access to hydroelectric power.[16] The carbon fiber is then shipped to Germany, where it first gets fabricated and is then shipped to the automotive production plant in Leipzig.[16]
Markets and sales[edit]

In 2016 the i3 also ranked as the fifth top selling plug-in electric car.[15] All sales figures include the REx variant.




Norway has the largest BMW i3 market penetration per capita in the world.[55]


Since its introduction, global cumulative sales totaled about 65,500 units through December 2016, making the i3 the world's all-time third best-selling all-electric car after the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S. These figure includes REx sales.[15] As of November 2016[update], three years after its market launch, the i3 is the top selling BMW electrified model, and accounts for 60% of combined BMW i and BMW iPerformance models.[13]
As of December 2016[update], the United States is the i3 top selling market with 24,741 units sold since its inception,[29][56][57] with the REx variant outselling the pure electric version at a 3:1 ratio.[58] The other top markets are Norway with 8,034 new units registered through November 2016,[59][60][61][62] Germany with 7,493 units registered through November 2016,[63][64][65][66] and the UK with almost 6,000 i3s sold through October 2016.[67]
Two years after it market launch, the BMW i3 became the top selling electric vehicle in Germany. In Norway the BMW i3 was the best-selling model across the entire BMW range during 2015.[14] Norway has the world's largest i3 market penetration per capita due to its population size,[55] As of November 2016[update], Norway is also the world's second largest market for the BMW i3, accounting for more than 13% of total i3 production since inception.[68] In another achievement, the BMW i3 ranked as the top selling new passenger car model in Norway in November 2016, capturing a market share of 7.7% of total new car sales.[62][69]

BMW i8[edit]
Main article: BMW i8
The BMW i8 plug-in hybrid is the production version of the BMW Vision Efficient Dynamics concept unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and has an all-electric range of 35 kilometres (22 mi). Production of both plug-in electric cars is scheduled to start in Leipzig in 2013.[3] Powering the front wheels will be an electric motor (131 hp), while the rear wheels will make use of a 1.5-litre 3-cylinder gasoline engine (231 hp).[70] Zero to 60 mph sprint timings are estimated to be less than 4.5 seconds using both power sources.[4] The positioning of the motor and engine over the axles also makes it benefit from a 50/50 weight distribution.[70]

^ The i8 does not run on 100% electricity as it consumes 0.1 gallons per 100 mi in EV mode.






BMW iPerformance[edit]




The BMW X5 xDrive40e is a plug-in hybrid with an all-electric range of 23 km (14 mi) that uses BMW i cars technology.


Launched in Europe and the U.S. in 2015, the BMW X5 xDrive40e is the first plug-in hybrid released under the core BMW brand. The use of BMW's eDrive technology on the established X5 platform is a direct technology transfer from the BMW i cars, in particular, from the BMW i8 technology.[9]
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which was given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8] The first BMW car launched to the market with the "iPerformance" model designation was the BMW 330e iPerformance, initially named the 330e. Deliveries in the American market began in the second quarter of 2016.[90] The new designation was also used on the plug-in hybrid variants of the new BMW 7 Series, the BMW 740e iPerformance.[8]
The iPerformance models take advantage of technical expertise regarding electric motors, battery cells and electronic control systems. Visible indicators for the vehicles with this designation are a BMW i logo on the front side panel, BMW i-style blue elements in the kidney grille and wheel hubs, and an eDrive logo on the C-pillar. Customers can also make use of the BMW i 360° ELECTRIC range of products and services, including the BMW i Wallbox.[8]
As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released, the BMW X5 xDrive40e, BMW 225xe Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and the BMW 740e iPerformance.[10] The BMW 530e iPerformance is scheduled to be released in Europe March 2017 as part of the upcoming seventh generation BMW 5 Series lineup.[91] The Mini Cooper S E Countryman ALL4 plug-in hybrid release is slated for June 2017.[92]

The BMW i is a sub-brand of BMW founded in 2011 to design and manufacture plug-in electric vehicles.[1][2][3] The company's initial plans call for the release of two vehicles; the i3 all-electric car and the i8 plug-in hybrid. Concept versions of both these vehicles were shown at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.[4]
Series production of the BMW i3 destined for retail customers began in September 2013,[5] and the European market launch took place in November 2013 with the first retail deliveries in Germany.[6] The BMW i8 was launched in Germany in June 2014.[7] The United States, Norway, Germany, and the UK are the main markets for both models.
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which is being given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8] As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released using BMW i technology, the BMW X5 xDrive40e, released in 2015, and the BMW 225xe Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and BMW 740e iPerformance, released in 2016.[9][10]
BMW i sales reached the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[11] Global i3 sales achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[12] Combined global sales of BMW i and iPerformance plug-in hybrid models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, three years after the inception of the i3. BMW's leading electrified model is the i3 with more than 60,000 units sold globally.[13] Two years after its introduction, the BMW i3 became the world's all-time third best selling all-electric car, and remained as such as of December 2016[update].[14][15]

History[edit]
Project i[edit]
BMW's "Project i" is a program created to develop lightweight eco-friendly urban electric car concepts designed to address the mobility and sustainability needs for people who live in megacities.[1][2] According to BMW, "Project i" has three phases. The Mini E demonstration was the first phase of this project, and it was followed by a similar field testing that began in January 2012 with the BMW ActiveE all-electric vehicle. The ActiveE was based on the BMW 1 Series Coupe and built considering the lessons learned from the Mini E trial. The last phase of "Project i" was the development of the i3 and i8 electric cars.[1][16][17]
The automaker expected that its first series production all-electric drive vehicle would help it achieve an overall fleet fuel economy average of 6.63 L/100 km (35.5 mpg) by 2016, as mandated by U.S. federal regulations. BMW expected high volume sales of the i3 to allow the company to continue selling several of its high-performance cars with low fuel economy in the U.S.[16]

In February 2011, BMW announced a new sub-brand, BMW i, to market the vehicles produced under Project i. BMW i vehicles are to be sold separately from BMW or Mini. The first two production models are the BEV (battery electric) Mega City Vehicle, now called BMW i3, and a plug-in hybrid called BMW i8, which is the production version of the Vision Efficient Dynamics concept unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and has an all-electric range of 50 kilometres (31 mi). Production of both plug-in electric cars was scheduled to start in Leipzig in 2013.[3][18]
Global i3 sales passed the 25,000 unit milestone in May 2015.[19] Combined global sales of the BMW i brand models passed the 30,000 mark in June 2015,[20] and the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[11] Global sales of the BMW i3 achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[12]
As of December 2016[update], BMW expects a stable development in the plug-in electric market with low profits the next 5-7 years, until batteries have doubled their capacity,[21] with the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025.[22][23] BMW's next electric development is expected to be the self-driving iNext in 2021.[24]
Stores[edit]
The first BMW i store opened in June 2012 at BMW’s London Park Lane showroom. The carmaker premiered an updated version of the BMW i3 concept electric car and unveiled its i Pedelec electric bicycle concept.[25] On November 15, 2013, retail deliveries for the i3 began with a special ceremony in Munich.[6]
Using eDrive in core-brand BMW models[edit]
On 1 December 2014, BMW announced the group is planning to offer plug-in hybrid versions of all its core-brand models using eDrive technology developed for its BMW i brand plug-in vehicles. The goal of the company is to use plug-in technology to continue offering high performance vehicles while reducing CO2 emissions below 100g/km.[26] In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which will be given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8]
Sales of BMW i and iPerformance designated plug-in hybrid drive models have grown strongly in Europe, accounting for 4% of all BMW vehicles sold in Western Europe in June 2016. The percentage is significantly higher in markets with strong incentives and infrastructural measures, such as Netherlands, with 14.9% of all BMW vehicles sold in June were BMW i or BMW iPerformance models, and Scandinavia with 13.2%. Combined global sales of BMW i or BMW iPerformance models totaled 23,675 units during the first half of 2016. This is the result of the expanded range of electrified models, which includes seven electrified models including plug-in hybrids. Sales of this type of vehicle during the first half of 2016 were just under 87% higher than the same period in 2015.[27] Combined global sales of BMW i and iPerformance plug-in hybrid models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, three years after the inception of the BMW i3.[13]

Products[edit]
As of February 2017[update], only two BMW i models are offered, the BMW i3 all-electric car with optional range-extender (REx), and the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid. BMW intends a family car above the i3 to have an optional range extender.[28] As of May 2016[update], BMW i was present in 50 countries, with both the i3 and i8 plug-in vehicles.[29] In November 2016, BMW announced the company expected to deliver 60,000 of its electrified i and iPerformance models in 2016, and a sales target of 100,000 units for 2017. BMW set the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025.[30] As of December 2016[update], the i3 ranked as the world's third best selling all-electric car in history, including REx variant sales.[15]

As of August 2016[update], a total of 65,638 units of both i brand vehicles had been sold worldwide since 2013, of which, 17,793 units were sold in 2014, 29,513 in 2015, and 16,855 during the first eight months of 2016.[31][32][33][34][35] The United States is the top selling market for both plug-ins, with 23,321 BMW i3s and 4,108 BMW i8s sold through October 2016.[29][36]
The demand for BMW i and iPerformance vehicles increased significantly during the first half of 2016. In June 2016, 4% of all BMW sales in Western Europe were electrified cars,[37] and again in July 2016, the electrified models captured 4% of all BMW sales in the region.[38] In the Netherlands, 43% of BMW 3 Series registrations in July 2016 corresponded to the plug-in hybrid BMW 330e iPerformance model, and 26% of BMW 2 Series Active Tourer registrations were for the BMW 225xe. Those figures were higher in Scandinavia, with the plug-in hybrid versions accounting for 45% of all BMW 3 Series sales, and 55% of all BMW 2 Series Active Tourer sales.[38] Sales of BMW iPerformance vehicles totaled 17,809 units during the first eight months of 2016.[35] Combined global sales of BMW i and BMW iPerformance vehicles totaled 34,664 units from January to August 2016, already exceeding 2015 total net sales of BMW electrified vehicles, and representing 2.3% of total BMW global sales during the first eight months of 2016.[35][39] In November 2016, more than one third of total BMWs sales in the Dutch market were electrified models.[40]
Sales of BMW plug-in hybrid and i3 electric cars in China totaled 1,796 units during the first nine months of 2016.[41] In the United States, sales of plug-in electric models represented 3.5% of BMW total sales in the country between January and June 2016, the highest share of plug-in vehicles sold for any carmaker in the American market except for Tesla Motors.[42] In July 2016, the i3 achieved a 7.5% share of all BMW passenger car sales in the American market. Accounting for all BMW plug-ins (i3, i8, X5 xDrive40e and 330e) sold in July 2016 (2,375 units), BMW also achieved a 9.2% share of the brand's total passenger and light trucks sales.[43]
Global sales of all plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 i3s, over 10,000 i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.[13] Combined global sales of BMW’s electrified models totaled more than 62,000 units in 2016.[44] More than 10,000 BMW i and iPerformance models were delivered worldwide during the first two months of 2017, up 110.1% on the same period the previous year.[45]
BMW i3[edit]
Main article: BMW i3
Design and technology[edit]
The BMW i3 is an electric car, BMW's first zero emissions mass-produced vehicle. The i3 is the first volume production vehicle on the market featuring carbon-fiber reinforced plastic.[46] This vehicle gets its power from an electric motor powered by lithium-ion batteries. The i3 is built for everyday use, with an all-electric range of 130 to 160 km (81 to 99 mi). BMW is offering a range extender (“REx”) option powered by a 647 cc two-cylinder gasoline engine with a 9 L (2.0 imp gal; 2.4 US gal) fuel tank that engages when the battery level drops to a pre-specified point, acting purely as a generator to produce electricity to extend the range to about 240 to 300 km (150 to 190 mi).[47]




BMW i3 charging


According to BMW, at the beginning of the i3 release, the use of range-extender was much more than the carmaker expected, more than 60%. Over time it has decreased significantly, with some people almost never using it, and by early 2016 it is being regularly used in fewer than 5% of i3s.[28]
In May 2016, BMW announced that the 2017 model year (MY) BMW i3 will come with an improved battery pack with 50% more capacity (33 kWh) than the previous model with a corresponding range increase expected to achieve 114 mi (183 km) under the EPA cycle, and 195 mi (314 km) under the New European Driving Cycle.[29][48] The Range Extender (REx) variant features the same higher capacity battery as the all-electric model, with a corresponding all-electric range increase.[29] Deliveries of the 2017 MY i3 in the U.S. market began in the third quarter of 2016.[49] Both variants with the improved battery are available in the UK starting in July 2016.[48]
Production[edit]
BMW invested US$100 million to build a plant in Moses Lake, Washington to manufacture the carbon-fiber reinforced plastic used on the vehicles' body panels.[16] The plant is located in an area that has large access to hydroelectric power.[16] The carbon fiber is then shipped to Germany, where it first gets fabricated and is then shipped to the automotive production plant in Leipzig.[16]
Markets and sales[edit]

The first i3 deliveries to retail customers in Europe took place at the official market launch ceremony held in Munich on 15 November 2013.[6] The i3 was also launched in the UK in November 2013.[50] The release in the American market took place in May 2014.[51] As of November 2015[update], the core phase of the market introduction of the i3 was finished, with only some smaller markets are still to follow.[14] As of May 2016[update], BMW i3 was available in 50 countries.[29]
The i3 ranked third among all-electric cars sold worldwide in 2014.[52][53] BMW i3 sales grew from 16,052 units in 2014 to 24,057 in 2015,[32][33] allowing the i3 to rank for the second year in a row as the world's third best selling all-electric car. Also in 2015 the i3 ranked fifth among the world's top selling plug-in electric cars.[54] About 25,500 units were delivered worldwide in 2016, up 6% from 2015, allowing the BMW i3 to rank in 2016 for the third year running as the world's third best-selling all-electric car. In 2016 the i3 also ranked as the fifth top selling plug-in electric car.[15] All sales figures include the REx variant.




Norway has the largest BMW i3 market penetration per capita in the world.[55]


Since its introduction, global cumulative sales totaled about 65,500 units through December 2016, making the i3 the world's all-time third best-selling all-electric car after the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S. These figure includes REx sales.[15] As of November 2016[update], three years after its market launch, the i3 is the top selling BMW electrified model, and accounts for 60% of combined BMW i and BMW iPerformance models.[13]
As of December 2016[update], the United States is the i3 top selling market with 24,741 units sold since its inception,[29][56][57] with the REx variant outselling the pure electric version at a 3:1 ratio.[58] The other top markets are Norway with 8,034 new units registered through November 2016,[59][60][61][62] Germany with 7,493 units registered through November 2016,[63][64][65][66] and the UK with almost 6,000 i3s sold through October 2016.[67]
Two years after it market launch, the BMW i3 became the top selling electric vehicle in Germany. In Norway the BMW i3 was the best-selling model across the entire BMW range during 2015.[14] Norway has the world's largest i3 market penetration per capita due to its population size,[55] As of November 2016[update], Norway is also the world's second largest market for the BMW i3, accounting for more than 13% of total i3 production since inception.[68] In another achievement, the BMW i3 ranked as the top selling new passenger car model in Norway in November 2016, capturing a market share of 7.7% of total new car sales.[62][69]

BMW i8[edit]
Main article: BMW i8
The BMW i8 plug-in hybrid is the production version of the BMW Vision Efficient Dynamics concept unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and has an all-electric range of 35 kilometres (22 mi). Production of both plug-in electric cars is scheduled to start in Leipzig in 2013.[3] Powering the front wheels will be an electric motor (131 hp), while the rear wheels will make use of a 1.5-litre 3-cylinder gasoline engine (231 hp).[70] Zero to 60 mph sprint timings are estimated to be less than 4.5 seconds using both power sources.[4] The positioning of the motor and engine over the axles also makes it benefit from a 50/50 weight distribution.[70]

^ The EPA classifies the i3 REx as a series plug-in hybrid or EREV[80][82][87] while CARB as a range-extended battery-electric vehicle (BEVx).[88] Since June 2014 the BMW i3 REx is the most fuel efficient EPA-certified vehicle current year vehicle with a gasoline engine in terms of its MPG-e combined gasoline/electricity rating.[81]
^ The i8 does not run on 100% electricity as it consumes 0.1 gallons per 100 mi in EV mode.






BMW iPerformance[edit]




The BMW X5 xDrive40e is a plug-in hybrid with an all-electric range of 23 km (14 mi) that uses BMW i cars technology.


Launched in Europe and the U.S. in 2015, the BMW X5 xDrive40e is the first plug-in hybrid released under the core BMW brand. The use of BMW's eDrive technology on the established X5 platform is a direct technology transfer from the BMW i cars, in particular, from the BMW i8 technology.[9]
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which was given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8] The first BMW car launched to the market with the "iPerformance" model designation was the BMW 330e iPerformance, initially named the 330e. Deliveries in the American market began in the second quarter of 2016.[90] The new designation was also used on the plug-in hybrid variants of the new BMW 7 Series, the BMW 740e iPerformance.[8]
The iPerformance models take advantage of technical expertise regarding electric motors, battery cells and electronic control systems. Visible indicators for the vehicles with this designation are a BMW i logo on the front side panel, BMW i-style blue elements in the kidney grille and wheel hubs, and an eDrive logo on the C-pillar. Customers can also make use of the BMW i 360° ELECTRIC range of products and services, including the BMW i Wallbox.[8]
As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released, the BMW X5 xDrive40e, BMW 225xe Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and the BMW 740e iPerformance.[10] The BMW 530e iPerformance is scheduled to be released in Europe March 2017 as part of the upcoming seventh generation BMW 5 Series lineup.[91] The Mini Cooper S E Countryman ALL4 plug-in hybrid release is slated for June 2017.[92]

The BMW i is a sub-brand of BMW founded in 2011 to design and manufacture plug-in electric vehicles.[1][2][3] The company's initial plans call for the release of two vehicles; the i3 all-electric car and the i8 plug-in hybrid. Concept versions of both these vehicles were shown at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.[4]
Series production of the BMW i3 destined for retail customers began in September 2013,[5] and the European market launch took place in November 2013 with the first retail deliveries in Germany.[6] The BMW i8 was launched in Germany in June 2014.[7] The United States, Norway, Germany, and the UK are the main markets for both models.
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which is being given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8] As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released using BMW i technology, the BMW X5 xDrive40e, released in 2015, and the BMW 225xe Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and BMW 740e iPerformance, released in 2016.[9][10]
BMW i sales reached the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[11] Global i3 sales achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[12] Combined global sales of BMW i and iPerformance plug-in hybrid models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, three years after the inception of the i3. BMW's leading electrified model is the i3 with more than 60,000 units sold globally.[13] Two years after its introduction, the BMW i3 became the world's all-time third best selling all-electric car, and remained as such as of December 2016[update].[14][15]

History[edit]
Project i[edit]
BMW's "Project i" is a program created to develop lightweight eco-friendly urban electric car concepts designed to address the mobility and sustainability needs for people who live in megacities.[1][2] According to BMW, "Project i" has three phases. The Mini E demonstration was the first phase of this project, and it was followed by a similar field testing that began in January 2012 with the BMW ActiveE all-electric vehicle. The ActiveE was based on the BMW 1 Series Coupe and built considering the lessons learned from the Mini E trial. The last phase of "Project i" was the development of the i3 and i8 electric cars.[1][16][17]
The automaker expected that its first series production all-electric drive vehicle would help it achieve an overall fleet fuel economy average of 6.63 L/100 km (35.5 mpg) by 2016, as mandated by U.S. federal regulations. BMW expected high volume sales of the i3 to allow the company to continue selling several of its high-performance cars with low fuel economy in the U.S.[16]

In February 2011, BMW announced a new sub-brand, BMW i, to market the vehicles produced under Project i. BMW i vehicles are to be sold separately from BMW or Mini. The first two production models are the BEV (battery electric) Mega City Vehicle, now called BMW i3, and a plug-in hybrid called BMW i8, which is the production version of the Vision Efficient Dynamics concept unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and has an all-electric range of 50 kilometres (31 mi). Production of both plug-in electric cars was scheduled to start in Leipzig in 2013.[3][18]
Global i3 sales passed the 25,000 unit milestone in May 2015.[19] Combined global sales of the BMW i brand models passed the 30,000 mark in June 2015,[20] and the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[11] Global sales of the BMW i3 achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[12]
As of December 2016[update], BMW expects a stable development in the plug-in electric market with low profits the next 5-7 years, until batteries have doubled their capacity,[21] with the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025.[22][23] BMW's next electric development is expected to be the self-driving iNext in 2021.[24]
Stores[edit]
The first BMW i store opened in June 2012 at BMW’s London Park Lane showroom. The carmaker premiered an updated version of the BMW i3 concept electric car and unveiled its i Pedelec electric bicycle concept.[25] On November 15, 2013, retail deliveries for the i3 began with a special ceremony in Munich.[6]
Using eDrive in core-brand BMW models[edit]
On 1 December 2014, BMW announced the group is planning to offer plug-in hybrid versions of all its core-brand models using eDrive technology developed for its BMW i brand plug-in vehicles. The goal of the company is to use plug-in technology to continue offering high performance vehicles while reducing CO2 emissions below 100g/km.[26] In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which will be given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8]
Sales of BMW i and iPerformance designated plug-in hybrid drive models have grown strongly in Europe, accounting for 4% of all BMW vehicles sold in Western Europe in June 2016. The percentage is significantly higher in markets with strong incentives and infrastructural measures, such as Netherlands, with 14.9% of all BMW vehicles sold in June were BMW i or BMW iPerformance models, and Scandinavia with 13.2%. Combined global sales of BMW i or BMW iPerformance models totaled 23,675 units during the first half of 2016. This is the result of the expanded range of electrified models, which includes seven electrified models including plug-in hybrids. Sales of this type of vehicle during the first half of 2016 were just under 87% higher than the same period in 2015.[27] Combined global sales of BMW i and iPerformance plug-in hybrid models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, three years after the inception of the BMW i3.[13]

Products[edit]
As of February 2017[update], only two BMW i models are offered, the BMW i3 all-electric car with optional range-extender (REx), and the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid. BMW intends a family car above the i3 to have an optional range extender.[28] As of May 2016[update], BMW i was present in 50 countries, with both the i3 and i8 plug-in vehicles.[29] In November 2016, BMW announced the company expected to deliver 60,000 of its electrified i and iPerformance models in 2016, and a sales target of 100,000 units for 2017. BMW set the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025.[30] As of December 2016[update], the i3 ranked as the world's third best selling all-electric car in history, including REx variant sales.[15]

As of August 2016[update], a total of 65,638 units of both i brand vehicles had been sold worldwide since 2013, of which, 17,793 units were sold in 2014, 29,513 in 2015, and 16,855 during the first eight months of 2016.[31][32][33][34][35] The United States is the top selling market for both plug-ins, with 23,321 BMW i3s and 4,108 BMW i8s sold through October 2016.[29][36]
The demand for BMW i and iPerformance vehicles increased significantly during the first half of 2016. In June 2016, 4% of all BMW sales in Western Europe were electrified cars,[37] and again in July 2016, the electrified models captured 4% of all BMW sales in the region.[38] In the Netherlands, 43% of BMW 3 Series registrations in July 2016 corresponded to the plug-in hybrid BMW 330e iPerformance model, and 26% of BMW 2 Series Active Tourer registrations were for the BMW 225xe. Those figures were higher in Scandinavia, with the plug-in hybrid versions accounting for 45% of all BMW 3 Series sales, and 55% of all BMW 2 Series Active Tourer sales.[38] Sales of BMW iPerformance vehicles totaled 17,809 units during the first eight months of 2016.[35] Combined global sales of BMW i and BMW iPerformance vehicles totaled 34,664 units from January to August 2016, already exceeding 2015 total net sales of BMW electrified vehicles, and representing 2.3% of total BMW global sales during the first eight months of 2016.[35][39] In November 2016, more than one third of total BMWs sales in the Dutch market were electrified models.[40]
Sales of BMW plug-in hybrid and i3 electric cars in China totaled 1,796 units during the first nine months of 2016.[41] In the United States, sales of plug-in electric models represented 3.5% of BMW total sales in the country between January and June 2016, the highest share of plug-in vehicles sold for any carmaker in the American market except for Tesla Motors.[42] In July 2016, the i3 achieved a 7.5% share of all BMW passenger car sales in the American market. Accounting for all BMW plug-ins (i3, i8, X5 xDrive40e and 330e) sold in July 2016 (2,375 units), BMW also achieved a 9.2% share of the brand's total passenger and light trucks sales.[43]
Global sales of all plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 i3s, over 10,000 i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.[13] Combined global sales of BMW’s electrified models totaled more than 62,000 units in 2016.[44] More than 10,000 BMW i and iPerformance models were delivered worldwide during the first two months of 2017, up 110.1% on the same period the previous year.[45]
BMW i3[edit]
Main article: BMW i3
Design and technology[edit]
The BMW i3 is an electric car, BMW's first zero emissions mass-produced vehicle. The i3 is the first volume production vehicle on the market featuring carbon-fiber reinforced plastic.[46] This vehicle gets its power from an electric motor powered by lithium-ion batteries. The i3 is built for everyday use, with an all-electric range of 130 to 160 km (81 to 99 mi). BMW is offering a range extender (“REx”) option powered by a 647 cc two-cylinder gasoline engine with a 9 L (2.0 imp gal; 2.4 US gal) fuel tank that engages when the battery level drops to a pre-specified point, acting purely as a generator to produce electricity to extend the range to about 240 to 300 km (150 to 190 mi).[47]




BMW i3 charging


According to BMW, at the beginning of the i3 release, the use of range-extender was much more than the carmaker expected, more than 60%. Over time it has decreased significantly, with some people almost never using it, and by early 2016 it is being regularly used in fewer than 5% of i3s.[28]
In May 2016, BMW announced that the 2017 model year (MY) BMW i3 will come with an improved battery pack with 50% more capacity (33 kWh) than the previous model with a corresponding range increase expected to achieve 114 mi (183 km) under the EPA cycle, and 195 mi (314 km) under the New European Driving Cycle.[29][48] The Range Extender (REx) variant features the same higher capacity battery as the all-electric model, with a corresponding all-electric range increase.[29] Deliveries of the 2017 MY i3 in the U.S. market began in the third quarter of 2016.[49] Both variants with the improved battery are available in the UK starting in July 2016.[48]
Production[edit]
BMW invested US$100 million to build a plant in Moses Lake, Washington to manufacture the carbon-fiber reinforced plastic used on the vehicles' body panels.[16] The plant is located in an area that has large access to hydroelectric power.[16] The carbon fiber is then shipped to Germany, where it first gets fabricated and is then shipped to the automotive production plant in Leipzig.[16]
Markets and sales[edit]

The first i3 deliveries to retail customers in Europe took place at the official market launch ceremony held in Munich on 15 November 2013.[6] The i3 was also launched in the UK in November 2013.[50] The release in the American market took place in May 2014.[51] As of November 2015[update], the core phase of the market introduction of the i3 was finished, with only some smaller markets are still to follow.[14] As of May 2016[update], BMW i3 was available in 50 countries.[29]
The i3 ranked third among all-electric cars sold worldwide in 2014.[52][53] BMW i3 sales grew from 16,052 units in 2014 to 24,057 in 2015,[32][33] allowing the i3 to rank for the second year in a row as the world's third best selling all-electric car. Also in 2015 the i3 ranked fifth among the world's top selling plug-in electric cars.[54] About 25,500 units were delivered worldwide in 2016, up 6% from 2015, allowing the BMW i3 to rank in 2016 for the third year running as the world's third best-selling all-electric car. In 2016 the i3 also ranked as the fifth top selling plug-in electric car.[15] All sales figures include the REx variant.




Norway has the largest BMW i3 market penetration per capita in the world.[55]


Since its introduction, global cumulative sales totaled about 65,500 units through December 2016, making the i3 the world's all-time third best-selling all-electric car after the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S. These figure includes REx sales.[15] As of November 2016[update], three years after its market launch, the i3 is the top selling BMW electrified model, and accounts for 60% of combined BMW i and BMW iPerformance models.[13]
As of December 2016[update], the United States is the i3 top selling market with 24,741 units sold since its inception,[29][56][57] with the REx variant outselling the pure electric version at a 3:1 ratio.[58] The other top markets are Norway with 8,034 new units registered through November 2016,[59][60][61][62] Germany with 7,493 units registered through November 2016,[63][64][65][66] and the UK with almost 6,000 i3s sold through October 2016.[67]
Two years after it market launch, the BMW i3 became the top selling electric vehicle in Germany. In Norway the BMW i3 was the best-selling model across the entire BMW range during 2015.[14] Norway has the world's largest i3 market penetration per capita due to its population size,[55] As of November 2016[update], Norway is also the world's second largest market for the BMW i3, accounting for more than 13% of total i3 production since inception.[68] In another achievement, the BMW i3 ranked as the top selling new passenger car model in Norway in November 2016, capturing a market share of 7.7% of total new car sales.[62][69]

BMW i8[edit]
Main article: BMW i8
The BMW i8 plug-in hybrid is the production version of the BMW Vision Efficient Dynamics concept unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and has an all-electric range of 35 kilometres (22 mi). Production of both plug-in electric cars is scheduled to start in Leipzig in 2013.[3] Powering the front wheels will be an electric motor (131 hp), while the rear wheels will make use of a 1.5-litre 3-cylinder gasoline engine (231 hp).[70] Zero to 60 mph sprint timings are estimated to be less than 4.5 seconds using both power sources.[4] The positioning of the motor and engine over the axles also makes it benefit from a 50/50 weight distribution.[70]

^ Between May 2014 and October 2016 the all-electric BMW i3 60 A·h was the most fuel efficient EPA-certified vehicle of all years regardless of fuel type.[84][85][86]
^ The EPA classifies the i3 REx as a series plug-in hybrid or EREV[80][82][87] while CARB as a range-extended battery-electric vehicle (BEVx).[88] Since June 2014 the BMW i3 REx is the most fuel efficient EPA-certified vehicle current year vehicle with a gasoline engine in terms of its MPG-e combined gasoline/electricity rating.[81]
^ The i8 does not run on 100% electricity as it consumes 0.1 gallons per 100 mi in EV mode.






BMW iPerformance[edit]




The BMW X5 xDrive40e is a plug-in hybrid with an all-electric range of 23 km (14 mi) that uses BMW i cars technology.


Launched in Europe and the U.S. in 2015, the BMW X5 xDrive40e is the first plug-in hybrid released under the core BMW brand. The use of BMW's eDrive technology on the established X5 platform is a direct technology transfer from the BMW i cars, in particular, from the BMW i8 technology.[9]
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which was given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8] The first BMW car launched to the market with the "iPerformance" model designation was the BMW 330e iPerformance, initially named the 330e. Deliveries in the American market began in the second quarter of 2016.[90] The new designation was also used on the plug-in hybrid variants of the new BMW 7 Series, the BMW 740e iPerformance.[8]
The iPerformance models take advantage of technical expertise regarding electric motors, battery cells and electronic control systems. Visible indicators for the vehicles with this designation are a BMW i logo on the front side panel, BMW i-style blue elements in the kidney grille and wheel hubs, and an eDrive logo on the C-pillar. Customers can also make use of the BMW i 360° ELECTRIC range of products and services, including the BMW i Wallbox.[8]
As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released, the BMW X5 xDrive40e, BMW 225xe Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and the BMW 740e iPerformance.[10] The BMW 530e iPerformance is scheduled to be released in Europe March 2017 as part of the upcoming seventh generation BMW 5 Series lineup.[91] The Mini Cooper S E Countryman ALL4 plug-in hybrid release is slated for June 2017.[92]

The BMW i is a sub-brand of BMW founded in 2011 to design and manufacture plug-in electric vehicles.[1][2][3] The company's initial plans call for the release of two vehicles; the i3 all-electric car and the i8 plug-in hybrid. Concept versions of both these vehicles were shown at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.[4]
Series production of the BMW i3 destined for retail customers began in September 2013,[5] and the European market launch took place in November 2013 with the first retail deliveries in Germany.[6] The BMW i8 was launched in Germany in June 2014.[7] The United States, Norway, Germany, and the UK are the main markets for both models.
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which is being given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8] As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released using BMW i technology, the BMW X5 xDrive40e, released in 2015, and the BMW 225xe Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and BMW 740e iPerformance, released in 2016.[9][10]
BMW i sales reached the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[11] Global i3 sales achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[12] Combined global sales of BMW i and iPerformance plug-in hybrid models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, three years after the inception of the i3. BMW's leading electrified model is the i3 with more than 60,000 units sold globally.[13] Two years after its introduction, the BMW i3 became the world's all-time third best selling all-electric car, and remained as such as of December 2016[update].[14][15]

History[edit]
Project i[edit]
BMW's "Project i" is a program created to develop lightweight eco-friendly urban electric car concepts designed to address the mobility and sustainability needs for people who live in megacities.[1][2] According to BMW, "Project i" has three phases. The Mini E demonstration was the first phase of this project, and it was followed by a similar field testing that began in January 2012 with the BMW ActiveE all-electric vehicle. The ActiveE was based on the BMW 1 Series Coupe and built considering the lessons learned from the Mini E trial. The last phase of "Project i" was the development of the i3 and i8 electric cars.[1][16][17]
The automaker expected that its first series production all-electric drive vehicle would help it achieve an overall fleet fuel economy average of 6.63 L/100 km (35.5 mpg) by 2016, as mandated by U.S. federal regulations. BMW expected high volume sales of the i3 to allow the company to continue selling several of its high-performance cars with low fuel economy in the U.S.[16]

In February 2011, BMW announced a new sub-brand, BMW i, to market the vehicles produced under Project i. BMW i vehicles are to be sold separately from BMW or Mini. The first two production models are the BEV (battery electric) Mega City Vehicle, now called BMW i3, and a plug-in hybrid called BMW i8, which is the production version of the Vision Efficient Dynamics concept unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and has an all-electric range of 50 kilometres (31 mi). Production of both plug-in electric cars was scheduled to start in Leipzig in 2013.[3][18]
Global i3 sales passed the 25,000 unit milestone in May 2015.[19] Combined global sales of the BMW i brand models passed the 30,000 mark in June 2015,[20] and the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[11] Global sales of the BMW i3 achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[12]
As of December 2016[update], BMW expects a stable development in the plug-in electric market with low profits the next 5-7 years, until batteries have doubled their capacity,[21] with the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025.[22][23] BMW's next electric development is expected to be the self-driving iNext in 2021.[24]
Stores[edit]
The first BMW i store opened in June 2012 at BMW’s London Park Lane showroom. The carmaker premiered an updated version of the BMW i3 concept electric car and unveiled its i Pedelec electric bicycle concept.[25] On November 15, 2013, retail deliveries for the i3 began with a special ceremony in Munich.[6]
Using eDrive in core-brand BMW models[edit]
On 1 December 2014, BMW announced the group is planning to offer plug-in hybrid versions of all its core-brand models using eDrive technology developed for its BMW i brand plug-in vehicles. The goal of the company is to use plug-in technology to continue offering high performance vehicles while reducing CO2 emissions below 100g/km.[26] In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which will be given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8]
Sales of BMW i and iPerformance designated plug-in hybrid drive models have grown strongly in Europe, accounting for 4% of all BMW vehicles sold in Western Europe in June 2016. The percentage is significantly higher in markets with strong incentives and infrastructural measures, such as Netherlands, with 14.9% of all BMW vehicles sold in June were BMW i or BMW iPerformance models, and Scandinavia with 13.2%. Combined global sales of BMW i or BMW iPerformance models totaled 23,675 units during the first half of 2016. This is the result of the expanded range of electrified models, which includes seven electrified models including plug-in hybrids. Sales of this type of vehicle during the first half of 2016 were just under 87% higher than the same period in 2015.[27] Combined global sales of BMW i and iPerformance plug-in hybrid models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, three years after the inception of the BMW i3.[13]

Products[edit]
As of February 2017[update], only two BMW i models are offered, the BMW i3 all-electric car with optional range-extender (REx), and the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid. BMW intends a family car above the i3 to have an optional range extender.[28] As of May 2016[update], BMW i was present in 50 countries, with both the i3 and i8 plug-in vehicles.[29] In November 2016, BMW announced the company expected to deliver 60,000 of its electrified i and iPerformance models in 2016, and a sales target of 100,000 units for 2017. BMW set the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025.[30] As of December 2016[update], the i3 ranked as the world's third best selling all-electric car in history, including REx variant sales.[15]

As of August 2016[update], a total of 65,638 units of both i brand vehicles had been sold worldwide since 2013, of which, 17,793 units were sold in 2014, 29,513 in 2015, and 16,855 during the first eight months of 2016.[31][32][33][34][35] The United States is the top selling market for both plug-ins, with 23,321 BMW i3s and 4,108 BMW i8s sold through October 2016.[29][36]
The demand for BMW i and iPerformance vehicles increased significantly during the first half of 2016. In June 2016, 4% of all BMW sales in Western Europe were electrified cars,[37] and again in July 2016, the electrified models captured 4% of all BMW sales in the region.[38] In the Netherlands, 43% of BMW 3 Series registrations in July 2016 corresponded to the plug-in hybrid BMW 330e iPerformance model, and 26% of BMW 2 Series Active Tourer registrations were for the BMW 225xe. Those figures were higher in Scandinavia, with the plug-in hybrid versions accounting for 45% of all BMW 3 Series sales, and 55% of all BMW 2 Series Active Tourer sales.[38] Sales of BMW iPerformance vehicles totaled 17,809 units during the first eight months of 2016.[35] Combined global sales of BMW i and BMW iPerformance vehicles totaled 34,664 units from January to August 2016, already exceeding 2015 total net sales of BMW electrified vehicles, and representing 2.3% of total BMW global sales during the first eight months of 2016.[35][39] In November 2016, more than one third of total BMWs sales in the Dutch market were electrified models.[40]
Sales of BMW plug-in hybrid and i3 electric cars in China totaled 1,796 units during the first nine months of 2016.[41] In the United States, sales of plug-in electric models represented 3.5% of BMW total sales in the country between January and June 2016, the highest share of plug-in vehicles sold for any carmaker in the American market except for Tesla Motors.[42] In July 2016, the i3 achieved a 7.5% share of all BMW passenger car sales in the American market. Accounting for all BMW plug-ins (i3, i8, X5 xDrive40e and 330e) sold in July 2016 (2,375 units), BMW also achieved a 9.2% share of the brand's total passenger and light trucks sales.[43]
Global sales of all plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 i3s, over 10,000 i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.[13] Combined global sales of BMW’s electrified models totaled more than 62,000 units in 2016.[44] More than 10,000 BMW i and iPerformance models were delivered worldwide during the first two months of 2017, up 110.1% on the same period the previous year.[45]
BMW i3[edit]
Main article: BMW i3
Design and technology[edit]
The BMW i3 is an electric car, BMW's first zero emissions mass-produced vehicle. The i3 is the first volume production vehicle on the market featuring carbon-fiber reinforced plastic.[46] This vehicle gets its power from an electric motor powered by lithium-ion batteries. The i3 is built for everyday use, with an all-electric range of 130 to 160 km (81 to 99 mi). BMW is offering a range extender (“REx”) option powered by a 647 cc two-cylinder gasoline engine with a 9 L (2.0 imp gal; 2.4 US gal) fuel tank that engages when the battery level drops to a pre-specified point, acting purely as a generator to produce electricity to extend the range to about 240 to 300 km (150 to 190 mi).[47]




BMW i3 charging


According to BMW, at the beginning of the i3 release, the use of range-extender was much more than the carmaker expected, more than 60%. Over time it has decreased significantly, with some people almost never using it, and by early 2016 it is being regularly used in fewer than 5% of i3s.[28]
In May 2016, BMW announced that the 2017 model year (MY) BMW i3 will come with an improved battery pack with 50% more capacity (33 kWh) than the previous model with a corresponding range increase expected to achieve 114 mi (183 km) under the EPA cycle, and 195 mi (314 km) under the New European Driving Cycle.[29][48] The Range Extender (REx) variant features the same higher capacity battery as the all-electric model, with a corresponding all-electric range increase.[29] Deliveries of the 2017 MY i3 in the U.S. market began in the third quarter of 2016.[49] Both variants with the improved battery are available in the UK starting in July 2016.[48]
Production[edit]
BMW invested US$100 million to build a plant in Moses Lake, Washington to manufacture the carbon-fiber reinforced plastic used on the vehicles' body panels.[16] The plant is located in an area that has large access to hydroelectric power.[16] The carbon fiber is then shipped to Germany, where it first gets fabricated and is then shipped to the automotive production plant in Leipzig.[16]
Markets and sales[edit]

The first i3 deliveries to retail customers in Europe took place at the official market launch ceremony held in Munich on 15 November 2013.[6] The i3 was also launched in the UK in November 2013.[50] The release in the American market took place in May 2014.[51] As of November 2015[update], the core phase of the market introduction of the i3 was finished, with only some smaller markets are still to follow.[14] As of May 2016[update], BMW i3 was available in 50 countries.[29]
The i3 ranked third among all-electric cars sold worldwide in 2014.[52][53] BMW i3 sales grew from 16,052 units in 2014 to 24,057 in 2015,[32][33] allowing the i3 to rank for the second year in a row as the world's third best selling all-electric car. Also in 2015 the i3 ranked fifth among the world's top selling plug-in electric cars.[54] About 25,500 units were delivered worldwide in 2016, up 6% from 2015, allowing the BMW i3 to rank in 2016 for the third year running as the world's third best-selling all-electric car. In 2016 the i3 also ranked as the fifth top selling plug-in electric car.[15] All sales figures include the REx variant.




Norway has the largest BMW i3 market penetration per capita in the world.[55]


Since its introduction, global cumulative sales totaled about 65,500 units through December 2016, making the i3 the world's all-time third best-selling all-electric car after the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model S. These figure includes REx sales.[15] As of November 2016[update], three years after its market launch, the i3 is the top selling BMW electrified model, and accounts for 60% of combined BMW i and BMW iPerformance models.[13]
As of December 2016[update], the United States is the i3 top selling market with 24,741 units sold since its inception,[29][56][57] with the REx variant outselling the pure electric version at a 3:1 ratio.[58] The other top markets are Norway with 8,034 new units registered through November 2016,[59][60][61][62] Germany with 7,493 units registered through November 2016,[63][64][65][66] and the UK with almost 6,000 i3s sold through October 2016.[67]
Two years after it market launch, the BMW i3 became the top selling electric vehicle in Germany. In Norway the BMW i3 was the best-selling model across the entire BMW range during 2015.[14] Norway has the world's largest i3 market penetration per capita due to its population size,[55] As of November 2016[update], Norway is also the world's second largest market for the BMW i3, accounting for more than 13% of total i3 production since inception.[68] In another achievement, the BMW i3 ranked as the top selling new passenger car model in Norway in November 2016, capturing a market share of 7.7% of total new car sales.[62][69]

BMW i8[edit]
Main article: BMW i8
The BMW i8 plug-in hybrid is the production version of the BMW Vision Efficient Dynamics concept unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and has an all-electric range of 35 kilometres (22 mi). Production of both plug-in electric cars is scheduled to start in Leipzig in 2013.[3] Powering the front wheels will be an electric motor (131 hp), while the rear wheels will make use of a 1.5-litre 3-cylinder gasoline engine (231 hp).[70] Zero to 60 mph sprint timings are estimated to be less than 4.5 seconds using both power sources.[4] The positioning of the motor and engine over the axles also makes it benefit from a 50/50 weight distribution.[70]

^ Between May 2014 and October 2016 the all-electric BMW i3 60 A·h was the most fuel efficient EPA-certified vehicle of all years regardless of fuel type.[84][85][86]
^ The EPA classifies the i3 REx as a series plug-in hybrid or EREV[80][82][87] while CARB as a range-extended battery-electric vehicle (BEVx).[88] Since June 2014 the BMW i3 REx is the most fuel efficient EPA-certified vehicle current year vehicle with a gasoline engine in terms of its MPG-e combined gasoline/electricity rating.[81]
^ The i8 does not run on 100% electricity as it consumes 0.1 gallons per 100 mi in EV mode.






BMW iPerformance[edit]




The BMW X5 xDrive40e is a plug-in hybrid with an all-electric range of 23 km (14 mi) that uses BMW i cars technology.


Launched in Europe and the U.S. in 2015, the BMW X5 xDrive40e is the first plug-in hybrid released under the core BMW brand. The use of BMW's eDrive technology on the established X5 platform is a direct technology transfer from the BMW i cars, in particular, from the BMW i8 technology.[9]
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which was given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand.[8] The first BMW car launched to the market with the "iPerformance" model designation was the BMW 330e iPerformance, initially named the 330e. Deliveries in the American market began in the second quarter of 2016.[90] The new designation was also used on the plug-in hybrid variants of the new BMW 7 Series, the BMW 740e iPerformance.[8]
The iPerformance models take advantage of technical expertise regarding electric motors, battery cells and electronic control systems. Visible indicators for the vehicles with this designation are a BMW i logo on the front side panel, BMW i-style blue elements in the kidney grille and wheel hubs, and an eDrive logo on the C-pillar. Customers can also make use of the BMW i 360° ELECTRIC range of products and services, including the BMW i Wallbox.[8]
As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released, the BMW X5 xDrive40e, BMW 225xe Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and the BMW 740e iPerformance.[10] The BMW 530e iPerformance is scheduled to be released in Europe March 2017 as part of the upcoming seventh generation BMW 5 Series lineup.[91] The Mini Cooper S E Countryman ALL4 plug-in hybrid release is slated for June 2017.[92]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
