Fact Sheet







First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund (FIF)




Fund Summary|News & Literature|Historical Pricing|Distribution History|Contact Fund











Investment Objective/Strategy - First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to seek a high level of total return with an emphasis on current distributions paid to shareholders by investing primarily in securities of companies engaged in the energy infrastructure sector. Energy infrastructure companies principally include publicly-traded master limited partnerships and limited liability companies taxed as partnerships ("MLPs"), MLP affiliates, Canadian income trusts and their successor companies (collectively, "Canadian Income Equities"), pipeline companies, utilities, and other companies that derive at least 50% of their revenues from operating or providing services in support of infrastructure assets such as pipelines, power transmission and petroleum and natural gas storage in the petroleum, natural gas and power generation industries. For purposes of the Fund's investment objective, total return includes capital appreciation of, and all distributions received from, securities in which the Fund will invest, taking into account the varying tax characteristics of such securities.


        There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved.

Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's common shares outstanding.


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


4
Distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through today's date and then dividing by the most recent market price. The distribution consists of the sum of net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains, and return of capital.  Distribution rates may vary. Any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution.  See the fund's 19a-1 Notices, if any, located under the "News & Literature" section of the website for estimates of distribution sources. Final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after year-end.


5
Total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions, at prices obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, if any, and changes in the NAV and Share Price.  The NAV total return takes into account the fund's total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.


6
Leverage is a technique where a closed-end fund's manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate, seeking to increase yield and total return. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


7
Market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions, which can differ from regulatory financial reports (Forms N-CSR and N-Q) that are based on trade date recording of security transactions. Holdings are subject to change.













Risk Considerations

The fund is subject to risks, including the fact that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. Investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.


    Because the fund is concentrated in securities issued by energy infrastructure companies, it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting that industry, including high interest costs, high leverage costs, the effects of economic slowdown, surplus capacity, increased competition, uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors.


    The fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the fund invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar.


    There can be no assurance as to what portion of the distributions paid to the fund's Common Shareholders will consist of tax-advantaged qualified dividend income.


    Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


    The risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the prospectus, shareholder report and other regulatory filings.

First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund Issues Notice Regarding June 2017 Distribution






Business Wire




Jun 15, 2017 4:16 PM EDT













 


















































  The Board of Trustees of First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund (the "Fund") (NYSE: FIF), CUSIP 33738C103, previously approved a managed distribution policy for the Fund (the "Managed Distribution Plan") in reliance on exemptive relief received from the Securities and Exchange Commission which permits the Fund to make periodic distributions of long-term capital gains as frequently as monthly each tax year.  The Fund has declared a distribution payable on June 15, 2017, to shareholders of record as of June 5, 2017, with an ex-dividend date of June 1, 2017. This Notice is meant to provide you information about the sources of your Fund's distributions. You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of its distribution or from the terms of its Managed Distribution Plan.  The following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date for the Fund from the following sources: net investment income ("NII"); net realized short-term capital gains ("STCG"); net realized long-term capital gains ("LTCG"); and return of capital ("ROC"). These estimates are based upon information as of May 31, 2017, are calculated based on a generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") basis and include the prior fiscal year-end undistributed net investment income. The amounts and sources of distributions are expressed per common share.                                                                                   5 Yr.

A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with "yield" or "income."(3) Based on Net Asset Value ("NAV") as of May 31, 2017.(4) Total Returns are through May 31, 2017.(5) The Fund anticipates that, due to the tax treatment of cash distributions made by Master Limited Partnerships in which the Fund invests, a portion of distributions the Fund makes to Common Shareholders may consist of a tax-deferred return of capital.

First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund Issues Notice Regarding June 2017 Distribution
BY Business Wire — 4:16 PM ET 06/15/2017

 WHEATON, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      The Board of Trustees of First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund (FIF) (the
      “Fund”) , CUSIP 33738C103, previously approved a managed
      distribution policy for the Fund (the “Managed Distribution Plan”) in
      reliance on exemptive relief received from the Securities and Exchange
      Commission which permits the Fund to make periodic distributions of
      long-term capital gains as frequently as monthly each tax year.
    

      The Fund has declared a distribution payable on June 15, 2017, to
      shareholders of record as of June 5, 2017, with an ex-dividend date of
      June 1, 2017. This Notice is meant to provide you information about the
      sources of your Fund’s distributions. You should not draw any
      conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of
      its distribution or from the terms of its Managed Distribution Plan.
    

      The following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the current
      distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to
      date for the Fund from the following sources: net investment income
      (“NII”); net realized short-term capital gains (“STCG”); net realized
      long-term capital gains (“LTCG”); and return of capital (“ROC”). These
      estimates are based upon information as of May 31, 2017, are calculated
      based on a generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis and
      include the prior fiscal year-end undistributed net investment income.
      The amounts and sources of distributions are expressed per common share.

      (1) Includes the most recent monthly distribution paid on June 15, 2017.(2)
      The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net
      realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be
      a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when
      some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to
      you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the
      Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or
      “income.”(3) Based on Net Asset Value (“NAV”) as of May 31, 2017.(4)
      Total Returns are through May 31, 2017.(5) The Fund anticipates
      that, due to the tax treatment of cash distributions made by Master
      Limited Partnerships in which the Fund invests, a portion of
      distributions the Fund makes to Common Shareholders may consist of a
      tax-deferred return of capital.
    

      The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are
      only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes.
      The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes
      will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder
      of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax
      regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar
      year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal
      income tax purposes. You should not use this Notice as a substitute for
      your Form 1099-DIV.
    

      Energy Income Partners, LLC (“EIP”) serves as the Fund’s investment
      sub-advisor and provides advisory services to a number of investment
      companies and partnerships for the purpose of investing in MLPs and
      other energy infrastructure securities. EIP is one of the early
      investment advisors specializing in this area. As of May 31, 2017, EIP
      managed or supervised approximately $5.7 billion in client assets.
    

      Principal Risk Factors: The Fund is subject to risks, including the fact
      that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company.
    

      Because the Fund is concentrated in securities issued by energy
      infrastructure companies, it will be more susceptible to adverse
      economic or regulatory occurrences affecting that industry, including
      high interest costs, high leverage costs, the effects of economic
      slowdown, surplus capacity, increased competition, uncertainties
      concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of
      energy conservation policies and other factors.
    

      The Fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to
      higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the Fund
      invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency
      of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar.
    

      There can be no assurance as to what portion of the distributions paid
      to the Fund’s Common Shareholders will consist of tax-advantaged
      qualified dividend income.
    

      Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify
      the effect of any losses.
    

      The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder
      reports and other regulatory filings.
