Respiratory Depression










































Respiratory Depression
Opiate Painkillers and Respiratory Depression 
Opioid analgesic drugs are commonly used to control pain on an acute, post-operative basis after major surgery or on a chronic basis in cases of cancer-related or other chronic pain. However, µ-opioid receptor agonists such as fentanyl, morphine and other opioid painkillers can cause significant depression of respiratory function, due to binding at µ-opioid receptors on the respiratory rhythm generating neurons in the brainstem. Respiratory depression (RD) can be fatal and is a constant concern in the post-operative or general care setting after surgery, or in other situations, e.g., chronic pain, where potent opioid analgesics are administered. Susceptibility to opioid-induced RD varies among individuals and predicting which patients are most sensitive is difficult, although older age, obesity, diseases affecting the respiratory or cardiovascular system and sleep apnea are some of the risk factors.
Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) is another major area in which opioid-induced RD may be problematic. Many post-surgical patients are allowed to control their pain level during the first 1-2 days after surgery by self administration of painkiller through PCA devices. While PCA is generally safe because doses are limited, it can be difficult to know whether the patient is more sensitive to opioid drugs than normal. In addition, mistakes in programming the PCA devices can be made by hospital staff.  Very importantly, pain management goals may not be achieved due to the administration of lower doses than optimal due to concern about RD.
Reversal agents, such as naloxone, are available, but all known reversal agents for opioid-induced RD are opioid receptor antagonists and thus also reverse the analgesic activity, leaving the rescued patient in severe pain. More often, if a patient is found not breathing by hospital staff (‘code blue’), the patient may be placed on a respirator, which can lead to an increased hospital stay and risk of infection. In some cases, respiratory arrest can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
Anesthetics and Respiratory Depression
Other central nervous system depressants, such as anesthetics (e.g., propofol) and anxiolytics (anti-anxiety drugs), may remain in blood circulation after surgery and contribute to RD.  Propofol and other anesthetic agents may also produce RD on their own if not properly controlled, and in those cases naloxone is ineffective as an RD reversal or prevention agent. Thus, there is a significant need for an agent that could prevent or reverse RD but which would not affect propofol anesthetic activity or anxiolytic activity of benzodiazapines or other anxiolytic agents.
RespireRx and its collaborators have determined that RespireRx’s Ampakines have these desired activities and may be used to prevent or rescue from opioid-induced RD without affecting opiate analgesia or prevent or rescue from propofol or anxiolytic induced RD.

CX1739










































CX1739
A Phase 2 Oral Drug Product
RespireRx has completed a Phase I human safety and tolerability study with CX1739 involving approximately 100 subjects, tested at doses up to 1200mg per day. The plasma half-life of CX1739 was around 8 hours, and CX1739 exhibited an excellent clinical safety and good tolerability profile. A very small pilot study of a single dose of CX1739 in twenty otherwise healthy sleep apnea patients has also been conducted. This double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study was the first step in an assessment of potential efficacy of CX1739 in sleep apnea, and thus was not powered (i.e., not large enough) to provide statistical significance in treating sleep apnea. The study did show that a single dose of CX1739 was able to improve blood oxygenation, and provided a hint that CX1739 may treat central sleep apnea, since a few patient’s central sleep apnea score was noticeably reduced on the night they received CX1739.
RespireRx filed an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ascending Phase 2A clinical trial in approximately 18 subjects to determine the ability of orally administered CX1739, the Company’s lead Ampakine, to prevent the respiratory depression produced by remifentanil, a strong opioid, without altering remifentanil’s analgesic properties.  The clinical protocol is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three escalating doses of CX1739 versus placebo when administered prior to remifentanil, with respiration, analgesia and a number of other clinical measures being taken after administration of both drugs.  The clinical trial, to be conducted at Duke University was initiated in March 2016.
The commencement of this clinical trial was subject to resolution of two deficiencies (since resolved) raised by the FDA in its clinical hold letter dated November 3, 2015.

The FDA cited a single incidence of mild necrosis in cardiac tissue from a rat in the highest dose group tested in a 4-week toxicology study.  In that study, histopathology analysis was performed on the heart tissue only from rats that received placebo and the highest of three doses of CX1739.  In its letter, the FDA requested that cardiac tissue from all animals in all dosage groups be analyzed.  This analysis has been completed and, according to two independent, board-certified pathologists, there does not appear to be any drug-related histopathology and the original finding most likely was due to “progressive rodent cardiomyopathy”, a syndrome commonly observed in this strain of rats.
The FDA requested that the Company perform an additional study in which rats are to be given a single administration of three dosages of CX1739, followed by neuro-histopathology evaluation 1, 5 and 14 days after drug administration.  In two previous studies, no neuropathology had been observed after 14 or 28 days of CX1739 administration at very high doses.  The agreed upon single dose study has begun and is scheduled to be completed by year end.

We performed the requested analysis, the additional study and, on January 29, 2016 responded to the FDA and provided an amendment to the IND. On February 25, 2016 removed the clinical hold allowing us to commence the clinical trial shortly thereafter.
We previously showed that a predecessor Amapakine compound, CX717, was able to prevent fentanyl-induced respiratory depression without affecting the painkilling, analgesic activity of the opiate. While having an identical mechanism of action, CX1739 is more potent than CX717, and is covered by a recently allowed patent, affording it much longer patent life. As discussed in the Respiratory Disorders section, RespireRx believes that an agent which can prevent drug-induced respiratory depression, without affecting the drug’s intended use as an analgesic or anesthetic, will be welcomed by practitioners who are constantly concerned about the potentially serious, even lethal, respiratory side effects of opioid painkillers, as they try to provide as much comfort for their patients from post-surgical pain.

(  OTCQB :  RSPI ) ("RespireRx" or the "Company"), a leader in the development of medicines for respiratory disorders, including sleep apneas and drug-induced respiratory depression, announced that the Company's President and CEO, and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, James S. Manuso, Ph.D., will present at the 28th Annual Roth Conference (www.roth.com) on Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 5:30 PM Pacific Time (8:30 PM ET). The Conference is sponsored by Roth Capital Partners, LLC and is being held at The Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Dana Point, California, from March 13 through March 16, 2016.Commented Dr. Manuso, "The Roth Conference provides an excellent forum for updating investors on RespireRx's ongoing research and development programs. I look forward to discussing the Company's FDA-cleared, Phase 2A clinical trial testing the impact of the oral ampakine, CX-1739, on opioid-induced respiratory depression." Dr. Manuso also will also provide information on the Company's other product pipeline candidates, including dronabinol, and the Company's development timelines. Dr. Manuso concluded, "We are eager to continue to update shareholders and other stakeholders on the progress of RespireRx's scientific, clinical and regulatory development initiatives during 2016."Dr. Manuso's presentation and accompanying slides will be accessible live, via webcast, at http://wsw.com/webcast/roth30/rspi. Replays will be available one hour after the presentation on RespireRx's website at www.respirerx.com, by clicking on the investors tab and following the links and instructions. A copy of the slide presentation to be presented at the conference will be submitted in a Form 8-K filing by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the presentation and will also be available in the investors section of the RespireRx website.About RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a leader in the development of medicines for respiratory disorders, with a focus on sleep apneas and drug-induced respiratory depression. The Company holds exclusive licenses and owns patents and patent applications for certain families of chemical compounds that claim the chemical structures and their use in the treatment of a variety of disorders, as well as claims for novel uses of known drugs.RespireRx's pharmaceutical candidates in development are derived from two platforms, as described below. The first platform is the class of compounds known as cannabinoids, in particular, dronabinol. Under a license agreement with the University of Illinois, the Company has rights to patents claiming the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep-related breathing disorders. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ascending Phase 2A clinical study conducted by the Company, dronabinol produced a statistically significant reduction in the Apnea-Hypopnea Index, the primary therapeutic end-point, and was observed to be safe and well-tolerated in a group of patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea ("OSA"). The University of Illinois and three other centers currently are investigating dronabinol in a potentially pivotal, six week, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2B clinical trial in 120 patients with OSA. This study, which the University of Illinois has indicated it expects to be completed during the second quarter of 2016, is fully funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The Company is not managing or funding this ongoing clinical trial.The second platform of medicines being developed by RespireRx is a class of proprietary compounds known as ampakines, which act to enhance the actions of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate at AMPA glutamate receptors. Several ampakines, in both oral and injectable form, are being developed by the Company for the treatment of a variety of breathing disorders. In clinical studies, select ampakines have shown preliminary efficacy in central sleep apnea and in the control of respiratory depression produced by opioids, without altering their analgesic effects. In animal models of orphan disorders, such as Pompé Disease, spinal cord damage and perinatal respiratory distress, it has been demonstrated that certain ampakines improve breathing function. The Company's compounds belong to a new class of ampakines that do not display the undesirable side effects previously reported in animal models of earlier generations.Read MoreAdditional information about the Company and the matters discussed herein can be obtained on the Company's website at www.RespireRx.com or in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov.Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: Certain statements included or incorporated by reference in this news release, including information as to the future financial or operating performance of the Company and its drug development programs, constitute forward-looking statements.

RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a leader in the development of medicines for respiratory disorders, with a focus on sleep apneas and drug-induced respiratory depression. The Company owns patents and patent applications, and holds exclusive licenses, for certain families of chemical compounds that claim the chemical structures and their use in the treatment of these and other disorders. Pending additional funding, during 2017, the Company plans to: 1) meet with the FDA to discuss its Phase 3 clinical trial program to test the safety and efficacy of dronabinol (oral) for the treatment of OSA; 2) file an IND and initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial investigating the ability of CX717 to improve breathing in patients with spinal cord injury; and 3) file an IND and initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial investigating the ability of CX1739 to reduce central sleep apnea in patients taking chronic opioids. RespireRx's pharmaceutical candidates in development are derived from two platforms, as described below. The first platform is the class of compounds known as cannabinoids, including dronabinol. Under a license agreement with the University of Illinois, the Company has rights to patents claiming the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep-related breathing disorders. As reported in a press release and on Form 8-K on December 23, 2016, Dr. David Carley and colleagues at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Northwestern University successfully completed the PACE (Pharmacotherapy of Apnea by Cannabimimetic Enhancement) trial, a potentially pivotal, six week, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2B study of dronabinol for the treatment of OSA. Dronabinol significantly improved the primary outcome measures of Apnea Hypopnea Index ("AHI"), daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale ("ESS") and overall patient satisfaction as measured by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medications ("TSQM"). This study was fully funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The Company did not manage or fund this clinical trial.In an earlier placebo-controlled, dose-ascending Phase 2A clinical study conducted by the Company, dronabinol produced a statistically significant reduction in the AHI, the primary therapeutic end-point, and was observed to be safe and well-tolerated in a group of patients with OSA. The second platform of medicines being developed by RespireRx is a class of proprietary compounds known as ampakines that act to enhance the actions of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate at AMPA glutamate receptor sites in the brain. Several ampakines in both oral and injectable form are being developed by the Company for the treatment of a variety of breathing disorders. In a recently completed Phase 2A clinical trial, acute administration of CX-1739 (oral) reduced the respiratory depression produced by remifentanil, a potent opioid, in a clinical model of chronic opioid consumption, without altering its analgesic effects. Furthermore, ampakines have been demonstrated to improve breathing in animal models of disorders such as spinal cord injury, Pompé Disease, and perinatal respiratory distress. The Company's compounds belong to a new class of ampakines that do not display the undesirable side effects previously reported for earlier generations of ampakines.Additional information about the Company and the matters discussed herein can be obtained on the Company's web-site at www.RespireRx.com or in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.Comments by the Company's President and Chief Executive OfficerDr. James S. Manuso, commented, "We look forward to advancing the many initiatives RespireRx is undertaking throughout the course of 2017. Now that the Company is Phase 3-ready with respect to the final clinical and regulatory development of dronabinol for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, commercialization and potential partnering plans may be initiated. With dronabinol's Phase 3 trial on the horizon, along with two Phase 2 or Phase 2-ready ampakine medicines in development, there are numerous strategic and operational milestones on the calendar. In 2017 we will continue to focus on the clinical and regulatory development of the Company's two proprietary platforms for addressing unmet needs in the sleep apnea and opioid-induced respiratory depression markets. In addition, we will continue to support the scientific research and pre-clinical development upon which our company is based. I look forward to reporting to you our progress in the months ahead." Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: Certain statements included or incorporated by reference in this news release, including information as to the future financial or operating performance of the Company and its drug development programs, constitute forward-looking statements.

RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. — Novel Medicines for Respiratory Diseases – dated October 20, 2016



Overview
RespireRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (OTCQB:RSPI) is developing small molecule medicines for the treatment of respiratory disease with a focus on sleep apneas and respiratory depression and distress.
The Company believes that its translational approach will move forward fundamental scientific knowledge and apply it to human medical needs and incorporate the results into medical practice. RespireRx’s depth of knowledge and its data span from the molecular level, to the cellular level, to the organ level, to the whole non-human animal level, and now ultimately to the human level. Some people refer to this translational approach as taking discoveries from the bench to the bedside.
Sleep apnea is not just snoring, but rather a serious sleep disorder that occurs when a person’s breathing is interrupted repeatedly throughout the night. The disorder is a major cause of motor vehicle and industrial accidents and is co-morbid with cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and other conditions. With a large patient population with few treatment options, sleep apnea represents a market potential of $3 billion to $9 billion per year for RespireRx’s drug candidates. Sleep apnea comes in a variety of forms, most commonly Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), Central Sleep Apnea (CSA) and Mixed Sleep Apnea.
OSA is the most common form of sleep apnea. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a study published in August 2016 entitled “Exploring the Economic Benefits of OSA Diagnosis and Treatment.” A few key points from that study are that there are an estimated 29.4 million Americans with OSA (Apnea/Hypopnea Index > 5) of which 23.5 million are undiagnosed and 5.9 million are diagnosed. Total costs of OSA in the United States are estimated at $162 billion. The costs associated with the 5.9 million diagnosed group are estimated to total $12.4 billion which breaks down as follows: (i) $6.2 billion for non-surgical treatments (CPAP device (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure), lifestyle, oral/dental devices, etc.), but no medicines as there are currently no pharmacotherapies for OSA, (ii) $5.4 billion for surgical treatments, and (iii) $800 million for diagnosis, testing and follow-up. The costs estimated for the undiagnosed group are $149.6 billion, of which $26.2 billion is related to motor vehicle accidents, $6.5 billion to workplace accidents, and $86.9 billion to lost productivity.
Part of the problem with OSA is that diagnosis is inconvenient and the treatment options are not particularly patient friendly or effective (CPAP is very effective but very patient unfriendly and compliance is very low). In addition, much of the population does not understand the symptoms. RespireRx believes that if a drug treatment were approved for OSA, not only would a significant number of non-surgically treated patients switch to the drug regimen, but a percentage of the currently undiagnosed population would get tested. In addition, there are companies pursuing less onerous diagnostic methods, including even home based tests that could increase the number of sufferers diagnosed.
The cause of CSA is very different from OSA, even though both result in the cessation of breathing for multiple short periods of time during sleep. Because the cause is different, the drug therapy would need to be different.
RespireRx is developing different drugs for each form of sleep apnea.
RespireRx has two Phase 2 clinical study medicines targeting Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Central Sleep Apnea. Phase 2B clinical data for dronabinol for OSA is expected to be announced before the end of 2016 and a Phase 2A clinical study of CX1739 is planned for CSA in chronic opioid users (see below). In a previous Phase 2A study of the three types of sleep apnea described above, CX1739 showed signals of efficacy in CSA and Mixed, but not OSA.
By the end of 2016, the Company is planning to release data from its Phase 2A clinical study of CX1739, conducted at the Duke University School of Medicine for another indication, opioid induced respiratory depression (RD), discussed in more detail below.
Pending additional funding, RespireRx is also looking to grow its portfolio of medicines to include product candidates for the treatment of respiratory distress in patients suffering from respiratory distress associated with spinal cord injury, Pompe Disease (an orphan disease and a niche market), and other indications.
In September 2016, RespireRx took the first step toward a NASDAQ (or other national exchange) uplisting by completing a reverse stock split.

Product Pipeline
“RespireRx is on to something unique. It is the only company focused on physiologically based sleep breathing disorders, and respiratory depression and distress and has a suite of IP-protected advanced clinical-stage medicines that have the potential to address these conditions,” stated Dr. James Manuso, President and CEO of RespireRx.

Amapakines: CX1739 and CX717
CX1739
Dr. Robert M. Califf, in the February 5, 2016 edition of the FDA Voice, stated “…as all of you know, more Americans now die every year from drug overdoses than they do in motor vehicle crashes. Opioids were involved in 28,648 deaths in 2014, according to the CDC.”
Those deaths occur primarily from respiratory depression caused by opioids. And we are not speaking only about illegal street use, we are talking about people overdosing on prescribed opioids who are taking them legally. Chronic pain patients who are regular opioid users develop tolerance to the drugs for pain and need higher doses to achieve pain control (think Prince), but now run the risk of respiratory depression and the elderly can forget how much of their medications they have taken and the list goes on. Pain management in a post-surgical setting is limited by the dose of opioids that can be given due to the risk of causing respiratory depression. So there are acute, semi-acute and chronic applications for a drug, like CX1739, to either reverse or prevent respiratory depression caused by opioids.
A Phase 2A study of CX1739 was conducted at Duke University School of Medicine and was designed to determine the ability of CX1739 to reduce the respiratory depression caused by remifentanil, a potent opioid, and consisted of two stages. The first stage was a double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over comparison of 300 mg of CX1739 and placebo, and the second was an open-label, dose ascending analysis of 600 mg and 900 mg of CX1739. Subjects were tested once a week for four weeks. During each of these weekly sessions, subjects were challenged with remifentanil in two ways, as a single, acute, bolus injection (REMI 1) and as an infusion (REMI 2). These procedures were designed, respectively, as models of acute opioid overdose and chronic opioid consumption in which opioid blood levels remain relatively constant. Data analysis is in process and the Company is planning to release data from this Phase 2A clinical study of CX1739 by the end of 2016.
In prior studies with another of RespireRx’s ampakines, CX717, the Company’s experimental medicine prevented respiratory depression caused by alfentanyl, another potent opioid, without offsetting the desirable pain-killing effects of the analgesic drug.
Based upon these results, and subject to available financing, the Company is currently planning to conduct a study of CX1739 in CSA patients who are chronic opioid users. Chronic opioid users’ respiratory depression is CSA measured during sleep. Approximately 70% of chronic opioid users have CSA and it is the primary risk factor for mortality.
One of RespireRx’s compounds, CX717, that is a candidate for further development in spinal cord injury patients suffering from respiratory distress. Of the approximately 276,000 spinal cord injury patients in the United States, approximately half of the injuries occur in the cervical (neck) region, 2/3 of those require respiratory support, usually a ventilator, and 40% require continued ventilator support after discharge. Animal studies support the notion that CX717 can improve respiration in spinal cord injury patients suffering from respiratory distress.
Ampakines have also shown efficacy in animal models of Pompe Disease, an orphan disease where patients may experience respiratory difficulties, and also respiratory distress in premature births.
Finally, RespireRx intends to develop a combination formulation of an ampakine, most likely CX717, with an opioid. The intent would be to create a “safer” opioid. As a person took more and more pills, in an attempt to achieve pain control, they would receive more and more of RespireRx’s ampakine, which in turn would prevent respiratory depression.
Dronabinol: Breakthrough Therapy for Obstructive Sleep Apnea
Dronabinol, RespireRx’s product candidate for the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea, is the first medicine being develop to treat the physiological causes of the disorder. The standard treatment is the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) device, which for reasons made obvious by the photo below, has an extremely high non-compliance rate.

Not surprisingly, 30 percent of diagnosed patients never initiate CPAP treatment when prescribed a machine and over 50 percent of patients stop using CPAP in the first year
Dronabinol (delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of anorexia associated with AIDS and for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting and has a long history of safety. RespireRx expects much greater patient compliance with this form of treatment over the CPAP device.
Phase 2A clinical trials for dronabinol successfully demonstrated a clear signal of activity in OSA patients.

Financed by a non-dilutive $5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a Phase 2B trial for the drug was conducted in 2016 at four major centers by the University of Illinois. The Phase 2B trial was completed in August 2016.
Upcoming Catalyst: Phase 2B data analysis is now underway and results are expected for release by the end of 2016. RespireRx plans to meet with the FDA to determine the path to registration.
RespireRx has obtained the licensed rights (expires 2025) from the University of Illinois to the use patents for the use of dronabinol (actually any cannabinoid, of which dronabinol is one) for the treatment of any sleep related breathing disorder, of which OSA is one. Further patents are pending on modified release formulations for dronabinol. As a Schedule III medicine, use is highly monitored by the U.S. government and is not covered by insurers for use outside of the existing FDA approved label, which discourages off label prescriptions of the generic versions of dronabinol. This provides market exclusivity via monitoring as well as via pricing, as third party reimbursement would only be available for a RespireRx brand of dronabinol, as RespireRx would be the only company with the FDA label for OSA.
