One Grand Deal Too Many Costs Lobbyist His Job

WASHINGTON — After about two dozen years in Congress, Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana was after bigger game —  the giant, 200-pound whitetail deer that run through the area of south Texas that hunters call the Golden Triangle.So in 2003 Mr. Tauzin, then chairman of the powerful energy and commerce committee, made a deal. Though still on a modest Congressional salary, he paid more than  $1 million for a 1,500-acre ranch there. And he invited a dozen friends — mostly executives and lobbyists with interests before his committee — to cover its mortgage by paying him dues as members of a new hunting club. It did business as Cajun Creek L.L.C., based in the Baton Rouge office of a  lobbyist who was a member.Now, seven years later, Mr. Tauzin’s friends say, it is to his Texas ranch that Mr. Tauzin, 66, will retreat, to contemplate the apparent collapse of the grandest in a career of fearless deals  —  a pact to trade the drug industry’s political support for favorable terms under President Obama’s proposed health care overhaul.Mr. Tauzin is leaving his $2 million-a-year job as the top lobbyist for the drug industry amid complaints from  drug makers that he bargained away their profits too cheaply, spent too much in his $150 million advertising campaign to sell the overhaul and miscalculated in his assessment that the passage of the legislation was all but inevitable.

Other drug industry lobbyists, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly,  said his departure raised questions about whether the drug makers would continue to support the proposed overhaul, which has stalled  in Congress.

Several of the lobbyists said Mr. Tauzin was undermined by a rival lobbying powerhouse —Thomas J. Donohue,   president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, who had fought the health care proposals from the start and complained to the drug makers that Mr. Tauzin had gone along too easily. A spokesman for Mr. Donohue declined to comment on Mr. Donohue’s behalf and later released a statement from Mr. Donohue praising Mr. Tauzin as “a great friend.”

The agreement that Mr. Tauzin struck on  health care  —   capping the drug industry’s costs at $80 billion over 10 years and turning a perennial foe into a Democratic ally —  was in some ways a fitting climax to a career of  such capers.“I don’t know anybody else who could have made a deal like that and could have made it stick,” said Wallace Henderson,  Mr. Tauzin’s  former chief of staff and one of the lobbyists in his hunting club. “He was one of the best political and legislative strategists I have ever seen, and I guess this sums it up: He is the only member of Congress who has ever served in the leadership of both parties.”Mr. Tauzin’s supporters in the drug industry trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,  known as PhRMA, say that he was essentially undefeated in his five years representing the industry on Capitol Hill — beating back a phalanx of proposals to cut drug costs, including allowing foreign imports or government price negotiations.But in private  drug company executives have long  rolled their eyes at the “Cajun in the Capitol” routine  that Mr. Tauzin, an aspiring actor in his youth, had honed during his years in politics.Wilbert Joseph Tauzin II,  the son of a poor electrician from of Chackbay, a small town in  southern Louisiana,  often joked that his alma mater, Nicholls State University, was “the Harvard of the Bayou.” He liked to open even the most solemn meetings with a joke about the antics of Boudreau and Thibodeau, a dimwitted pair of bayou folk characters. And for 30  years he has been a ringleader of the annual Mardi Gras celebration in Washington, when thousands of revelers take over a giant Hilton hotel for a three-day party  hosted by the Louisiana Congressional delegation and paid for by corporate sponsors and lobbyists.Mr. Tauzin was elected to the House in 1980 as a Democrat. But after the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress cost him a  committee chairmanship, he complained that President Bill Clinton had failed to live up to a private deal to kill a certain energy tax from a bill Mr. Tauzin had voted for in a House-Senate conference.

Citing that betrayal and Mr. Clinton’s health care proposals, Mr. Tauzin switched parties. And in the process he bargained with Republican leaders to retain his seniority so that he soon became chairman of the new House Energy and Commerce Committee. That  gave have him vast power over telecommunications, media, drugs and other industries.

He set up his first hunting club — which included lobbyists as dues-paying members — in the early 1990s on a property about a hundred miles from the Capitol on the Eastern Shore of Maryland where he liked to shoot ducks. When the Congressional publication Roll Call first reported Mr. Tauzin’s million-dollar purchase of the Texas ranch in 2003, his spokesman said that the House Ethics Committee had approved of the clubs and that Mr. Tauzin himself paid the same dues as other members.News of the  purchase also fueled rumors around Washington that Mr. Tauzin, still presiding over major pieces of legislation, was seeking more lucrative work.  In 2004,  the Motion Picture Association of America reportedly offered him a salary of about $1.5 million to become its top lobbyist. Then PhRMA lured him away from Congress  with its $2 million-a-year offer.

When he accepted the PhRMA job  that year,  just months after passage of the Medicare drug benefit, Democrats accused him of trading favorable legislation for his lucrative job. The House speaker,  Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of  California, said at the time, “If you want to know the price of selling seniors down the river, it’s approximately about $2 million a year, if you want to hire the manager of the bill on the floor of the House of Representatives.”Mr. Tauzin’s spokesman called the criticism sour grapes from opponents of the bill.Drug industry officials said Friday that PhRMA’s   board had grown increasingly wary of Mr. Tauzin in recent months.His party switch had alienated House Democrats, his jump to a lobbying job  had embarrassed House Republicans, and his public threats to make the White House abide by his understanding of the industry deal on health care had irked the Obama administration.One industry official pointed to a statement Mr. Tauzin made in early August. “Who is ever going to go into a deal with the White House again if they don’t keep their word?” Mr. Tauzin said then. “You are just going to duke it out instead.”

Third-Party Descriptions

June 2009: "According to a 2005 report by Public Citizen, since 1998 more than 43 percent of all eligible departing congresspeople went into lobbying. Take William Tauzin. The Louisiana Republican, and former chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, left the House for a $1-million-plus-a-year job as president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). According to press reports, PhRMA was wooing Tauzin the same month he pushed through the Medicare bill. Tauzin denies it fueled his zeal for the bill, but you can’t help wondering how the prospect of that kind of money might influence one’s judgment."
http://www.smartmoney.com/spending/rip-offs/what-your-congressman-wont-tell-you-20207

January 2007: W.J. 'Billy' Tauzin, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said the House bill may lead to the government limiting which medicines will be covered. 'That should not be acceptable to anyone,' the former GOP congressman said.
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/12/AR2007011201399.html

January 2007: “It would be naïve to not acknowledge the fact that D.T.C. advertising is also a lightening-rod in the health care debate in this country,” said Billy Tauzin, the former congressman who is now president and chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, in a speech to venture capitalists last spring. There is “one great problem” that the manufacturers face, he said: “in a word, it is trust.”
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/22/business/media/22drug.html

April 2005: "We can do a much better job with the advertising," agreed W.J. "Billy" Tauzin, president and chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). "The ads can do a great job making sure people who need medications and are undertreated get help. We can also make it clear that a particular product is meant for people with this particular problem and for those people only."

Lawmakers Seek to Curb Drug Commercials
QUOTE: For some legislators and consumer advocates, the [drug] ads are a daily reminder of a health care system run amok. Critics contend that drug ads are intended to prompt people to diagnose themselves with chronic quality-of-life problems like insomnia or restless leg syndrome; lead people to pressure their doctors for prescriptions for expensive brand-name drugs to treat these conditions; and steer people away from cheaper generic pills.

Wilbert Joseph Tauzin II (IPA: ['bɪli 'toʊzɛ̃]; born June 14, 1943) is an American lobbyist and politician. He was President and CEO of PhRMA, a pharmaceutical company lobby group. He was also a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1980 to 2005, representing Louisiana's 3rd congressional district.

Personal life[edit]
Of Cajun descent, he is a lifelong resident of Chackbay, a small town just outside Thibodaux, Tauzin graduated from Nicholls State University in 1964 with a Bachelor of Arts Degree and earned a law degree from Louisiana State University in 1967. While attending law school, he served as a legislative aide in the Louisiana state Senate.
He is married to Cecile Tauzin and has five children by a previous marriage.
Political career[edit]
Tauzin began his elective career in 1972, when he was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives and served four full terms as a Democrat. In his first term, he served alongside fellow Democrats Dick Guidry and Leonard J. Chabert. In 1979, David C. Treen, U.S. Representative from Louisiana's 3rd congressional district, the first Republican congressman from Louisiana since Reconstruction, was elected as the state's first Republican governor in more than a century. Treen resigned his House seat on March 10, 1980. Tauzin won a special election for the seat on May 17 and was sworn into office on May 22, just five months after winning a fifth term in the state house. He won the congressional race by seven points. Tauzin defeated Democratic State Senator Anthony Guarisco, Jr., of Morgan City and another Democrat-turned-Republican: Jim Donelon of Jefferson Parish. Tauzin then won a full term in November 1980, with 85 percent of the vote against minimal opposition.
For fifteen years, Tauzin was one of the more conservative Democrats in the United States House of Representatives. Even though he eventually rose to become an assistant majority whip, he felt shut out by some of his more liberal colleagues and sometimes had to ask the Republicans for floor time. When the Democrats lost control of the House after the 1994 elections, Tauzin was one of the cofounders of the House Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate-to-conservative Democrats.
In 1987, Tauzin ran for governor of Louisiana, but lost to a colleague in the U.S. House, Buddy Roemer, as incumbent Edwin Edwards, with a weakened second-place showing, withdrew from a runoff election. Others in the race were Republican Representative Bob Livingston of the New Orleans suburbs and two other Democrats, former U.S. Representative Speedy Long, and Louisiana Secretary of State James H. "Jim" Brown.
However, on August 8, 1995, Tauzin himself became a Republican and claimed that conservatives were no longer welcome in the Democratic Party. He soon became a Deputy majority whip, becoming the first Congressman to have been part of the leadership of both parties in the House. Regardless of party, Tauzin remained popular at home. After 1980, he was reelected twelve more times without major-party opposition; the first nine of those completely unopposed.
Tauzin served as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee from 2001 until February 4, 2004 when he announced he wouldn't run for a 13th full term. Tauzin, who has five children by his first marriage, heavily backed his son, Billy Tauzin III, as his replacement, even going so far as to appear in ads that were criticized as blurring the lines on which man was actually running for Congress. In spite of his father's support, the younger Tauzin was defeated by 569 votes by Democrat Charlie Melancon.
During his tenure, he left his mark on issues ranging from natural gas, airline, trucking and electricity deregulation to the Clean Air Act, Superfund and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In addition, he was an original author of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and the Cable Act – bills which went on to become law despite a Presidential veto.
In 2003, he was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield[1]
Career as a lobbyist[edit]
Tauzin resigned from Congress in February 2004. In January 2005, the day after his term in Congress ended he began work as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA.[2] a powerful trade group for pharmaceutical companies. Tauzin was hired at a salary outsiders estimated at $2 million a year. Five years later, he announced his retirement from the association (as of the end of June 2010).[3]
Two months before resigning as chair of the committee which oversees the drug industry, Tauzin had played a key role in shepherding through Congress the Medicare Prescription Drug Bill. Democrats said that the bill was "a give-away to the drugmakers" because it prohibited the government from negotiating lower drug prices and bans the importation of identical, cheaper, drugs from Canada and elsewhere. The Veterans Affairs agency, which can negotiate drug prices, pays much less than Medicare. The bill was passed in an unusual congressional session at 3 a.m. under heavy pressure from the drug companies.[4][5]
As head of PhRMA, Tauzin was a key player in 2009 health care reform negotiations that produced pharmaceutical industry support for White House and Senate efforts.[6]
Tauzin received $11.6 million from PhRMA in 2010, making him the highest-paid health-law lobbyist.[7] Tauzin now is on the Board of Directors at Louisiana Healthcare Group.
Controversies[edit]
Jerome Schneider[edit]
Tauzin endorsed Jerome Schneider's book The Complete Guide to Offshore Money Havens, dubbing the book "A serious contender for the best book on offshore banking I've ever seen."[8] Tauzin also spoke at one of Schneider's tax conferences.[9] After Schneider pleaded guilty in 2004 to assisting hundreds of people to avoid taxes through sham offshore banks,[9][10] a spokesperson for Tauzin called his endorsement "a stupid mistake."[9]
Connections to pharmaceutical industry[edit]
In his capacity as chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Tauzin "was one of the chief architects of the Medicare bill."[11] Tauzin's appointment shortly afterward as chief lobbyist for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the trade association and lobby group for the drug industry, drew criticism from consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which claimed Tauzin "may have been negotiating for the lobbying job while writing the Medicare legislation."[11][12]

It's a sad commentary on politics in Washington that a member of Congress who pushed through a major piece of legislation benefiting the drug industry, gets the job leading that industry.
— Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook 2004

Personal life[edit]
Of Cajun descent, he is a lifelong resident of Chackbay, a small town just outside Thibodaux, Tauzin graduated from Nicholls State University in 1964 with a Bachelor of Arts Degree and earned a law degree from Louisiana State University in 1967. While attending law school, he served as a legislative aide in the Louisiana state Senate.
He is married to Cecile Tauzin and has five children by a previous marriage.
Political career[edit]
Tauzin began his elective career in 1972, when he was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives and served four full terms as a Democrat. In his first term, he served alongside fellow Democrats Dick Guidry and Leonard J. Chabert. In 1979, David C. Treen, U.S. Representative from Louisiana's 3rd congressional district, the first Republican congressman from Louisiana since Reconstruction, was elected as the state's first Republican governor in more than a century. Treen resigned his House seat on March 10, 1980. Tauzin won a special election for the seat on May 17 and was sworn into office on May 22, just five months after winning a fifth term in the state house. He won the congressional race by seven points. Tauzin defeated Democratic State Senator Anthony Guarisco, Jr., of Morgan City and another Democrat-turned-Republican: Jim Donelon of Jefferson Parish. Tauzin then won a full term in November 1980, with 85 percent of the vote against minimal opposition.
For fifteen years, Tauzin was one of the more conservative Democrats in the United States House of Representatives. Even though he eventually rose to become an assistant majority whip, he felt shut out by some of his more liberal colleagues and sometimes had to ask the Republicans for floor time. When the Democrats lost control of the House after the 1994 elections, Tauzin was one of the cofounders of the House Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate-to-conservative Democrats.
In 1987, Tauzin ran for governor of Louisiana, but lost to a colleague in the U.S. House, Buddy Roemer, as incumbent Edwin Edwards, with a weakened second-place showing, withdrew from a runoff election. Others in the race were Republican Representative Bob Livingston of the New Orleans suburbs and two other Democrats, former U.S. Representative Speedy Long, and Louisiana Secretary of State James H. "Jim" Brown.
However, on August 8, 1995, Tauzin himself became a Republican and claimed that conservatives were no longer welcome in the Democratic Party. He soon became a Deputy majority whip, becoming the first Congressman to have been part of the leadership of both parties in the House. Regardless of party, Tauzin remained popular at home. After 1980, he was reelected twelve more times without major-party opposition; the first nine of those completely unopposed.
Tauzin served as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee from 2001 until February 4, 2004 when he announced he wouldn't run for a 13th full term. Tauzin, who has five children by his first marriage, heavily backed his son, Billy Tauzin III, as his replacement, even going so far as to appear in ads that were criticized as blurring the lines on which man was actually running for Congress. In spite of his father's support, the younger Tauzin was defeated by 569 votes by Democrat Charlie Melancon.
During his tenure, he left his mark on issues ranging from natural gas, airline, trucking and electricity deregulation to the Clean Air Act, Superfund and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In addition, he was an original author of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and the Cable Act – bills which went on to become law despite a Presidential veto.
In 2003, he was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield[1]
Career as a lobbyist[edit]
Tauzin resigned from Congress in February 2004. In January 2005, the day after his term in Congress ended he began work as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA.[2] a powerful trade group for pharmaceutical companies. Tauzin was hired at a salary outsiders estimated at $2 million a year. Five years later, he announced his retirement from the association (as of the end of June 2010).[3]
Two months before resigning as chair of the committee which oversees the drug industry, Tauzin had played a key role in shepherding through Congress the Medicare Prescription Drug Bill. Democrats said that the bill was "a give-away to the drugmakers" because it prohibited the government from negotiating lower drug prices and bans the importation of identical, cheaper, drugs from Canada and elsewhere. The Veterans Affairs agency, which can negotiate drug prices, pays much less than Medicare. The bill was passed in an unusual congressional session at 3 a.m. under heavy pressure from the drug companies.[4][5]
As head of PhRMA, Tauzin was a key player in 2009 health care reform negotiations that produced pharmaceutical industry support for White House and Senate efforts.[6]
Tauzin received $11.6 million from PhRMA in 2010, making him the highest-paid health-law lobbyist.[7] Tauzin now is on the Board of Directors at Louisiana Healthcare Group.
Controversies[edit]
Jerome Schneider[edit]
Tauzin endorsed Jerome Schneider's book The Complete Guide to Offshore Money Havens, dubbing the book "A serious contender for the best book on offshore banking I've ever seen."[8] Tauzin also spoke at one of Schneider's tax conferences.[9] After Schneider pleaded guilty in 2004 to assisting hundreds of people to avoid taxes through sham offshore banks,[9][10] a spokesperson for Tauzin called his endorsement "a stupid mistake."[9]
Connections to pharmaceutical industry[edit]
In his capacity as chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Tauzin "was one of the chief architects of the Medicare bill."[11] Tauzin's appointment shortly afterward as chief lobbyist for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the trade association and lobby group for the drug industry, drew criticism from consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which claimed Tauzin "may have been negotiating for the lobbying job while writing the Medicare legislation."[11][12]

It's a sad commentary on politics in Washington that a member of Congress who pushed through a major piece of legislation benefiting the drug industry, gets the job leading that industry.

Personal life[edit]
Of Cajun descent, he is a lifelong resident of Chackbay, a small town just outside Thibodaux, Tauzin graduated from Nicholls State University in 1964 with a Bachelor of Arts Degree and earned a law degree from Louisiana State University in 1967. While attending law school, he served as a legislative aide in the Louisiana state Senate.
He is married to Cecile Tauzin and has five children by a previous marriage.
Political career[edit]
Tauzin began his elective career in 1972, when he was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives and served four full terms as a Democrat. In his first term, he served alongside fellow Democrats Dick Guidry and Leonard J. Chabert. In 1979, David C. Treen, U.S. Representative from Louisiana's 3rd congressional district, the first Republican congressman from Louisiana since Reconstruction, was elected as the state's first Republican governor in more than a century. Treen resigned his House seat on March 10, 1980. Tauzin won a special election for the seat on May 17 and was sworn into office on May 22, just five months after winning a fifth term in the state house. He won the congressional race by seven points. Tauzin defeated Democratic State Senator Anthony Guarisco, Jr., of Morgan City and another Democrat-turned-Republican: Jim Donelon of Jefferson Parish. Tauzin then won a full term in November 1980, with 85 percent of the vote against minimal opposition.
For fifteen years, Tauzin was one of the more conservative Democrats in the United States House of Representatives. Even though he eventually rose to become an assistant majority whip, he felt shut out by some of his more liberal colleagues and sometimes had to ask the Republicans for floor time. When the Democrats lost control of the House after the 1994 elections, Tauzin was one of the cofounders of the House Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate-to-conservative Democrats.
In 1987, Tauzin ran for governor of Louisiana, but lost to a colleague in the U.S. House, Buddy Roemer, as incumbent Edwin Edwards, with a weakened second-place showing, withdrew from a runoff election. Others in the race were Republican Representative Bob Livingston of the New Orleans suburbs and two other Democrats, former U.S. Representative Speedy Long, and Louisiana Secretary of State James H. "Jim" Brown.
However, on August 8, 1995, Tauzin himself became a Republican and claimed that conservatives were no longer welcome in the Democratic Party. He soon became a Deputy majority whip, becoming the first Congressman to have been part of the leadership of both parties in the House. Regardless of party, Tauzin remained popular at home. After 1980, he was reelected twelve more times without major-party opposition; the first nine of those completely unopposed.
Tauzin served as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee from 2001 until February 4, 2004 when he announced he wouldn't run for a 13th full term. Tauzin, who has five children by his first marriage, heavily backed his son, Billy Tauzin III, as his replacement, even going so far as to appear in ads that were criticized as blurring the lines on which man was actually running for Congress. In spite of his father's support, the younger Tauzin was defeated by 569 votes by Democrat Charlie Melancon.
During his tenure, he left his mark on issues ranging from natural gas, airline, trucking and electricity deregulation to the Clean Air Act, Superfund and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In addition, he was an original author of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and the Cable Act – bills which went on to become law despite a Presidential veto.
In 2003, he was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield[1]
Career as a lobbyist[edit]
Tauzin resigned from Congress in February 2004. In January 2005, the day after his term in Congress ended he began work as the head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA.[2] a powerful trade group for pharmaceutical companies. Tauzin was hired at a salary outsiders estimated at $2 million a year. Five years later, he announced his retirement from the association (as of the end of June 2010).[3]
Two months before resigning as chair of the committee which oversees the drug industry, Tauzin had played a key role in shepherding through Congress the Medicare Prescription Drug Bill. Democrats said that the bill was "a give-away to the drugmakers" because it prohibited the government from negotiating lower drug prices and bans the importation of identical, cheaper, drugs from Canada and elsewhere. The Veterans Affairs agency, which can negotiate drug prices, pays much less than Medicare. The bill was passed in an unusual congressional session at 3 a.m. under heavy pressure from the drug companies.[4][5]
As head of PhRMA, Tauzin was a key player in 2009 health care reform negotiations that produced pharmaceutical industry support for White House and Senate efforts.[6]
Tauzin received $11.6 million from PhRMA in 2010, making him the highest-paid health-law lobbyist.[7] Tauzin now is on the Board of Directors at Louisiana Healthcare Group.
Controversies[edit]
Jerome Schneider[edit]
Tauzin endorsed Jerome Schneider's book The Complete Guide to Offshore Money Havens, dubbing the book "A serious contender for the best book on offshore banking I've ever seen."[8] Tauzin also spoke at one of Schneider's tax conferences.[9] After Schneider pleaded guilty in 2004 to assisting hundreds of people to avoid taxes through sham offshore banks,[9][10] a spokesperson for Tauzin called his endorsement "a stupid mistake."[9]
Connections to pharmaceutical industry[edit]
In his capacity as chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Tauzin "was one of the chief architects of the Medicare bill."[11] Tauzin's appointment shortly afterward as chief lobbyist for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the trade association and lobby group for the drug industry, drew criticism from consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which claimed Tauzin "may have been negotiating for the lobbying job while writing the Medicare legislation."[11][12]

It's a sad commentary on politics in Washington that a member of Congress who pushed through a major piece of legislation benefiting the drug industry, gets the job leading that industry.
— Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook 2004
