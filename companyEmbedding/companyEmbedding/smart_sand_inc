Smart Sand Partners LP, an MLP formed by Clearlake Capital to
own frac sand production assets in Wisconsin, filed on Thursday
with the SEC to raise up to $100 million in an initial public
offering.


Frac IPOs


Smart Sand Partners LP initially filed confidentially on August 29,
2014, just one week after close competitor Fairmount Santrol (
FMSA

) filed publicly. Fairmount priced below the range and raised $400
million in early October, but trades 21% below, including an 8%
loss today. The frac sand MLP IPOs of 2012 and 2013, Hi-Crush
Partners LP (
HCLP

) and Emerge Energy Services (
EMES

), reached all-time highs on August 29. Since then, Emerge has
fallen 46% (but still trades 350% above its IPO price) and Hi-Crush
is down 36% (+160% from IPO).



The The Woodlands, TX-based company, which was founded in 2014 and
booked $52 million in sales for the 12 months ended September 30,
2014, plans to list on the NASDAQ under the symbol SSLP.
 Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse are the joint bookrunners on
the deal. No pricing terms were disclosed.

Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
We are a pure-play, low-cost producer of high-quality Northern White raw frac
sand, which is a preferred proppant used to enhance hydrocarbon recovery rates
in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells. We sell our products
primarily to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and
oilfield service companies under a combination of long-term take-or-pay
contracts and spot sales in the open market. We believe that the size and
favorable geologic characteristics of our sand reserves and the strategic
location and logistical advantages of our facilities have positioned us as a
highly attractive source of raw frac sand to the oil and natural gas industry.

We own and operate a raw frac sand mine and related processing facility near
Oakdale, Wisconsin, at which we have approximately 332 million tons of proven
recoverable sand reserves as of December 31, 2016.  ... More ...

The Smarter Choice - Northern White Sand comes from Wisconsin, and is the first and best choice of proppant for hydraulic fracturing. But there is more to the story than the sand itself. Sustainable supply, massive reserve, quality focus, environmental sensitivity and efficient logistics through unit train delivery capability is smarter.

Smart Sand Inc. holds a large reserve, is located on Class I rail and operates one of the largest industrial rail loops in Wisconsin. At Smart Sand, we think it is smarter to look at the big picture: moving sand from the origin to basin destinations reliably and continuously. Smart Sand is invested in sustainability, in our community and in the environment. We are a proud member of the Wisconsin Industrial Sand Association and the Wisconsin’s marquee environmental performance partnership, Green Tier.

Smart Sand Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings and Operating Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for 2017
May 11 17
Smart Sand Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported revenues were $25,059,000 compared to $10,359,000 a year ago, the increase in revenue was primarily due to increased sales volumes. Revenues for the quarter decreased by 15% compared to fourth quarter 2016 revenue of $29.5 million, primarily due to shortfall payments recognized during the previous quarter, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Operating income was $1,558,000 compared to $2,834,000 a year ago. Income before income tax expense was $1,484,000 compared to $619,000 a year ago. Net income was $969,000 or $0.02 basic and diluted per share compared to $382,000 or $0.01 basic and diluted per share a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $3,709,000 compared to $4,736,000 a year ago. EBITDA was $3,552,000 compared to $4,520,000 a year ago. Capital expenditures were $1.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.

Sales volumes were approximately 559,000 tons in the first quarter, a 103% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016 volumes. Most of the increases in sales volume during the quarter came from contracted customers taking increasing volumes under their contracts. Approximately 83% of sales volume in the first quarter came from contracting customers. Spot sales grew to approximately 17% of sales volume, up from approximately 70%- 7% in the fourth quarter.

The company expected CapEx approximately $85 million for 2017 and anticipates effective tax rate to be in the 35% to 40% range going forward.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Smart Sand Lands Big Name for Board of Directors
Smart Sand Inc., headquartered in Fairless Hills, PA, is a supplier of industrial sand, primarily serving customers in the oil and gas industry including drillers in the Marcellus and Utica Shale region. Sand—the right kind of sand which is crystalline—is a critical part of the hydraulic fracturing process. Most of the frack sand mined in the U.S. comes from the Midwestern states of Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois. Smart Sand owns and operates a facility in Oakdale, WI.
What’s the big deal about Smart Sand? They’ve just landed former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty as a new board member, raising their visibility in the industry considerably. You may recall that Pawlenty ran for the Republican nomination for president not all that long ago.

From the Smart Sand press release:

Smart Sand, Inc., a provider of high-quality proppant to the oil and gas industry, today announced that former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty has joined its Board of Directors.
“We are honored to have Mr. Pawlenty join our board,” said Andrew Speaker, chief executive officer of Smart Sand. “Having served as Minnesota governor for two terms, and with deep roots in the region, Tim is experienced in the oversight and development of our natural resources. Tim’s experience in the energy and transportation sectors combined with his respect for the environment and the communities in which we operate makes him a strategic addition to our board. We look forward to drawing on his expertise as CEO of the great state of Minnesota as we continue to build our company.”
Mr. Pawlenty served as the Governor of the State of Minnesota for two terms, from 2003 until 2011. During his tenure as Governor, Mr. Pawlenty was responsible for overseeing a $60 billion biennial budget and 30,000 employees, and worked closely with state agencies including those dealing with natural resource and transportation issues.
“Shale oil and gas is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the U.S. With proper stewardship, it will help solve our nation’s energy crisis and dramatically boost our economy,” said Mr. Pawlenty. “I’m pleased to join Smart Sand at this very important time in the industry. The company provides a much-needed product, utilizes superior delivery logistics and is a leader in this critical industry. I look forward to collaborating with Smart Sand’s talented and innovative team.”
This appointment follows the announcement last week that funds affiliated with Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. have made a major investment in the company’s state-of-the-art frac sand facility in Oakdale, Wisconsin. The facility, located on more than 1,100 acres, has an initial processing capacity of over one million tons per year, an extensive base of in-place permitted frac sand reserves, and is expected to be operational later this month.
Jose E. Feliciano, founding partner at Clearlake and chairman of the Smart Sand board of directors added, “We welcome Mr. Pawlenty to the Smart Sand board, as we continue to grow the company and bring its many benefits to partners in key U.S. regions including the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations, and the Utica and Marcellus shales. With more than 100 years of reserves, the flexibility to reliably produce various sizes and blends of raw sand proppant, and direct access to a major rail line and superior transportation logistics, we believe Smart Sand is poised for success.”
