Helping youth is a key to building a more conscientious, responsible and productive society
The Boy Scouts of America is one of the nation's largest and most prominent values-based youth development organizations, providing programs for young people that build character, trains them in the responsibilities of participating citizenship and develops personal fitness. For more than 100 years, Boy Scouts of America has helped build future leaders by combining educational activities and lifelong values with fun.
Scouting Programs
Cub Scouts: For boys 7-10 years old or Grades 1-5, Cub Scouting is the foundation of our organization and involves the whole family as parents pitch in to plan and deliver activities.
Boy Scouts: For boys 11-17 years old, this is the traditional Scouting experience for young men. While there's guidance from experienced leaders, Boy Scouts take their own lead, exploring places they've never been as they dive into the rugged world of outdoor adventure.
Venturing: Venturing is a coed program for young adults ages 13 (and have completed the 8th grade) through 20. Venturing's motto, "Lead the Adventure," reminds Venturers to always pursue life in the spirit of adventure.

James Turley




James S. Turley
New York City, New York
Committed Volunteer, Gifted Leader, Good Scout

Jim Turley understands that the Scouting program can flourish only when built on
a solid financial and organizational foundation. And so he has devoted more than
two decades working behind the scenes to strengthen both local councils and the
National Council. His work is informed by his occupation—he is chairman and CEO
of Ernst & Young—and inspired by his heritage—both his father and grandfather were
active in the Greater St. Louis Area Council and received the Silver Beaver Award.
At the local level, Mr. Turley served on the executive board of the Viking
Council from 1994 to 1998, and he continues to actively promote his company’s support
of Scouting in New York City. For his service, the Greater New York Councils honored
him with the Good Scout Award in 1999.
At the national level, Mr. Turley has served on the Audit, Budget, Properties,
Boy Scout, National Finance Support, and Chief Scout Executive Selection committees.
A member of the National Executive Board since 2002, he chairs the Human
Resources Group Committee. Mr. Turley has just been installed as the BSA’s
international commissioner.
As chairman and CEO of Ernst & Young, Mr. Turley has focused on the
values of quality, integrity, and professionalism—values he brings to his service
for Scouting.
Among his many other civic affiliations, Mr. Turley serves on the boards of
Catalyst and the National Corporate Theatre Fund. He is a member of the Business
Roundtable and Transatlantic Business Dialogue.
Mr. Turley holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in accounting from Rice
University, where he currently serves on the board of trustees.
Mr. Turley and his wife, Lynne, have one son.
