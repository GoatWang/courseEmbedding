(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Multi Soft II, Inc.'s Condensed Financial Statements and the related Notes contained elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. All statements in the following discussion that are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the factors that may affect operating results set forth herein. Overview  From June 2011 through August 17, 2012, we were engaged in organizational efforts, including obtaining initial financing, and preparing to identify potential merger or acquisition candidates. Upon the effectiveness of our Form 10 Registration Statement on August 17, 2012, we commenced our business operations. Our business purpose is to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation.  Prior to the effectiveness of our Registration Statement on Form 10 on August 17, 2012, we were solely engaged in organizational activities related to its corporate structure and causing its shares of Common Stock to become publicly tradable (including the filing of the Form 10 Registration Statement) and had not yet engaged in identifying potential merger or acquisition candidates. As of August 17, 2012, we commenced our investigation for potential merger or acquisition candidates and thus commenced our business operations, and as of such date became a Development Stage Entity in accordance with ASC 915. All our results after August 17, 2012 have been reported as Development Stage operations.  Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business, rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Our search for a business opportunity will not be limited to any particular geographical area or industry, including both domestic and international companies.  We have negative working capital, negative shareholders' equity and have not earned any revenues from operations since 2005. However, we have issued an 11% revolving credit promissory note in favor of Vector Group Ltd. ("Vector") in the principal amount of up to $300,000, as amended on November 22, 2013, which we believe provides us with access to capital sufficient until we consummate a merger or other business combination. We are currently devoting our efforts to locating merger candidates. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another company, and ultimately, achieve profitable operations. Our historical operating results disclosed in this Form 10-Q are not meaningful to our future results.  We do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to: (i) investigating and analyzing business combinations; (ii) filing of Exchange Act reports, and (iii) consummating an acquisition. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through amounts, as needed, to be lent by or invested in us by our shareholders, management or other investors.  We may consider acquiring a business that has recently commenced operations, a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, a company seeking to develop a new product or service or an established business that may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company that does not need substantial additional capital, but desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.  MULTI SOFT II, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)  Our management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.  Our management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective shareholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management's plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.  We anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise because our directors and officers also serve as the directors and officers of Multi Solutions II, Inc., each of our officers and directors have entered into an agreement with us and Multi Solutions II, Inc. whereby they have each agreed that we will not analyze or consider any possible business combination opportunities until Multi Solutions II, Inc. has agreed to consummate a business combination.  If we consummate a business combination, we will use our best efforts to have our stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (the "OTCBB"), and anticipate that our common stock will be eligible to trade on the OTCBB subsequent to such business combination. In addition, subsequent to such business combination, we may seek the listing of our common stock on any of the several NASDAQ markets or the NYSE MKT, either immediately after such business combination or sometime in the future. However, in 2011, the NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSE MKT adopted a "seasoning" requirement for the listing of former reverse merger companies, which includes trading in another market for an adequate period of time at certain minimum price levels, with an adequate number of round lot shareholders and completing SEC filings during this time, although there is an exception to this requirement for firmly underwritten public offerings of at least $40 million. We may be unable to comply with seasoning requirements for listing prior to the listing deadline and we may be unable to qualify for the $40 million exception, which could adversely impact our ability to access U.S. stock exchanges. There can be no assurance that after we consummate a business combination we will be quoted on the OTCBB or be able to meet the initial listing standards of any stock exchange or quotation service, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on any of those or any other stock exchange or quotation service. If an active trading market for our shares does not develop, the value and liquidity of our shares will be materially and adversely affected.  MULTI SOFT II, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)  Recent Developments  On November 22, 2013, we amended our Credit Facility in favor of Vector from a principal amount of up to $250,000 to a principal amount of up to $300,000, and the outstanding balance owed to Vector as of October 31, 2013 was $216,408.  Results of Operations  Comparison of Three Months Ended October 31, 2013 and 2012  Revenues. We did not generate revenues for the three months ended October 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2013 and 2012, were $20,451 and $27,398, respectively. During the three months ended October 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, such expenses consisted of professional fees associated with various corporate matters. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will remain low until such time as we effect a merger or other business combination with an operating business, if at all.  Other Expense. Other expense was $5,020 and $3,058 for the three months ended October 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Other expense for the three months ended October 31, 2013 and 2012 related to interest expense on the outstanding balance of the credit facility executed in April 2012.  Net Loss. Our net loss for the three months ended October 31, 2013 and 2012 was $25,471 and $30,456, respectively.  Comparison of Nine Months Ended October 31, 2013 and 2012  Revenues. We did not generate revenues for the nine months ended October 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended October 31, 2013 and 2012, were $57,707 and $64,960, respectively. During the nine months ended October 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, such expenses consisted of professional fees associated with various corporate matters. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will remain low until such time as we effect a merger or other business combination with an operating business, if at all.  Other Expense. Other expense was $12,785 and $4,807 for the nine months ended October 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Other expense for the nine months ended October 31, 2013 and 2012 related to interest expense on the outstanding balance of the credit facility executed in April 2012.  Net Loss. Our net loss for the nine months ended October 31, 2013 and 2012 was $70,492 and $69,767, respectively.  MULTI SOFT II, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We do not have any revenues from operations and, absent a merger or other combination with an operating company, or a public or private sale of our equity or debt securities, the occurrence of either of which cannot be assured, we will be dependent upon future loans or equity investments from our present shareholders or management, for which there is no existing commitment. Although we have no present commitment from any such parties to provide funding, if we reach the point where we need funds to remain in operation, we will attempt to raise funds from our present shareholders or management in the form of equity or debt. If, in such situation, we are unable to raise funds from those parties, it is likely that our business would cease operations. As of October 31, 2013, we had a cash balance of $20,158, total liabilities of $264,408 and a negative working capital balance of approximately $27,800.  In April 2012 we entered into an 11% revolving credit promissory note in favor of Vector in the principal amount of up to $300,000, as amended on November 22, 2013, and the outstanding principal and interest balance owed to Vector as of October 31, 2013 was $216,408. We believe this revolving credit arrangement provides us with access to capital sufficient until we consummate a merger or other business combination. If we later determine that our capital reserves are insufficient, we will either cease operations or we will need to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional shares or through debt. There is no existing commitment to provide additional capital. In such situation, there can be no assurance that we shall be able to receive additional financing, and if we are unable to receive sufficient additional financing upon acceptable terms, it is likely that our business would cease operations.  Discussion of Cash Flows  For the nine months ended October 31, 2013, net cash and cash equivalents increased by $14,941. Net cash used in operations was $50,059. For the nine months ended October 31, 2013, no cash was provided by investing activities, while cash provided by financing activities was $65,000.  For the nine months ended October 31, 2012, net cash and cash equivalents increased by $22,444. Net cash used in operations was $37,556. For the nine months ended October 31, 2012, no cash was provided by investing activities, while cash provided by financing activities was $60,000.  Liquidity Sources  We satisfy our cash needs by drawing on the 11% revolving credit promissory note in favor of Vector in the principal amount of up to $300,000, as amended on November 22, 2013 which had an outstanding principal and interest balance of $216,408 as of October 31, 2013.  We may seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt, including loans from related parties, to acquire sufficient liquidity to satisfy our future liabilities. Such additional capital may not be available timely or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our plans to repay our liabilities as they become due may be impacted adversely by our inability to have sufficient liquid assets to satisfy our liabilities.  Contractual Obligations  As a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this section.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.  MULTI SOFT II, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these condensed financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our condensed financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we believe the policies discussed below are the most critical to understanding our condensed financial position and results of operations.  Income Taxes  We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying statutory tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets since we have determined that it is more likely than not that we may not be able to realize our deferred tax asset in the future.  As of October 31, 2013, we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $327,000. The carryforwards expire through the year 2033. Our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations, which could reduce or defer the utilization of the losses as a result of an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Acts of some jurisdictions contain provisions which may limit the net operating loss carryforwards available to be used in any given year if certain events occur, including significant changes in ownership interests. As a result of various equity transactions, management believes we experienced an "ownership change" in 2011, as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which limits the annual utilization of net operating loss carryforwards incurred prior to the ownership change. As calculated, the Section 382 limitation does not necessarily impact the ultimate recovery of the U.S. net operating loss; although it will defer the realization of the tax benefit associated with certain of the net operating loss carryforwards.  MULTI SOFT II, INC. (A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  Some of the statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q discuss future expectations, contain projections of our plan of operation or financial condition or state other forward-looking information. In this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words such as "anticipate", "plan", "believe", "expect", "estimate", and the like. Forward-looking statements involve future risks and uncertainties, there are factors that could cause actual results or plans to differ materially from those expressed or implied. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. The forward-looking information is based on various factors and is derived using numerous assumptions. A reader deciding whether to invest in our securities or not, should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ from projections include, for example:   the success or failure of our efforts to implement our plan of operation;   our ability to fund our operating expenses;   our ability to compete with other companies that have a similar plan of operation;   the effect of changing economic conditions impacting our plan of operation;   our ability to meet the other risks as may be described in future filings with the SEC.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. We believe the information contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q to be accurate as of the date hereof. Changes may occur after that date. We will not update that information except as required by law in the normal course of our public disclosure practices.  Additionally, the discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and related notes.  MULTI SOFT II, INC.

Item 1.   Business                                                              
--------                                                    

General                                                                         
-------                                                                         

     Multi Soft,  Inc.  (the  "Company"  or "Multi  Soft") was  incorporated  in
January 1985 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Multi Solutions,  Inc. ("MSI") and,
as of the date hereof,  is a 52% owned subsidiary of MSI. The Company engages in
the  production,  marketing  and  maintenance  of  communications  front-ending,
client-server  and  cooperative  processing   technologies  called  The  Windows
Communications  LibraryTM (WCL(TM)) for Windows 3x and 95, INFRONT for DOS and a
new product COMRAD (Component Object Model Rapid Application Development) for 32
bit Windows 95, 98, and NT.                                                     

The Technology                                                                  
--------------                                                                  

     The Multi  Soft  product  line  consists  of tools for the  development  of
client-server,  front-ending,  and Internet based applications using a mainframe
or  an  Internet  server.  There  are  four  key  elements  to  the  real  world
development, delivery and production maintenance of these applications; and they
are all are supported by the Multi Soft product line. These include screen-based
access to mainframe  data and processes;  message-based  access to mainframe and
server data and processes;  integration of screen-based and message-based access
to  the  mainframe  in  the  same  application;  and  control  and  distribution
management.                                                                     

     SCREEN-BASED  ACCESS  TO  MAINFRAME  DATA  AND  PROCESSES  (which  includes
front-ending) allows the user to enhance existing mainframe applications through
the integration of Internet and client technologies such as GUIs (graphical user
interfaces),  imaging and local data,  without changing any mainframe code. This
allows  companies to leverage their PC capabilities to streamline user processes
and for presenting  mainframe data to users in a way that is intuitive,  easy to
use and productive.  Screen-based  access to a host is supported by all of Multi
Soft's products.                                                                

     MESSAGE-BASED  ACCESS TO MAINFRAME DATA AND PROCESSES  allows  companies to
create client-server  applications,  where the PC is used for the client portion
of the  application  (i.e.,  all user  interaction,  dialogue flow and access to
local data) and the mainframe is used for the server portion of the  application
(i.e., management of database interaction, data integrity and security). In this
architecture,  only data and messages are passed between the PC and host,  which
results in a streamlined  and optimized  production  application.  Message-based
access to the  mainframe  is  supported by WCL's  WCL/Enterprise  Server  Option
("WCL/ESO").                                                                    

     INTEGRITY  CONTROL AND DISTRIBUTION  MANAGEMENT allows companies to use the
mainframe system to centrally manage the integrity of the work station logic and
distribute new version releases. In production client-server  applications it is
important  to ensure that the  programs,  files and data  residing on the PC are
correct  before the user starts the  application.  When  changes are made to the
work  station  logic,  the host can also be used to manage the  distribution  of
these changes.  Integrity  control and  distribution  management is supported by
WCL's WCL/Software Distribution Option ("WCL/SDO").                             

The Multi Soft Product Line                                                     
---------------------------                                                     

     The Multi Soft Product line consists of three product sets: the new product
COMRAD (Component Object Model Rapid Application Development) for 32 bit Windows
95, 98, and NT, the WCL product set and the INFRONT product. The WCL product set
runs under Windows 3x and 95 and includes WCL, WCL/ESO and WCL/SDO.  The INFRONT
product is an integrated environment that runs under DOS and Windows.           

     COMRAD is a new component-based  development tool released in July 1998. It
takes  advantage of  Microsoft's  COM/DCOM  technology  and will  generate  both
components and complete applications, not just applications as currently done by
WCL. COMRAD will allow you to build client server applications today and use the
same  code for your  Internet/Intranet  applications  tomorrow.  The  components
generated by COMRAD that interface with the mainframe can be used both by Visual
Basic and the your Internet browsers,  on individual  workstations or Windows NT
servers,  depending on the needs of your  application.  Persistence and security
are achieved through the use of Microsoft's  Internet  Information  Server (IIS)
and Active Server Pages (ASP).                                                  

     WCL is a toolkit and a set of DLLs (Dynamic Linked  Libraries) that work in
conjunction with Windows 3270 emulation  products to provide easy integration of
data and  processing  between  PC/LANs  (local area networks) and the mainframe.

cause  WCL is  open,  any of the  standard  Windows  development  tools  such as
PowerBuilder,  Visual Basic,  and C++, can be used with WCL to create the client
application.  It  supports  the  development  of GUI  front-ends,  client-server
applications  that use the  mainframe  as a server  and  integrity  control  and
distribution  management.  The WCL  toolkit  provides an  automated  development
environment  that includes,  among other things, a screen capture  mechanism,  a
screen maintenance and a screen matching facility. In addition, it provides code
generation to remove the  complexity  and  development  effort  associated  with
building GUI front-end applications.  Multi Soft, Inc. also has a 32 bit version
of it's WCL product for Windows 95 and Windows/NT.                              

     WCL/ESO is the host component to WCL and provides a message-based transport
layer  between  client  PC/LANs and the  mainframe.  The client  application  is
created using any of the standard  Windows  tools and  products,  and the server
application is created using a standard  language,  such as COBOL. Any mainframe
file  structure or database,  such as VSAM,  DB2, or IMS, can be accessed  using
WCL/ESO  through CICS (an IBM mainframe  operating  environment).  Client-server
applications  developed  using  WCL/ESO  have  the  added  advantage  of using a
company's existing mainframe skills and infrastructure, including security, data
integrity, backup and recovery and disaster recovery.                           

     WCL/SDO is a WCL/ESO  application  created for the centralized  control and
management of application code, data and software for distributed  client-server
applications.  It allows companies to control, audit and distribute from central
host-based  master libraries to distributed PCs. These PCs can be clients and/or
servers.  WCL/SDO is used as a verification  mechanism to ensure all files,  and
appropriate  versions of files are present on a PC or in a host library. It will
automatically  update the PC or Host with  correct  versions of files if any are
found to be missing or invalid.  This facility is important  for the  successful
production management of large-scale distributed applications.                  

     INFRONT is a  comprehensive  and  integrated  development  environment  for
building PC front-ends and client-server  applications  with the mainframe.  The
development  environment  includes:  an intelligent  forms subsystem with screen
capture,  screen painting,  editing and validation assignment  facilities,  data
dictionary;  a 4GL; an intelligent  editor with language  templates and reusable
code library; a PC-resident database,  including database maintenance facilities
such as sorting and reorganizing;  sophisticated debugging facilities, including
a source-level language debugger, and other utilities such as code libraries and
forms libraries.                                                                

Key Services

     Multi Soft offers training and consulting services designed to help its new
customers  get a fast start in  client/server  development  and to help existing
customers  with  additional  resources  to  facilitate   successful   production
application roll-outs.                                                          

     Training Services include basic and advanced product  training,  as well as
courses such as "Design and Development  Methodologies,"  which covers the major
issues  companies need to understand for  successfully  developing  applications
running on distributed platforms.                                               

     Consulting  Services range from human factors design and project management
to assisting  licensees with application  development  and/or the development of
complete applications.                                                          

     Technical  Support  Services include a telephone  hotline,  fax, e-mail and
Internet support staffed by knowledgeable personnel trained and experienced with
the Multi Soft product line.                                                    

Clients

     In addition to their  management  responsibilities,  Charles  Lombardo  and
Miriam Jarney also are active in sales. At present, in-house sales are generally
made  through  telemarketing.  If the  Company  obtains  additional  funds  from
operations  or  otherwise,  it plans to  further  market  its  products  through
advertisements in trade publications and targeted mailings.  No assurance can be
given that the Company will have sufficient funds to increase its in-house sales
and marketing activities.

---------------------                                                           

     To supplement  its domestic  sales and marketing  efforts,  Multi Soft uses
international distributors and VARs on a non-exclusive basis.                   

IBM                                                                             
---                                                                             

In September 1994, Multi Soft entered into an International  Software  Licensing
Agreement  with IBM's Personal  Communications  3270 division  ("P-Comm").  This
agreement  allows IBM to logo and market a P-Comm  specific  version of both the
Toolkit and Runtime of Multi Soft's WCL. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company
will  receive  a  minimum  of  $75,000  per  quarter  over  a  two-year   period
representing minimum advances against royalties. This IBM agreement is effective
for a term of two years and is renewable by IBM for two more  one-year  periods.
The  Agreement  is  terminable  by the Company or IBM upon 90 days notice in the
event of default by the other party.  As of November 1996, the contract with IBM
was  extended  for  two  more  years  and  IBM is  paying  the  Company  monthly
maintenance  and  royalties.  As of As of January 31, 1999 the contract with IBM
was extended for one year and IBM is paying Multi Soft monthly maintenance.     

     Since fiscal 1994,  IBM has  represented a significant  percentage of Multi
Soft's revenues See "Item 6.  Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations".                                           

Employees                                                                       
---------                                                                       

     The Company has eight full time  employees,  including  two  officers,  one
support  personnel,  four  technical  and  engineering  personnel  plus  several
independent consultants, which work for the company on an as needed basis.      

Competition                                                                     
-----------                                                                     

     The Company operates in a business composed of strong competitors,  many of
which have substantially greater resources,  are better established,  and have a
longer history of operations  than the Company.  In addition,  many  competitors
have more extensive facilities than those which now or in the foreseeable future
will become available to the Company.                                           

     The Company competes directly with computer  manufacturers,  large computer
service companies and independent software suppliers.  The Company believes that
hundreds  of  firms  that  manufacture   software   applications   products  are
significant  competitors,  and the Company is one of the smaller entities in the
field.                                                                          

     The Company's products provide front-ending,  client-server and cooperative
processing  technologies  which the Company  believes  represent  a  significant
advance over other products being marketed.                                     

NetCast, Inc.                                                                   
-------------                                                                   

     NetCast,   Inc.  is  a  subsidiary  company  of  Multi  Solutions  and  was
incorporated  in April of 1996. It is in the business of developing new Internet
technologies  to create a series of products and businesses that will extend the
power of  advertising  on the Internet.  Multi  Solutions  currently owns 75% of
NetCast.  Multi Soft  provides  services and office space to NetCast at cost for
which it has billed approximately  $234,592 through January 31, 1999. During the
fiscal year ending  January 31, 1999 Charles J.  Lombardo  devoted a substantial
amount of his time to NetCast  activities.  Multi Soft charged  NetCast for this
time. Multi Solutions has guaranteed  NetCast's debt to Multi Soft. The Board of
Directors  consists of two  officers,  Charles  Lombardo and Miriam  Jarney.  No
assurance can be made that NetCast will obtain the funding necessary to complete
its software and bring it to the marketplace.                                   

Item 2.   Properties                                                            
----------                                                  

     The Company  subleases  approximately  3,300 square feet of office space at

Fiscal Year Ended  January 31,  1999  Compared to Fiscal Year Ended  January 31,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1998                                                                            
----                                                                            

     Revenues  for the fiscal  year ended  January  31,  1999 were  $805,655  as
compared to $901,450 in fiscal year 1998,  a decrease of $95,795  (10.6%).  This
decrease is primarily due to a decrease in revenues from  maintenance  fees from
$645,265 to $524,948,  much of which came from the Company's  largest  customer.
The  increase  in  license  fees is  primarily  due to the  increase  in royalty
payments to the Company from IBM.                                               

     In fiscal 1999, Multi Soft's two principal sources of revenues were license
fees and maintenance fees which represented  approximately  99.1% ($798,708) and
98.6% ($888,411) of revenues in fiscal 1998.                                    

     Management believes that the decrease in maintenance fees during the fiscal
year ended January 31, 1999 is due to the  non-renewal of maintenance  contracts
by customers.                                                                   

     Operating  expenses  decreased  11.7% from fiscal 1998 ($893,064) to fiscal
1999 ($788,777)  primarily as a result of lower selling and administrative costs
offset by an increase in software development costs. The decrease in selling and
administrative  costs is principally due to lower levels of salaries and related
costs.                                                                          

     Other  income  increased  from $90,035 in fiscal 1998 to $134,873 in fiscal
1999.  Consulting,  rent revenue and administrative  fees charged to NetCast are
included  in the other  income  section in the amounts of $78,000 and $75,750 in
1999 and 1998, respectively.

     As a result of all of the foregoing, Multi Soft's net income in fiscal 1999
of $151,751 increased compared to its net income in 1998 of $98,421.            

Major Customers                                                                 
---------------                                                                 

     In fiscal 1999, IBM accounted for 25% of total revenues. In fiscal 1998 IBM
accounted for 29% of total revenues.                                            

Liquidity and Capital Resources                                                 
-------------------------------                                                 

     At January  31,  1999,  the  Company had a working  capital  deficiency  of
$(292,092) and has experienced cash flow problems.                              

     Management  of Multi Soft  continues to take various  steps to correct this
situation.  Overhead  costs  have  been cut  drastically  as a  result  of staff
reductions and curtailment of all outside  marketing and  advertising  costs. In
addition,  senior staff salaries were reduced and executive  officers'  salaries
were partly deferred.  Secondly,  Multi Soft broadened its product base into the
Windows 95 and  Windows/NT  environment  and has made its Windows based products
easier to learn and use.                                                        

     It is Multi Soft's  intent to remain a  technology  provider and search out
multiple  distribution  channels,  with  increasing  emphasis  on the use of the
Internet  for  marketing,  rather than to try and grow via an  expensive  direct
sales force.  This allows the focus to stay on  technology,  with a low overhead
cost for  each  distribution  channel  used.  However,  if the  Company  obtains
additional  funds from  operations  or  otherwise,  it plans to expand  in-house
marketing  activities by  advertising  in trade  publications  and by conducting
targeted mailing. See "Item 1. Business - In-House Marketing and Sales".

Dividend Policy                                                                 
---------------                                                                 

     The Company  has not  declared or paid any  dividends  on its common  stock
since its inception and does not anticipate  the  declaration or payment of cash
dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company intends to retain earnings,  if
any, to finance the development  and expansion of its business.  Future dividend
policy will be subject to the  discretion  of the Board of Directors and will be
contingent  upon future  earnings,  if any, the Company's  financial  condition,
capital requirements,  general business conditions and other factors. Therefore,
there can be no assurance that dividends of any kind will ever be paid.         

Year 2000                                                                       
---------                                                                       

     Many computer  systems may  experience  problems  handling dates beyond the
year 1999. The Company's products are not directly impacted by this problem.    

     In  particular,  Year  2000  issues  are  transparent  to WCL.  WCL  simply
transports  data  between  the  3270/5250  presentation  space  and  the  client
application.  WCL does no formatting of any data,  including  dates.  The client
development  tools,  such as VB, PB, and VC++  handles  this.  Therefore,  these
development tools, not WCL, must address Year 2000 issues.                      

     In addition,  The Company's INFRONT products have built in support for Year
2000.  Any date  functions  in use  within  an  INFRONT  application  that use 4
positions for the year will automatically handle Year 2000 with no changes.     

     For date functions  that use 2 positions for the year, the SETUPSL  command
can be used to handle the Year 2000.                                            

Effect of Inflation                                                             
-------------------                                                             

     Management  believes that  inflation  has not had a material  effect on its
operations for the periods presented.

(1)  Messrs.  Lombardo  and  Spatz  and Ms.  Jarney  are  also  officers  and/or
     directors of MSI. Therefore, together with the other directors of MSI, they
     share the voting  power of the Company  shares owned by MSI, and the shares
     owned by MSI have been deemed to be owned by the officers and  directors of
     the  Company.  The shares  listed as owned by Charles J.  Lombardo,  Miriam
Jarney and Larry Spatz include the 7,026,722 shares owned by MSI.     

(2)  Excludes  shares owned  beneficially  by a family trust of which Mr. Spatz'
     wife is one of the  beneficiaries.  Mr. Spatz has  confirmed to the Company
     that  neither  he nor his wife has any  voting or  dispositive  power  with
regard to the shares owned by the trust.                              

Item 12.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions                        
----------------------------------------------              

     As of January 31,  1999 the  Company  had a demand  loan with a  commercial
bank.  Borrowings are  collateralized by the Company's  accounts  receivable and
bear  interest at the bank's  prime rate plus 2% (9% at January 31,  1999).  The
loan agreement provides for monthly payments of $1,500 of principal and interest
and the personal guarantee of the Company's Chairman.  As of March 31, 1999, the
loan was paid off and Multi Soft is no longer indebted to this bank. During 1999
and 1998, the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding were $16,338 and $25,497,
respectively.                                                                   

     Although there is no written agreement between MSI and the Company granting
MSI preemptive rights with regard to MSI's majority  ownership of Company common
stock, in practice,  MSI has and plans to continue to acquire  sufficient shares
of the Company's common stock to assure its majority ownership in the Company.  

     The Company subleases its office space from C&S Consulting, Inc., a company
owned by the Company's Chairman and his wife (see "Item 2. Properties").

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
--------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Directors                                                       
MULTI SOFT, INC.                                                                

I have audited the accompanying balance sheets of MULTI SOFT, INC. (a New Jersey
corporation and 52% owned subsidiary of Multi Solutions, Inc.) as of January 31,
1999 and 1998 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows for the years then ended.  These financial  statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management.  My responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.                    

I conducted my audit in accordance with generally  accepted auditing  standards.
Those standards  require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.            

In my opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects,  the financial position of MULTI SOFT, INC. as of January 31,
1999 and 1998 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years
then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.        

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been  prepared  assuming that the
Company  will  continue  as a  going  concern.  As  discussed  in  Note A to the
financial statements,  the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations
and has a  working  capital  deficiency,  raising  substantial  doubt  about its
ability to continue as a going  concern.  Management's  plans in regard to these
matters are also  described in Note A. The  financial  statements do not include
any  adjustments  relating to the  recoverability  and  classification  of asset
carrying  amounts or the amount and  classification  of  liabilities  that might
result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.             

STEWART W. ROBINSON

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
January 31, 1999 and 1998
NOTE A - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION                      

     Multi Soft, Inc.  "Company" was  incorporated on January 29, 1985 under the
     laws of the State of New Jersey.  At January 31, 1999,  the Company was 52.
     0% owned by Multi  Solutions,  Inc. The Company is principally  involved in
     the design,  production and delivery of computer  applications  development
     software for sale to large corporate customers throughout the United States
and overseas.                                                         

     The Company's  financial  statements have been presented on a going concern
     basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of
     liabilities in the normal course of business.  The liquidity of the Company
     has been  adversely  affected in recent  years by  significant  losses from
     operations.  The Company  earned net income of $151,751 in 1999 and $98,421
     in  1998.  In  addition,   at  January  31,  1999,  the  Company's  current
     liabilities  exceeded  current assets by $292,092 and total assets exceeded
total liabilities by $464,639.                                        

     The  Company  intends  to  aggressively  market its new  products,  control
     operating  costs and broaden  its  product  base  through  enhancements  of
products for use by non-technical computer personnel.                 

     The Company believes that these measures will provide sufficient  liquidity
     for it to continue as a going concern in its present form. Accordingly, the
     financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  relating  to the
     recoverability  and  classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount
     and  classification  of liabilities or any other  adjustments that might be
     necessary  should the Company be unable to  continue as a going  concern in
its present form.                                                     

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                             

1.   Furniture and Equipment                                          
-----------------------                                     

     Furniture and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on the
     straight-line  method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,  which
range from three to seven years.                                      

     Depreciation  expense  was $3,563 for each of the years  ended  January 31,
1999 and 1998 respectively.                                           

2.   Capitalization of Computer Software                              
-----------------------------------                         

     Capitalized  software  development  costs  relating to  products  for which
     technological  feasibility has been established  qualify for capitalization
     under  Statement  of  Financial   Accounting   Standards   (SFAS)  No.  86,
     "Accounting  for the Costs of  Computer  Software  to be Sold,  Leased,  or
Otherwise Marketed."                                                  

     Research and  development  costs  associated  with the creation of computer
     software  prior to  reaching  technological  feasibility  are  expensed  as
     incurred,  except  for  related  computer  equipment  expenditures  such as
     personal computers and other hardware components, which are capitalized and
     depreciated  over their  useful  lives if the  equipment  is deemed to have
alternative future use.                                               

     Capitalized software development costs are amortized to operations when the
     product is available  for general  release to  customers.  Amortization  is
     calculated using (a) the ratio of current gross revenues for the product to
     the total of current and anticipated  gross revenues for the product or (b)
     the  straight-line  method over the  remaining  useful life of the product,
whichever is greater.                                                 

     The Company is  amortizing,  over a sixty  month  period,  the  capitalized
     software costs for its Windows-based products. The period is based on sales
     forecasts for the  seven-year  agreement  with IBM,  which began in October
     1993. The Company's  Windows  products are  compatible  with Windows 95 and
     further   modifications  are  continually  made  specifically  for  32  bit
     environments  (Windows 95 or Windows  NT).  Unamortized  costs  relating to
     Windows  products as of January 31, 1999 and 1998 are $650,263 and $628,852
respectively.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
January 31, 1999 and 1998

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued                 

     As of January  31,  1998,  there no longer is any  unamortized  capitalized
     software  costs  relating to the two DOS products.  The  unamortized  costs
relating to DOS products at January 31, 1997 were $2,440.             

     Amortization expense for 1999 and 1998, for all products,  was $241,383 and
$258,584 respectively.                                                

3.   Revenue Recognition                                              
-------------------                                         

     In  accordance   with  Statement  of  Position  91-1,   "Software   Revenue
     Recognition"  (SOP 91-1), the Company's policy is to recognize  license and
     maintenance  fees when earned and  consulting  fee income when services are
     rendered.  License fees are recognized  upon shipment of the software while
     maintenance  fees are  recorded  over the  period  covered  by the  related
contract. Consulting is performed on a time and material basis.       

4.   Deferred Compensation                                            
---------------------                                       

     Deferred  compensation  arising  from  the  issuance  of  stock  grants  is
     amortized over the term of the related grant or employment  agreements (one
     to five years). The amount of compensation  attributable to stock grants is
     determined by the market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant.

5.   Income Per Share                                                 
----------------                                            

     Income per share is computed  using the weighted  average  number of common
shares outstanding during the period.                                 

6.   Income Taxes                                                     
------------                                                

     The  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued  Statement  of
     Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) NO.  109,  "Accounting  for Income
     Taxes," which  significantly  changed the  accounting  for deferred  income
     taxes. The standard provides for a liability  approach under which deferred
     income  taxes  are  provided  for  based  upon  enacted  tax laws and rates
applicable to the periods in which the taxes become payable.          

7.   Estimates                                                        
---------                                                   

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
     accepted  accounting  principles  requires management to make estimates and
     assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
     disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of the
     financial  statements and reported  amounts of revenues and expenses during
 the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

NOTE C - LOAN PAYABLE                                                           

1.   Demand Loan - Bank                                               
------------------                                          

     The  Company  has a demand  loan  payable  to a  commercial  bank ($796 and
     $16,338  at  January  31,  1999  and  1998  respectively).  Borrowings  are
     collateralized  by the Company's  accounts  receivable and bear interest at
     the bank's  prime rate plus 2% (9.75% at January 31,  1999) As of March 31,
1999 the Company is in  compliance  with the terms of the agreement and the
balance has been paid in full.                                        

     During 1999 and 1998,  the maximum  amount of  borrowings  outstanding  was
     $16,338 and $25,497  respectively,  the average  borrowings were $8,567 and
    $20,918, respectively, and the weighted average interest rates were 10.1%.

NOTE D - INCOME TAXES                                                           

     As a result of  losses  incurred  in  recent  years,  the  Company  has net
     operating  loss carry forwards  available to offset future federal  taxable
     income of approximately $4.5 million.  These losses expire at various dates
through 2011.                                                         
Therefore, there is no provision for income taxes.                    

     The Company adopted,  effective February 1, 1993, SFAS No. 109, "Accounting
     for Income  Taxes."  Under the liability  method  specified by SFAS No 109,
     deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined  based on the difference
     between the financial  statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as
     measured  by the  enacted  tax rates  which  will be in effect  when  these
     differences  reverse.  Deferred  tax  expense  is the  result of changes in
     deferred tax assets and  liabilities.  The principal  types of  differences
     between  assets and  liabilities  for  financial  statement  and tax return
     purposes are capitalized software development costs, deferred compensation,
deferred income and allowance for uncollectible accounts.             

NOTE E - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY                                                   

1.   Stock Transactions                                               
------------------                                          

     The expiration date of the Company's 714,012 outstanding  warrants has been
extended to June 1, 1999.                                             

     In January 1996,  the Company  issued  1,500,000  shares of common stock to
     Multi  Solutions,  Inc.  The  transaction  was  valued  at $.22  per  share
($330,000) for which Multi Solutions was to issue a note.             

     In connection with this  transaction,  the company paid for the acquisition
     of 1,000,000  shares each of Multi Solutions  common stock (valued at $0.08
     per share) by the chairman and vice president by allowing the  indebtedness
     of Multi  Solutions to the company to be reduced by $160,000  which thereby
 reduced the debt of the company to the two officers by the same amount.

     After  completion  of this  series of  transactions,  the net debt due from
     Multi  Solutions  in  connection  with the common stock sale was reduced to
$170,000.                                                             

     In December  1998,  the Company  issued  500,000  shares of common stock to
     Multi  Solutions,  Inc.  The  transaction  was  valued  at $.05  per  share
     ($25,000).  The effect of this transaction was to reduce  indebtedness owed
to Multi Solutions, from approximately $33,000 to $7,000.             

2.   Option and Stock Grant Program                                   
------------------------------                              

     In June 1993, the Company adopted an Employee, Consultant and Advisor Stock
     and Option Compensation Plan (the Plan). Pursuant to the terms of the Plan,
     an aggregate of up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock,  .001 par value per
     share (the common stock),  and/or  options to purchase  common stock may be
     granted to persons who are, at the time of issuance or grant,  employees or
     officers of, or  consultants  or advisors  to, the Company.  At January 31,
1999, an aggregate of 957,001 shares have been issued pursuant to the Plan.

     the above  contract.  In October  1996  agreement  # R94564 was  amended to

	MULTI SOFT II, INC.






	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	Unaudited




	 








	NOTE 1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ORGANIZATION









	(A) Organization and Basis of Presentation




	 




	Multi Soft II, Inc.'s (the "Company") business purpose is to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company's business objective for the next 12 months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business, rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company's search for a business opportunity will not be limited to any particular geographical area or industry, including both domestic and international companies.









	The Company does not have any revenues from operations and, absent a merger or other combination with an operating company, or a public or private sale of the Company's equity or debt securities, the occurrence of either of which cannot be assured, the Company will be dependent upon future loans or equity investments from the Company's present shareholders or management, for which there is no existing commitment. Although the Company has no present commitment from any such parties to provide funding aside from a credit facility agreement (the "Credit Facility") with its majority shareholder, if the Company reaches the point where the Company needs funds to remain in operation, the Company will attempt to raise funds from the Company's present shareholders or management in the form of equity or debt. If, in such situation, the Company is unable to raise funds from those parties, it is likely that the Company's business would cease operations.









	In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise because the Company's directors and officers also serve as the directors and officers of Multi Solutions II, Inc., an entity under common control, each of the Company's officers and directors have entered into an agreement with the Company and Multi Solutions II, Inc. whereby all parties have each agreed that the Company will not analyze or consider any possible business combination opportunities until Multi Solutions II, Inc. has agreed to consummate a business combination.

	(C) Use of Estimates




	In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	Item 2.     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations




	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Multi Soft II, Inc.'s Condensed Financial Statements and the related Notes contained elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. All statements in the following discussion that are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the factors that may affect operating results set forth herein.




	Overview









	Our principal business objective for the next twelve months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business, rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Our search for a business opportunity will not be limited to any particular geographical area or industry, including both domestic and international companies.









	We have


	negative


	 working capital, negative shareholders' equity and have not earned any revenues from operations since 2005. However, we have issued an 11% revolving credit promissory note in favor of Vector Group Ltd. ("Vector"), a majority shareholder, in the principal amount of up to


	$450,000


	, as amended on


	June 3, 2015


	, which we believe provides us with access to sufficient capital for the next twelve months We are currently devoting our efforts to locating merger candidates. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital, locate and complete a merger with another company, and ultimately, achieve profitable operations. Our historical operating results disclosed in this Form 10-Q are not meaningful to our future results.









	We do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to: (i) investigating and analyzing business combinations; (ii) filing of Exchange Act reports, and (iii) consummating an acquisition. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through amounts, as needed, to be lent by or invested in us by our shareholders, management or other investors.









	We may consider acquiring a business that has recently commenced operations, a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, a company seeking to develop a new product or service or an established business that may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company that does not need substantial additional capital, but desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.









	Our management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.













	9








	MULTI SOFT II, INC.













	Our management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective shareholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management's plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.









	We anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.









	In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise because our directors and officers also serve as the directors and officers of Multi Solutions II, Inc., an entity under common control, each of our officers and directors have entered into an agreement with us and Multi Solutions II, Inc. whereby they have each agreed that we will not analyze or consider any possible business combination opportunities until Multi Solutions II, Inc. has agreed to consummate a business combination.









	If we consummate a business combination, we will use our best efforts to have our stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (the “OTCBB”), and anticipate that our common stock will be eligible to trade on the OTCBB subsequent to such business combination. In addition, subsequent to such business combination, we may seek the listing of our common stock on any of the several NASDAQ markets or the NYSE MKT, either immediately after such business combination or sometime in the future. However, in 2011, the NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSE MKT adopted a “seasoning” requirement for the listing of former reverse merger companies, which includes trading in another market for an adequate period of time at certain minimum price levels, with an adequate number of round lot shareholders and completing SEC filings during this time, although there is an exception to this requirement for firmly underwritten public offerings of at least $40 million. We may be unable to comply with seasoning requirements for listing prior to the listing deadline and we may be unable to qualify for the $40 million exception, which could adversely impact our ability to access U.S. stock exchanges. There can be no assurance that after we consummate a business combination we will be quoted on the OTCBB or be able to meet the initial listing standards of any stock exchange or quotation service, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on any of those or any other stock exchange or quotation service. If an active trading market for our shares does not develop, the value and liquidity of our shares will be materially and adversely affected.

	 was

	 and


	$54,943


	, respectively.













	Liquidity and Capital Resources









	We do not have any revenues from operations and, absent a merger or other combination with an operating company, or a public or private sale of our equity or debt securities, the occurrence of either of which cannot be assured, we will be dependent upon future loans or equity investments from our present shareholders or management, for which there is no existing commitment. Although we have no present commitment from any such parties to provide funding aside from the Credit Facility, if we reach the point where we need funds to remain in operation, we will attempt to raise funds from our present shareholders or management in the form of equity or debt. If, in such situation, we are unable to raise funds from those parties, it is likely that our business would cease operations. As of


	October 31, 2016


	, we had a cash balance of


	$41,360


	, total liabilities of


	$520,852


	 and a


	negative


	 working capital balance of approximately


	$28,600


	.









	In April 2012 we entered into an 11% revolving credit promissory note in favor of Vector in the principal amount of up to


	$450,000


	, as amended on


	June 3, 2015


	, and the outstanding principal and interest balance owed to Vector as of


	October 31, 2016


	 was


	$450,852


	, including accrued interest of


	$110,695


	. We believe this revolving credit








	11








	MULTI SOFT II, INC.













	arrangement provides us with access to capital sufficient for the next twelve months. If we later determine that our capital reserves are insufficient, we will either cease operations or we will need to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional shares or through debt. There is no existing commitment to provide additional capital. In such situation, there can be no assurance that we shall be able to receive additional financing, and if we are unable to receive sufficient additional financing upon acceptable terms, it is likely that our business would cease operations.









	Discussion of Cash Flows









	For the


	nine months ended October 31, 2016


	, net cash and cash equivalents


	increased


	 by


	$10,950


	. Net cash used in operations was


	$29,050


	. For the


	nine months ended October 31, 2016


	, no cash was provided by investing activities, while cash provided by financing activities was $ 40,000.




	 




	For the


	nine months ended October 31, 2015


	, net cash and cash equivalents


	increased


	 by


	$9,975


	. Net cash used in operations was


	$30,025


	. For the


	nine months ended October 31, 2015


	, no cash was provided by investing activities, while cash provided by financing activities was $40,000.




	    




	Liquidity Sources









	We satisfy our cash needs by drawing on the 11% revolving credit promissory note in favor of Vector in the principal amount of up to


	$450,000


	, as amended on


	June 3, 2015


	 which had an outstanding principal and interest balance of


	$450,852


	 included accrued interest of $


	110,695


	 as of


	October 31, 2016


	.









	We may seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt, including loans from related parties, to acquire sufficient liquidity to satisfy our future liabilities. Such additional capital may not be available timely or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our plans to repay our liabilities as they become due may be impacted adversely by our inability to have sufficient liquid assets to satisfy our liabilities.









	Contractual




	Obligations









	As a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this section.









	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements









	We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.









	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates









	Our condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these condensed financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.









	 Our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our condensed financial statements included in the annual report on Form 10-K.

	I, J. Bryant Kirkland III, certify that:









	1.    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Multi Soft II, Inc.;


















	2.






	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;





















	3.

	4.






	The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have:





















	(a)






	designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;





















	(b)






	designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;





















	(c)






	evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and





















	(d)






	disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting;







	 













	5.






	The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):












	(a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and


















	(b)






	any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
