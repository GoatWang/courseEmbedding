About Us
Reese-Hitches.com is a Midwest based, family owned business that specializes in trailer hitches and towing products for light duty to heavy duty applications. Our company opened for business in 1957 as a manufacturer of trailer hitches and has grown to become an ISO 9001-2008 certified company and a leading supplier of hitches, trailer parts and truck accessories to customers throughout North America. Unlike some other e-commerce sites, we are not just marketers of other company's products who take your order and then drop ship those products to you. We stock everything we sell on this website. That means faster service, better order fill and tighter quality control.
Choosing the right trailer hitch can be a real challenge and having someone to guide you through that process can be a great help. The professional customer service team here at Reese-Hitches.com is here to help. Give us a call or drop us an email and we'll be happy to put our years of experience and hands-on product knowledge to work for you. 
Thanks for stopping by. If you don't find what you're looking for please let us know. We have access to thousands of hard-to-find parts available from leading manufacturers throughout the world. Our friendly and courteous staff will be happy to help you find whatever you need.
We are an independent authorized dealer for Reese products, not affiliated with Horizon Global Corp.

Shipping Information
We use UPS for most of our shipments. We want you to get your products as fast as possible and in excellent condition. That is why we normally use UPS - the leader in the package delivery business to get you your order as soon as possible. 98% of our orders get to our customers within 4 - 5 business days. Remember, none of the major package delivery carriers (UPS included) deliver on the weekends.
Depending on the size of your package and its destination, we may at our discretion ship your order via another carrier.
We do have a few restrictions on our shipping. We cannot ship to Puerto Rico, P.O. Boxes or to APO/FPO addresses. We can ship to Hawaii - 2nd Day UPS Air. We currently do not ship to Mexico, Canada or anywhere outside North America. We reserve the right to add shipping expense onto orders that are special case orders - this is very rare, but we needed to state it here and we would advise you of these charges at the time of your order. If you have any questions about our shipping policies - please do not hesitate to call us.
Special free freight offers are available and are valid on most orders.  Some oversized items and truck shipments may have additional charges applied.  Again, we will advise you at the time of your order of any exceptions.
All truck freight shipments must be shipped to a commercial business address.  Truck shipments to residential addresses will have additional service charges applied.
Refused shipments that we have not been notified of in advance will be charged for outbound and return freight charges and may require additional handling charges of up to 15%.
