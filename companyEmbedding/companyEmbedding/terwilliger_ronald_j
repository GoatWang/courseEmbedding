Renee Glover

Renee is the Founder and Managing Member of The Catalyst Group, LLC, a national consulting firm, focused on urban revitalization, real estate development and community building; urban policy; and business transformation.
Renee served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Atlanta Housing Authority for almost 20 years, until September 2013, during which she pioneered master-planned, mixed-use, mixed-income communities. During her tenure, the housing authority sponsored 16 master-planned, mixed-use, mixed-income communities, in partnership with private sector real estate developers and other investors, leveraging $300 million of federal funds into over $3 billion of private investment and economic impact. She has been nationally recognized for her role in transforming U.S. urban policy. The mixed-use, mixed-income model (conceptualized through the creation of Centennial Place, the first mixed-use, mixed-income community in the United States) holistically addresses the needs for quality housing, excellent crib-to high school public education, transit access, employment and economic development. This model has been used by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development since 1996 as a blueprint for holistic redevelopment in cities across the U.S. Renee also transformed the housing authority from a chronically “troubled” agency on the verge of receivership by the Federal government to a high-performing, nationally recognized and financially sound diversified real estate organization, with a public service-oriented mission and purpose.
In January 2016, Renee was elected to the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae Corporation. Renee was also elected to the Board of Trustees of Enterprise Community Partners, Inc. in December 2015. Renee served on the Board of Directors of Habitat for Humanity International from November 2006 to November 2015, including serving as Chair of the Board of Directors from November 2013 to November 2015. Renee served on the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta from January 2009 to December 2014. Renee was appointed to the Board of Advisors of the University of Pennsylvania’s Institute of Urban Research in June 2015.
She also served as a Commissioner of the Bipartisan Policy Center Housing Commission from October 2011 to September 2014. The Commission was responsible for coming up with a set of bipartisan recommendations concerning federal housing policy and housing finance.
Renee has received numerous recognitions over the years and was inducted as a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration in November 2007. Most recently, Renee was honored by HousingWire as one of forty “Women of Influence in Real Estate” in August 2015 and by the Atlanta Chapter of the National Association of Corporate Directors and the Atlanta Business Chronicle in December 2015 as one of the recipients of the “2015 Outstanding Directors Awards” for exemplary service as Chair of the Board of Directors of Habitat International.
