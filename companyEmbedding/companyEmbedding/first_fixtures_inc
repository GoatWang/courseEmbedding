	Item 1. Business.







	 



	On February 28, 2014, Mr. Colin Povall, president and sole director, incorporated the Company in the State of Nevada and established a fiscal year end of March 31. FIRST FIXTURES, INC. is a company that intends to market and sell kitchen and bathroom fixtures online through its' intended website. Other than its President, the Company has no employees. We intend to contract with specialists to develop our logo and website, and contract with an Internet advertising and search engine specialist to assist us in development of our planned business. The Company has currently no arrangements or understandings in place with any specialists to develop our logo, to develop our website and to develop our planned business through Internet advertising and search engines.



	 



	FIRST FIXTURES, INC. is a shell company as defined in Rule 405, because it is a company with nominal operations and it has assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents. Accordingly, there will be illiquidity of any future trading market until the company is no longer considered a shell company.



	 



	The Company has not yet implemented its business model and to date has generated no revenues. It is the Company's intention to provide its customers with the quality kitchen and bathroom fixtures. The Company's target customers will be home builders or home owners that have an interest in home renovations. We intend to deploy current electronic marketing activities like Search Engine Optimization and online advertising. The Company intends to focus its marketing activities in North America.



	 



	The Company intends to provide home kitchen & bathroom faucets and faucet handles manufactured by Zhejiang Momali Sanitary Utensils Co., Ltd., our potential supplier whospecializes in manufacturing spigot, sanitary material, and copper hardware components. Although our potential supplier has an "Add to Basket" on their website, there is no customer accessible "Check Out" function nor customer accessible "Payment" function" on our potential supplier's website. Therefore, we are of the opinion that potential First Fixtures customers cannot buy directly from our potential supplier. FIRST FIXTURES, INC. intends to market our planned products on the Internet.



	 




	Product Description






	 



	Kitchen and bathroom faucets from Zhejiang Momali Sanitary Utensils Co., Ltd. have a broad range of style and finish. Faucet finish will include oil rubbed bronze, brushed nickel and chrome plating. Tub/shower faucets will include deck mounted, wall mounted and freestanding with hand showers. Bathroom basin taps will include free standing and deck mount basin taps while kitchen faucets will include wall mount and deck mount faucets with hand sprayers.



	 




	Competitive Environment




	 



	Manufacturers include large companies such as American Standard Brands, Armitage Shanks, Asahi Eito Co., Ltd., Black & Decker Corporation, Price Pfister, Inc., Elkay Manufacturing Company, Friedrich Grohe AG & Co. KG, Ideal Standard, Jacuzzi Whirlpool Bath, Kohler Co., MAAX Corp., Masco Corp., Moen, Inc., Roca UK, Sanitec Corp., Toto Ltd., and Villeroy & Boch. In addition, there are many large retailers of plumbing fixtures like Home Depot, HQ and HQ, Home Depot, and Builder's Square (Builders Square closed its stores and became an online distributor). There are many online resellers of plumbing fixtures including www.kingstonbrass.com, www.eodfaucet.com, www.signaturehardware.com, www.vintagebath.com, www.signofthecrab.com and www.vandykes.com

	.






	 


	Our competitors may have greater access to capital than we do and may use these resources to engage in aggressive advertising and marketing campaigns. The current prevalence of aggressive advertising and promotion may generate pricing pressures to which we must respond. We expect that competition will continue to increase. We might not be able to compete with large company's if they where to drive prices down for bathroom fixtures.

	Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.







	 



	Although our common stock is not listed on a public exchange, our stock is quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) and as of May 19, 2016 is quoted on the OTCQB. There was no bid/ask history during the period ended March 31, 2016. There have been no trades in our stock.

	Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.







	 






	Results of Operations






	 



	For the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company had no revenue. Expenses for the year ended March 31, 2016 totaled $28,445 consisting primarily of Office and general expense, resulting in a net loss of $28,445 as compared to expenses for the year ended March 31, 2015 of consisting primarily of Office and general expense, resulting is a net loss of $16,669. The increase in expenses for the year ended March 31, 2016 are primarily due to filing fees with the state of Nevada, the hiring of a transfer agent, the application fees to OTCMarkets for quotation on the OTCQB and an increase in accounting fees.




	 






	Capital Resources and Liquidity






	 



	Our auditors have issued a "going concern" opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we implement our plan of operations. With the exception of cash advances from our sole Officer and Director, we must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business.



	 



	As of March 31, 2016, we had $2,191 in cash as compared to $Nil in cash for the year ended March 31, 2015. As of the date of this Form 10-K statement, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to fund the expenses related its reporting status.



	 




	Plan of Operation






	 



	FIRST FIXTURES, INC. is a company that intends to market and sell its planned products through its' intended website. The Company has not yet implemented its business model and to date and has generated no revenues. It is the Company's intention to provide its customers with the quality kitchen and bathroom fixtures. The Company's target market will be home builders or home owners that have an interest in home renovations.



	 



	We require additional financing to implement our Plan of Operation and sustain business operations. Currently, we do not have any arrangements for financing and we may be unable to obtain financing when required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors, including the Company's ability to attract customers. The Company may be unable to access to capital markets in the future or that financing, adequate to satisfy the cash requirements of implementing our business strategies, will be available on acceptable terms. The inability of the Company to gain access to capital markets or obtain acceptable financing could have a material adverse effect upon the results of its operations and upon its financial conditions.

	Over the next 12-month period, our Company must raise capital to introduce its planned products and start sales. We intend to market our products on the Internet. We have two planned phases to our operations over the next twelve months.



	 



	The Company requires a minimum of $25,000 to implement its business plan.





	 



	The Company intends to store and make delivery to customers its planned inventory in the United States at fulfillment service providers like Expert Fulfillment, eCommerce Fulfillment or Shipwire. The company has not contracted with any fulfillment service providers.





	 



	The first phase of our planed operations will be to secure the services of specialists to develop our logo and website. Estimated cost for logo development is $10,000. Estimated cost for website development is $8,000. In addition, the Company plans to purchase two lap top computers, a printer/fax, a photocopier and the requisite office supply and stationary at an estimated cost of $7,300. The company anticipates the first phase of our planed operations to be completed within 120 days of receiving investment capital. Initial inventory will consist of product numbers M11020-528C Faucet, P25005 Hand Shower, M11300-119 Popular Faucet, Model 126 American Basin Mixer, M11205 Hot Basin Mixer, M12308-124 Unique Gold Faucet, and M92300-119 Rain Shower Mixer. Once the amount of investment capital has been determined, the mix of product and related quantities will be decided upon.

	 



	 

	For the second phase of our planed operations, we intend to engage the services of an internet advertising and search engine specialist at an estimated cost of $6,000 for search engine optimization and an estimated cost of $12,000 for online advertising. The Company intends to enter into a supply agreement with Zhejiang Momali Sanitary Utensils Co., Ltd. and purchase its initial inventory at an estimated cost of $34,450. The company anticipates the second phase of our planned operations to be completed within 240 days of receiving investment capital. We anticipate generating revenues within 360 days of receiving investment capital.



	 



	If $25,000 of financing is raised, the Company intends to scale back its planned inventory purchase and travel expenses to $4,000 and $1,000 respectively, eliminating the logo development expense and reducing the website development expense to $6,000 and minimize online advertising and search engine optimization expenses to $3,000 and $2,200 respectively and reducing our administrative expense to $1,550.



	 



	If $50,000 of financing is raised, the Company intends to scale back its planned inventory purchase and travel expenses to $11,350 and $5,000 respectively, reducing the logo development expense to $5,000 and reducing the website development expense to $6,000, Furthermore, the Company will minimize online advertising and search engine optimization expenses to $7,000 and $3,600 respectively and reducing our administrative expense to $4,800.



	 



	If $75,000 of financing is raised, the Company intends to scale back its planned inventory purchase and travel expenses to $20,900 and $7,500 respectively, increasing the logo development expense to $10,000 and increasing the website development expense to $8,000, Furthermore, the Company will reduce online advertising and search engine optimization expenses to $10,000 and $4,800 respectively and reducing our administrative expense to $4,800.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM






	 



	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders




	First Fixtures, Inc.



	 



	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of First Fixtures, Inc. ("the Company") as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended March 31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.



	 



	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.



	 



	In our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First Fixtures, Inc. as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the years in the two year period ended March 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.



	 



	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has generated no revenues from its business operations, has incurred operating losses since inception and will need additional working capital to service its debt and for its planned activity, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 1 to the financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	FIRST FIXTURES, INC.







	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	 





	NOTE 1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION





	 



	First Fixtures, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on February 21, 2014 and established a fiscal year end of March 31. The Company is organized to sell plumbing fixtures over the internet.





	 




	Going concern




	 



	To date the Company has generated no revenues from its business operations and has incurred operating losses since inception of $46,936. As at March 31, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficit of $38,846. The Company will require additional funding to meet its ongoing obligations and to fund anticipated operating losses. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company intends to continue to fund its business by way of private placements and advances from related parties as may be required. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.



	 




	NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 




	Use of Estimates and Assumptions




	 



	Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.



	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 



	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.



	 




	Financial Instruments




	 



	The carrying amount of the Company's financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair values due to their short term maturities.



	 




	Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Common Share




	 



	The basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the Company's net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year. The diluted earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are the same as basic earnings (loss) per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the Company. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no common stock equivalents outstanding.



	 




	Income Taxes




	 



	The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are



	 



	measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.

	NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)




	 




	Stock-based Compensation




	 



	The Company follows


	ASC 718-10, "


	Stock Compensation


	",


	which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services


	,


	with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions


	. ASC 718-10


	is a revision to


	SFAS


	No


	. 123, "


	Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation


	,"


	and supersedes Accounting Principles Board


	("APB")


	Opinion




	No


	. 25, "


	Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees


	,"


	and its related implementation guidance


	. ASC 718-10


	requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award


	(


	with limited exceptions


	).


	Incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized


	.


	As of March 31, 2016 the Company had not adopted a stock option plan nor had it granted any stock options. Accordingly no stock-based compensation has been recorded to date.



	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	 



	The Company does not expect the adoption of any other recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial statements.



	 




	NOTE 3 – COMMON STOCK




	 



	On February 28, 2014, the Company issued 2,590,000,000 (5,000,000 pre-split) common shares at $0.00000193 per share to the sole director and President of the Company for cash proceeds of $5,000.



	 



	On April 5, 2015, the Company issued 40,017,572 shares (77,254 pre-split shares) of its common stock for $3,090 in cash.



	 



	On April 23, 2015 the directors of the Company increased its Share Capital from 75,000,000 authorized common shares to 200,000,000 authorized common shares with the same par value of $0.001 per share. No preferred shares have been authorized or issued.



	 



	On April 23, 2015, the directors of the Company approved a special resolution to undertake a forward split of the common stock of the Company on a basis of 518 new common shares for 1 old common share. All references in these financial statements to number of common shares, price per share and weighted average number of shares outstanding prior to the 518:1 forward split have been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retroactive basis, unless otherwise noted.



	 



	On April 24, 2015, the founding shareholder of the Company returned 2,529,974,160 (4,884,120 pre-split) restricted shares of common stock to treasury and the shares were subsequently cancelled by the Company.

During the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company received cash advances from the CEO of $29,352 and $9,600 respectively. All amounts due to the related party are unsecured, non-interest bearing and are due on demand.

	The amount taken into income as deferred income tax assets must reflect that portion of the income tax loss carry forwards that is more likely-than-not to be realized from future operations. The Company has chosen to provide a full valuation allowance against all available income tax loss carry forwards. The Company has recognized a valuation allowance for the deferred income tax asset since the Company cannot be assured that it is more likely than not that such benefit will be utilized in future years. The valuation allowance is reviewed annually. When circumstances change and which cause a change in management's judgment about the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the impact of the change on the valuation allowance is generally reflected in current income.





	 



	As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has no unrecognized income tax benefits. The Company's policy for classifying interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is to include such items as tax expense. No interest or penalties have been recorded during the year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 no interest or penalties have been accrued as of March 31, 2016 and 2015. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.



	 



	The tax years from 2014 and forward remain open to examination by federal and state authorities due to net operating loss and credit carryforwards. The Company is currently not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authorities.

	Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.









	 



	There have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants regarding our accounting, financial disclosures or any other matter.




	 







	Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.









	 



	The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as required by Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Section 404 A. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.



	 



	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management conducted the assessment based on certain criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2016.



	 



	The matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company's management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Company's Chief Financial Officer in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of March 31, 2016 and communicated the matters to our management.



	 



	Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2), (3) and (4) above did not have an affect on the Company's financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the Company's determination to its financial statements for the future years.

	We are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of this commitment, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.



	 



	Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's Board. In addition, management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further, management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future.



	  



	We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.



	 



	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual report.



	 



	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the small business issuer's last fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.









	 




	Identification of directors and executive officers




	 



	The name, address, age and position of our present sole officer and director is set forth below:



	 











	Name










	Age










	Position(s)








	 






	 




	 




	 







	Colin Povall








	46








	President, Secretary/ Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.







	 



	The person named above has held his offices/positions since inception of our company and is expected to hold his offices/positions at least until the next annual meeting of our stockholders.



	 




	Business Experience




	 



	Mr Povall has been the owner of his own plumbing company since February 2000 until the present date. He has been running his Company, H20 Technologies CC Trading as Plumbing Unlimited, successfully and has extensive knowledge of bathroom fixtures.



	 



	The Company feels that Mr. Povall's entrepreneurship and his experience in plumbing products sales, services and marketing make him the best choice for the president of the Company.



	 




	Director Independence




	 



	Our board of directors is currently composed of one member, Colin Povall, who does not qualify as an independent director in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, our board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to each director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director's business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management.



	  




	Conflicts of Interest




	 


	At the present time, the company does not foresee any direct conflict between Mr. Povall's' other business interests and his involvement in FIRST FIXTURES, INC.

	The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of small business issuer's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):





	 









	a)



	all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

 MAXI LINE



DOWNLOAD CATALOG


Maxi Line is Madix's most popular and versatile product line. Thousands of shelves, merchandising accessories, and back panel options make this line universally appealing to all market segments. Most retailers utilize this line for aisle and perimeter wall fixtures. The Maxi Line products are available in multiple sizes and finish options. Easy to assemble, Maxi Line has snap-together parts and built-in levelers. Maxi Line's standard shelves include integral tag moldings, round perforations for accessories, and slim, multi-position brackets.

 TUBE LINE



DOWNLOAD CATALOG


Tube Line is an alternative to Maxi for aisle and perimeter wall shelving. The line includes several options for shelves, merchandising accessories, and back panels. Tube Line has a reduced load capacity rating compared to Maxi Line's, but it assembles faster since it has fewer snap-together parts. The line's standard shelves include flush-front tag, diamond-shaped perforations for accessories and slim, multi-position brackets. The T-Rack Fashion and Shoe models are offshoots of Tube Line, and they are perfect for selling apparel and shoes.

 FREESTANDING



DOWNLOAD CATALOG


Madix produces displays for an array of retail applications. Some of the most common types of freestanding displays are four way merchandisers, platforms, display tables, rolling displayers, cubes, pedestals, and dump bins. Often these displays create focal points that complement aisle and perimeter fixture runs, or they are deployed exclusively when space is limited or a particular look is desired.

 PALLET RACK



DOWNLOAD CATALOG


Pallet Rack is the ultimate solution for heavy-duty racking when substantial loads or the use of handling equipment rules out Wide Span. Maximize safety within your budget constraints by choosing from a variety of deck and beam options. Madix's Pallet Rack line also offers more accessories than the typical racking competitor. Available in two standard colors, Pallet Rack can also be painted to match the colors of other Madix fixtures, making it suitable for sales floor applications.

Wide Span is available with a number of deck and beam options to safely match what you need with your budget. It assembles quickly and has many accessories. It is available in two standard colors or finishes that match Madix's display fixtures.

 CATWALK SYSTEM



LEARN MORE


The space-utilizing Catwalk System is designed to eliminate storage issues often plagued by downsized backrooms. The issue of storage space is often a crucial element in dealing with an efficient backroom. Catwalk System resolves this issue by creating a complete second floor that practically doubles the usable storage space. This custom backroom solution consists of joists, hangers, steel planking, staircases, protective railings, and wire panels. Contact your Madix Sales Representative for ordering information or visit our Sales Assistance page.

www.kingstonbrass.com, www.eodfaucet.com, www.signaturehardware.com,
www.vintagebath.com, www.signofthecrab.com and www.vandykes.com.
 
Our competitors may have greater access to capital than we do and may use these
resources to engage in aggressive advertising and marketing campaigns. The
current prevalence of aggressive advertising and promotion may generate pricing
pressures to which we must respond. We expect that competition will continue to
increase. We might not be able to compete with large company’s if they were to
drive prices down for bathroom fixtures.

Our competitors may have greater access to capital than we do and may use these
resources to engage in aggressive advertising and marketing campaigns. The
current prevalence of aggressive advertising and promotion may generate pricing
pressures to which we must respond. We expect that competition will continue to
increase. We might not be able to compete with large company’s if they were to
drive prices down for bathroom fixtures.
