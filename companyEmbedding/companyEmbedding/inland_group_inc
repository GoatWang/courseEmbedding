BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.

                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Inland American – SEC Probe – Salas Wang Investigation
May 11, 2012


The Wall Street is reporting that the SEC is investigating Inland American Non-Traded REIT.  Our firm has been investigating shareholder claims against brokers who sold shares to investors for sometime.  This recent SEC action, we believe, is the culmination of years of abuse.  According to the WSJ:
The SEC is looking at activity of Inland American Real Estate Trust to determine if the REIT committed violations related to management fees, the timing and amount of distributions paid to investors, and transactions with affiliates, according to a company filing with the SEC on Monday.
If you own shares of Inland American, please call Jeffrey Salas at 312.803.4963 or fill out the contact form below.

ProductsA world of options and great development support for your new product label and packaging solution
Inland’s diverse line of packaging options and expertise in multiple packaging technologies makes us a valuable resource for brand owners.
Our capabilities span several printing technologies—rotogravure, flexography and offset lithography. Our choices of label types introduce hundreds of materials, inks and coatings, from shrink sleeves to IML labels to illuminated or color-changing smart packaging.
But it’s our end-to-end support that sets us apart. We recognize that product label decisions involve an entire category of details. Your filling, labeling, packing and shipping systems can all be affected. And transitioning to a brand new label type or packaging type involves a lot more. That’s where Inland really shines.
We collaborate with everyone who touches your solution, from ink companies to label equipment manufacturers, making sure you have the solution you need and that it works in your world. We proof and test until we’re sure. For a new label application, we often test small batches of digitally printed labels on the production equipment that will be used for the product. Any needed adjustments to materials or process can then be made before labels are run.
We’re with you from concept through production. No matter which packaging technology you choose, you can count on our technical expertise, a craftsman’s eye for detail and our robust color systems to deliver a best-in-class product label.

What Inland has to offer matters to beverage brands—the most accurately sized, consistently running labels on the market, a proven, streamlined ordering system via customer web portal, our own InColor color management system, total cost savings and experienced technical support in your bottling plants.

Our beverage packaging and labeling options include:

White, metalized or specialty paper cut and stack labels

White, clear or metalized film pressure sensitive labels
Roll-fed shrink labels in clear film
