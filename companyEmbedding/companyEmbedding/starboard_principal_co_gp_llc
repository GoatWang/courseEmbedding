NEW YORK, May 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates, "Starboard"), one of the largest shareholders of Depomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:    DEPO) with an ownership interest in approximately 9.9% of Depomed's outstanding shares, today announced it has delivered an open letter to Depomed shareholders and intends to recommence the process for calling a Special Meeting of Depomed shareholders for removing and replacing the current Depomed Board of Directors with a modified slate of six highly qualified director nominees.
The full text of the letter follows:








May 26, 2016
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Starboard Value LP, together with its affiliates ("Starboard"), currently has an ownership interest in approximately 9.9% of the outstanding shares of Depomed, Inc. ("Depomed" or the "Company"), making us one of the Company's largest shareholders.  
We believe that Depomed is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist within the control of management and the Board of Directors (the "Board") to unlock substantial value for the benefit of all shareholders. Unfortunately, as we outlined in our previous letter to Depomed on April 8th, we have significant concerns regarding serious corporate governance deficiencies, questionable capital allocation decisions, and egregious actions taken by the Board to stymie strategic interest in acquiring Depomed. We believe the Board clearly lacks the independence, objectivity, and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders.
To that end, we will be delivering to Depomed today a new written request, in accordance with Depomed's Bylaws, that the Board set a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to call a special meeting (the "Record Date Request Notice") for purposes of seeking to remove and replace the current Board. This Record Date Request Notice supersedes our initial request delivered to Depomed, dated April 7, 2016 (the "Initial Record Date Request Notice").  As you may recall, the Initial Record Date Request Notice was delivered to Depomed in order to preserve our rights under California law and mitigate the risk that Depomed would seek to further amend its governance provisions to suppress shareholder rights.
Since delivering the Initial Record Date Request Notice, we have undertaken an extensive process to carefully vet a slate of highly-qualified nominees that included the evaluation of over 100 qualified potential candidates. We have selected a group of six candidates possessing unique skill sets and perspectives directly relevant to Depomed's business and current challenges, including pharmaceutical operations, healthcare regulatory, finance, board governance and oversight, and mergers and acquisitions expertise. Collectively, our slate of director nominees has decades of experience serving on well-performing public company boards. Importantly, this group of nominees, if elected at the special meeting, is prepared to serve the shareholders of Depomed and ensure that the interests of all shareholders are of paramount importance.
We appreciate that the Board promptly set a record date in response to our Initial Record Date Request Notice, thereby demonstrating that it does not intend to unnecessarily delay the calling of a special meeting by shareholders. While we also appreciate the Board's intentions in amending its 10% poison pill rights plan ("Poison Pill") to facilitate our delivery of the requisite requests from shareholders in order to call the special meeting, there are other considerations as a 13D filer that make us uncomfortable with the idea of soliciting and delivering requests from other Depomed shareholders without conducting a public solicitation. Therefore, today we are filing preliminary proxy materials with the SEC in furtherance of soliciting the requisite requests to deliver the special meeting request. Our expectation is that the Board will adhere to a similar timetable in setting a record date for this Record Date Request Notice as it did with our Initial Record Date Request Notice, and we look forward to calling a special meeting of shareholders in the near future.
We are confident that you will find the team of professionals we are nominating to be incredibly well-qualified to serve as directors of Depomed. We have provided detailed biographies of each of our nominees below. Over the coming weeks and months, we intend to share our detailed views on Depomed and look forward to engaging with you as we approach the special meeting of shareholders.

NEW YORK, Sept. 12, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Starboard Value LP (together with its affiliates and director nominees, "Starboard"), the largest stockholder of MIPS Technologies, Inc. ("MIPS" or the "Company") (NasdaqGS:   MIPS) with ownership of 9.1% of the outstanding shares, today announced that it delivered a letter to the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Sandeep Vij, and the Company's Board of Directors.
In the letter, Starboard expressed its belief that the Company's common stock is deeply undervalued and that meaningful opportunities exist to unlock significant value based on actions within the control of management and the Board.  Starboard also noted the Company's dismal stock price performance dating back to its IPO in 1998.  According to Starboard, this destruction in stockholder value is a direct result of the Company's weak operating performance, deteriorating margins and poor capital allocation decisions around internal investments and poorly executed acquisitions.  Starboard urged MIPS to discontinue pursuing acquisitions and instead focus on improving its operating performance and consider allocating capital to buy back shares at the current deeply discounted valuation.  
Also, Starboard announced today it has delivered a letter to the Company nominating a slate of highly qualified candidates for election at the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting, including Robert Kramer, Jeffrey S. McCreary, Jeffrey C. Smith and Kenneth H. Traub.  Starboard believes that the terms of three current MIPS directors are set to expire at the 2011 Annual Meeting and if this remains the case, Starboard would withdraw one of its director candidates.  Starboard stated that it looks forward to engaging in a constructive dialogue with the Company in hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable resolution that will serve the best interests of all stockholders.
The full text of the letter follows:
September 12, 2011
Sandeep Vij
MIPS Technologies, Inc
President and CEO
955 East Arques Avenue
Sunnyvale, CA 94085
CC: Board of Directors
Dear Sandeep,
Starboard Value LP, together with its affiliates and director nominees, currently owns 9.1% of the outstanding common stock of MIPS Technologies, Inc. ("MIPS" or "the Company"), making us the Company's largest shareholder.  This morning, we delivered a letter to the Company formally nominating four highly qualified candidates for election to the Board of Directors (the "Board") at the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting.  
We believe that MIPS' common stock is deeply undervalued and that meaningful opportunities exist to unlock significant value based on actions within the control of management and the Board.  Despite a highly profitable royalty stream, market-leading technology and valuable intellectual property, MIPS stock has dramatically underperformed over an extended time period.  The director nominees we have proposed have the requisite skill sets to assist the Board in evaluating opportunities to improve performance and shareholder value.  
As shown in the table below, MIPS' stock price performance has been dismal dating back to the Company's Initial Public Offering ("IPO") in 1998.  As of August 22, 2011, the last trading day prior to our 13D filing, MIPS shares traded at $4.34 per share, a decline of 69%, versus the IPO price of $14.00.  During the same period, the average share price of MIPS' Peer Group and the broader indices have increased by approximately 120% and 42%, respectively.

1. Performance as of 8/22/11.
2. Peer Group consists of companies used in MIPS proxy to set executive compensation and include AATI, ARMH, CEVA, ENTR, EXAR, GSIT, IKAN, LAVA, PSEM, PDFS, PLXT, SUPX, TXCC, TRID and VLTR.

 In fact, in the 2011 year-to-date period through August 22, 2011, MIPS' share price declined 71% compared to a decline of only 14% in its Peer Group and 17% in the broader indices.
This destruction in shareholder value is a direct result of the Company's weak operating performance, deteriorating margins and poor capital allocation decisions around internal investments and acquisitions.  In the eighteen months since you were named President and CEO in January 2010, operating margins and profitability have plummeted.  As shown in the table below, operating margins have declined from 22.5% in the third quarter of 2010 to 8.9% last quarter, a reduction of 60%.  While the Company has attempted to drive revenue growth by increasing its spending on research and development and sales and marketing, revenue has actually declined over the last four consecutive quarters and is expected to continue to decline over the coming year.  This continued decline in revenue, together with increases in operating expenses, has caused significant deterioration in operating margins and may continue to negatively impact operating margins into the future.

 Source: Company filings.  FY 2012 estimates per Craig-Hallum
Based on MIPS' recently reported fourth quarter results and associated conference call, it appears that the current plan is to press ahead with aggressive spending despite clearly missed expectations.  As the Company's largest shareholder, we have serious concerns regarding the significant deterioration in financial performance and the lack of action to stem the decline in revenues and operating profits.  Further, we are deeply troubled by the apparent willingness of the Board to consider using the Company's cash to pursue acquisitions in light of a terrible acquisition track record and an operating business in need of serious and immediate attention.
As a reminder, on August 27, 2007 MIPS announced the acquisition of Chipidea Microelectronica S.A. ("Chipidea") for an aggregate value of $149 million, plus assumed liabilities.(1)  Prior to the announcement, MIPS shares were trading at $8.17.  As a result of this acquisition, the Company depleted its entire $145 million of net cash and swung to a net debt balance of $11.7 million.(2)  The stated rationale for the transaction was to "strategically enter high-growth segments where analog is essential" and that MIPS expected "to reap significant sales growth from the new partnership."
The Chipidea acquisition proved to be a massive failure.  MIPS' financial results deteriorated and the stock fell to $1.01 per share at its low, 88% lower than where the Company was trading prior to the Chipidea acquisition.  Less than two years later, on May 7, 2009, MIPS sold Chipidea to Synopsis for a mere $22 million, less than 15% of the original $149 million purchase price.  MIPS stated, "Unfortunately, after two big quarters the analog market went into a sharp downturn...affecting our entire business" and that the "limited ability of our balance sheet to absorb that shock is driving this decision." 
Given the disastrous results of the Chipidea acquisition and the many years of poor financial performance, we strongly encourage the Board to reconsider its stance on capital allocation.  Instead of pursuing acquisitions, the Company should focus on improving its operating performance and consider allocating capital to buy back shares of MIPS at the current deeply discounted valuation.  We believe this is the best use of excess cash and will significantly benefit shareholders.  
Further, we believe that MIPS' intellectual property may hold substantial value.  To that end, we strongly encourage the Board to explore alternatives for realizing that value for the benefit of all shareholders.
We look forward to continuing to share our views with you.  It should be clear that our nominees are uniquely qualified to assist the Board in evaluating the topics covered in this letter and in taking the necessary steps to enhance shareholder value.  We are happy to engage in a constructive dialogue with you in hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable resolution that will serve the best interests of all shareholders.  
Best Regards,
Jeffrey C. Smith
