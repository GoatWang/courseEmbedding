WAYZATA, Minn., Jan. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mill City Ventures III, Ltd. ("Mill City") today announced that Lyle Berman, board member of Golden Entertainment ("Golden") and founder, former chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Grand Casinos, Inc., was appointed to the company's board of directors, returning the board's size to five.
"Lyle will provide Mill City with incredible resources in his vast business experience in gaming ventures, retail sales, food and beverage and many other industries," said Mill City Chief Executive Douglas M. Polinsky. "He is a tremendous addition to complement our current slate of experienced and valued board members."
Since August 2015 Mr. Berman has served on the Board of Directors of Golden Entertainment, Inc. He also provides consulting services to the Chief Executive Officer of Golden. Previously, he was the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Lakes Entertainment, Inc. ("Lakes", the predecessor of Golden) since June 1998 and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Grand Casinos, Inc. (the predecessor to Lakes) from October 1991 through December 1998. 
Mr. Berman has also served as the Executive Chairman of the Board of WPT Enterprises, Inc. (now known as Emerald Oil, Inc.) from its inception in February 2002 until July 2013. Mr. Berman was also Chairman of the Board of PokerTek, Inc. from January 2005 until October 2011. Mr. Berman also served as Chief Executive Officer of Rainforest Café, Inc. from February 1993 until December 2000. 
We believe Mr. Berman's qualifications to sit on our Board of Directors include: his over 30 years in retail, gaming and many other industries; his extensive executive experience running large national companies, and his particular strengths in strategic operations; and his extensive public company experience.
He is a 1964 graduate of the University of Minnesota in business administration.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Mill City Ventures III Ltd (OTCPK:MCVT)
Property, Plant and Equipment
=GURUF("MCVT","Property, Plant and Equipment")

$0.02 Mil (As of Mar. 2017)
Mill City Ventures III Ltd's quarterly net PPE declined from Sep. 2016 ($0.03 Mil) to Dec. 2016 ($0.03 Mil) and declined from Dec. 2016 ($0.03 Mil) to Mar. 2017 ($0.02 Mil).
Mill City Ventures III Ltd's annual net PPE declined from Dec. 2014 ($0.05 Mil) to Dec. 2015 ($0.04 Mil) and declined from Dec. 2015 ($0.04 Mil) to Dec. 2016 ($0.03 Mil).

Definition
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are the fixed assets of the companyFixed assets are also known as non-current assets.
Property, plant, and equipment includes assets that will - in the normal course of business - neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers.
Some of the most common parts of property, plant, and equipment are:

	Land
	Buildings (and leasehold improvements)
	Transportation equipment
	Manufacturing equipment
	Office equipment
	Office furniture

Companies with lots of property, plant, and equipment often have special categories. For example, railroad property includes:

	Track
	Ties
	Ballast
	Bridges
	Tunnels
	Signals
	Locomotives
	Freight Cars

There is often a note in the financial statements - found in a companys 10-K - that will explain the different categories of property a company owns.
The market value of property, plant, and equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of property, plant, and equipment.
For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile mills, it had to pay the buyers of the companys manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment away. That property, plant, and equipment was literally worth less than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres of land.
All property, plant, and equipment other than land is depreciated. Land is never depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown on the balance sheet at cost.
The property, plant, and equipment line shown on the balance sheet is usually net property, plant, and equipment. This means it is the cost of the property, plant, and equipment less accumulated depreciation.

Explanation
A company with durable competitive advantage doesnt need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive. The company replaces when it wears out. On the other hand, a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace.
Difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows, whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance.
Producing a consistent product that doesnt change equates to consistent profits. There is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures. Think Coca Cola, Johnson & Johnson etc.
