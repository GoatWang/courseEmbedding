What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

Jul 28, 2015, 6:54pm EDT














BALTIMORE, July 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM), today announced that it has agreed to acquire a majority equity interest in RARE Infrastructure, Ltd., (RARE) a pioneer in global listed infrastructure investing headquartered in Sydney, Australia.  
The firm, with offices in Sydney, Melbourne, London and Chicago, specializes in global listed infrastructure investments, managing $7.6 billion for institutional and retail clients.  The acquisition expands Legg Mason's offerings in equity liquid alternative investments, adding an experienced manager in a high-growth asset class.  
The transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings on a GAAP and adjusted net income basis in the first year after closing, which is expected in the 4th calendar quarter of 2015.    
Under the terms of the transaction, Legg Mason will acquire a 75% ownership stake, the firm's management team will retain a 15% equity stake and The Treasury Group, a previous minority owner, will retain 10%.  
RARE will operate as a core independent investment affiliate along with Brandywine Global, ClearBridge Investments, Martin Currie, the Permal Group, QS Investors, Royce and Associates, and Western Asset Management.   
Established in 2006, RARE is one of the largest alternative asset managers in the infrastructure asset class category[1].  The firm's investment approach is centered on risk adjusted returns on equity (RARE) and its investment process focuses on detailed analysis of cash flows of infrastructure assets that provide stable, predictable returns combined with the underlying macro and economic valuation drivers. RARE has:

A focus on global listed infrastructure companies and invests in the listed equity securities of major infrastructure projects and developments such as airports, gas, electricity, water and roads in both developed countries and emerging markets.

Products that provide the opportunity for stable and predictable returns, low correlation to other asset classes and reasonable inflation protection.  

Established investment process with strong performance relative to peers and an experienced portfolio management team with deep industry knowledge and support from sector focused research teams.  The 15-person investment team has global reach across listed infrastructure categories and markets.  

A global institutional client base spanning Australasia, the US, the UK and Europe. Canada and the Middle East, consisting of large corporate and government pension funds, municipals and endowments.

An extensive investment record and leading presence in the retail markets in Australia and Canada, with the ability to leverage Legg Mason's Global Distribution to accelerate their growth.  

Strong relationships with institutions and consultants globally.
Joseph A. Sullivan, Chairman and CEO of Legg Mason, said, "RARE's investment expertise has strong relevance for many clients today, meeting important investment objectives including income, growth, diversification and capital preservation.  The market for infrastructure investing has grown significantly over the past few years and RARE has participated in this growth, particularly in early adopter markets like Australia and Canada.  We believe that global demand for these liquid, long-dated assets will continue to grow and that we can leverage RARE's existing geographic presence into additional important markets that Legg Mason's global distribution platform serves in the US, Asia and Europe.  This is an important investment capability addition for our clients and we welcome the RARE team to Legg Mason."
Richard Elmslie, Founder and co-CEO said "I am very excited by the opportunity to form a partnership with Legg Mason, as their goals and culture are highly aligned with RARE's vision.  Their affiliate model allows management to run the business independently with governance and oversight from the board.  This partnership provides continuity and sustainability for our clients with no change to the investment team or process."
Nick Langley, Founder and co-CEO said "For our staff and business, this provides a number of opportunities including for enhanced career progression, equity participation in the business, and access to a deep, well -resourced support team. Overall, this is a great strategic and cultural fit for RARE."
The senior management team at RARE has signed long-term contracts in conjunction with the transaction, and will retain a 15% equity stake in the firm.  The senior team will invest a portion of the proceeds from the sale into the firm's products.  
RARE Infrastructure, Ltd. was advised by UBS Investment Bank.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




The Fund is newly organized, with a limited history of operations. Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal. Small- and mid-cap stocks involve greater risks and volatility than large-cap stocks. International investments are subject to special risks including currency fluctuations, social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Because this Fund expects to hold a concentrated portfolio of securities, and invests in certain regions or industries, it has increased vulnerability to market volatility. The fund may invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs), which are closely linked to the performance of the real estate markets. REITs are subject to illiquidity, credit and interest rate risks, as well as risks associated with small- and mid-cap investments. Investments in master limited partnerships (MLPs) include the risks of declines in energy and commodity prices, decreases in energy demand, adverse weather conditions, natural or other disasters, changes in government regulation, and changes in tax laws, and other risks of the MLP and energy sector. Derivatives, such as options and futures, can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. As a non-diversified fund, it can invest a higher percentage of its assets in any one issuer than a diversified fund, which may magnify the fund's losses from events affecting a particular issuer.

 Performance 






Performance




IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. For performance data including the effects of sales charges, Class A and Class A2 shares reflect the deduction of a maximum front-end sales charge of 5.75%. One-, three- and five-year returns for Class B shares reflect a maximum contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) of up to 5.0%, 3.0% and 1.0% respectively. Class C1 shares have no initial or CDSC charge, but are subject to a 12b-1 fee. One-year returns for Class C shares reflect a CDSC of 1.0%. Total returns assume the reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all Fund expenses. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports. Performance shown excluding sales charges would have been lower, if the applicable sales charge been reflected. Had fees not been waived in various periods performance would have been lower. All classes of shares may not be available to all investors or through all distribution channels.
Different minimums may apply to clients of certain service agents. See the Fund's prospectus for additional information.
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.








Net Asset Value (NAV): An investment option’s net asset value (“NAV”) per unit or unit price is calculated by dividing the value of its net assets by the total number of units outstanding. 
























Morningstar proprietary ratings are based on risk-adjusted returns and are subject to change every month. The Overall Morningstar Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. A 4- or 5-star rating does not necessarily imply that a fund achieved positive results for the period. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Share classes have a common portfolio and different expense structures.














**Gross expenses are the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the share class(es) shown.  Net expenses for Class(es) A, I & IS reflect contractual fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2018 without Board consent.

Listed vs Unlisted









Many managers of hard infrastructure assets – railways, tollroads, airports etc, have chosen to list the assets or portfolios of assets on stock exchanges around the world. The global listed infrastructure sector has a lower risk profile than the underlying infrastructure assets, and is more liquid, providing key advantages for investors. At RARE we believe we have both the infrastructure experience and the funds management experience to assess and take advantage of these opportunities.  The market as a whole is relatively inexperienced in relation to valuation and risk assessment of the complex structures and financing arrangements that are standard in this sector.Infrastructure asset class. Listed vs. unlistedClick here to read RARE’s The Infrastructure Opportunity Listed vs Unlisted Paper.
