Why GMAT Pill is a Great Product – Peter Yu – MediumHomepageSign in / Sign upPeter YuBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingProduct Manager @ Ladders; previously Expedia, Postmates, GMAT Pill co-founderApr 25, 2015Why GMAT Pill is a Great Product[This post is an application of the framework I introduced in a prior post: A Universal Framework for Understanding Great Products.]As part of my exercise evaluating the products at the companies I’ve worked at, here is a product perspective for GMAT Pill, a company I co-founded in 2009.GMAT Pill is an online GMAT test prep course helping students score higher on the GMAT exam. It entered the market in 2009 with these unique angles:effective simulation of the private tutoring experience by leveraging video screen recording and audio recording technologyconvenient online and mobile access (24/7) via website and mobile appsaffordable price point <$400 and in pill-sized pieces of ~$100 eachtrusted GMAT expert as private teacher (plus email testimonials, #1 rating on public forums, etc)easy-to-follow framework approach, 1-month study plan with notifications, and more.I’ll go into how GMAT Pill works from a product perspective (metrics, etc) in another post. But for now, I tell you why it’s a great product from a framework approach: it’s useful, convenient, affordable, trustworthy, and easy-to-use.A) Useful (effectively transfers ‘thinking process’)In the GMAT test prep market, test takers wanted practice questions, practice tests, and text explanations. Ultimately, these test takers wanted higher scores.GMAT Pill delivered on these points and went farther than its competitors by offering video explanations — specifically videos simulating a private tutoring experience, which makes the transfer of knowledge or thinking process between teacher and student that much more effective than traditional text-book studying or group classroom learning. The unique approach was useful AND effective.B) ConvenientTraditionally, students’ options were limited. GMAT Prep books were bulky to carry around. And in-person classrooms were highly inconvenient for students (mostly busy working professionals) to attend in evenings or on Saturday mornings.GMAT Pill was convenient because it offered its prep services via its online website — accessible anywhere with an internet connection.C) TrustworthySigning up for GMAT prep services is an incredibly important decision for MBA aspiring students. Taking the GMAT exam is typically usually only a once (or mb twice) in a life-time event. So getting services from a credible / reliable / trustworthy / consistent source is a really important aspect to a GMAT prep service.GMAT Pill takes this dimension to the extreme.Screenshots of real email testimonials, real video testimonials with students in them, audio interviews with students, links to social media accounts, snapshots of real Official Score Reports, reviews on 3rd party websites — all attest to the credibility of results that students got and the effectiveness of the course.Background information on the instructor, Zeke Lee, a Stanford graduate who scored in the top 1–2%ile of students is available all online. Free video previews and articles written by Zeke Lee solidify his credibility as a GMAT expert and build trust, as the audio of his voice in the video previews help students evaluate the teacher and the effectiveness of the learning style they might embark on if they sign up.Lastly, in a combination of being “trustworthy + convenient”, GMAT Pill offered direct email support with expert Zeke Lee himself 24/7, convenient for whenever GMAT questions may pop up in students’ minds. The same level of support also offered in a comments section below every video in the course and every question on its practice question platform.D) Easy-to-useTraditional prep options required a lot of discipline and planning in how to prepare in the 1–3 months leading up to test day.GMAT Pill helped facilite by offering 1-month and 2-month study plans. Rather than get inundated with a large collection of videos, we helped students navigate by organizing the course in a thoughtful way and by recommending 1–2 month study plans. Further, when subscribed, students would get an email at 6AM, every day for 30 days, telling students what exactly they should be doing that day. By taking a big goal and breaking it down into bite-sized chunks, GMAT Pill students would be able to more easily follow the study plan.E) AffordableTraditional books were under $50 and in-person classrooms exceeded $1000. Then, private tutoring easily went over $1500. Was it possible to provide excellent prep at an affordable price?Leveraging technology, GMAT Pill was able to do so at a price range between $300-$450, a price point closer to the middle. Further, GMAT Pill itself was broken down into 6 pills. If the full course was too expensive, students would be able to buy just 1 of the pills at a price just under $100. These prices were new to the market and were gladly welcomed by GMAT test takers.So, the above 5 dimensions (useful, convenient, trustworthy, easy-to-use and affordable) are what make GMAT Pill stand out as a product.GMAT Pill — The Rise of MobileNow, what happened when the industry landscape changed and mobile apps became popular? Well, the decision to build mobile apps vs a mobile-optimized website is not an easy one (future post). But GMAT Pill leveraged mobile apps to improve the GMAT Pill product in the following dimensions:A) ConvenientMobile devices offered an opportunity for prep services to be even more convenient. Customers loved to watch prep videos on their couch with an iPad device. Yes, it may have been dangerously comfortable for some students who may have taken advantage of the couch to fall asleep, but it was definitely the preferred mode of consumption. GMAT Pill was the very first in the market to offer an iPad app.When iPhone and Android devices began getting bigger screens, GMAT Pill made the convenience factor even more accessible by launching iPhone and Android apps.B) UsefulThe mobile apps gave GMAT Pill customers one superpower that the desktop website did not provide — the ability to download videos for offline viewing. This was incredibly useful as more and more students were accessing the course on mobile while on-the-go: in the subway, on the train, on the oil rig (yes we had students in the Oil & Gas industry), and in other places that had no wifi or internet connection. The GMAT Pill mobile apps made all of these customers very happy.Clearly, GMAT Pill is fantastic product that really helps solve customer pain points along the dimensions of being useful, convenient, trustworthy, easy-to-use and affordable. I highly recommend.You may be interested in What Makes Expedia a Great ProductShareNever miss a story from Peter Yu, when you sign up for Medium.

Back to Directory 





Research Area(s): Condensed Matter Physics And Materials ScienceBiographyPeter Yu received his B.Sc from the Univ. of Hong Kong in 1967 and the Ph.D. in Physics from Brown in 1972. After doing postdoctoral work at Berkeley between 1971-73, he joined the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center as a research staff member. He returned to Berkeley as a faculty member in 1979. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and has been a Guggenheim Fellow and Miller Professor.
Research InterestsMy research interest has been in experimental studies of the physics of semiconductors. I am particularly interested in problems relevant to device application of semiconductors such as defects, electron-phonon interactions and effects on these as a result of quantum confinement.
Current ProjectsElectronic and Vibrational Properties of semiconductor Nanocrystals: Study of quantum wells (where confinement in a two-dimensional plane occurs) have demonstrated the importance of confinement in influencing the electronic and vibrational properties of semiconductors. It has been predicted that confinement in all three directions (quantum dots) will have further advantageous effects on device performance. My group has started a program to apply laser spectroscopies to systematically investigate the electronic and vibrational properties of semiconductor quantum dots grown by various techniques, including ion-implantation into SiO2 and self-organization during epitaxial growth by MBE.
Properties of Large Bandgap group III-Nitride Semiconductors: Recently the Japanese company Nichia has achieved several notable milestones in the area of semiconductor light-emitting diodes (LED) and lasers using the large band gap semiconductors GaN, GaIN and A1GaN. This company has produced commercially blue and green LED and announced the production of continuous-wave room temperature blue laser diodes with lifetimes longer than 10,000 hours. These breakthroughs have been achieved in thin film of GaInN with defect density of above 108 cm-2. Previous semiconductor films in lasers and LED typically have at least two orders of magnitude less defects. The success of Nichia has raised interesting questions such as why the group III-nitrides are so tolerant of defects and whether it is possible to achieve similar effects in other semiconductors. In my group we are investigating the origin of the emission from group III-nitrides and the effect of defects on these emission processes.
High Pressure Physics: Pressure is a thermodynamical variable which determines the properties of all matters in the same way as temperature. Pressure can induce major changes in the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of all condensed phases. Using diamond anvil based high pressure cells we can now measure optical and electrical properties of samples at pressure as high as a million times the atmospheric pressure. This has allowed us to study pressure induced insulator-metal transitions, superconducting transition of Si in its high pressure metallic phases, etc. Effort is underway to study pressure-induced magnetic phase transitions in transition metal compounds.

A Day in the Life of Pediatric Surgeon Dr. Peter Yu




5:00 a.m.: Alarm rings. I hit snooze once, for an additional 9 minutes of peace. Then it is time to get up and at ’em. In the dark, I attempt to avoid injuring myself on the various toys that are strewn about the house–one of the hazards that comes with raising young children. I start the coffee maker, brush my teeth, shave, get dressed and kiss my slumbering family good-bye. Then it is off to swim practice.
