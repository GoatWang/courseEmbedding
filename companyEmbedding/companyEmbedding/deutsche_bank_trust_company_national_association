Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas Key Developments

Samson Resources Corp. Unsecured Creditors Look to Sue JPMorgan Chase Bank NA and Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas
Aug 17 16
The official committee of unsecured creditors of Samson Resources Corp. seeks approval to pursue alleged fraudulent transfer claims and causes of action against first- and second-lien lenders as it looks to recover up to $1.5 billion. The committee on Aug. 12, filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in Wilmington seeking authority to pursue the claims against first-lien agent JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, first-lien lenders, second-lien agent Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas and second-lien lenders. Judge Christopher S. Sontchi has scheduled a hearing on the motion for Sept. 7. Objections are due by Aug. 26. Committee counsel Thomas Lauria of White & Case LLP and debtor counsel Paul Basta of Kirkland & Ellis LLP were unavailable for comment. The committee seeks to prosecute and settle claims from an alleged fraudulent conveyance related to the $8 billion leveraged buyout of oil and gas exploration and production company Samson Investment Co. by private equity sponsors in 2011, four years before the debtor's Chapter 11 filing, and an emergency issuance of second-lien debt nine months after the LBO. The committee also looks to prosecute fraudulent transfer claims against second-lien lenders for the granting of mortgages on previously unencumbered properties immediately before the debtor filed for Chapter 11 protection. Finally, the committee seeks authority to pursue an adversary proceeding to determine the extent of the secured lenders' security interests in certain Samson assets, to avoid improperly perfected liens and to recharacterize or disgorge the adequate protection payments paid to the secured lenders in the Chapter 11 cases. The complaint alleges Samson did not receive reasonably equivalent value for the transfers and the LBO rendered the debtor insolvent and inadequately capitalized at all relevant times. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LP (KKR), Natural Gas Partners LP, Crestview Partners LP and Japanese trading giant Itochu Corp. on Nov. 22, 2011, agreed to acquire Samson Investment in a deal that closed on Dec. 21, 2011. In the transaction, Charles and Lynn Schusterman Family Foundation and other related entities sold Samson to a new entity formed by the private equity sponsors, Samson Resources. The buyers financed the LBO with a $2.25 billion reserve-based revolving first-lien credit facility with JPMorgan as administrative agent, a $2.25 billion senior unsecured bridge loan, $180 million in preferred stock and $4.14 billion in equity capital. The debt, the committee asserted, left Samson balance sheet insolvent and inadequately capitalized at closing. On Feb. 8, 2012, the debtor issued $2.25 billion in 9.75% senior notes due 2020 to pay off the bridge loan. The debtor allegedly was facing cash flow problems from falling natural gas prices and an eminent default on its first-lien facility when on Sept. 25, 2012, it entered into a $1 billion second-lien term loan agreement with Bank of America NA as agent. The facility matures Sept. 25, 2018. The second-lien facility provided little to no benefit to the debtor, the committee alleged, as it only shifted secured obligations from the first-lien parties to the second-lien parties, using $853 million of the proceeds to pay down the first-lien debt.

Welcome to Deutsche Bank Fraud Exposed	E-mail

How many Deutsche Bankers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
ZERO.  Deutsche Bankers don't screw lightbulbs .... they only screw people.

It's part of the Scam of the Century!  Fraudulent foreclosures are known to be rampant around the country and our government is doing nothing.  Instead, they are leaving individuals alone with an overworked, uncaring court system to fight illegal foreclosures and eviction.  ??When you applied for your home loan, you were forced to produce myriad documents, including bank statements, tax returns, W-2s, pay stubs, work and personal references and a ton of money all up front before you could get a mortgage approved and receive the keys to your new home.

But thanks to the big banks and investment firms' obscene fraud,  you can lose your home in the blink of an eye.  A mortgage servicing company/bank simply brings a copy of the original mortgage note where you were forced to sign your life away and an Assignment  from one of the pass-through company’s that you’ve never even heard of, record a new deed and your home is gone.    

The foreclosure documents, as you may have been heard by now, were not even reviewed in many cases by a human actually reading them.  Robo-signers, they’re called; some signatures were forged; some documents were never properly filed or sealed.

Many lawyers need to know what is going on.  Also write to Senator Bennet's office asap.  These predators need to look in the mirror.  May the force be with you all!  If we all do something we can help the whole who is being affected by this vicious corporation.

I have worked with Deutsche Bank National . They use a company called OCWEN to handle their properties. Her is the link to their Web site : http://www.ocwen.com/
I hope this will help. But the best thing to do is contact a agent in the area who is trained in short sales to aid you in your search. You may even want to look into signing a buyers agent agreement. That way an agent can confidently look for you. The Buyers Agent Agreement is an agreement that that agent works exclusively for you.

Here is some information which may help you. The home was not boarded up when the initial Lis Pendens was filed. It was listed for sale during that period but never sold. It is a two family home. The home does not appear to have been foreclosed at all. Most likely, the borrower brought the loan current. As previously stated, many banks do not service their REO product and use companies like PlatREO or Ocwen to do so. I actually list and sell Ocwen properties and am familiar with them.  Subsequently I can concur that if you don't have some guidance, they can be one of the more difficult servicers to deal with. All that being said, here is a link which may help you find some information if there is any. http://www.tss.db.com/Product.asp?BusinessID=3&id=produc
If you are interested in purchasing the property, try sending a letter to the owner. You can get the information you will need to do that at http://www.vitalgov.net. Hope that helps, let me know if I can help you further.

Hey instead of talking to anyone else. Go tho the courthouse and pull the file. In it there should be an attorney's name and you can call him so you can make an offer or even find out how to contact someone that deals wiht this specific bank.

        BEST ANSWER
      
I am dealing with the Deutsche Bank right now .The bank is based in Germany so it uses a company called Ocwen to handle their short sales and morgage remodification.They are very slow.My clients had not paid the morg since 4/1/07 . I listed the home and went under contract . I submitted the short sale package on 11/12/09. I am still working on closing the sale. If you do find a way to put an offer on the home and if it is still owned by the home owner make sure that if they tried to modify their loan , that the home owners officially withdraw from the loan modification program.Otherwise the short sale will not be accepted.
My clients are the seller and buyer. Lucky for me and my buyers, the sellers are still in contact with me . They  moved out last month. I have gone though four adjurnments of the sheriff sale..My clients (the sellers) cam to me when they received notice of sheriffs sale.

Be carful what you are trying to buy and try to get more information from the botom and you will see al the information they have;  but let me tell you this 5 years ago there were Loans like 80% and 20% Century21 did around the country but guess what? these kind of Loans were fraudulent Loans and this is why the Country suffer this economy with the banks.   Well these Banks are receiving since 5 years ago all those accounts the other banks can not handle any more so my advice is stay away from them becouse Deustche Bank National Trust and Ocwen Loan Services sonner or later will have to pay for this fraudulent short sale or sale actions and the treatening the are doing removing the people from their properties, there are a honest group of Attorneys working on this. My best advise to you is get and advisor from Re-max (is the most reliable realtors, consultants and advisor you can find) and avoid a big hedache you can get if you insist to buy a House with these banks.

Hi Lost,

The foreclosure process is a lengthy one. Deutsche Bank will not talk to any buyers directly. They do have a realtor hotline that we can call to find out who will be servicing the property. That doesn't always get you an answer either though. In some cases we just have to find out via MLS or the REO grapevine who is getting the listing. Contact me if you would like me to approach them on your behalf.

Wed Jan 27, 2010







        BEST ANSWER
      
From my experience Deutsche Bank does not service there own loans.  They are a investor or a trustee and such they will not be handling the marketing of the property.  The delay on getting it listed might be due to the type of loan it is.  If it is a fha or a va loan there are delays in the government marketing until ownership is transfered from Deutsche bank.  The way the property would be transfered from the bank to the government is through a claim being filed by the bank.  My guess that this loan is tied to one of those programs.  The fact it is boarded up suggests to me that FHA is involved to me, because they have regs that stipulate how vacant homes are handled.  Of course others banks secure the property depending on the city and issues they many have with the property.

I would get a buyers agent to assist you find out what is going on or check the court house records to see if it gives you more information.
Good Luck

Regina Carmen Banda,
      Home Buyer,
      Jeffersonville, IN
    

      I've been watching a property owned by this bank as well in Southern Indiana.  When I last contacted the realtor handling the property about two months ago, she said she doesn't get any updates from the seller or the pending buyer.  It was a Hubzu sale back in January 2015.  It's now July and it's still "under contract" with the winning bidder.  In other words, going to the realtor doesn't do me any good.
