MACRA & MIPS FAQs



What is MACRA?



MACRA stands for the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015. The act was signed into law in early 2015 and makes substantial changes to the government’s health care payment system. The significant portions include permanently repealing the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula for determining provider payments and changing the Medicare physician fee schedule by establishing two new tracks for reimbursement: the Merit Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and Alternate Payment Models (APMs).






What is the purpose of MACRA?



CMS’s goal for MACRA is to reward providers for better, lower-cost, patient-centered care.
 
CMS continues to promote the shift away from fee-for-service payments to adopting alternative payment models (APMs) to hit industry goals of having 50% of Medicare payments made through APMs, and having 90% of remaining fee-for-service payments tied to quality and value by the end of 2018.






What is the timeline for MACRA?



The first performance year began on January 1, 2017 and will impact payments adjustments in 2019.






What providers are affected by MACRA?



MACRA, and the Quality Payment Programs that come out of it, will impact most providers across the country. Check CMS’s website to see if you must participate qpp.cms.gov

AXPM We are different





































































 













AXPM Difference
Why do it the same way?
Cars are different now than they were 10 years ago. Brackets are different now than they were 10 years ago. Why do even new management softwares look and have the same features as 10 years ago? We want you to love your software and we want your patients to love it too!


 


AXPM Difference
Multi-Speciality
We are a multi-specialty software built on the HTML5 platform. Pedo, Ortho, iPads, PC, Macs, Android, iOS, Linux. We can answer yes! If your software was not built from day one as multi-specialty chances are it is retrofit to work and will not work well.


 


AXPM Difference
Secure Communication
Finally a software that built in secure communication into the platform. Securely share images, treatment notes, documents and more! Keeping you and your patients data safe! Heck we even have a built in phone system! All HIPAA compliant. 


 




We are different, and we are okay with that!

All practice management software can take payments, schedule payments, manage a ledger, create a letter and track treatment for patients.  It is how those things are done and the new never before seen features in practice management software that makes us different.
At AXPM One we are reinventing practice management and rethinking the old ways. Times change and so should your practice management software. We are committed to continue to bring you new innovative features that have never been part of a software.

Does your practice management software have a built-in email client?
What about secure HIPAA compliant sharing?
Wireless Imaging?
Can you text with patients and track all communication in their chart?
Technology to help close more cases?
What about an interactive patient portal?
Built-in phone system that pulls up patient’s charts?

Sure for some of those you can use a third party – but by the time you do that you are using 3-6 piece of software. That is just crazy!
Why should you have to do that when we can handle it all for much less than you are currently paying!
Call us today at 844-488-AXPM to learn more!

Find out all the info! How often do they update? What devices can I use the software on?  What features will be rolling out in the 6-12 months? What does customer service mean to them?

Run your practice like a business
"We are all working together, that is the secret," - Sam Walton
Running your practice like a business can be a tall task for somebody who just wants to make people smile. But our job is to make you smile by letting you focus on your patients first. We have re-invented practice management software so you can once again put the focus back on your patients.
We have re-thought practice management software and built technology like a smart scheduler, case closer and wifi photo auto transfer and load. We are working towards making you and your staffs life easier to make your patient have a better experience.
 


AXPM tips
Autopay Tip!
Help patients stay on top of things by setting up their auto payment with them. Together, you can discover when their paydays are and base payments on those dates. Setting it up for when they get paid every two weeks can make individual payments less pricey for the patient and more consistent for you. Everybody wins.







Axpm One
Case Closer Technology
Starting cases is harder than it has ever been. But we’re making it easier. With our Case Closer Technology, treatment coordinators can adjust down payments, payment frequency, monthly amounts and term lengths to find the best plan for both the patient and the practice. Patients can even access it from anywhere in order to accept treatments, sign contracts, make payments and schedule appointments.









Axpm One
Smart Scheduling
Under the old template system, there’s no such thing as a perfect day. That’s why Smart Scheduling was born. Smart Scheduling uses an algorithm that recalculates every time you or your patient sets up an appointment. This makes it more efficient to set up each appointment, while also continuously making your overall schedule for the day as perfect as possible.  Practice smarter, not harder.








AXPM One
Reporting and Analytics
Reporting and Analytics sound boring. At least, that’s the way we used to see it. But we make reporting dynamic and easy to read and understand. You can even anonymously view how your practice stacks up against the rest of the country. And you should like how it looks from the top, with us on your side.









AXPM One
Secure Sharing
We give you the ability to digitally send patient photos and medical stats directly to other doctors. In a safe and sensitive manner, you can exchange vital information for all patients you have in common, or just the ones you choose. And if the other practice is savvy enough to use AXPM One as well, it all goes right into the chart.








AXPM One
Latest Technology and Platform
Everything runs on HTML5 and is based in The Cloud. That means there is nothing to install and you can pump the brakes on your IT costs. The clients we work with save an average of $25,000 a year in that department. Use Macs, PCs, Android, iOS, Chrome OS and even Linux. Any operating system works!








AXPM One
Communication
With One, we have a fully integrated email client. 2-way text messaging is also built-in. You can text message with 
patients directly out of the software. Not only can you send appointment reminders via email and text but if they reply 
to those text messages your staff and text back with them to find a new time! We even have your phone system built-in. Get rid of that expensive 3rd party expense!








AXPM One
Accrual and Cash Accounting
Good news - you can now run your reports for Accrual and Cash basis accounting! Finally - making you and your accountant's life easier!








AXPM One
HR and Benefits
One of the biggest departments that practices can receive some much needed help from us is human resources. Our HR Management and Benefit Enrollment services are part of what we offer as an insurance broker, letting you and your employees to stay on top of all the vital individual and group info that comes with the territory.

MACRA & MIPS FAQs



What is MACRA?



MACRA stands for the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015. The act was signed into law in early 2015 and makes substantial changes to the government’s health care payment system. The significant portions include permanently repealing the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula for determining provider payments and changing the Medicare physician fee schedule by establishing two new tracks for reimbursement: the Merit Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and Alternate Payment Models (APMs).






What is the purpose of MACRA?



CMS’s goal for MACRA is to reward providers for better, lower-cost, patient-centered care.
 
CMS continues to promote the shift away from fee-for-service payments to adopting alternative payment models (APMs) to hit industry goals of having 50% of Medicare payments made through APMs, and having 90% of remaining fee-for-service payments tied to quality and value by the end of 2018.






What is the timeline for MACRA?



The first performance year began on January 1, 2017 and will impact payments adjustments in 2019.






What providers are affected by MACRA?



MACRA, and the Quality Payment Programs that come out of it, will impact most providers across the country. Check CMS’s website to see if you must participate qpp.cms.gov
