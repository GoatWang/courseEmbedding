I Save App Logo

 
These new "super-charged" checking accounts offer all of the benefits of a Lake Shore relationship-including free online banking, bill pay, debit card, expanded surcharge-free ATM network, and e-statements, plus entirely new features and benefits, including savings discounts available through BaZing technology, accessible via our LS I $ave mobile device app, and/or website.  With "proximity couponing", you receive instant notification on your mobile device when you are in the vicinity of a participating vendor with an exclusive deal for LS Checking customers.  Traditional "couponers" can also visit the LS I $ave site to search and print out deals prior to shopping if preferred.  Additionally, these accounts will offer other non-traditional features and benefits, including cell phone replacement coverage, roadside assistance, vision, hearing and prescription savings, identity theft protection and much more!  These are definitely NOT your typical checking accounts!  Use the navigation menu to access details on each LS Checking account.We would love the opportunity to discuss the value of a Lake Shore relationship with you personally.  With 11 branches conveniently located throughout Erie and Chautauqua counties, we're just a visit, click, or call away.   Visit the Locations page to find the branch nearest to you, or click the link below to start the account opening process, and we will contact you directly.Banking with your best interest in mind-it's how we do business!

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
Zacks Style Scores Education - Learn more about the Zacks Style Scores


The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.
