  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsJust rightBytommyron 14 December 2013Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI love this book. I had last year's edition too. Each day's entry contains two readings, and the relevant psalmody, plus a commentary on one of the readings and a collect. Thus it enables me to read an old testament and a new testament passage, as well as a psalm (or two if I want) every day, which, coupled with private prayer, makes a useful basic frame of daily worship. It's not a book of hours, but it is great for those of us who are too busy to read much or engage in lectio divina on a daily basis. The commentaries are well-written an though-provoking. A word to Kindle users: it is useful to have 2 or even 3 Bibles on your Kindle, so you don't have to find pages all the time, as the OT and NT readings tend to follow each other day by day over particular seasons.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsConcise and often thought provokingByAnne Dupreon 9 January 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI use the daily office and needed something to make me pause a little over the reading. This text, which I use on the Kindle, has three sections for each day: the references for the RCL readings for Morning Prayer, a reflection on one of the readings, and the daily collect. I find the reflection usually has something useful to say to make me think more deeply about the Bible passage so this does the job for me. A variety of authors contribute; typically each one covers a two week period so if the current person does not quite do it for you, another one will be along soon.Read more0Comment|

The scripture observations provided for each day are concise and yet prove a challenge to the reader in how life can be lived and experienced. Well worth having in the suitcase, duffle bag or stall.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsgood apart from one ignorant writerByMr. D. P. Jayon 10 June 2014Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis continues to be one of the more liberal daily bible reading notes, though some of the best contributors from last year have gone.I am somewhat concerned that Catherine Williams, a selection secretary for ordinands, thinks that Candlemas Day happened eight days after Christmas. She is confusing circumcision with purification. She also makes the common mistake of thinking that healing on the Sabbath was against Jewish law.It is not. She has not caught up with the massive amount of modern scholarship. Such atrocious ignorance about Judaism and the Church’s year make me think I’ll not buy this book next time.However she does say: Mary and Joseph temporarily lost their son. ……..It's easy for us too, to take Jesus for granted — to expect him to be around and do the things we want and ask for. Sometimes we have to search for him again — prayerfully in worship and in the world round us. When we find him, he may unsettle us with his requests .and actions. What he calls us to do and be as we follow him may be  surprising and challenging, but we can trust that he is calling us to join him in his Father's business.We have lost one good contributor from previous years, Martin Percey.I still, despite my misgivings, recommend it to those whom I direct.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseSee all 17 customer reviews (newest first)Write a customer review
