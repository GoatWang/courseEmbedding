Baxter Financial Corp.


                  BFC's investment objective is to achieve long-term growth of capital and income. For value stocks, the firm uses fundamental analysis to select stocks that are believed to be undervalued. They consider the following factors to evaluate whether a stock may be undervalued: p/e ratio less than growth rate of sales and/or earnings, ROE, price-to-sales and price-to-book ratios and price-to-cash.They consider stocks with these criteria but do not require that all or any exist prior to investment. Other factors considered before investing include low price in relation to market dominance, ability to control prices, market capitalization size, corporate business strategy, industry position, trading liquidity, trading activity of officers, directors and large stockholders, good management, protection from competition and dividend yield. Investments are held until the stock meets the advisor's projection, the original criterion used to select the investment no longer exists or an investment opportunity believed to be superior presents itself. The Fund's portfolio usually consists of 20-30 different stocks that is less than the amount of stocks held by the typical mutual fund. This strategy stems from the belief that there are a limited number of investment ideas available and allows the advisor to focus on companies with the greatest potential for investment return balanced with minimal risk. The Fund generates income by investing in stocks that pay dividends, commercial paper and long-term fixed-income securities rated at least 'A' by Moody's or by S&P. Fixed-income securities are selected by comparing the investment's yield in relation to market rates with similar duration to maturity and risk factors. When BFC believes a decline in interest rates is imminent, fixed-income investments may also be purchased for the purpose of capital appreciation as prices tend to rise as interest rates fall.

Interest rates on subordinated debentures generally range from 4% to 6% over 10 year US Treasuries, per annum. Return is estimated based on financial projections.Allegiance Capital usually invests $1 million to $3 million per company. Smaller investments are considered on a case-by-case basis.

				Industry Veteran Hank Struik Appointed As LABSCO’s Chief Executive Officer			


LABSCO, a leading distributor of innovative diagnostic technologies and laboratory products to hospitals, physician office laboratories and alternate healthcare settings, has appointed Hendrik “Hank” Struik as its new chief executive officer (CEO) to take the Company through its next growth phase.  Struik will succeed Steve Nielsen, who will be transitioning from his role as chairman and CEO to a full-time director position with the Company’s board.
“After two very productive years at LABSCO, I am looking forward to taking a temporary step back from my professional life to spend more time with my family.  This decision has been made much easier by Hank. I have full faith that he will leverage LABSCO’s employee talent, our renowned laboratory expertise and the business enhancements we have made over the last two years to take LABSCO to a whole new level,” Nielsen said.  “Hank’s expertise in healthcare business management and his creativity complement our strategic direction, and as such he is in the best position to propel LABSCO’s growth.”        
Prior to taking the helm at LABSCO, Struik was an operating partner at Frazier Healthcare, a private equity firm that partnered with the previous owners, the Davis Family of Louisville, to acquire LABSCO in early 2011.  He joined Frazier Healthcare in July of this year, working with the firm’s Growth Equity team to identify investment opportunities in differentiated medical products, supplies, devices and outsourced technology-enabled services.  Prior to joining Frazier Healthcare, Struik served as the CEO and president of Sarnova from 2009 to 2012, a provider of healthcare products to the emergency medical and acute care services markets.  
“I am excited to work with the LABSCO team to continue to build on the foundation manifested under Steve’s leadership, and to further articulate and differentiate the value of our offerings in the industry,” Struik said.  “LABSCO has the number one laboratory specialists in the industry, a strong customer focus, and unparalleled domain knowledge.  With many of the organizational enhancements that have been made, and the installation of a state-of-the art technology infrastructure, LABSCO is ready to maximize its strengths internally and externally.”  
Prior to Sarnova, Struik spent more than 20 years with Baxter, Allegiance and Cardinal Health. While at Cardinal, he served as the president of its $850 million respiratory and neurocare unit.
