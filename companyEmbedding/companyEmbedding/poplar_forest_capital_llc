Poplar Forest: A Place To Stand Away From The Crowd.

Dale Harvey founded Poplar Forest in 2007, after 16 years with The Capital Group Companies, where he was portfolio counselor managing roughly $20 billion in client assets for several of the American Funds mutual fund sub accounts. As his investment responsibilities grew, Dale discovered the challenge of managing large pools of capital. In an unusual move, he left the Capital Group and founded a boutique firm where he and a small staff could focus on a contrarian investment strategy – a firm where size should not impede investment results.
Thomas Jefferson was an inspiration for this new venture. Dale grew up in Virginia, 12 miles from a different Poplar Forest: Jefferson’s little-known, secluded estate. There, Jefferson escaped the very public demands that surrounded him at his more famous home, Monticello. Over time, the Poplar Forest estate grew to be the third president’s creative haven for reading, writing, and the pursuit of perfection in American architecture.
And so it is no mistake that Dale chose Poplar Forest as the name for his new venture. Like Jefferson’s cherished retreat, Poplar Forest Capital strives to be a place where analytical rigor enables independent thought. We have built a boutique firm that provides focused portfolios for a select group of client-partners. Our firm holds true to fundamental business analysis and contrarian strategy, un-swayed by mainstream opinion or the short-term action of markets.
Through Poplar Forest Capital, we are building an ethos based on values as enduring as Jefferson’s institutions and iconic architecture. Our model is one of partnership with like-minded investors--delivered with passion, integrity, humility, and skill for generations to come.
